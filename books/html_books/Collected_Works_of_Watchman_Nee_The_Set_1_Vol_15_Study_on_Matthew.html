This volume consists of notes taken during those studies that were later edited and polished. It covers the interpretation from chapter one through chapter twenty-five, chapter by chapter and verse by verse in sequence, and includes the exposition of all important sections. The contents are exceedingly rich and multifaceted, with a rich supply of life and the light of the truth.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER ONE</H1><P>Verse 1: "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham." In the beginning of this chapter, in the first verse, Jesus Christ is mentioned. This corresponds to the last verse of Revelation (Rev. 22:21). Furthermore, the phrase rendered "the book of the generation" is used only once, here, in the New Testament. It is also mentioned only once in the Septuagint Version of the Old Testament, in Genesis 5:1, "the book of the generations of Adam." (The Septuagint Version was the version read by the Lord while He was on this earth.) One is the book of the generations of the first Adam, whereas the other is of the last Adam. The two are in contrast to each other.</P><P>"The son of David." In this book the Lord is called by this title a total of nine times: in 1:1; 9:27; 12:23; 15:22; 20:30-31; 21:9; 22:42, 45. From Adam to the Lord Jesus there were a total of seventy-five generations (see Luke 3:23-38, in which the name of Cainan is recorded twice).</P><P>Why does the chapter begin not by mentioning the son of Adam, of Isaac, or of Jacob, but, rather, by singling out two names, David and Abraham? This shows that this book has two lines. One is the line of the son of David, the line of prophets; the other is the line of the son of Abraham, the line of priests. By this we know that the Lord fulfilled these two functions. The son of David refers to Solomon. To say that the Lord was the son of David is to say that He would be Solomon. In his lifetime Solomon did two particular things. One was that he spoke the word of wisdom, and the other was that he built the temple. The Lord is greater than Solomon; as a prophet, He sent forth the Holy Spirit and built the spiritual temple. The Lord's being the son of Abraham means that He was to be Isaac. In his lifetime Isaac had two characteristics: he was offered on the altar, and he married Rebecca, a Gentile woman. The Lord was offered in His death and resurrection, and He also married the Gentiles and brought forth the church.</P><P>The genealogy of a man begins with the descendants and goes back to the ancestors, whereas the genealogy of a king begins with a king and comes down to the descendants. The genealogy recorded in Luke traces back to the ancestors, whereas the genealogy recorded in Matthew follows the generations in succession.</P><P>Verses 2-6: Here four women are mentioned. The purpose is to show that the Lord is related not only to the Jews but also to the Gentiles (Eph. 3:6). Jesus did not come to call the righteous; He came to be the Savior of all. In the Old Testament the names of women and of Gentiles were never included in the genealogies. However, this time not only were four women mentioned, but they were all Gentile sinners.</P><P>Tamar was Judah's daughter-in-law; she committed incest. Rahab was a prostitute in Jericho. Ruth was a Moabitess. In Deuteronomy 23:3 the Moabites were forbidden from entering the assembly of Jehovah, even to the tenth generation. Bathsheba was not mentioned by name but was referred to as "the wife of Uriah" (2 Sam. 11:3). This is to inform people as to what kind of person she was. From this it can be seen that, whether they are Jews or Gentiles, all have a share in Christ.</P><P>In the whole Bible man is used to signify the aspect of doctrine, the objective aspect, and woman is used to signify the aspect of experience, the subjective aspect. Examples are Solomon and the Shulamite virgin in the Song of Songs.</P><P>Although this chapter mentions fourteen kings, only David was definitely designated as "the king," for he was a man according to God's heart.</P><P>Verses 7-9: Compare this section with 1 Chronicles 3:11-12. The names of Ahaziah (2 Chron. 22:2-5, 9), Joash (2 Chron. 24:25), and Amaziah (2 Chron. 25:14-16, 27) were recorded in 1 Chronicles but omitted in Matthew 1. They were left out by Matthew because they (1) were born of Jezebel, (2) did evil, and (3) did not die a natural death. God punished such people until the third and fourth generation. They did not deserve to be kings; therefore, Matthew did not record their names.</P><P>Verses 10-12: Here the name of Jehoiakim (2 Chron. 36:4; 2 Kings 23:34-35) is missing, though it is found in 1 Chronicles 3:15-19. Jehoiakim was made king by Pharaoh king of Egypt, not by God. Moreover, he heavily taxed the people that he might please Pharaoh, and he also worshipped idols. Therefore, his name was struck from the King's genealogy. Uzziah in Matthew 1:8 is Azariah in 2 Kings 15:1-3, 13. Matthew 1:12 says, "Salathiel begot Zerubbabel." However, 1 Chronicles 3:17-19 says that Zerubbabel was the son of Pedaiah. This is because Salathiel died at an early age, and according to the custom at that time (Deut. 25:5-6), his brother Pedaiah might have married his wife and begot a son, Zerubbabel. Or, it might have been that Zerubbabel, the son of Pedaiah, was made the son of Salathiel.</P><P>Verse 12: "Jeconiah begot Salathiel." However, according to Jeremiah 22:24-30, none of Jeconiah's descendants would sit on the throne of David. Although Joseph was a descendant of Jeconiah, the Lord was not Joseph's son. This is God's marvelous doing.</P><P>Verses 13-16: In verse 16 the genealogy turns to read "Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ." Thus, the difficulty mentioned above is solved.</P><P>Verse 17: The genealogy of Christ has a total of forty-two generations. Forty-two is the number for the experiencing of sufferings. It is different from forty, which is the number for trials only and does not necessarily involve sufferings. After the number forty-two is concluded, the millennium will come, a time for rest. Revelation mentions forty-two months. Numbers 33 has a record of forty-two stations, and the forty-third station was Canaan. Once the number forty-two is passed, Christ comes, and there is eternal rest. Three times fourteen generations is forty-two generations. But when one counts the generations recorded in chapter one, there are only forty-one generations. This is because David was the last of the first fourteen generations and also the first of the second fourteen generations. Therefore, there were forty-one generations.</P><P>Verse 19: "Joseph...being righteous." A righteous person is both just and kind. Joseph was just; hence, he had to divorce such a woman. He was also kind; thus, he was not willing to disgrace her openly but intended to divorce her secretly. As a righteous person, Joseph was both just and kind.</P><P>Verse 20: "While he pondered these things." Joseph's pondering afforded God an opportunity to speak to him and to lead him.</P><P>Verse 21: Jesus is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua. It may be rendered "Jehovah the Savior" or "Jehovah saves." (Je is Jehovah, and sus means "salvation.")</P><P>Verse 23: Emmanuel means "God with us." It is not "God is present among us" [the rendering in the Chinese Union Version]. "God with us" is broader in meaning than "God is present among us." In Hebrew, whenever a name has "el" in it (for example, Daniel, Israel, and Eli), it always means something related to "God." </P><P>King David typifies the Lord Jesus as King: (1) the king established by God, (2) the warring king, and (3) the king despised and rejected by men.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER TWO</H1><P>This chapter may be divided into two sections: verses 1-12 are concerned with Herod's plot to kill, and verses 13-23 describe Jesus' flight.</P><P>Verse 1:"In the days of Herod the king." Herod was an Idumaean (Mark 3:8), an Edomite, a descendant of Esau. He was made king, a tetrarch (Luke 1:5). At Herod's time Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea. This is related to the first census, as recorded in Luke 2:1-2. From the political viewpoint, the census was a decree from the Caesar. From our viewpoint, it was God's fulfillment of biblical prophecy. (At that time Joseph lived in Nazareth.) The king's heart is in the hand of Jehovah (Prov. 21:1). If the census had been taken earlier, Joseph and Mary would have returned to Nazareth immediately after they were registered. If the census had been taken a little later, they might still have been traveling on the way. However, under God's sovereignty, as soon as they arrived in Bethlehem, Mary delivered the child.</P><P>"Magi from the east arrived." According to Greek, the magi were persons of morality or principle, like the Hindu "holy men." The phrase the east does not indicate what place it was east of; it should refer to east of Jerusalem, east of Judea.</P><P>Verse 2:"He who has been born King of the Jews." This seems to indicate that the Lord Jesus was only for the Jews; however, those who first came to seek for the Lord were Gentiles. It was declared from the mouths of Gentiles that the Lord was the King of the Jews. From this verse we can see that the Lord's work was for both the Gentiles and the Jews. "We saw His star at its rising." The Bible does not give us proof of how the magi from the east learned of the Lord's birth, but we have some hint. ("Light"-Isa. 60:3; "He"-Psa. 72:4). The Gentiles also had prophets, Balaam being one of them. He was one of four prophets who prophesied the most concerning the Lord Jesus (Num. 24:17). Perhaps these prophecies had spread in the east. Perhaps the magi from the east read the prophecy in Daniel. In his captivity in Babylon, when Daniel prophesied concerning the seventy weeks, he spoke the things concerning the Lord Jesus (Dan. 9:24-25). "To worship Him" was not to worship as one would worship God but to worship the Lord with the highest honor given to a human being.</P><P>Verse 3:"When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him." For Herod to be troubled was somewhat reasonable, but for all Jerusalem also to be troubled was truly strange. From the time of Malachi to that time was a period of about four hundred and thirty years. During that period the Jews were suffering, and they were expecting the Messiah to come. When they heard this news, they should have rejoiced. Instead, they were troubled. This is for no other reason than that they were not genuinely seeking the Savior. (A Christian who expects the Lord to come or who expects to be raptured should take this as a warning-Prov. 4:23; 25:28.) Verse 3 says that Herod was troubled inwardly (the motive); verse 7 shows us that he took action outwardly (the scheme); and verse 16 is the result of the troubling (the killing).</P><P>Verses 4-6 indicate that biblical prophecy is one thing and revelation is another thing, that teaching is one thing and revelation is another thing. One may have the words of the prophets, but he still needs the heavenly star. One may have the knowledge of the Scriptures, but he still needs the divine revelation. If man is not hungry, God does not give. Perhaps the magi from the east were people who waited on God and were seeking. If one has only dead knowledge, he is merely a Pharisee. Even though he understands the word of the Scriptures, he has never seen the light from heaven. The star appeared in heaven to show the magi that there was a Savior, but it was through the Bible that they could find out the details. On the one hand, they needed the heavenly star; on the other hand, they needed Micah's prophecy (Micah 5:2). By this we can see that there are certain conditions for the receiving of God's revelation: (1) waiting and (2) desiring.</P><P>The second half of Micah 5:2 says, "And His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity." This shows that the One born in Bethlehem is God. When the Lord said, "Before Abraham came into being, I am" (John 8:58), they wanted to stone Him because they did not acknowledge Him as God.</P><P>Verse 7:"Then Herod, secretly calling the magi, determined accurately from them the time that the star appeared." Things done "secretly" are not necessarily wrong, but they usually cannot avoid becoming something of darkness. Christians may have secrets, but they should not have darkness. Herod "determined accurately" the time that the star appeared. By that time probably more than a year had passed, the evidence for which will be given later.</P><P>Verse 8:"And sending them to Bethlehem, he said, Go and find out accurately about the child. And when you find Him, report to me, so that I also may come and worship Him." Herod's intention was not to worship Him, but to kill Him.</P><P>Verse 9:"And after they heard the king, they went their way, and behold, the star which they saw at its rising led them until it came and stood over the place where the child was." There is no mention here that any scribe or Pharisee followed the magi. The magi could come from the east and find Bethlehem, but the scribes and the Pharisees would not go from Jerusalem to Bethlehem. This shows that the Gentiles wanted the Lord, but the Jews rejected Him. We should understand the Bible with our mind. At the same time, we also should seek inwardly to know the power of God. Andrew Murray said that it is a pity for someone to have a great deal of Bible knowledge yet keep it merely in his fleshly mind.</P><P>"The star which they saw" was the same star they saw the first time. If we want to know the certainty of God's leading, we need a second revelation of the star after its first revelation. This is a principle: the second appearing of the star is a confirmation that its first appearing is correct. God said to Abraham, "Unto a land that I will show thee" (Gen. 12:1). If we took the first step, yet we do not have "I will show thee" as the second step, we were probably wrong in our first step. The revelation after a revelation is a confirmation that we are on the right way. This is a principle: always verify a revelation with a follow-up revelation.</P><P>Verse 10:"And when they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy." In contrast, when the people in Jerusalem heard the news, they were troubled. Our attitude toward the Savior is an indication of the degree of our spirituality. One characteristic of the Lord is that He requires man to love Him. A Christian should not only believe in the Lord but also love the Lord. If one who believes in the Lord is not affected by the Lord in his inward emotions and feelings, he is not worthy to be called a Christian.</P><P>Verse 11:"They...saw the child." Here it does not say "a baby." This shows that a period of time had passed since the event mentioned in verse 9. The magi's traveling required some time because transportation was not convenient then. Herod had inquired previously concerning the time that the star appeared, but eventually those whom he killed were children who were two years old and under. Furthermore, this verse mentions "the house," not a manger. House is a particular word used in Matthew. This is the first time it is used. It might have been a house rented by Joseph; perhaps at that time they lived alternately between Nazareth and Bethlehem. These things may prove that the time when the magi came to see the Lord was not when the Lord was newly born.</P><P>That the magi from the east came to see the Lord shows that the Lord is King. Moreover, they went into the house to worship Him. The Gospel of Mark writes concerning the Lord as a slave; therefore, it does not give a record of His birth. The Gospel of Luke portrays the Lord as a man; therefore, it gives an account of His birth. It also tells us that those who came to see Him were shepherds, common people. He was born in a manger, but He was not the son of a manger. The Gospel of John unveils the Lord as God; therefore, instead of mentioning His birth, it only says, "The Word became flesh."</P><P>Gold signifies the divine nature, frankincense denotes delight, and myrrh is used for the dead. Isaiah 60 mentions only gold and frankincense, not myrrh. Because Isaiah is a book on the Lord as the King in the millennium, it mentions only gold and frankincense. Here the magi presented myrrh, signifying that the coming of the Lord this time was for Him to go through death. Fittingly, the gold provided the travel expenses for Joseph to flee from Herod. How wonderful is God's doing!</P><P>Verse 12:"And because they had been divinely instructed in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed by another way to their country." One who has seen the Lord cannot return to Herod.</P><P>Verse 13:"Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying, Arise, take the child and His mother and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is going to seek the child to destroy Him." "Until I tell you" indicates that God's leading is step by step.</P><P>Verse 15: "And was there until the death of Herod, in order that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, `Out of Egypt I called My Son.'" Instead of performing a miracle for His Son, God told Him to flee. From the time of His birth, the Lord had to flee. He did not resist. His word to Christians who are to suffer persecution is: "When they persecute you in this city, flee into another" (Matt. 10:23). "Out of Egypt I called My Son." This is a word spoken by God to Israel. When the children of Israel were no longer able to bear it, they fled. Isaiah 49:3 shows us that the Lord and Israel are one. It seems that the Lord was the last Israelite; He included the Israelites in Himself. Israel was exceedingly wicked; therefore, the Lord had to go to the cross.</P><P>Verses 16-18:This portion is quoted from Jeremiah 31:15. Rachel was buried in Bethlehem, which means "house of bread." "Rachel weeping for her children" is a modifying clause. Because Herod had killed so many children of Bethlehem, it seemed to cause Rachel to come out of the grave to weep for her children. Ramah was about two hundred yards away from Bethlehem.</P><P>Verse 19:"And when Herod had died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt." Man is nothing; once he dies, everything of him comes to an end. Herod had caused others to die, but now he himself died. God did not perform a miracle so that His Son might remain; rather, He called His Son out of Egypt.</P><P>Verse 20:"Saying, Arise, take the child and His mother and go into the land of Israel, for those who seek the life of the child have died." "Go into the land of Israel" indicates that the Lord still had to be an Israelite.</P><P>Verse 22:"But because he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there; and having been divinely instructed in a dream, he departed into the regions of Galilee." We need not only the Lord's leading but also common sense. God only commanded Joseph to go into the land of Israel; He did not tell him where to stay. At that time, if he had gone back to Jerusalem, he would have had trouble. However, because he had this common sense, while he hesitated, he was led by God and departed into Galilee. The land of Galilee was a large region. Matthew 4:15 reads "Galilee of the Gentiles," indicating that Galilee was a place with a mixed population of Gentiles and Jews. The first three Gospels contain mainly records of what the Lord spoke in the land of Judea, whereas the last Gospel contains mainly records of what the Lord spoke in the land of Galilee.</P><P>Verse 23:"And he came and settled in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, He shall be called a Nazarene." In the Bible, no prophet ever prophesied that the Lord would be called a Nazarene. Nothing good can be from Nazareth (John 1:46). Therefore, to call the Lord a Nazarene is to despise Him and consider Him low. The prophecies of the prophets concerning the Lord implied that He is lowly and low (Isa. 53:2-3; Psa. 22:6).</P><P>Chapters one and two include five quotations from the Old Testament, with three kinds of fulfillment: (1) 2:6 and 2:15 would be fulfilled-they were of the same situation; (2) 2:17-18 was fulfilled-literally; and (3) 1:23 and 2:23 should be fulfilled-a fulfillment in teaching.</P><P>In chapter two, concerning God's leading, there is the need of (1) Bible knowledge, (2) heavenly revelation, (3) man's common sense, and (4) faith, waiting, and obedience.</P><P>These two chapters mention three characters:</P><P>First, Joseph-having great faith. (1) For a virgin to be with child is against the natural law, yet he believed (1:24). (2) Even though he needed to flee with Jesus, the Son of God, he still believed (2:14). (3) He obeyed God's command and returned to the land of Israel (2:21).</P><P>Second, Herod-(1) He was troubled because of Christ's birth (2:3). (2) He envied the Lord (2:7). (3) He sought to destroy Jesus (2:16). This shows how Satan transfigures himself into an angel of light.</P><P>Third, the magi-(1) They had the knowledge of the Scriptures. (2) They had a seeking and waiting attitude. (3) They had the revelation of the Holy Spirit. (4) They had the expression of honoring the Lord. (5) They did not take the same way back.</P><P>The conclusion: God's ways are higher than man's ways (Isa. 55:9).</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER THREE</H1><P>Verses 1-12 give a record of John's preaching of repentance; verses 13-17, of Jesus' being baptized.</P><P>When we come to Matthew 3, a problem arises because of different views concerning the kingdom of the heavens. In studying the Word of God, first we must reject our preconceived ideas; second, we must have the Lord's view. Therefore, in Ephesians 4:14 Paul said that we should not be "carried about by every wind of teaching." We should not view the Word of God according to man's preconceived ideas, nor should we follow men by simply repeating what they say. Concerning the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord promised that it will be revealed to infants (Matt. 11:25).</P><P>In verse 1, the work of John the Baptist began. Was the beginning of his work the beginning of the dispensation of the gospel? When did the dispensation of the gospel begin? In order to know the beginning of the dispensation of the gospel, we first need to know who ended the dispensation of the law. If the dispensation of the gospel began with the work of John, then what he preached does concern us. Otherwise, it has nothing to do with us.</P><P>Some people say that the dispensation of the law ended at the cross. If so, the dispensation of the gospel is after the cross. Romans 10:4 says, "Christ is the end of the law." This verse cannot be quoted as a basis to say that the dispensation of the law ended at the cross, because it refers to the requirement, not the dispensation, of the law.</P><P>John's work is the beginning of the dispensation of the gospel. This is based on:</P><P>(1) Matthew 11:13 and Luke 16:16: According to these two verses, we can see that the law and the prophets ended at the appearing of John, that is, at the beginning of his work, not at his death. John belonged to the dispensation of the law, but what he preached was grace and not doctrines of the dispensation of the law.</P><P>(2) Acts 10:36-37: The announcing of the Lord's gospel of peace began "after the baptism which John proclaimed."</P><P>(3) Acts 13:23-27: The repentance proclaimed by John (v. 24) is "the word of this salvation" (v. 26).</P><P>(4) Mark 1:1: "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ." By reading through verse 10 we know that the " beginning" began with the preaching of John the Baptist.</P><P>(5) Luke 4:17-21: Verses 18-19 show that the gospel is referred to. "Today" in verse 21 indicates that the dispensation of the gospel had begun. When the Lord spoke this word, the dispensation of the gospel had already begun.</P><P>(6) John 4:23: "An hour is coming, and it is now." This indicates that the dispensation of the gospel had begun when the Lord spoke this word.</P><P>(7) John 5:25: "An hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear...." What the dead hear are things of the dispensation of the gospel, which the Lord said "is now."</P><P>According to Mr. Pember, the Greek word rendered hour in John 4:23 and 5:25 is used for age. "An age is coming" indicates that after the dispensation of the law, another dispensation is coming.</P><P>The views of different schools concerning the beginning of the dispensation of the gospel are as follows: (1) The gospel began with John's work. (2) The gospel began at the time of the Lord's crucifixion. (3) The gospel began with the descending of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. (4) The gospel began with Stephen. In Acts 3:21 the Lord waited for Israel to repent. In 7:56 the Lord stood up, but Israel rejected Him, so the preaching of the gospel was turned to the Gentiles. This is the argument of those who take this view. (5) The gospel completely went to the Gentiles after Acts 28. (6) The gospel began from the book of Ephesians. The argument of this school is that it was at this time that the mystery was made known to the apostles. Therefore, baptism and bread breaking are not necessary because they belong to the Jews. Those who take this view think that everything is predestinated and is heavenly. They care only for three books: Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.</P><P>What kind of work was John's work? John was there doing the work of preparation. Although the dispensation of the gospel had already begun, John was doing the work of preparation (Matt. 3:3). He proclaimed, "Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near" (v. 2). What does the kingdom of the heavens refer to? Does it refer to the kingdom of the Messiah, prophesied by Daniel and Ezekiel, which the Jews are expecting? Scofield defined the kingdom of the heavens as the Messiah's rule over the earth and the time of the restoration of David's throne. Is this scriptural? Did John and the Lord say at the beginning that Christ comes to establish the kingdom? Scofield also said that when the Lord came to the earth, had He not been rejected by the children of Israel, He would have established the kingdom on the earth. "The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near"-this was preached by John, by the Lord Jesus, and by the disciples.</P><P>Matthew chapters five through seven are concerned with the law of the kingdom of the heavens; chapters eight and nine are on the Lord's healing; chapters eleven and twelve cover the Lord's being rejected; and chapter thirteen is concerned with the mysteries of the kingdom. Some say that because of Israel's rejection, the Messianic kingdom has been moved to the millennium and has therefore become a kingdom of mystery. (Between chapters twelve and thirteen there is the church.) But if the Lord came to establish the kingdom of Messiah, why would the Jews reject Him? Does not John 6:15 record that they intended to come and take Him by force to make Him King? If at that time the Lord came to establish the kingdom of Messiah, then the Lord would have come to rule and not to suffer death. If the kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of Messiah, then the cross would have been merely an expedient way to take care of certain unexpected changes, for it seems that the Lord had to put aside the kingdom and set up the way of salvation through the cross because of the Jews' unwillingness to receive Him. However, the death of Christ was foreordained by God before the foundation of the world. Peter said that Christ first suffered and then received the glory (1 Pet. 1:11). The Lord Himself also said the same thing (Luke 24:26).</P><P>Matthew 1 and 2 show us that the Lord is related not only to the Jews but also to the Gentiles. (The millennium consists of two parts: one is the kingdom of the heavens and the other, the kingdom of Messiah. The kingdom of the heavens pertains to the Lord's relationship with the believers, which is spiritual; whereas the kingdom of Messiah pertains to the Lord's relationship with the Jews, which is physical.) Does Matthew 3:2 speak of the kingdom of the heavens as the kingdom of Messiah? It begins by saying "Repent." This is the first word spoken in relation to the kingdom of the heavens. Therefore, it shows that the kingdom of the heavens is not physical but spiritual and heavenly. The kingdom of Messiah will rule the nations with an iron rod, and it will not be concerned with the matter of repentance. Moreover, the kingdom of Messiah will come with power and great glory. However, 3:3 says, "Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths." This means to prepare the hearts of men and turn them to Jehovah.</P><P>Verses 4-12: This section is a word spoken by John and, of course, is related to the drawing near of the kingdom of the heavens. From this portion we see the nature of the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>(1) It has nothing to do with the Jews: "Do not presume to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father" (v. 9). (2) It must be an organized entity whereby people can flee from the coming wrath (v. 7). (3) It requires holy and righteous conduct (v. 8). (4) Whoever does not have a relationship with the kingdom of the heavens will be cast into the fire (v. 10). (5) For people to be baptized is for them to believe in the One who is coming (v. 11). Hence, believing in the Lord is the initiation. (6) How is this Christ related to the kingdom of the heavens? (a) At the beginning of the kingdom of the heavens He baptizes people in the Holy Spirit, and (b) at the end of the kingdom of the heavens He will baptize people with fire (vv. 11-12).</P><P>There is a great difference between the kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of Messiah, and the proof is as follows:</P><P>Matthew 13:11 says that the kingdom of the heavens is a mystery, which was not understood by men but is now revealed.</P><P>In 13:16-17 we see that the truth concerning the kingdom of the heavens is not in the Old Testament. Therefore, the prophets of old could not see or hear it. In 13:35 it says, "I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world." The things hidden from the foundation of the world are the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens. By this we can see that before this time no one knew about the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens. However, the kingdom of Messiah was known to men such as Balaam, Isaiah, and Daniel.</P><P>When does the kingdom of the heavens begin? From Matthew 13:24 and 30 we see that it begins with the sowing of wheat and ends with the harvest. Therefore, the kingdom of the heavens is this age. In Matthew 16:13-19, "this rock" in verse 18 refers to Peter's confession earlier in this portion. Verse 19 mentions "the keys of the kingdom of the heavens." Here, in the original language "keys" is plural, and they are for opening the doors. These keys were used to open the doors on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius to bring in the Jews and the Gentiles. By this we can see that the church and the kingdom of the heavens begin at the same time. The building of the church was at Pentecost. The kingdom of the heavens is related to men, whereas the church is related to the Lord. It is the Lord who gives life. The church receives position and grace. The church is our position, whereas the kingdom of the heavens is our responsibility.</P><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="400"><tr><td width="50%"><p class="bold" style="text-align:center">The Kingdom<br>of the Heavens</p></td><td width="50%"><p class="bold" style="text-align:center">The Church</p></td></tr><tr><td>Related to men</td><td>Related to the Lord</td></tr><tr><td>Referring to discipline</td><td>Referring to life-giving</td></tr><tr><td>Concerning responsibility</td><td>Concerning position and grace</td></tr></table></div><P>According to its nature, the work of John the Baptist is definitely of grace. The message preached by John concerning the Lord is as follows: (1) John 1:29: "the Lamb of God" and (2) Matthew 3:11: "He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire." One is concerned with the Lord's bearing our sins, and the other is related to the Lord's baptizing in the Holy Spirit and judging the unbelievers in the future. In Luke 1:67-79, Zachariah's prophecies include the following: "to give knowledge of salvation to His people by the forgiveness of their sins" and "to guide our feet into the way of peace." This is the message that John would preach later on. Matthew 21:32 mentions "the way of righteousness"; this is in contrast to "the way of peace" mentioned in Luke 1:79. John tells people to (1) repent and (2) be baptized; this is in contrast to what the Lord does, which are: (1) to bear people's sins and (2) to baptize people in the Holy Spirit and fire.</P><P>In Greek, to repent means to regret. This causes people to stand in the position of sinners. Regret is linked to confession, for when a person recognizes his position, spontaneously he will confess his sins. Baptism signifies death and resurrection. When John was asking people to be baptized, he was telling them, in effect, that they ought to die and be resurrected. John told people to believe in the One who was coming. Therefore, John's work was for the preaching of the gospel and not for the kingdom of Messiah. John used the word "kingdom" only once (Matt. 3:2). Furthermore, he did not say that the Lord would be King. He said that the Lord is the rising sun, the Bridegroom, the Lamb, and the One who baptizes people in the Holy Spirit. For the Lord to be the Lamb and to baptize people in the Holy Spirit, He needed to die and be resurrected. The baptism ministered by John shows forth the things to be accomplished. This shows us that when the Lord came the first time, it was absolutely not for the establishing of the kingdom of Messiah. In Acts 15:13-16 we can see that verse 14 refers to the church; "after these things" in verse 16 means after the church in verse 14; "the tabernacle" denotes the kingdom of Messiah; and "a people" denotes the church. This shows that it was not until after the church that the kingdom of Messiah, the tabernacle of David which has fallen, will be established.</P><P>In Acts 11 Peter acknowledged that the gospel began with John the Baptist, and in Acts 13 Paul also acknowledged the same thing. Apollos did not have a thorough knowledge concerning this. He knew only the first part, which was the baptism of John, but he did not know concerning the things that the Lord had already acknowledged. Therefore, Priscilla and Aquila took him to themselves to help him.</P><P>John's purpose was for people to believe in the One coming after him. He preached the gospel (Acts. 19:4), except that he preached it before the Lord's death. Therefore, after the Lord accomplished redemption, what John preached had to be repeated. Peter and Paul did not overturn John's work.</P><P>Luke 3:7-14:This group of people had repented and sought to flee from the coming wrath. Therefore, in verses 11-14 John could tell them what they should do. In the four Gospels, John the Baptist was the only one who preached the substitutionary death of Christ.</P><P>Verse 1:"Now in those days John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judea." The emphasis of the Lord's work is different from the emphasis of John's work. John stressed repentance because he came to prepare the way of the Lord. Therefore, he stood in a position against the world.</P><P>John took the wilderness as his home and the city as his inn, whereas the Lord took the city as His home and the wilderness as His inn. John came that people might weep, whereas the Lord came that people may dance (Matt. 11:16-19). A complete salvation is first to weep and then to dance. In other words, repent and believe. John caused people to weep; therefore, it was as if he put on sackcloth in mourning. On the other hand, the Lord causes people to dance; He provides the music. The position in which John stood demonstrates that the people in the world are not right. John preached first in the wilderness of Judea because salvation is of the Jews (John 4:22).</P><P>Verse 2:"And saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near." That the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near is a fact; therefore, men should repent. It does not say that you repent and then the kingdom of the heavens will draw near. Heavens in Greek is in the plural number; hence, it is the kingdom of the heavens. Why is it not the kingdom of heaven, but the kingdom of the heavens? It is because before the Lord died, and while Satan was in the air, there was never a kingdom that was ruled by the heavens. Only the kingdom that was brought in by God, being different from the kingdoms on the earth, is a spiritual kingdom that can be in fellowship with God.</P><P>Verse 3:"For this is he who was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, `A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.'" Although John the Baptist was a prophet, he did not prophesy. Although he was the greatest among the prophets, he did not show off his greatness. He was merely a voice of man.</P><P>Why is the quotation in Luke 3:4-6 longer than that in Matthew 3:3? Because the Gospel of Matthew was written to the Jews, it mentions more of the things related to the Jews. Like Matthew, the Gospel of Luke also preaches Jesus Christ, but it mentions more concerning the things related to the Gentiles.</P><P>Verse 4:"Now this John had his garment of camel's hair and a leather girdle around his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey." The focus of John's message was to make people repent. Therefore, he stood in a position against the people of the world. His food and clothing were all different from those of the people of the world. However, today's Christians should not imitate John. Concerning all the things on the human side, we should not be too different from the people of the world (this is not to say that Christians should be fashioned according to the world); the Lord behaved in the same way as men (Matt. 11:19).</P><P>Verses 5-6:"At that time Jerusalem and all Judea and all the surrounding region of the Jordan went out to him, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins." This kind of baptism was not found in the Old Testament. The baptisms mentioned in Hebrews 6 refer to the washings in the Old Testament. John's baptism was to lead people to believe in the One coming after him. At that time baptism was a personal act; so also confession was a personal act. We should not use Matthew 3:6 as a basis for making confession of sins in public.</P><P>Verse 7:"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Offspring of vipers, who prompted you to flee from the coming wrath?" The Pharisees were self-proclaimed adherents of fundamental doctrines; actually, they were dead. On the other hand, the Sadducees did not believe in anything. Both the traditionalists and the modernists were offsprings of vipers and would end up in the same hell.</P><P>The self-proclaimed fundamentalists believed only in creeds; they did not know the power of God. Therefore, the traditionalists damage the church just as the modernists do. They were not only old but also dead, and they really did not know anything. The heritage of traditionalism may not be dependable.</P><P>Verse 8:"Produce then fruit worthy of your repentance." There is a need to produce fruits of repentance.</P><P>Verse 9:"And do not presume to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father; for I tell you that God is able, out of these stones, to raise up children to Abraham." The drawing near of the kingdom of the heavens has nothing to do with the fact that the Jews are the children of Abraham. What they need is repentance. Only by repentance can they become associated with the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Verse 10:"And already the axe is laid at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not produce good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire." This is a test. This does not mean that a person is required to have certain good behavior; rather, it means that his behavior should be worthy of his repentance.</P><P>Verse 11:"I baptize you in water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is stronger than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire." This verse mentions three kinds of baptism: (1) the baptism of water, (2) the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and (3) the baptism of fire. The fire here refers to hell. In the original language the conjunction "and" indicates that the two terms that are conjoined should be treated in the same manner. Since "Holy Spirit" is interpreted literally, "fire" must also be interpreted literally. John said that the Lord "will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire" because at that time two groups of people were standing before him: one group belonged to the Lord and the other was not truly seeking the Lord. John's baptism could not differentiate them, but the Holy Spirit and fire could. Matthew 3:12 categorizes people into wheat and chaff. Some think that "fire" refers to the tongues of fire at Pentecost (Acts 2:3). If so, then the mentioning of "the Holy Spirit and fire" in Matthew 3:11 would be redundant and meaningless. In Matthew 3:10, 11, and 12 fire is mentioned three times. Since in the first time and third time "fire" refers to the fire of hell, how can "fire" in the second instance not refer to the fire of hell? This shows that at the beginning of the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord baptizes people in the Holy Spirit, and that at the end of the kingdom of the heavens, He will baptize people in fire (2 Thes. 1:7-8).</P><P>Verse 12:"Whose winnowing fan is in His hand. And He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor and will gather His wheat into His barn, but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire." In Judea the threshing floor is slightly higher than the ordinary ground. The Jews used oxen to tread out the grain (1 Cor. 9:9). After the treading, they used the winnowing fan to blow off the chaff. A barn is not built in the field but near the house; hence, it signifies the world. Whenever the Bible mentions the harvest, it refers mainly to rapture and sometimes to resurrection.</P><P>Verse 13:"Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him." The baptism of the Lord Jesus is not recorded in the Gospel of John, because there He is shown as God. All the other three Gospels do have the record of the Lord's baptism.</P><P>Verse 14:"But John tried to prevent Him, saying, It is I who have need of being baptized by You, and You come to me?" Only the Gospel of Matthew mentions John's preventing because Matthew shows that the Lord Jesus is the King.</P><P>Verse 15:"But Jesus answered and said to him, Permit it for now, for it is fitting for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness. Then he permitted Him." What does "righteousness" refer to? When a sinner goes into the water, he confesses that he is a sinner and therefore needs to be baptized. The Jordan River signifies the water of judgment. By going into the water, a sinner acknowledges that he deserves to be judged. The Lord did this so that there is the possibility for men to be saved. He fulfilled God's righteousness through His death and resurrection so that sinners might be saved. "Us" indicates that God is the Father of all the believers; the Lord included all the believers in Him.</P><P>Why was the Lord baptized right at the time that He began to work? This is to show us that as soon as the Lord began His work, He stood in the position of crucifixion and resurrection. In reality, He died and resurrected after He worked for three and a half years. But He wanted us to see that all His work on earth was done by Him in the position of death and resurrection. Therefore, He was baptized beforehand as a sign. On the one hand, this shows us that the Lord's work is a work of death and resurrection; this is the aspect of redemption. On the other hand, it shows us that all the Lord's work was done in the position of death and resurrection. This is also the principle of spiritual work. Self has three aspects: (1) will, (2) power, and (3) glory; they should all be put in the position of death.</P><P>Verse 16: "And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon Him." This proves that baptism is by immersion. "The heavens were opened." This is in line with the kingdom of the heavens. Once the heavens were opened, the Spirit of God descended. From this we see that the meaning of the kingdom of the heavens is none other than God and man having fellowship. The Lord's death and resurrection caused the heavens to open. The heavens can open only for death and resurrection. Since the Lord's death and resurrection is a fact, it requires only our believing. However, because it is also a principle, it requires also our obedience.</P><P>In mentioning the dove, the Bible refers to two things: (1) being gentle and (2) having eyes that can see only one thing at a time (for the dove's eyes are single). "The Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon Him" indicates that the Spirit of God descended upon the Lord to give Him power that He might do only one thing before God in His entire life, which was to do the will of God.</P><P>Verse 17:"And behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight." This is God's testimony. God so testified because (1) the Lord truly took the way of death and resurrection, and (2) God wanted to prove that the Lord went into the water for the sake of righteousness. (At that time, all the people were baptized only because of their sins; therefore, the heavens were silent. Only the Lord was baptized for the sake of righteousness; therefore, the heavens testified.)</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER FOUR</H1><P>This chapter includes two important things: (1) the Lord's being tempted (vv. 1-11) and (2) the Lord's calling of four disciples (vv. 12-25).</P><P>Verse 3:"And the tempter came and said to Him, If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread." The Lord does not need to prove Himself, because He has God's testimony (Matt. 3:17).</P><P>Verse 4:"But He answered and said, It is written, `Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.'" Adam was defeated because he did not do what God had commanded him to do; Christ was victorious because He did not do what God had not commanded Him to do.</P><P>The temptation in this chapter follows baptism. Why did the Lord's baptism give rise to the devil's temptation? It is because baptism focuses not only on death but also on resurrection. By His resurrection Christ was designated the Son of God in power (Rom. 1:4). Among so many people, only One was designated by God to be the Son of God. The resurrection of Lazarus can be counted only as a returning to the physical life. Christ is the firstfruits of resurrection (1 Cor. 15:20). His resurrection designated Him the Son of God. Therefore, Satan had to challenge Him.</P><P>The temptation here is parallel to the temptation in the garden of Eden. Adam was tempted after he woke up from his sleep; so was the Lord. The period from Adam to Christ was four thousand years. During that period of time, no one could call himself the Son of God. But on that day a voice out of the heavens said that He was the Son of God. Therefore, Satan had to challenge Him. Satan would never let any of God's regenerated children go that easily without attacking them. Sin, the world, and the environment are all against the children of God. If Christ, who is our Forerunner, had to pass through great temptations to prove that He is the Son of God, then how could those who belong to Him be exceptions?</P><P>The first thing in the work of Christ is to manifest Himself as the Son of God. The church begins with the confession of Christ as the Son of God (Matt. 16:16, 18). (Once there was a man who was teaching the Gospel of Mark. When he came to the question, "Who do you say that I am?" (Mark 8:29), a sinner who had never cared for the Lord repented and confessed in tears the Lord Jesus as his Savior.) The record of the Gospels is to prepare men to confess the Lord Jesus as the Son of God.</P><P>The demons recognized the Lord, and they also recognized Paul (Acts 19:15). We should have a reputation before the demons. The victory of the Lord's work did not come from fighting but from His standing firm in the proper position. Afterward, it was sufficient for Him only to declare His victory. Therefore, He was able to send forth His disciples to simply cast out demons in His name. Evan Roberts said that everything would be all right if only a Christian knew how to stand firm in his position.</P><P>Verse 1:After the Lord had obtained God's testimony that He was the Son of God, what He encountered first was not victory but temptation-warfare.</P><P>Verse 2:The number forty always signifies a time of trial. This verse shows the right way for fasting. The Lord was not hungry for forty days and forty nights. Instead, He fasted forty days and forty nights. What is fasting? A person fasts because the burden within him becomes so heavy that he is unable to eat, or because a spiritual warfare is serious to the extent that his body does not feel the need for food. The Lord was not hungry while fasting. Rather, when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He became hungry.</P><P>In the garden of Eden, Adam and Eve were full but were still greedy for more food. Here, the Lord was truly hungry and could hardly refuse the food, yet He did not eat. If we cannot overcome in the matter of food, we will not be able to overcome in other things (Phil. 3:19; Heb. 13:9). Food should be only for nourishment and not for pleasure. Those who serve their stomach cannot buffet their body. God cannot do much work in people of this kind.</P><P>In verse 3 "the tempter" is mentioned, and later it is pointed out that he is the devil. Likewise, in Genesis 3 it merely says "the serpent" (Gen. 3:1).</P><P>When the Lord was baptized, there was a voice out of the heavens, saying, "This is My Son, the Beloved." The devil always remembered this and could not be at ease. He had to prove and see whether or not this One was the Son of God and how much it was related to Hades. In Matthew 16:18, after saying, "Upon this rock I will build My church," the Lord immediately said, "And the gates of Hades." All the power of Satan cannot shake the Son of God. If you stand on this testimony, you have a most firm standing.</P><P>The modernists' efforts in opposing the Son of God is absurd. Likewise, the traditionalists' efforts in supporting the Son of God also is absurd. From the beginning the Lord was the Son of God. After His baptism, He was designated the Son of God. Thereafter, the Lord would not be provoked to prove who He was. It was sufficient for Him to have God's testimony. What is needed is God's testimony; there is no need for man's explanation.</P><P>The Lord would not do anything without God's command. If there was no word from God, the Lord could not do anything. He was hungry, and it was legitimate to change the stones into bread, yet He would not do it. In the garden of Eden, Adam did what God had forbidden (Gen. 3:11). Here, the Lord would not do what God did not command Him to do. Therefore, whatever God commands us to do, we should obey. If God does not command us to do certain things, we should not act on our own. We should never go before God. Presumptuousness is as much a sin as rebellion. Moses was not able to enter into the land of Canaan, not because he did too little, but because he did more than what God commanded him to do (Num. 20:7-12). Both the Lord's doing and His not doing are miracles. Having strength and using it all up-this is the nature of man, for he hopes to receive glory thereby. Having power yet reserving it-this is the nature of God. Satan considered that the Lord indeed was the Son of God, but if He had caused the stones to become bread, He would have been finished, for He would then have acted apart from the Father.</P><P>Verse 4:"But He answered." The Lord's answer was completely opposite to Satan's proposal. Satan was on one line, but the Lord changed to another line to deal with him.</P><P>"It is written." This is one of the principles of warfare. When temptation comes, it is true that our withstanding enables us to hold our position and causes the devil to flee (James 4:7). However, most of the time, this will only bring about a deadlock. But if we declare the word of God, the devil will flee. The word of God is the sword of the Spirit (Eph. 6:17). When we wield it, we gain the victory. However, it is also important to have faith. The word of God may be likened to the verdict handed down by the Supreme Court. This shows that before the Lord went into the wilderness, God had already given Him the word. God had said that He could get through, so He could get through.</P><P>Verses 5-7:Satan, who still would not let go of the matter of "the Son of God," also quoted the Scriptures. The first time it was the Lord who quoted the Scriptures to deal with Satan. The second time it was Satan who quoted the Scriptures, and the Lord refuted him by quoting the Scriptures again. The Bible should not be quoted in a careless way. What the Lord is showing here was that the first time He Himself quoted the Scriptures because God had given the word. But the second time, since God had not given the word, if He had cast Himself down, He would have tempted God. To have faith is to do according to what God has said; to tempt God is to decide to do something when God has not said it. Faith has only one principle: God has said it and I believe it.</P><P>Concerning the word "again" (v. 7), we should remember that in seeking God's will, if we receive just one verse and cannot back it up with another verse, we may be in danger.</P><P>Verses 8-10: Satan was willing to give up all the kingdoms of the world and their glory, but he was not willing to give up the worship from men. In this age Satan is the ruler of this world. In his entire life Satan's aim is to receive worship from men by hiding behind numerous idols and religions. Many idols have spirits because Satan is behind them. Satan's intention is to rob God of the worship from men. Therefore, the Scriptures say that God is a jealous God. It is written, " You took up...the star of your gods that you made for yourselves. / Thus I will bring you into captivity" (Amos 5:26-27).</P><P>John 4:23 says, "The Father also seeks such to worship Him." The Greek word rendered "seeks" is emphatic. The Father has to seek for worshippers because Satan is trying to rob God of the worship from men. David said that he would not take up the names of other gods upon his lips (Psa. 16:4).</P><P>In Old Testament times, those who had in them a spirit of the dead or a familiar spirit would be stoned to death (Lev. 20:27). Even if the wife of a man's bosom should entice him secretly, saying, "Let us go and serve other gods," she would be stoned to death. Furthermore, the first one to cast the stone on her would be her husband (Deut. 13:6, 9-10).</P><P>The Lord rebuked the tempter three times with the word of God. The first two times He did not point out that the tempter was Satan. However, the third time, because the tempter was attempting to rob God of worship, the Lord pointed out that he was Satan. The Lord also quoted the Scriptures, saying, " You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve" (Matt. 4:10; Deut. 6:13). The Lord is coming soon. We should reject any attempts to rob God of His worship.</P><P>Verse 11:"Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him." Every saint has the ministering of angels (Heb. 1:14). While we are being tempted, angels are standing by our side. We should pray God to send His angels to encamp around us and protect us.</P><P>Verse 12-17:Although John was put into prison, the Lord continued the message preached by John (v. 17). Although the first one who preached the message concerning the kingdom of the heavens was imprisoned, the nature of his message was not changed.</P><P>Verses 18-22:Peter was called when he was casting a net; John was called when he was mending nets. Eventually, what Peter did every time was a work of net-casting, and what John did every time was a work of net-mending. Peter cast a net first on the Jews and then on the Gentiles. Among the four Gospels, John's Gospel was written the latest. At that time, the Lord was no longer seen by men, but John brought men back to the source. When John wrote his Epistles, modernism had come into existence. Therefore, John led people to know the One who is from the beginning. The church had degraded, so John came to mend the nets. If the church had not degraded during the apostolic age, we would not have known how to take care of the situation when the church became defeated. Therefore, the Lord allowed the church to become defeated in the apostolic age so that John could come to mend the net and people would know how to take care of the situation. It seems that a person's condition at the time of his salvation more or less determines his work later on.</P><P>Verses 23-25: What the Lord preached was none other than the gospel of the kingdom. This is the same as the gospel of grace (Acts 20:32). However, the kingdom of the heavens has a specific emphasis. All who follow the Lord must be fishers of men. If a person is saved yet has never led another person to the Lord, he is not following the Lord. The Lord said, "I will make you fishers of men" (Matt. 4:19).</P><P>After Jesus healed many sick people, great crowds came to follow Him. Today if our spiritual diseases are healed by the Lord, many will come to follow Him.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER FIVE</H1><P>In chapter three John the Baptist declared the kingdom of the heavens, in chapter four the Lord proclaimed the kingdom of the heavens, and in chapter five the Lord spoke concerning the law and principle of the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Is this portion, Matthew 5-7, spoken to Christians?</P><P>First, insofar as the term "disciples" is concerned, this passage is spoken to Christians:</P><P>(1)In verses 1-2, although there were crowds, only the disciples went up to the mountain with the Lord. The Lord did not consider the crowds as His "disciples." This means that the disciples were Christians.</P><P>(2)Some say that the disciples mentioned in verse 1 were the Jewish disciples. However, this is not what the Bible says. Furthermore, the Lord says, "To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens" (Matt. 13:11). From this we see that this word is not spoken to the Jews. In Matthew 28:19 the Lord charged His disciples to "disciple all the nations," that is, to make the Gentiles the Lord's disciples. There is no such thing as "Gentile" disciples. From Acts 11:26 we know that disciples are equivalent to Christians. From Matthew to Acts, all who believed in the Lord, whether Gentiles or Jews, were called disciples.</P><P>Second, insofar as the Lord's word is concerned, this passage is spoken to Christians:</P><P>(1)In His charge in Matthew 28:19-20 the Lord said, " Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you." Of all the Lord's commands in the Gospels, none surpasses those given in Matthew 5-7. We may say that Matthew 5-7 is the center of all the Lord's commands and contains the Lord's most important commands. Therefore, this passage is spoken to Christians and should be observed by Christians.</P><P>(2)John 14:26 shows us that the work of the Holy Spirit is to remind the disciples of all the things that the Lord Jesus said while He was on the earth. The most important part of the work of the Holy Spirit is to lead us back to the Lord's word.</P><P>(3)What did Paul say concerning the word of the Lord? In Colossians 3:16 he said it is "the word of Christ." He did not say "the word of God," because the word of God refers to the whole Bible. Here he mentioned specifically "the word of Christ." Paul wrote Colossians while he was in prison, after the mystery of the church had been revealed to him.</P><P>Third, insofar as its contents are concerned, this portion is spoken to Christians:</P><P>(1)In Matthew 5-7 when we read words such as "you have heard that it was said to the ancients" and "but I say to you," we know that this portion is not concerned with the law of the Old Testament. Christians are not under the law. However, they are not without law. Rather, they are under the law of Christ.</P><P>(2)In Matthew 5-7 expressions such as "Father who is in the heavens" and "brother" are often mentioned. This indicates that this portion does not refer to the Old Testament. Rather, it is related to a group of people who have the life of God.</P><P>(3)We can find many teachings in the Epistles that are similar to those in Matthew 5-7. For example, Romans 12 has a number of teachings similar to those in this passage.</P><P>(4)If Matthew 5-7 contains the law of the millennial kingdom, how can there be "the unjust," "the evil," the robber, and the adulterer in that kingdom?</P><P>Verses 3-9 speak concerning nine blessings:</P><P>Verse 3:"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens." For one to be poor in spirit means that he is void of riches. "Theirs is the kingdom of the heavens"-the definition of the kingdom of the heavens cannot be determined here. However, we may say that it is a reward or more than a reward.</P><P>Verse 4:"Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted." "Mourn" indicates that God wants us to be pessimists in the world who react negatively toward the world, for the world will not get any better (Luke 17:26-29).</P><P>Verse 5:"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth." To be meek is to put up no resistance but to endure all things. Such people will lose the things in the world today. Therefore, they will inherit the earth in the future.</P><P>Verse 6:"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied." "Righteousness" refers, in particular, to our personal righteousness in our behavior. For example, to take advantage of others is to be unrighteous. It does not say, "Blessed are the righteous," because it is difficult to be righteous. Instead, it says "hunger and thirst for righteousness." This is to seek after righteousness as a hungry and thirsty person seeking for food and drink. Such a one, therefore, will be satisfied.</P><P>Verse 7:"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be shown mercy." The previous verse speaks of righteousness. To be righteous is to give one what he deserves. This verse speaks of being merciful. To be merciful is to give one what he does not deserve. Today on this earth Christians should not try to occupy a position of advantage. Our obtaining of mercy will be at the judgment seat. The Lord will deal with us in the way that we deal with others (James 2:13). Our prayers of mercy will reach the judgment seat (2 Tim. 1:16, 18).</P><P>Verse 8:"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." The nine blessings mentioned in this section, of course, are for the present age, but, even more, they are for the coming age. To be pure is to be single in purpose for God's glory and God's will, to seek only for God's gain (1 Cor. 10:31), to be solely for God. When a person sets his goal on God alone, he gains God at the end. If he fixes his eyes only on one thing, then he will see only one thing. When he fixes his eyes on God, he sees God. Revelation 20:6 says that the overcoming believers will be kings and priests of God the Father. Priests are those who see God. But some will lose the blessing of seeing God. Not exercising one's gift is also a reason for not being able to see God.</P><P>Verse 9:"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God." This is a matter in the present time. God is making peace today; we are merely preaching it. "Sons" actually means children. Every believer is a child of God (John 1:12). The expression "sons and daughters" is used only in 2 Corinthians 6:18 and refers to each individual. In Christ, whether they are male or female, everyone is a "son"; there are no daughters. For example, we call someone a brother in the Lord because he is in Christ, not because he is a man. "Sons" are grown-ups.</P><P>According to the Greek custom, all offspring are called children. When the children grow up, the father selects one among them as the chosen heir, who then receives the "sonship."</P><P>Verse 10:"Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens." "For the sake of righteousness" means for the sake of rightfulness and justice. "Those who are persecuted," according to the original language, may be rendered in the past tense: "those who have been persecuted." Perhaps it also includes those in the Old Testament who had such righteous conduct. The suffering of persecution mentioned in this verse is different from that mentioned in 5:11. Here, in this verse, many Christians are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, that is, rightfulness, justice. In 5:11, however, Christians are persecuted directly for the sake of Christ.</P><P>"Enter into the kingdom of the heavens," "in the kingdom of the heavens," and "theirs is the kingdom of the heavens"-these three expressions should have different meanings; otherwise, they conflict.</P><P>Verses 11-12:"Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me. Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you." People persecute Christians by three different kinds of treatment: (1) reproaching-right in one's face; (2) persecuting-method, environment; and (3) saying every evil thing-spreading rumors behind one's back. Because the ninth blessing refers to a reward, we know that the preceding eight blessings also are rewards. This is biblical parallelism. Since the first half of each blessing refers to conduct, then the second half refers to reward. In verse 12, since the Lord said that the reward is "great," it cannot be small. What a comfort this is to us!</P><P>Verses 13-16: This section covers two things: (1) the believers as the salt of the earth and (2) the believers as the light of the world. Salt is something inward and is toward oneself; this refers to nature. Light is something outward and is in relation to others; this refers to behavior. Here, the Lord does not say "You are the salt" but "You are the salt of the earth." Although there is much garbage on the earth, the presence of germ-killing salt keeps the earth from being fully corrupted. In the same way, the element of salt in the sea water causes the filth to become purified. If there were no salt, the earth would become rotten and would stink. Only Christians can influence the earth (2 Cor. 6:14-17).</P><P>"The salt has become tasteless" does not mean that the believers have fallen into apostasy. Rather, it means that they have lost the flavor that distinguishes them from the people in the world. They dress the same way as the earthly people do, and they eat the same way as the earthly people do. For them to become no different from the world means that they as the salt have become tasteless. They do not have to commit serious sins to lose their taste. "It is no longer good for anything"-this is in the eyes of God. "To be cast out" is to be put into the tribulation, because both "out" and "trampled underfoot" are terms used in connection with the tribulation. This may be referring both to the present and the future.</P><P>What about the light of the world? (1) It is like a city situated upon a mountain that cannot be hidden. Believers should not seek to be manifested among believers, but they should be manifested among the unbelievers to let the world know that they are Christians. (2) It is like a lamp on the lampstand. The preceding point says that the light cannot be hidden, and this point says that the light should not be hidden. "City" is with respect to outsiders, and "lamp" is with respect to those inside the house. God has a specific use for our light. If we hide the light, God cannot be glorified through us. Light can be shut out, but darkness cannot be shut out. Darkness is the nature of the world, but light comes as something extra. When light comes, darkness is chased away. It is the Father, not men, who will be glorified. The word "Father" proves that these people are regenerated ones.</P><P>Verses 17-20:This section is on the importance of the law. (1) Verses 17-18 say that the Lord did not come to abolish the law; (2) verse 19 refers to people in the Old Testament; and (3) verse 20 refers to people in the New Testament. Verse 17 is the Seventh Day Adventists' basis for keeping the law; but to keep the law in this way is like committing suicide. "To fulfill" (v. 17) is to fill up that which is lacking in the law; it does not refer to what He would accomplish on the cross. Verse 19 is concerned with the annulling of the law in general, that is, by "whoever." Verse 20 is concerned with the fulfilling of the law; it refers to another group of people, not people in general but the disciples specifically. The highest righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees can fulfill only what is said in the second half of verse 19. But even if we can attain the righteousness like that of the scribes and Pharisees, we still cannot enter into the kingdom of the heavens. In other words, unless our righteousness surpasses the righteousness in verse 19, we still cannot enter into the kingdom of the heavens. What does the Lord want to fulfill? It is the words spoken in Matthew 5-7. This is to complement that which is imperfect in the law; it is not to add more items to the law.</P><P>The requirements of the law are of three aspects. First, it requires keeping. Men are required to keep every item of the law, from the first item to the last item. Only Christ keeps the law in such a complete way. Second, it requires punishment. If a man is punished, the law is also fulfilled. For example, if a man sheds another man's blood, his blood also needs to be shed. Both the first and second aspects are mentioned in Matthew. Third, it requires teaching. Because the law is not perfect, it needs either to be changed or to be fulfilled. This is still the fulfilling mentioned in Matthew 5:17.</P><P>The first requirement comes first, and then there is the second requirement, because the first requirement gives Christ the qualification to be punished in our place. The third requirement comes after the second requirement. Since the old covenant is over, the requirements of both keeping and punishment are over. The third requirement is what we need to keep.</P><P>"To fulfill" in verse 17 is different from "come to pass" in verse 18. Verse 17 refers to complementing, and verse 18 refers to carrying out. Verse 17 speaks of complementing because it mentions both the law and the prophets. Verse 18 speaks only of the law and does not mention the prophets. What is covered by the law extends only to the end of the millennial kingdom, but what is covered by the prophets, such as Isaiah, extends to the new heaven and new earth. The law does not mention eternity. In verse 18, "until" means up to that time.</P><P>Verses 21-26:This section is on being reconciled to our brother. Verse 21 corresponds to verse 17, and verse 22 corresponds to verse 19. Both prove that the above explanation is accurate. The judgment in verse 22 is the same as the judgment in verse 21. Although the judgment in verse 22 was not the judgment by the Jewish council, we can tell that it was the preliminary judgment because at that time the preliminary judgment was held at the gate of the city. The judgment by the Sanhedrin was a step higher. The next step would be before God. Although this portion is a word spoken to Christians, at that time those standing before the Lord were Jews. Naturally, the Lord used the background of the Jews in His speaking.</P><P>To be "angry" is inward. It is mentioned in the Gospel of Mark that the Lord was angry (Mark 3:5). The Bible does not say that all anger will be judged, but it says that some anger offends God and offends the brothers. Therefore, Ephesians 4:26 says, "Be angry, yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation." This means not to be so angry as to sin and not to be controlled by sin. Anger should have a time limit. We should control our anger. Why is it that being angry with our brother is equivalent to killing him? This is simply because many times it is our position, our physical body, our environment, and our ethical education that prevent us from carrying out the killing. However, in reality, the inner desire to kill is present in us.</P><P>Since judgment is mentioned here, we can see that it is a fact that Christians will be judged. Therefore, we should not believe the teaching by some that says that Christians will not be judged. "Brother" is mentioned here, and the requirement here is high. Therefore, this is not a word spoken to those outside the church. The Presbyterians, the Episcopalians, and the Brethren all follow Calvinism, which teaches that salvation is predestinated and, therefore, all who are saved cannot perish. The Methodists and some of the Pentecostalists follow Arminianism, which teaches that man has a free will and that Christians still can perish, since many Christians had fallen, as seen in the Bible. Calvinism is prevailing in that it exalts God, but Arminianism is also somewhat reasonable. Therefore, in my opinion, we should not overthrow a teaching that is based on a few Bible verses with another teaching that is based on many Bible verses. We should put all the verses together and let the Bible decide the matter.</P><P>The Lord speaks of eternal life and of not perishing forever, which are things relating to eternity. Before the creation of the world and after the book of Revelation-this is all eternity. Only the section in between, a temporary section, is called time, that is, from the creation of the world to the book of Revelation. In this period of time, some Christians may be punished (2 Cor. 5:10), and some may receive retribution. What could this be if this were not punishment? Luke 12:47-48 mentions the matter of receiving lashes. This is a matter before the judgment seat. It is possible for Christians not only to lose the reward but also to receive lashes. First Corinthians 3:15 mentions also that some will "suffer loss." Some have said that even if it speaks of suffering loss, as long as one does not feel the loss, it cannot be considered a loss. John 15:6 says, "If one does not abide in Me," showing that that one had abided before; then it says, "cast them into the fire," showing that there is surely punishment. Revelation 2:11 says, "He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death." In other words, he who does not overcome will be hurt of the second death. According to Revelation 20:6, only those who overcome will reign with Christ. If a Christian commits sin, God will cause him to pass through fire at the time of the millennial kingdom.</P><P>John 10:28 says, "They shall by no means perish forever." This means that those believers who commit sins and do not repent will temporarily suffer what the unbelievers will suffer. They will be released when the official criminals arrive. The Catholic purgatory begins with a person's death. Moreover, they have the teaching of the so-called release of the soul from suffering. Reference to this heresy should not be made to oppose the matter that Christians will be punished. We can only use the Bible to prove that the punishment is at the judgment seat. Sin in a Gentile is sin; sin in a believer also is sin.</P><P>Mr. Govett translated Raca as "useless"; others, as "stupid" or "good-for-nothing." Some say that the word Moreh is Syriac and that a more proper translation is "rebel." According to the context, it is more serious to call one's brother "Raca" than to be angry with one's brother. While to be angry is merely within one's heart, to call others "Raca" involves the using of one's mouth. The punishment for one who calls his brother "Moreh" is that he will be liable to the Gehenna of fire. We may thus see that the meaning of Moreh is stronger than that of Raca. Raca means "stupid," whereas Moreh, as Mr. Pember said, means "rebel." "The Gehenna of fire" is mentioned here. This indicates that Christians cannot escape judgment. If this referred to unbelievers, would they go to hell simply because they scold a person for being stupid?</P><P>Verse 23:"Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you..." "Therefore" means "for this reason." Here it does not say "offering your sacrifice" but "offering your gift." The offering of a sacrifice is for dealing with sin, whereas the offering of a gift is to give something to God and has nothing to do with sin. "Has something against you" indicates that you have done something wrong.</P><P>Verse 24:"Leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift." The requirement in this verse is many times higher than that in the Old Testament. Not only the gift and the person should be right, but also the spiritual condition should be right. When the Lord spoke these words, the ceremonial law had not been abolished. "Offer your gift" and "before the altar" were the background at that time.</P><P>Verse 25:"Opponent at law" in Greek means "plaintiff"; "opponent" implies enmity. "On the way" means that you have not reached the end of the way and have not arrived before the judge. Therefore, be well disposed quickly toward your opponent for the following three reasons: (1) He may die. If he dies, there is no possibility for reconciliation. (2) You may die. Once you die, there is also no possibility for reconciliation. (3) The Lord may come back. Once the Lord comes back, there is no possibility for reconciliation. If you mistreat someone and do not deal with it properly, even the sound of his sighing can prevent your prayer from reaching God. The voice of Abel caused Cain to be troubled.</P><P>"The judge" refers to the Lord; "the officer" refers to the angel. The "prison" is a place where there is no freedom and a place of darkness as well. One who is put into prison cannot live glorious days; he cannot be like those who follow the Lamb wherever He may go. However, since this is the prison, this is not forever. We may thus see that there is still the possibility for Christians to be put in the Gehenna of fire in the future.</P><P>Verse 26:"You shall by no means come out from there until you pay the last quadrans." Since the debt has to be paid back sooner or later, why not pay it back today? Here, "come out" will take place in the coming age, that is, the age of the millennial kingdom. This refers to the forgiveness in the coming age.</P><P>Verses 27-32:This section is on adultery. In verse 28, " looks" indicates that it is intentional; "a woman" refers to another's wife. What is condemned by Christ is not any sudden thought put into us by Satan or any sudden evil thought that came up in our mind. Rather, what is condemned is that after seeing, we look with intention. Any action that our will disagrees with is not counted as a sin. However, the action of our will after we surrender to temptation is a sin.</P><P>The Lord teaches us here that we must guard our heart. Otherwise, we would surely commit adultery if it were not for reasons of ethics, environment, or position. It is written in Proverbs, "He that hath no rule over his own spirit / is like a city that is broken down, and without walls" (25:28). A city without walls is a place where the enemy can go in and out freely.</P><P>Verse 29:Unbelievers still have to go to hell even if they pluck out their eyes. Therefore, this word here is not spoken to unbelievers but to Christians.</P><P>Verse 30:Both the cutting off of the hand in this verse and the plucking out of the eye in the preceding verse are not to be taken literally. Rather, what is meant here is to cut off the opportunities for sinning. (Peter once cut off someone's ear with his hand, but his hand was not cut off.) This means that we should pay any price to cut off the opportunities for sinning.</P><P>Verses 31-32:Here the Lord puts the matter of divorce altogether in a new position. The Lord acknowledges that husband and wife are one body. Before this one body is damaged, nothing can destroy this oneness. Adultery destroys oneness. The certificate of divorce is only a recognition that the oneness has been destroyed. Unless the divorce is due to adultery, the oneness still exists before God. If the wife marries someone else, that means the husband causes her to destroy the oneness. He also causes the man who marries her to be guilty of destroying the oneness. Furthermore, if the husband himself marries another woman, he also commits adultery.</P><P>Verses 33-37:This section speaks concerning not swearing. James 5:12 says, "Above all things, my brothers, do not swear." No one is allowed to swear. Why does James put so much emphasis on swearing? It is because the emphasis of the entire book of James is the matter of speaking.</P><P>Men always like to use different ways to prove the honesty of their speaking. Not swearing means that a Christian's word should be simple. He should not use any extra effort to prove his word in order to convince others of his credibility. Swearing includes speaking "anything more than" yes and no.</P><P>Verses 38-42:This section is on not resisting one who is evil. Today is the time for us to be patient. The following are three kinds of persecutions: (1) Concerning one's physical body. For a Christian to endure the first slapping is not something special. What is special of a Christian is that he is ready to receive the second slapping. A Christian does not stop at simply not resisting; he goes further by joyfully giving himself over to be slapped again. The degree of one's power is not determined by what one can do; rather, one's power is measured by what one can endure. Therefore, Colossians 1:11 says, "unto all endurance and long-suffering." The many items that were required in the foregoing word are simply "unto all endurance and long-suffering." "Turn to him the other [cheek] also" indicates endurance to the utmost degree, that is, being ready to be slapped again. You should allow the life within to be expressed in a spontaneous way. It is not that you try to endure by yourself. The mentioning of "right cheek" and "the other [cheek]" does not mean to turn our cheek to the right or to the left. Rather, it means to endure the first slapping and be willing to be slapped again. This is what it means to "turn to him the other [cheek] also." This is the life of the Lamb. (2) Concerning one's property. The lawsuit here against the defendant is most unusual. What the Lord means here is that the suit is not merely to get the tunic. Rather, the suit is to get everything, including even the tunic. But the Lord said to yield the cloak too. We are preserved by the love of God. Besides this, none can raise his own hand to protect himself. (3) Concerning one's work. Here it says, " Whoever compels you to go..." Compel in Greek is a technical term used in the military.</P><P>The blessings of a Christian issue from his turning the other cheek, yielding the cloak, and going the second mile. This is the principle of the second. Very often we cannot even go one mile. Only those who follow the principle of the second will be glorified with the Lord. All those who will reign with the Lord in the future are those who would not reign today.</P><P>In conclusion, here in verse 42 Christ did not tell us to choose those to whom we should give. Christ only commanded us to do our part. We can only take care of what God requires of us. We cannot take care of what God requires of others.</P><P>Verses 43-48:This concerns the motivation of love. The actions taken in the preceding verses are caused by love. If we are indignant about injustice, we cannot pray for those who persecute us. The love here is neither love out of one's preference nor love out of one's affection. Rather, it is love out of one's compassion. (There are four kinds of love: affectionate love, preferential love, respectful love, and compassionate love.) We should not close our compassionate heart.</P><P>Verse 44:"Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you." Only by so doing can we become children of the heavenly Father and express the nature of the heavenly Father.</P><P>Verse 45:"Because He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust." By this we see how generous God is toward men. If God were like us, no one would be saved. Only God can forget men's evildoings. Man has no ability to forget because man does not have absolute forgetfulness. "So that you may become" has the sense of "so that you may be manifested as."</P><P>Verses 46-47:Without the deeds described in the above verses, we cannot receive the reward. A greeting many times expresses an attitude of the mind.</P><P>Verse 48:"You therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect." "Perfect" here refers to being perfect in love. We cannot be perfect as God is perfect in nature, power, wisdom, glory, and holiness. God requires us to be perfect only in our deeds of love. To be perfect here does not mean to eradicate sin, since the preceding verses in this section are concerned not with punishment but with the deeds of love. In parallel to this word, Luke 6:36 says, "Be full of compassion, even as your Father also is full of compassion." By this we see that Luke interprets "perfect" here in terms of compassion. Here it cannot mean that we should be perfect as God is perfect in righteousness. The Bible tells us to be righteous toward ourselves and to be perfect in love toward others as God is perfect.</P><P>The clause "it was said to the ancients" is used in verses 21 and 33. However, it is changed to "it was said." Since the word concerning "hate your enemy" is not plainly written in the Old Testament, the Lord said that "it was said" and not that "it was said to the ancients." Although "a tooth for a tooth" is written plainly in the Old Testament, it was spoken to the judge and not to the common people. Furthermore, at that time, the scribes and the Pharisees had already taken this word as a teaching. Therefore, the Lord did not say here that "it was said to the ancients," but He was quoting the scribes. Hence, He said that "it was said."</P><P>In chapters one through five we see the following principles of Bible interpretation:</P><P>Example 1: If a conjunction is used between words, and if the part that comes before the conjunction is interpreted according to its spiritual sense, then the part that comes after the conjunction should also be so interpreted. Likewise, if one part is interpreted according to its literal sense, the other part should also be so interpreted. The interpretation should be consistent for both parts.</P><P>Example 2: A teaching with few supporting Bible verses should not be sacrificed for another teaching with many supporting Bible verses.</P><P>Example 3: All the words in the Bible should be interpreted literally unless the literal interpretation is nearly absurd. Parables, visions, and signs should not be interpreted literally. Everything else should be interpreted literally.</P><P>Example 4: It is not sufficient to determine a truth based on one Bible verse alone. There should always be the "Again, it is written."</P><P>Example 5: Two words or phrases that are similar should not be interpreted in the same way if their contexts are different.</P><P>Example 6: All parallels are equals.</P><P>Example 7: In interpreting the Bible one should not be bound by the background, nor should he ignore the background.</P><P>Example 8: One Bible verse alone cannot cover all aspects of any truth. For example, no one can find out all aspects of the truth concerning the law from one Bible verse alone.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER SIX</H1><P>Verses 1-18: This section, the main subject of which is righteousness, is divided into three subsections: (1) alms-giving, (2) prayer, and (3) fasting.</P><P>Verse 1: "Take care not to do your righteousness before men in order to be gazed at by them." This is the general subject. We should not only do righteousness, but we should do it in secret. When we do something, we should govern our heart. The preceding passage emphasizes that we should love our enemies. This passage says that all our righteous deeds should be hidden from men. In this way we will receive a reward from our Father who is in secret. In Germany there was once a great battle, and some soldiers arrived at a place where some good Lutheran believers were. The soldiers asked one believer to lead them to the best wheat field in order that they could cut some wheat. When they were led eventually to one field, they were told to cut there. The soldiers looked around and asked why they were not led to those fields on the side. The believer answered that those other fields were not his, and that only that patch was his. This is the principle of the second mile.</P><P>The central teaching in Matthew 5-7 is reward.</P><P>Verses 2-4: This is concerning alms. "Sound a trumpet" in verse 2 is probably an idiomatic expression. "Do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing." Of course, this cannot be interpreted literally. What it means is that we should try our best to avoid giving alms before men, even to the extent that seemingly our left hand does not know what our right hand is doing. "Repay" may also be rendered "reward." All our righteous deeds before God should be done only before God (in secret).</P><P>Verse 5: "When you pray." The Lord did not command us to give alms, pray, and fast, because these things are what the believers should do at the least. What the Lord said here is how to give alms, pray, and fast in order to please God.</P><P>"Hypocrites." The root of this word in the original language is "an actor, one who play-acts." Hypocrites are actors. For example, they are not very earnest when they pray, yet they act as if they are very earnest. This kind of acting is condemned by the Lord. In the "synagogues" are many zealous people; on the "street corners" are many ordinary people. Synagogues and street corners are stages for the hypocrites, since performers have to perform before men. This means that they want to gain the praise of both the insiders and the outsiders. "So that they may be seen by men." This is the purpose of their performing. To hide shortcomings is the natural act of the fleshly man. However, grace requires us to hide our good points. New Christians like to hide their shortcomings. However, after having deeper experiences, they are willing to reveal their shortcomings before others. Then, further on, because of the grace of God they will be transformed, and their shortcomings will thus be eliminated.</P><P>There are two different times for reward: (1) today and (2) in the future. There are two kinds of reward: (1) reward from men and (2) reward from God. We cannot have both kinds of reward. If we want to receive reward from men, we will not be able to receive reward from God in the future. We cannot enjoy a big name in the world and also have a position in the kingdom. Today there are some zealous ones who give alms in order to gain glory and praise. Thus, they will not be able to receive reward from God. Therefore, we should refuse the present reward. People in the world are willing to be zealous and to suffer because they want to gain something today. If we are not careful, we may have the same inclination in our giving of alms and praying. What can we gain from the praise of men? If our eyes are open, we will seek only the glory before God and before His angels. All other things do not count.</P><P>Verse 6: "When you pray, enter into your private room, and shut your door." Some say that prayer involves the matter of place and that therefore it is necessary to build a prayer room. However, Paul told Timothy that men should "pray in every place" (1 Tim. 2:8). The "private room" refers to the bedroom, where there are not too many people. It is quiet during the day when people go out to work; it is also quiet at night when people are asleep. This means that we need to pray in a place where there are few people. When the Lord was on the earth, He did not have a place to rest. Therefore, He often used the wilderness and the mountains as His private room (Matt. 8:20; Mark 1:35; Luke 5:16; Mark 6:46; Luke 6:12; 9:28). David said, "I...am as a sparrow alone" (Psa. 102:7).</P><P>"Your Father who sees in secret will repay you." It is human nature to call people's attention to one's good points. But God sees in secret; He cannot even forget a cup of water (Matt. 10:42). The good points that we remember today may not be counted by God in the future. What we have forgotten today may be remembered by God in the future. The Greek word for repay means "reward." This does not refer to what is commonly called "answers to prayer." Rather, it points to the reward in the future. God cannot answer prayers that are not according to His will and therefore do not deserve His answer. However, God considers all our prayers in secret as righteous deeds and will reward us in the future.</P><P>Verse 7: "And in praying do not babble empty words as the Gentiles do." This means that we should not use many meaningless words to make our prayers long. It does not mean that we should not pray with the same words. The Lord prayed three times using the same words (Mark 14:36, 39, 41). Therefore, we know that when we are genuinely burdened in our spirit, we often pray many times with the same words. The prayer of those who know best how to pray is original and not natural. There is a bad tendency among the believers today. We think that our prayers cannot be effective unless they are long. Therefore, we prolong our prayers so that they will be heard by God. However, most of the prayers recorded in the Bible are short; for example, "Lord, save me!" (Matt. 14:30). Thus, we can see that short prayers are very important. When we are at a critical point in our gospel preaching to sinners, or when we have an urgent need, short prayers are most effective.</P><P>"For they suppose that in their multiplicity of words they will be heard." Probably this is what today's believers think. When we have the time, we may pray long prayers privately. However, we should not think that we will be heard because of our multiplicity of words.</P><P>Verse 8: "Your Father knows the things that you have need of before you ask Him." Some say that since God already knows our need before we ask, we do not need to pray. They also say that it is better not to pray than to have short prayers. However, this verse does not mean that we should not pray. Rather, it means that we should not go to God to give a report. Although God knows our need, He is still waiting for us to pray. Nonetheless, He does not want us to report. For example, "Lord,...we are perishing!" (Matt. 8:25) is a report, but "Lord, save us!" is a prayer. It is not right to notify God, but it is right to make requests of God. This verse is to discourage prayers that are in the nature of a report.</P><P>Verse 9: "You then pray in this way." This does not mean that the prayer that follows should be used as a form. Rather, it means that the disciples should take it as an example of prayer and learn to pray in the same way.</P><P>Verses 9-13: When the Lord was on the earth, this was the only time that He taught people to pray. On the other occasion, recorded in Luke, it was the disciples who asked the Lord to teach them to pray (Luke 11:1). Although the words there were similar to the words here, the two were given on two different occasions. From the prayer here we can get some clue. Although the Lord taught us to pray just these few sentences, we can see what God wants us to pray in these few thousand years. All of God's desire and all that He is intent on accomplishing speedily are expressed through this prayer. This prayer shows forth God's eternal will and God's desire toward man.</P><P>This prayer contains the word "Your" three times and the word "us" four times.</P><P>"Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth." God's name is not sanctified by people on the earth. Neither is God's authority exercised on the earth, nor is God's will done on the earth. The purpose of God is to have His will done also on earth, as it is in heaven. (This sentence is a great key to understanding this section.) From this it can be seen that in heaven God's name is sanctified and God's will is done. However, on earth other names are sanctified, the kingdom of darkness exists, and an opposing will is present. Satan is the ruler of this world and the god of this age, and in his hand the whole world lies (John 12:31; 2 Cor. 4:4; 1 John 5:19).</P><P>We should preach the gospel to deliver people out of the hand of the evil one that they may sanctify God's name and be subject to God's authority, so that God's kingdom may come to this very earth on which we stand. Today's Christians bear a great responsibility, that of bringing the kingdom to the earth through prayer. Why is Satan still in the world today? It is because those who belong to Christ have not experienced the victory of Christ. At least one of the reasons that God created man was that God does not want to cast out a created being-Satan-directly as a Creator. The fact that God in that day charged Adam to keep the garden of Eden shows that there was an enemy. The authority that God gave to Adam was that which He had previously given to Satan, who was originally the archangel.</P><P>The serpent was cursed to eat dust, which is the substance with which man was formed. This means that man fell and was subjected under the authority of Satan. God's original intention was to have man cooperate with Him. Since the first man Adam failed, God raised up the second man Christ to overcome Satan. Through His death the Lord redeemed man from sin, and He did the will of God. The Lord joined every saved one to Himself that they all may exalt God, do God's will, and destroy the kingdom of Satan. This group of people corporately form the second man Adam in order to do the will of God on earth as it is in heaven.</P><P>Mr. Evan Roberts said that the wheel of prayer is as follows: (1) God initiates, (2) man prays, and (3) God accomplishes. Ezekiel 36 shows us a great principle. God first said that He will give Israel a new heart, yet He still wants them to inquire of Him, and then He will accomplish it.</P><P>Verse 9: "Our" includes all Christians. Only Christians can call God their "heavenly Father"; people in the world cannot address God in this way. "Your name be sanctified." This is what God has always demanded for thousands of years.</P><P>Verse 10: "Your kingdom come." On the one hand, we may say that the kingdom of God is already in our midst. On the other hand, we may also say that it has not come and is waiting for the believers to pray for its coming.</P><P>Verses 11-13: These are our askings, in which "us" is used four times. Verse 11: This is asking God to give us our daily bread. Since Christians do not have savings on earth, they need to ask for their daily bread.</P><P>Verse 14: "For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you also." Some say that this passage is spoken to Jews and indicates something different from the forgiving mentioned in Ephesians 4:32. This is incorrect. The reasons are as follows: (1) If this passage was spoken to Jews, how could God be addressed as the heavenly Father? Adam was called the son of God only because he was created by God. (2) Since words such as "offenses" and " heavenly Father" are used, we know that a father-son relationship with God still exists when sins are committed. Therefore, these are sins committed after one has been saved. (3) The sins of the Jews are not forgiven because they forgive others; they still need the sin-cleansing fountain in the future (Zech. 13:1). The forgiveness here is not the initial forgiveness of sin; rather, it refers to the forgiveness of our daily weaknesses and offenses after we have been saved. For these we need to forgive others in order to receive forgiveness from the Father. If a believer does not forgive others, he forgets that he has received forgiveness from God. God cannot allow two believers who have a disagreement with each other to enter into His kingdom. At least one, if not both, will not be able to enter.</P><P>Verse 13 tells us that since we stand for the kingdom of God and truly want to keep the teachings on the mount, we should ask God to deliver us from the hand of the evil one. "For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever." The word "for" indicates that this sentence follows the preceding passage and is very precious. We pray this and that because the kingdom, the power, and the glory all belong to God and not to Satan. "Kingdom" is the sphere in which God rules, "power" is the operation of God, and "glory" is the effulgence of God, which shines out from God Himself.</P><P>Verses 16-18: This section is on fasting. (1) Fasting is an expression of self-humbling before God. (2) Fasting is an expression of self-buffeting before God. (3) Fasting is an indication of one's seeking for God's grace. Therefore, fasting should not be abolished. However, we should do our best not to let others know. This is a matter of our purpose, intention, and motive. The "repaying," as above, is the reward.</P><P>Verses 19-34: This section is on treasures. Treasures include not only money but also clothing, food, and things precious to us.</P><P>Verse 19: "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves dig through and steal." The Greek word for rust means "eating" and is the same word as for "eating" in Romans 14:17. Therefore, rust may be literally translated "eating," meaning "consumed" or "finished." The consuming by moth refers to clothing, the consuming by rust or "eating" refers to food, and the stealing by thieves refers to money. The Lord's command is: "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth." However, this does not mean that we should use up our money and eat up our food every day. To "store up" means that we are planning to have something to depend upon.</P><P>Verse 20: "But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven." Anything that can be consumed by moth and rust or stolen by thieves is displeasing to God. God condemns idle treasures. We should not be wasteful, nor should we store up treasures on earth. To store up treasures in heaven is to give to the believers who are poor. This is made very clear in Luke. If we store up treasures in heaven, then in time of need we can go to God to make a withdrawal rather than beg. Such storing up of treasures is a changing of banks, from one on earth to one in heaven.</P><P>Verse 21: "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." When our treasures are relocated to heaven, our heart will be relocated. We need to transport our heart to heaven by distributing our treasures to others. Our treasures must go first; then our heart will follow.</P><P>Verse 22: "The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light." Every member of our body functions on behalf of the whole body. For example, a person whose eyes are blind is a blind person, even though only his eyes are defective. This verse tells us that our eyes should be single. Although we have two eyes, our eyes can focus on only one object at a time. Otherwise, we could not see clearly because there would be a seeing disorder. Some believers want to store up all their treasures on earth, but they have no peace within them. Yet they are not able to store up all their treasures in heaven either. Therefore, they try to store up a little on each side. This causes them to lose their spiritual eyesight. The Lord shows us here that we cannot make gains in both worlds. The Lord was afraid that people might not understand what He said in verse 21. Therefore, He used the word in verse 22 to explain it.</P><P>If our eyes are not single and our heart is divided between two places, we will not have light. To have light is to see clearly and to be able to make manifest (Eph. 5:13). To be full of light is to be filled with something that can make other things manifest. In other words, light is the spiritual eyesight, the spiritual vision, the spiritual view that can see accurately. Then one can see what is the way of the cross and what is a narrow way.</P><P>Verse 23: "If your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!" When our eyes are fixed on two objects and we have two desires in our heart, we no longer have spiritual eyesight. This is like a blind man walking on a narrow, winding path with deep ravines on both sides. How dangerous this is!</P><P>Verse 24: "No one can serve two masters....You cannot serve God and mammon." The Lord said, "No one can serve two masters," but the believers always seem to say that it is possible. Like the strength of the other members of the body, the strength of love is limited. If we overspend it on unimportant things, when the time comes for important things, we are without strength. If we spend our love on mammon, then when the time comes for us to spend our love on God, our love will have been exhausted. Our heart can be in only one place. The principle of mammon is contrary to the principle of God. The Chinese idiom which says that the rich are unkind does not mean that the rich are cruel, but rather, that they are selfish.</P><P>Verse 25: "Because of this, I say to you, Do not be anxious for your life, what you should eat or what you should drink; nor for your body, what you should put on." Here the Lord changed His tone. Since the Lord commanded us not to store up treasures on earth in the preceding passage, we will no doubt have questions concerning our food and clothing. The previous passage says that the way to deal with idle money is to give alms. The passage from verse 25 on speaks concerning the proper attitude toward our legitimate needs. Here the Lord mentioned food first, and then clothing. This is because our need for food is greater than our need for clothing. The problem of food is more urgent and more difficult to solve than the problem of clothing. "Therefore" has a deep meaning here because the previous passage says that we should not serve mammon. We should not be anxious even for legitimate needs such as food and clothing, for this kind of anxiety can eventually cause us to serve mammon. Life in the original language is soul, the seat of cravings and desires. The Bible in many places connects the soul with food; for example, the soul fainted because of the lack of food (Psa. 107:5).</P><P>Verses 25-34: The main subject is on not being anxious concerning food, drink, or clothing. The serving of mammon probably starts with the anxiety for food, drink, or clothing. "Is not the life more than food, and the body than clothing?" This shows that believers should have noble thoughts. "Can God...?" This is man's unbelief. Anyone who asks "Can God...?" expresses his unbelief. If we have no faith in God, it will be very difficult for us to live our daily life. All anxieties can be taken away only by believing in God. When the Lord wants us to consider, He often uses questions. God created the heavens and the earth in the first five days, and then on the sixth day He created man. God had first prepared everything that man needed, yet man still thinks as though he was created on the first day.</P><P>Verse 27: "Who among you by being anxious can add one cubit to his stature?" This is the third question that the Lord raised. In other words, since anxiety is useless, then why be anxious? If there is a remedy, there is no need to be anxious. If there is no remedy, it is useless to be anxious.</P><P>Verses 26 and 27 cover the matter of food and drink. We easily see the birds if we lift up our eyes. Therefore, the Lord said, "Look...." Verses 28-30 speak about the matter of clothing. Lilies are not common. Therefore, the Lord said, "Consider well...." Oh, how careful the Lord was! The lilies mentioned here are probably colorful. From the phrase "you of little faith" we can see that this was spoken to the saved ones. Mr. George Muller's whole life of trusting God was based on these two great promises concerning the birds and the lilies. His exercise of faith is a characteristic needed for this age.</P><P>Verse 31: "Therefore do not be anxious." "Therefore" is used here once more. This is a summary. The reason the Lord used the illustrations of the birds and of the lilies is to forbid us from being anxious and not to forbid us from working. When the Lord said to behold the birds and to consider the lilies, He was not asking us to imitate them. The Lord said through Paul, "If anyone does not want to work, neither should he eat" (2 Thes. 3:10). To "sow" and to "reap" (v. 26) is the work of men, whereas to "toil" and "spin thread" (v. 28) is the work of women.</P><P>Verse 32: "For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things." "Your heavenly Father knows" indicates that this is spoken to believers. God provides us only what we need. God will not provide us what we demand or what we ourselves would like to have.</P><P>Verse 33: "But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you." What is the kingdom? On one hand, the kingdom refers to a spiritual condition. For example, the Bible says, "The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit" (Rom. 14:17). On the other hand, the kingdom refers to the ruling in the millennium (Luke 19:11). One is the present spiritual living, and the other is the future reward. The present spiritual condition of the believers enables them to reign in the future. The emphasis of the " kingdom" here is the future.</P><P>The "righteousness" here can only be obtained by seeking. Thus we see that this is neither the justification by faith nor the righteousness of God mentioned in Romans 3. Rather, this is the righteousness in Matthew 5-7, the righteousness that surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, the righteousness mentioned in 6:1. Righteousness specifically refers to the conduct described in Matthew 5-7.</P><P>The phrase "seek...His kingdom" emphasizes not only the present spiritual condition but even more the future reward. "Added" means that you already have something, and other things are added to what you already have. Since you seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness, you obtain the kingdom of God and His righteousness; in addition, you have food, drink, and clothing. To one who has nothing, something is "given"; to one who already has something, more things are "added."</P><P>Verse 34: "Therefore do not be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself; sufficient for the day is its own evil." This shows that the Lord did not ordain believers to have a life of ease and comfort.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><P>Verses 1-5: "You...be judged" is the opposite of "you judge." Here it does not say that "you...be judged by others" but simply "you...be judged." We know that this refers to being judged by God (1 Cor. 4:4). Judgment here is not the ordinary discerning judgment or the ordinary proper opinion. (1) We need to have a proper view toward others. The Lord said clearly that the Pharisees were hypocrites (Matt. 23:13), but He also said that He did not come to judge the world (John 12:47; 3:17). Paul said that the Corinthians were not spiritual but fleshy (1 Cor. 3:1), yet in chapter four he said, "Do not judge anything" (v. 5). (2) When a matter concerns a particular person, we should let him know. Judging is not only an attitude in our heart, but sometimes it is also expressed through our mouth. Whenever someone comes to us to ask about another person, we must first find out whether the asking one has any relationship with that person. If it is just for the sake of satisfying the itching ears, then it is not necessary to answer him. If it is because he is concerned about the spiritual condition, then it is all right to tell him. The Lord told the disciples to accept the teachings of the Pharisees, but not to imitate their behavior (Matt. 23:2-3). In his last book Paul wrote concerning Alexander (2 Tim. 4:14), Demas (v. 10), Phygelus, and Hermogenes (1:15) in order to help the recipient of his letter to guard against them.</P><P>Judging here includes the following two meanings: (1) judging as a judge and (2) being critical or faultfinding.</P><P>(1) Judging as a judge. The first mentioning in the Old Testament of this kind of judgment (see Exo. 18:13-27) shows that it is a judgment carried out by the rulers or officials. "Do not judge" means do not be a judge. Therefore, a Christian should not be a government official in politics. Once he becomes a government official, he can be neither merciful nor meek. Thus, he will lose two kinds of blessings. A Christian must not even once represent the law to judge others. The result of not judging others is "that you be not judged." This does not mean that anyone who is not an official judge will not be judged before the judgment seat of Christ. Here, to be judged is to be condemned.</P><P>(2) Being critical or faultfinding. Many types of behaviors are borderline behaviors. For instance, losing one's temper is permissible, but losing one's temper and committing sin are very close. If we are not careful, we will cross over the border; if we are careless, we will step into the realm of sin. The examples of the Lord and Paul show that we should speak frankly only when it is profitable to others. Otherwise, we should not speak, especially (1) if we have some bad intention, such as being jealous of others; (2) if it is because of our sin; or (3) if it is because we do not know ourselves. The more a person knows himself, the more lenient he is on others.</P><P>Verse 2: "For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you." This verse gives the reason for not judging others. There are two principles in the Bible; one is righteousness and the other is mercy. If you choose to treat people according to righteousness, your reputation, position, and wealth will not suffer loss. You can protect yourself with righteousness. However, the result will be that "with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you." James 2:13 says, "For the judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy." If you choose the principle of mercy, which is the principle of overflowing mercy in Matthew 5, God will also measure to you with the measure of mercy. James 2:13 goes on to say, "Mercy triumphs over judgment."</P><P>Verse 3: "And why do you look at the splinter which is in your brother's eye, but the beam in your eye you do not consider?" The preceding verses say that we should not judge; the Lord exhorted people with mercy. Here it tells us that it is improper for us to judge. The preceding verses are concerned with the result in the future; this verse deals with the condition today. Here it is not a matter of whether or not one has a beam in his eye; rather, he has it. If one says that there is a splinter in another's eye, it must be that he has a beam in his own eye. Since he judges that the other has a splinter in his eye, it must be that he himself has a beam in his own eye. If one can see a splinter, which is so tiny, one should be able even more to see a beam. (1) Since you can see the splinter in your brother's eye, this shows that you are quite an expert in sinning, that you are experienced in committing sin. Therefore, it is easy for you to see even a splinter. (2) It must be that you have an improper attitude toward God. Most of the time you see the splinter in your brother's eye because you have a beam in your own eye. The more sins we have, the more critical and faultfinding we are. Here the use of the word "brother" shows that the sermon on the mountain is spoken to Christians.</P><P>Verse 4: "Or how can you say to your brother, Let me remove the splinter from your eye, and behold, the beam is in your eye?" The preceding verse is regarding the observation of another's sin, whereas this verse is regarding the exhortation concerning another's sin.</P><P>Verse 5: "Hypocrite, first remove the beam from your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the splinter from your brother's eye." The Lord said it is good to remove the splinter from another's eye. However, one should remove the beam from one's own eye first and then remove the splinter from his brother's eye.</P><P>Verse 6: This is a small, separate section. The dogs and hogs here, and especially those mentioned in 2 Peter 2:22, are the people mentioned in 2 Peter 2:21. These people are like those who stay at the entrance of the church and have received some spiritual education. They are not saved. Second Peter 2:22 described the sows as "washed." This kind of washing is merely a kind of noble concept. It is not the forgiveness of sin that we have received.</P><P>In the Bible hogs are mentioned frequently in the Old Testament, and dogs are mentioned often in the New Testament. Both hogs and dogs are unclean. Hogs have divided hoofs but do not chew the cud; dogs do not have hoofs, nor do they chew the cud. Therefore, both are unclean. Hogs superficially are better than dogs. The spiritual symbol for a Christian is a sheep. Hogs may signify the so-called church-goers, who seem to have a good outward appearance and possess some superficial knowledge of the truth, whereas dogs are those who have neither the outward nor the inward. Philippians tells us to beware of the dogs (3:2), whereas Revelation says that there are dogs in hell (22:15).</P><P>"That which is holy" belongs to God. How can man have the things that are holy? The things that are holy refer to all spiritual things, all things that are out of God. They may refer to revelations or truths, such as the truth of baptism or the truth of the breaking of bread. The "pearls" are "your pearls," referring to what you have personally received from God. The holy things are the ordinary truths that are of God; the pearls are what you have personally and specifically received and experienced. The last part of verse 6 refers to both the hogs and the dogs, and not to the hogs only.</P><P>Verses 7-12: This section enters into a new situation. Although the teachings on the mountain are all commandments, they also contain God's promises. Although they all are laws of God, they also contain God's grace. Although they all tell us what we should do, they also tell us that God gives us the strength to do it.</P><P>Verses 7-8: "Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you. For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened."</P><P>"Ask" concerning your conduct, and it shall be given to you; "seek" the kingdom and the righteousness mentioned in the preceding portion, and you will find them; "knock" on the narrow gate that leads to the constricted way, and it will be opened to you. To ask is to pray in a common way, to seek is to pray in a specific way, and to knock is to pray in a direct way. Each step is more pressing than the previous one. Verse 7 is the promise, whereas verse 8 is the principle. Verse 7 is for the individual. Verse 8 begins with "for," indicating that verse 8 should come before verse 7.</P><P>There are two practical applications of the promise in verse 7: (1) The power to practice Matthew 5-7 must be obtained by prayer. (2) All prayers of faith will receive an answer.</P><P>Verse 11: "If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those who ask Him!" Being evil is because of being born in sin. "If you then being evil...." This includes all people, for no one is good.</P><P>Chapters five through seven can be divided into three sections: (1) 5:1-20 deals with our relationship with the old law and the general characteristics of the kingdom of the heavens; (2) 5:21-7:12 deals with the Ten Commandments, the "ten words" (Exo. 34:28, ASV margin); (3) 7:13-27 gives the exhortations.</P><P>Verse 12: "Therefore" shows that this verse is a conclusion of all that was previously spoken in the second section, 5:21-7:12, which is on the ten new commandments. The teachings given on the mountain are full of practicality. Here, the phrase "all that you wish" indicates that verse 12 is a principle. Here we see that everything is positive; this is different from the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament. Here the emphasis is on what one should do. The teachings given on the mountain do not contradict the law and the prophets; rather, the teachings stand on the same line with the law and the prophets.</P><P>Verse 13: What is the difference between the "gate" here and the "door" in John 10:9? The door in John 10:9 is the door of grace, whereas the gate here is the gate of the principles of the kingdom of the heavens. "The narrow gate" is the gate to the kingdom of the heavens. This narrow gate refers to the new law presented in the preceding verses. To "enter in" is a matter of choice, and to walk on "the way" is a matter of practice. To enter in through the narrow gate is to cross the threshold, and to walk on the way is a matter related to our daily life. "Narrow" signifies the strictness of the Lord's commands. "Narrow" is a comparative term. Since the law mentioned above is the "narrow gate," there must be another law, a law that is "wider" or more lenient. From this, we see that the demand of the teachings on the mountain did not exist in the former law.</P><P>There are two gates and two ways. One is according to the inward condition, and the other is according to the outward appearance. Christians may choose to enter either of the two gates and to walk either of the two ways. The choice we have today is nothing else but choosing the principles of our life today. However, no one can walk on the constricted way without first entering in through the narrow gate. If you have not entered in through the gate mentioned in Matthew 5-7, you cannot walk on this way.</P><P>Why is entering in through the narrow gate so important? The Greek word for destruction has two meanings: one is "perdition" or "corruption," and the other is "destruction." Here it is better to render it "corruption" or "destruction." Destruction means complete ruin. Even if perdition is used, it should refer to something temporal and not eternal. It is still a wide gate and a broad way, even if there is only a requirement of an average outward morality.</P><P>Verse 14: "Because narrow is the gate and constricted is the way that leads to life, and few are those who find it." The way is constricted because it is the way of God's will. It is so narrow that it takes only God's will, and it is so constricted that it takes only God's will. Nothing of the flesh, the world, or today's glory can be brought in. "Few are those who find it." This shows that truth is usually among a small number of people. That the narrow gate and the constricted way need to be found shows that there are many people who do not even know that they exist.</P><P>The Greek word for way here in Matthew 7:14 is also used in Acts 9:2, "any who were of the Way," and 19:9, "speaking evil of the Way." The same word is also found in Acts 19:23 and 24:22. In Acts we see that people were exhorted to believe in this Way and to walk on this Way.</P><P>Verses 15-20: What kind of people are called "false prophets"? They are those who have received a special kind of inspiration. For example, those who wrote the Bible were called prophets. In 2 Peter 1:21 we are told that a prophet is one who receives inspiration and speaks forth the words of another person. A false prophet is also inspired, but not by the Holy Spirit, and he also speaks forth the words of another person, but not the words of God.</P><P>Prophets are directly related to teachings. Sheep are very timid, so the false prophets appear to be the same outwardly. "Wolves" may refer to evil spirits, because the outward sheepskins were stolen by them, and even the inward things are not their own. The "fruits" here refer to teachings. The fruits of the prophets are teachings, not conduct. Whether or not he is a false prophet is determined by what he teaches.</P><P>Figs and grapes were the best fruits among the Jews. No teachings of God can be heard from the mouth of the false prophets.</P><P>Verse 19: "Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire." These surely are people who will perish.</P><P>Verses 21-23 are of one section, verses 24-27 are of another section, and verses 28-29 are of a third section.</P><P>Verse 21: "Not every one who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens." Here the Lord told us positively that he who says "Lord, Lord" will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but not every one who says "Lord, Lord" will enter in. "Not every one." These words are crucial. Romans 10:9 says, "If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord...you will be saved." This indicates that the first condition for entering into the kingdom of the heavens is to be saved. However, not every one who is saved will enter into the kingdom of the heavens; not every Christian will participate in the kingdom of the heavens. There is a second condition; that is, those who do the will of God will enter into the kingdom of God.</P><P>The general conditions for entering into the kingdom of the heavens are, first, being saved and, second, doing the will of God. Verse 21 gives the general conditions for entering into the kingdom of the heavens. Verse 22 illustrates a particular case of exclusion. Verse 23 gives the specific consequence.</P><P>Verse 23: The Greek word for knew is the same as the word for acknowledge in Romans 7:15. There, in Romans 7:15, I do not acknowledge means "I do not consider [it] right." Here, I never knew you may be translated "I never approved of you"; that is, "I never considered what you were doing as right."</P><P>Those referred to in verses 21-23 are Christians, for the following reasons: (1) In their context these verses refer to Christians because the teachings on the mountain are spoken basically to Christians. (2) The teachings on the mountain, from the beginning to the end, never speak concerning the way of salvation, for they were spoken to those who were already saved. (3) In this section, verses 21-23, what is dealt with is not the question of faith but the question of behavior. We know that salvation is of faith and not of works. Therefore, here it is not concerned with the perishing of the unsaved. (4) Which day is "that day"? It is the day of judgment at the judgment seat of Christ. Only the saved ones can be there for this judgment. It is not the judgment at the great white throne. (5) They are people who have confessed the Lord as Lord. (6) In their work they are able to prophesy, to cast out demons, and to do works of power in the name of the Lord. "That day" is a special term used in the Bible. The "man's day" mentioned in 1 Corinthians 4:3 refers to today, the present age in which man judges. "That day" is the day of the Lord (Isa. 2:11-12; Zech. 12:9-14; 13:2; 14:1-9; 2 Tim. 1:12, 18; 4:8), referring specifically to the day of judgment at the judgment seat of Christ. Only the saved ones will be judged there.</P><P>In Matthew 7:22, the word "many" shows that a great number of people will not be able to enter into the kingdom of the heavens. "Lord, Lord." This is the second time of such calling. "In Your name...we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power." These few things are the highest gifts in the church. To prophesy is to be a prophet, to cast out demons is to bring in God's kingdom, and to do works of power is to exercise the powers of the age to come. These workers mentioned especially these few things as if to show that they were quite qualified to enter into the kingdom.</P><P>According to the original language, the first part of verse 23 may be rendered, "And then I will confess to them." In Matthew 10:32-33 the word "confess" definitely refers to the saved ones. A saved one who does not confess in the Lord but rather denies Him today will not get the glory in that day. What the Lord meant in verse 23 is that "I never confessed that I knew you." Knew here should be more properly translated "approved of." The reason that the Lord does not approve of them is that they are "workers of lawlessness." The Greek word for lawlessness means "overstepping." The workers of lawlessness are those who do not abide by the rules for entering into the kingdom of the heavens. "Depart from Me" indicates that they have no part in the glory, which is different from the glory mentioned in 2 Thessalonians 1:9. The general requirement for entering into the kingdom of the heavens is to be saved and do the will of God.</P><P>The Holy Spirit who dwells in man has a personality; He exercises control over man. However, the Holy Spirit who falls upon man is without personality; He is subject to man-the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets (1 Cor. 14:32). The Holy Spirit dwells only in the saved ones, but the Holy Spirit may fall upon an unsaved one, for example, Balaam and Saul. In casting out demons, prophesying, and doing works of power, one may still be doing lawlessness. In these things, there is still the danger of not doing God's will. The iniquity in Numbers 18:1 is an iniquity of violating the sanctuary. We need to pray that we may be delivered from this sin. The three things-prophesying, casting out demons, and doing works of power-will be restored at the end of this age.</P><P>Verses 24-27: In this section the Lord used parables to confirm what has been said before. In verse 24 the problem is not whether you have heard it, but whether you will do it. The words have been heard, but doing them is up to the individual. In a broad sense, "these words" include all the teachings given on the mountain; in a narrower sense, they refer to the words in the preceding text concerning doing God's will.</P><P>The "rock" here does not refer to the Lord; it refers to the doing of God's will. A "foolish" man is not an evil man. Even the foolish ones mentioned in Matthew 25:2 are not the unsaved ones. Here, it speaks altogether concerning the matter of building. What is beaten by the wind and the rain is the work, the conduct, of the person and not the person himself. Thus, we can see that he is a saved one. Here it does not say that the one who builds his house upon the rock is a good man; it says that he is a prudent man. This is similar to the case of the prudent virgins mentioned in Matthew 25:2.</P><P>One "who hears these words of Mine and does them" is one who does according to the words of the Lord. It is not that the foolish one does nothing, since he also goes to build something. Rather, he does not do according to the word of God but according to his own idea. One shortcoming of today's believers is that they imitate people. What is the difference between the prudent and the foolish? Both spent time and effort and both built. However, the foolish man wasted his effort by building on the sand. The prudent man fixes his eyes on the judgment seat. The rain, the river, and the wind refer to great tribulation. The rain descends from above, the wind blows from four sides, and the rivers beat upon the foundation. According to the Bible, "rain" signifies the work of the evil spirits, "wind" signifies teachings of heresy (Eph. 4:14), and "water" signifies the power of the evil spirits.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER EIGHT</H1><P>Verse 1: "And when He came down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him." This verse should immediately follow the end of chapter seven.</P><P>Verse 2: "And behold, a leper, coming near, worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me." From the other Gospels, we can see that this leper was healed before the giving of the teachings on the mountain. In contrast to the Gospel of Mark, the Gospel of Matthew was not written absolutely according to historical order.</P><P>Each writer of the Gospels has his own characteristic in arranging the order of the events. Matthew records the Lord's acts and words, whereas Mark records mostly the Lord's acts and very little of the Lord's words. This is because Mark shows the Lord as a slave. A slave should not speak too much. Mark especially uses the word "immediately," whereas Matthew especially uses the term "the kingdom of the heavens" thirty-three times. Since the word "immediately" is often used in Mark, everything recorded in the book is according to historical order. Therefore, of the four Gospels, the Gospel of Mark has the most accurate chronology of historical events. Regarding the chronological order, Mark is more accurate than Luke, and John is more accurate than Matthew. The words used quite often by John are "the next day" or "the second day." Thus, the chronological order in John is more accurate than that in Matthew.</P><P>Matthew, Mark, and Luke are concerned in particular with the events that occurred while the Lord was in Judea; John writes specifically about the events that occurred while the Lord was in Galilee. Of course, this is not absolutely so. The order in Luke is according to morality, while the order in Matthew is according to doctrine. The miracles in Mark are recorded approximately according to chronological order, as can be seen in the incident of crossing the sea in Mark 4:35-41.</P><P>The order of the events recorded in Matthew 8 (as edited by him) is as follows: (1) the cleansing of the leper, (2) the healing of the centurion's servant, and (3) the healing of Peter's mother-in-law. However, according to chronological order, they should be as follows: (1) the healing of Peter's mother-in-law, (2) the cleansing of the leper, and (3) the healing of the centurion's servant.</P><P>Why did Matthew record these events in such a way? Because the Gospel of Matthew, from the beginning to the end, intends to show people the strictness of the kingdom of the heavens. Matthew's record uses the kingdom of the heavens as the backbone, as the center, and speaks continuously along the same line. Therefore, he puts the facts together without caring for the historical order. Luke is written with morality as its goal, which is to speak forth how God grants mercy to men. Therefore, in Luke we can see God's salvation in every section. John speaks of the Lord's preaching in Galilee. Galilee is sometimes called "Galilee of the Gentiles." Therefore, John writes with the world as the criterion and eliminates all the background.</P><P>Why should "behold" be inserted at the beginning of verse 2? This is to get people's attention because what follows is a special case. For instance, even Elisha dared not to see Naaman or to get near him, but ordered him to wash himself (2 Kings 5:10). In the Old Testament there are the ordinances of how the lepers can be cleansed (Lev. 14), but here we have the healing of the leper. Therefore, verse 2 begins with " behold."</P><P>According to history, the order of the events in this chapter is as follows: (1) the healing of Peter's mother-in-law, (2) the cleansing of the leper, and (3) the healing of the centurion's servant. These events are recorded in a different way because they are types.</P><P>There were many lepers, but only one was healed. The Jews were like lepers. They all committed sin, but among the Jews, only a small remnant received grace. The servant of the centurion was a Gentile. Because Israel would not receive grace, salvation went to the Gentiles.</P><P>In Luke it was recorded that the centurion sent some elders of the Jews to entreat the Lord. This is to show that salvation was of the Jews. Matthew was written to the Jews. However, in order to show that the Gentiles can come to the Lord directly, Matthew did not mention the elders of the Jews. The leper was healed by being touched by the Lord. This shows that the Jews were related in the flesh to the Lord. The servant of the centurion was healed, but the Lord did not touch him. Rather, He spoke a word from a distance. The centurion heard it and believed, but the servant did not see the Lord. This shows that the Gentiles are saved through believing. What the Lord has ordained for us today is that we believe without seeing (John 20:29).</P><P>Leprosy signifies the filthiness of sin and refers to the Jews. Paralysis signifies the impotence of sin and refers to the Gentiles. Fever signifies the energy of the flesh in disobeying God. Sin causes man not only to be filthy but also to be impotent. Filthiness is something before God and needs to be cleansed. Weakness needs power.</P><P>Peter's mother-in-law was healed because Peter had an intimate relationship with the Lord. This shows us that after the Gentiles have received salvation, the Lord again will be gracious to Israel for the sake of Abraham and David. Fever refers to the situation of the tribulation, since tribulation is like a furnace. Matthew recorded these events in such a way to emphasize the doctrinal aspect. Verse 17 refers in particular to the millennium, because in the kingdom the power of death ceases to exist. Although death will be there, it is for the punishment of sin, because those who will be born during the millennium may not all be saved ones. Their death will be due to God's punishment.</P><P>Concerning verse 2, Spurgeon said that if someone is a leper yet he does not come to worship the Lord, his leprosy must be very serious. In Mark 9:22-23, the man said, "If you can...." It was a questioning of the Lord's power, and that is why the Lord rebuked him. Here, the leper said, "Lord, if You are willing." This is a matter of the heart. The leper did not doubt the Lord; he just did not know whether or not the Lord was willing. The Lord said, "I am willing," meaning "I am definitely willing." Thus, we can see the Lord's heart toward the sick ones.</P><P>Verse 4: "Jesus said to him, See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them." This is because at that time the law had not been abolished. Only through the death of the Lord can we be freed from the requirements of the law, as shown in Romans 7:4. At that time the Lord had not yet died; therefore, they had to follow the law.</P><P>Verses 5-10: Fever is an abnormal power; paralysis is an abnormal weakness; and leprosy is an abnormal filthiness. To have great faith is to believe in God's authority. God's authority and God's word go together. For instance, "God said, Let there be light: and there was light." God created the heavens and the earth by His authority. The Greek word for power literally means "dynamite." The Greek word for authority denotes a very marvelous power that can subdue everything. People today pay attention to power but do not care for authority. Men commit sin because they overthrow the authority of God. During the time of the great tribulation, all the people in the world will try to use their power to overthrow God's authority. Satan is what he is because he wants to overthrow the authority of God. Not only will he not submit himself to the authority of God; he also stirs people up to oppose God. However, Christ withstood Satan with authority. The sharp sword coming out of the Lord's mouth is the power behind His authority. God does not use power to directly rule over the world. Therefore, Christians today should learn to submit themselves under the authority of God.</P><P>Verses 11-13: When the Lord mentioned the kingdom of the heavens, He did not specify whether it is in the present or in the future. Some say it refers to the present age. If so, then verse 11 cannot be explained. But in chapter eleven, verses 11-12, it seems that the kingdom of the heavens is in the present age. In Matthew 5:3 it is in the future because it is related to reward.</P><P>"The kingdom of God" is mentioned five times in Matthew. God's kingdom is God's sovereign authority. There must be a difference between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens; otherwise, the Lord would not have used a different term. The kingdom of God is both today and in the future.</P><P>The way to explain the question is to first look for the facts, the phenomena, and then look for the explanation. The major sections: (1) Chapters one through four are the first major section. (2) Chapters five through seven are the second major section. (3) Chapters eight through nine are the third major section. The minor sections: 8:1-17 is divided into four small sections: (1) verses 2-4, the cleansing of the leper; (2) verses 5-13, the healing of the paralytic servant; (3) verses 14-15, the healing of the fever of Peter's mother-in-law; and (4) verses 16-17, the healing of many who were ill.</P><P>The four titles of the Lord on the earth as the Son are: (1) the Son of God, (2) the Son of Man, (3) the Son of Abraham, and (4) the Son of David. In the four small sections in chapter eight we see the Lord as the Son in four ways: (1) In the cleansing of the leper He is the Son of God-this is in relation to the Jews. (2) In the healing of the paralytic, He is the Son of Abraham-this is because of faith and because it is in relation to the Gentiles. (3) In the healing of Peter's mother-in-law, He is the Son of David-this is in relation to the Jews in the future. (4) In the casting out of demons and in the healing of all men, He is the Son of Man-this is in relation to all people.</P><P>Verse 14: "And Jesus, coming into Peter's house, saw his mother-in-law lying down and in a fever." The word "house" is one of the key words in this book. It refers to the Jews. In the Bible this word has its special significance. The same word is used in Matthew 2:11. In Matthew's record, the magi saw the Lord in the house; in Luke's record, the Lord was found in the manger by the shepherds.</P><P>The Lord healed the leper in the open air, not in a house. Coming into the house is an indication of intimate communication. Here it shows that there were only a few Jews who received salvation at the Lord's first coming. The Lord came to Peter's house to heal Peter's mother-in-law. A house is a place of intimacy and affection. This shows that all the Jews will be saved in the future. The Lord healed both the leper and Peter's mother-in-law by touching them. This indicates that the Lord has a special relationship with the Jews. Verses 16 and 17 show what the Lord will do in the coming kingdom. Matthew recorded the events in this way because the order in this book is according to doctrine.</P><P>Verse 15: "And He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served Him." The Lord's touch is powerful. Once He touches us, His power contacts our weakness. Wherever the Lord touches, Satan has no more ground.</P><P>Verse 16: "And when evening fell, they brought to Him many who were demon possessed, and He cast out the spirits with a word, and all those who were ill He healed." "Many" here means a great many, a multitude. Here the Lord cast out demons "with a word"; this is a reflection of the case where the Lord healed the paralytic by speaking a word, as seen in the second small section. This shows that the Lord is the Son of God. "Brought to Him." This is to stand in a position where one can receive the blessing of the Lord.</P><P>Verse 17: On one hand, the word spoken through Isaiah, that "He Himself took away our infirmities and bore our diseases," was fulfilled at that time when the Lord healed the sick. On the other hand, the actual fulfillment of Isaiah's word was at the time when the Lord was on the cross. There are two groups of people with two extreme views: (1) The scope of the Lord's bearing of our diseases is as wide as the scope of His bearing of our sins. (2) The Lord bears only sins but not diseases. There are errors in both of these views. The Lord today does bear our diseases, but it is different from the bearing of our sins in scope, in degree, and in significance. ("Infirmities" in this verse and "weakness" in 2 Corinthians 12:9 are the same in Greek.) For instance, we may have the same faith concerning the forgiveness of sins and the healing of diseases, yet the results today may be different. When we believe in the forgiveness of sins, our sins are forgiven. However, when we believe in the healing of our diseases, our diseases may not all be healed. The Lord's work of bearing our diseases will not be accomplished until His coming back. The actual fulfillment of verse 17 is on the cross.</P><P>Spurgeon said that every time the Lord heals a sickness, He causes His power to flow to the sick one, and He Himself bears the weakness. In the above four small sections we see the Lord's power and man's intention.</P><P>The section from 8:18 through 9:8 is the second minor section of the third major section.</P><P>Verse 18: "Now when Jesus saw a crowd around Him, He gave orders to depart to the other side." When there were too many people, the Lord always departed. This is the Lord's way. He did not want the curious ones to draw near to Him. On "the other side" there was no one. The Lord was not reluctant to let go of people. Paying attention to people, gaining people for ourselves, and paying attention to having a crowd are great problems to our work. "Depart to the other side." This is the best principle for our work. When we work, we should not try to gain people for ourselves. This is the Lord's work. Once the work is done, we should leave immediately. If we remain, it will be nothing but "strange fire," and perhaps there will be more of man's attraction than of God's command.</P><P>Verses 19-20: The scribe here represents one who is zealous. He came of his own free will and seemingly without condition to follow the Lord. But the Lord told him that He did not have the comfort that the birds and the foxes had. This means that what the Lord had as an enjoyment was inferior to what the birds and the foxes had. Then the scribe withdrew after learning of the hardship involved. Therefore, one can never follow the Lord if he has not counted the cost. The scribe indeed represents those who care only for the building up of themselves. The scribe was not willing to sacrifice himself.</P><P>Verse 21: "And another of the disciples said to Him, Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father." "Disciples" are those who have already been called. "Bury my father" is the duty of a son. However, this one had been called yet shrank back.</P><P>Verse 22: "But Jesus said to him, Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead." The first "dead" refers to the dead mentioned in Ephesians 2:1. Here, the Lord has a demand that is more important than burying one's father. Burying one's father can be done by someone else. This demonstrates the principle that the Lord's calling is above everything else. The Lord would not allow anything besides Himself to have control over us or put a demand on us. "Permit me first...." This is a great mistake. The Lord's calling should certainly be above all things.</P><P>The difference between these two is that one does not count the cost, whereas the other overly counts the cost. In the matter of following the Lord, it would be foolish and improper not to count the cost at all. However, it would also be improper to always count the cost and dare not move forward. We should avoid these two extreme mistakes. If the Lord wants us to go, we should count the cost and tell the Lord, "I am willing"; we should let go of everything else. The pathway of obedience takes obedience, not the waiting for problems to be solved, as the end. "Follow Me" is the solution to the problem of "burying the father." If someone has been called by the Lord, although he may consider withdrawing, the Lord will still say to him, "Follow Me."</P><P>Verses 19 through 22 are an inserted section. A similar case is recorded in Luke, but that is probably a different event.</P><P>Verses 24-27: Their prayer was "save us," and the reason was "we are perishing." Because they realized that they would perish, they said, "Lord, save us." Because of their little faith, they said, "Lord, save us." Because of their cowardice, they said, "We are perishing!" Little faith is somewhat better, and somewhat more advanced, than no faith at all.</P><P>In the midst of His busyness, the Lord was still teaching His disciples. It was easier to deal with the winds and the waves than it was to deal with the disciples. All fear and cowardice are due to unbelief. Faith comes from the word of God. The Lord rebuked the disciples for having little faith because He already had said to "depart to the other side." (This is a command as well as a promise.) Yet they still said, "We are perishing!" This shows that they did not believe the Lord when He told them to "depart to the other side." It seems that they thought that the Lord had told them to depart to the bottom of the sea. The Lord's word is linked to faith. From this we see that many prayers are a sign of little faith. It does not mean the more prayer, the better.</P><P>The word "arose" is used twice in this section: "There arose a great tempest in the sea" and "Then He arose...and there was a great calm." Furthermore, "great" is in contrast to "little"-"great calm," "little faith."</P><P>In verses 2-17 several miracles are specifically put together. Verses 18-27 are a record showing the effect of the Lord's presence. The winds and the sea were rebuked. This means that they must have had some consciousness. However, the winds and the sea by themselves have no consciousness; the Lord was rebuking the demons behind the winds and the sea. The winds and the sea always come before a spiritual battle begins.</P><P>Verse 28: This verse is a fulfillment of what the Lord said in verse 18 concerning departing to the other side. This portion mentions that there were two possessed by demons, but Luke's record mentions only one. All of Luke's records are more detailed than Matthew's, especially concerning the sick ones, because Luke himself was a medical doctor. For example, Matthew 8:2 mentions "a leper," but Luke, in 5:12, says "a man full of leprosy." Concerning this particular case of being possessed by demons, Luke's record says that a certain man was possessed by a legion of demons (Luke 8:30). Because Luke was a medical doctor, he had his own observation concerning the sick ones.</P><P>Luke recorded only one possessed by demons for the following reasons: (1) Since the two were the same, it was enough to record only one. (2) Luke did not directly follow the Lord. What he wrote was based on what he had investigated. Therefore, he recorded only the events he had examined. (3) Matthew portrayed the Lord as King. Therefore, he often recorded two, that is, in plurality. On the other hand, Luke showed the Lord as man. For a man, it is sufficient to give the account of one. (4) The Gospel of Matthew is written to the Jews. According to the Jewish regulations, for a testimony there must be two people. On the other hand, the Gospel of Luke is written to the Gentiles. Since there is no such regulation among the Gentiles, there is no need to record two. (5) The emphasis of Matthew is on doctrine. Therefore, he did not record the rest of the things related to the person himself. On the other hand, the emphasis of Luke is on morality. Hence, he gave a detailed account of the person himself. "Coming out of the tombs." Those who are demon possessed are neighbors to the dead ones.</P><P>Verse 29: "They cried out, saying, What do we have to do with You, Son of God? Have you come here before the time to torment us?" Although the demons are wicked, they still confess that the Lord is the Son of God. Therefore, in this respect they are better than some human beings. "Before the time." In the original text the definite article "the" indicates a specific time. The demons know the time of their torment. This gives us a hint that God has appointed a time for the demons to be tormented.</P><P>Verse 30: "Now there was, a good way off from them, a herd of many hogs feeding." The Lord did not respond to the demons. The less we speak to the demons the better.</P><P>Verse 32: "And He said to them, Go! And they came out and went into the hogs. And behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and they died in the waters." The Lord spoke only one word, "Go!" The hogs rushed into the sea on their own because they would not tolerate being possessed by the demons. In this respect, they are better than human beings.</P><P>Verse 33: "And those who were feeding them fled and went away into the city and reported everything, including what had happened to those possessed by demons." Spurgeon said that when false believers die, the pastor would flee into the city to report to people the terrifying news.</P><P>Verse 34: "The whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they entreated Him to depart from their borders." The people entreated the Lord to depart from their borders. This is the same as the request of the demons. The Lord never forces people, so He departed from them.</P><P>Chapters eight through twelve, constituting the third major section, describe how the King manifested Himself and how He was rejected by men. In 8:2-17 we see the Lord as the Son in four different ways. In 8:18-9:8, which is the second minor section, the Lord's authority is manifested in four aspects: the aspect of nature, the aspect of demons, the aspect of men, and the aspect of the believers. These four things reveal man's heart to man. These four sections reveal mainly two things: (1) the Lord's power and (2) the intent of man's heart. Verses 35-38 of chapter nine should be placed at the beginning of chapter ten. Matthew 9:9-34, the third minor section, speaks of how Christ shows mercy to man. The second minor section shows us the authority of Christ.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER NINE</H1><P>Verse 1:"And stepping into a boat, He crossed over and came to His own city." The city was Capernaum.</P><P>Verse 2:"And behold, they brought to Him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Take courage, child; your sins are forgiven." Mark 2:1 says that people heard that the Lord was at home, so they brought the paralytic to Him. The account of Matthew is more simple because he presents the Lord as the King. Therefore, he does not record the trivial things or the details. Rather, he writes with a style of broadness. This verse shows us wherever the Lord is, He cannot be hidden.</P><P>"Jesus, seeing their faith." Faith is something that can be seen. The Lord had manifested His authority among the disciples, He had manifested His authority in the realm of nature, and He had manifested His authority among the demons. If the Lord can manifest His authority among sinners, then the demonstration of His authority is completed. All foundations are overthrown. Therefore, He must deal with sinners. Hence, 9:1-8 and chapter eight are inseparable. " Take courage." If your sins are not forgiven, you cannot take courage. By reading the Old Testament, the scribes knew the doctrine concerning forgiveness of sins, yet they did not know the actual forgiveness of sins. They had the teaching of forgiveness but not the experience of forgiveness.</P><P>Verse 3:"Some of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes." This was the first rejection of the Lord. The scribes' heart was exposed by what the Lord did.</P><P>Verse 4:"And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why are you thinking evil things in your hearts?" The Lord is not slack with regard to the thoughts in our hearts. Therefore, we need to pray that the meditation of our hearts may be acceptable to God (Psa. 19:14).</P><P>Verse 5:"For which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and walk?" On the Lord's side, both are easy. The Jews thought in their hearts that it was easy for the Lord to speak words such as "your sins are forgiven." However, by telling the man to "rise and walk," the Lord wanted to prove that His forgiveness of sins was a sure thing.</P><P>Verse 6:"But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins-then He said to the paralytic, Rise, take up your bed and go to your house." The Lord's enabling the paralytic to rise and walk shows that the Lord's words are trustworthy. If what is seen is true, then what is not seen also is true.</P><P>Verse 7:"And he rose and went away to his house." The great principle of the gospel is first forgiveness and then walking. The sinner cannot go to the Lord, but the sinner can go from the Lord. In the Old Testament the principle is to walk and live; in the New Testament it is to live and walk. One is by works; the other is by grace.</P><P>Verse 8:"And when the crowds saw this, they feared and glorified God, who had given such authority to men." Prior to Matthew 16, the Lord never called Himself the Son of God. Rather, after the temptation, He always called Himself the Son of Man.</P><P>The strongest part of the backbone of the entire Gospel of Matthew is found in chapter sixteen. Although the Lord did not reveal who He was, people could tell who He was from what He did. In chapter sixteen, after Peter had confessed the Lord as the Son of God and the Christ, the Lord began to speak of His death and resurrection.</P><P>The people's glorifying God here is altogether different from the believers' glorifying God, since those people had not repented.</P><P>Verses 9-13:This small section manifests God's grace. Now it is the Lord Himself who came to seek man. Other Gospels give more details concerning the calling of Matthew. As a whole, because Matthew presented the Lord as the King, he did not record the trivial things. In particular, because Matthew was the author of this book, he did not want to reveal too many details related to himself.</P><P>Verse 9:"He saw a man...called Matthew." According to the way this verse was written, it seems to indicate that before that time Matthew had never met the Lord. When the Lord called him, he followed immediately. There must have been something special either in the Lord's voice or in His eyes that caused people to be willing to follow Him. The Lord did not say, "Believe in Me"; rather, He said, "Follow Me." This is because believing in the Lord is included in following the Lord. The Christian life is a life of following the Lord. Christ requires us not only to believe but also to follow, that is, to do the will of God in the way of the cross. To follow the Lord is to partake of the Lord's tribulation, kingdom, and endurance (Rev. 1:9). To endure is not to use our own strength. God cannot use those who only believe in the Lord and do not follow the Lord.</P><P>Verse 10:"And as He was reclining at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and reclined together with Jesus and His disciples." This feast was prepared by Matthew (Luke 5:29).</P><P>Verse 11:"And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?" Although men themselves are not righteous, they like to see God deal with man according to righteousness. Because men do not know the grace of God, they blame God for showing grace to people. Therefore, an attitude of being gracious is often criticized and blamed.</P><P>Verse 12:"Now when He heard this, He said, Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill." The Lord's word here implies that the tax collectors and sinners knew their own position and therefore drew near to the Lord, but that the Pharisees were self-righteous and therefore blamed the Lord for being gracious toward the tax collectors and sinners.</P><P>Verse 13:"But go and learn what this means, `I desire mercy and not sacrifice,' for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners." The only "righteous" people in the world are the self-righteous, as were the Pharisees. Mercy is part of grace. Grace comes only from above. However, men do not like to receive grace; they prefer to give something, such as a sacrifice, to God. God desires that man come just as he is to receive grace. This is the only ground of fellowship. (To repent is to expose one's real condition, to simply admit what one is.) Here it shows that men many times condemn grace. Although the Lord has dealings with sinners, the Bible says that He is separated from sin. Therefore, only those who are separated from sin may draw near to sinners.</P><P>In the foregoing section, in the calling of Matthew, the Lord replied to the protest of the Pharisees. From 9:14 on, the Lord answered the protest of John's disciples.</P><P>Verse 14:"Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?" John somewhat practiced asceticism.</P><P>Verse 15:"And Jesus said to them, The sons of the bridechamber cannot mourn as long as the Bridegroom is with them, can they? But days will come when the Bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast." " Taken away" refers to the Lord's being rejected, not to His ascension. The Lord's ascension was for Him to receive glory, so there was no need for the disciples to fast. Therefore, here His being taken away does not refer to His ascension. The "Bridegroom" was the Lord, and the "sons of the bridechamber" were the disciples. Later, the disciples will become the bride. In the transitional period, the Lord considered His disciples as the sons of the bridechamber. The Lord was taken away from them as a result of the Jews' rejection of Him.</P><P>Verse 16:"No one puts a patch of unfulled cloth on an old garment, for that which fills it up pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made." Here the "unfulled cloth," or the "new cloth," signifies the outward living, whereas the "new wine" signifies the inward life. A garment is exposed on the outside, and wine ferments within. One is the living and the other is life. One is objective and the other is subjective. The New Testament gospel gives an outward living and conduct to man as a new cloth and imparts an inward life into man as new wine.</P><P>The regulations and ordinances of the law are like the old garment; fasting is one of them. To mix the new and the old is to use the gospel to help the law. The best that this can do is to patch, but it can also cause a tear. For example, circumcision is an important matter. However, Galatians shows us that there is no need for circumcision. Romans says that man cannot be justified by the law; Galatians says that man cannot be sanctified by the law. Just as the law is unable to justify man, so it is unable to sanctify man. This is precisely what the Lord teaches here. The law in the aspect of commandments is one thing, and the law in the aspect of principle is another thing. The commandments of the law were complemented by the Lord, but the principle of the law was put aside by Him. In the Epistles, the phrase " by faith" should be rendered " by the principle of faith"-for example, " The righteous shall have life and live by the principle of faith" (Rom. 1:17; Gal. 3:11).</P><P>Verse 17:"Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out, and the wineskins are ruined; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved." Wine here refers to the inward life. "New wine" means that the fermenting power has not ceased. The life that the Lord put in us is like the new wine. The old wineskins signify the ordinances of the law. When the new wine is put into old wineskins, "the wineskins burst." For example, one who has the new life cannot keep the Old Testament law of "an eye for an eye"; hence, it bursts. Therefore, putting the new life given by the Lord into the old ordinances of the law will cause them to burst.</P><P>In Matthew 5-7 we see not only the fresh wineskins but also the fresh wineskins with new wine. The outward commandments are the highest expression of our inward life. Matthew 5-7 reveals what we have received within to show us that we can do the things mentioned therein. The old wine signifies the fleshly life. "Both are preserved"; that is, both the new wine and the old wineskin are preserved. This means that when the law is put aside, it is preserved.</P><P>Verse 18:"As He was speaking these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshipped Him, saying, My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live." Matthew does not tell us that the name of the ruler of the synagogue is Jairus (Mark 5:22), nor does he tell us in the previous chapter, that the name of the demon possessed man is Legion (Luke 8:30). Matthew seldom mentions names, because he presents the Lord as the King. It is not necessary to mention names, since they are insignificant before the Lord. The name Jairus means "the enlightening one."</P><P>Matthew says that the daughter "has just died," whereas Luke says that she "was dying." This is because Matthew records the situation after her death, and Luke narrates her condition from the beginning. Each Gospel has its own characteristic, and it records only the aspect that is related to its characteristic. The Gospel of Luke is written for the Gentiles; hence, it mentions only the things that are related to this aspect. On the other hand, because the Gospel of Matthew is written to the Jews, it stresses the aspect of doctrine and therefore uses this event as a type of the Jews' death and their future restoration.</P><P>Verse 20:"And behold, a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years approached from behind and touched the fringe of His garment." The daughter who had just died was twelve years old, and the woman here had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years. This shows that the year the daughter was born is the first year that the woman began to suffer from the hemorrhage. This signifies that when the Jews were receiving grace, the Gentiles had nothing to do with God. The woman with the hemorrhage signifies the Gentiles. A hemorrhage indicates the extermination of life. The Gentiles are like dead dogs. The daughter's death signifies the Jews' initial rejection of the Lord. Here, the Lord had no intention to heal the woman with the hemorrhage; rather, He intended to go to Jairus's house. But on the way, out of convenience, He healed the woman. This signifies that the Lord is for the Jews, but since the Jews reject Him, the Gentiles are blessed.</P><P>The resurrection of the daughter signifies the millennium; this is the grafting again of the natural branches into their own olive tree, as mentioned in Romans 11:23. In resurrecting Jairus's daughter, the Lord "took hold of her hand." This is similar to His healing of the leper by touching him. However, in the healing of the woman with a hemorrhage, it was the woman who touched the fringe of the Lord's garment; this is faith.</P><P>Verse 21:"For she said within herself, If only I touch His garment, I will be healed." Faith requires the word of God. Here, the clause "she said within herself" seems to indicate that it was a kind of psychological reaction within her. However, she did not ask the Lord to touch her, for she believed that "if only I touch His garment...." This was an indication of her faith. "Only" is a word of comparison. Perhaps she heard that Jairus had asked the Lord to lay His hand on his daughter and that the Lord was willing to go. Thus, she believed. Therefore, it was not just a guessing within her.</P><P>Verse 22: "And Jesus, turning and seeing her, said, Take courage, daughter; your faith has healed you. And the woman was healed from that hour." "From that hour." These are Matthew's own words; the incident itself ends with "your faith has healed you." "Hour" refers to the time of the entire incident. The reason that the Lord told her, "Your faith has healed you," was to give her a word to prepare her to be able to resist any future temptation or attack. Here Matthew's record is again very brief. This is his characteristic.</P><P>Matthew 8-9 has a total of ten miracles. In the entire book there are sixty-five quotations from the Old Testament.</P><P>Verses 23-25:The Lord said that "the girl...is sleeping"; He did not say that all those who die are sleeping. " The crowd making a commotion." People in the world cannot render any help to the living, but they render a great deal of help to the dead. "The crowd had been put out." It seems that the Lord gave the order to put out all those who believed that the girl was dead. The dead must be shut out of the gate of life.</P><P>Verses 27-28:"Do you believe that I am able to do this? They said to Him, Yes, Lord."</P><P>Verses 29-30:Here it was the opening of the eyes; later it was the opening of the mouth (v. 33). This is a picture of the millennium (Isa. 35:5-6).</P><P>Verse 31:"But they went out and spread reports about Him in all that land." The most important thing in doing spiritual work is obedience. Otherwise, we may cause damage to the Lord's work.</P><P>Verses 32-34:This shows the Jews' rejection of the Lord.</P><P>The healing of the woman with the hemorrhage and the raising up of Jairus's daughter have a doctrinal, dispensational significance. The death of the daughter signifies the death of the Jews; the healing of the hemorrhaging woman signifies the salvation of the Gentiles; and the raising up of the daughter signifies the restoration of the Jews. In the other Gospels, the emphasis of the record of these incidents is on the moral aspect. When the Jews will be willing to confess the Lord as the Son of David, the Messiah, their eyes will be opened and their mouths will speak. This also has a doctrinal significance.</P><P>Matthew 9:35-10:42 is the third minor section of the third major section. This section records the Lord's sending out of the disciples after He had been rejected.</P><P>Verse 35:"And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness." The reason for the sending out is that there were too many cities and villages. After working among the people, the Lord saw their need. Therefore, He sent forth the disciples. The gospel of the kingdom of the heavens includes the gospel of grace plus the powers of the age to come.</P><P>Verse 36:"And seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and cast away like sheep not having a shepherd." The Lord "was moved with compassion for them" because they were harassed and cast away. The Lord was not sympathetic toward their sins, for sins need His redemption. The Lord sympathized with their being harassed. He not only deals with sins but also shows compassion toward our distressed condition. God sent the Lord not only to be our Savior because of our sins but also to be our Shepherd, to be a Friend of sinners, because of our distress.</P><P>Verse 37:" Then He said to His disciples, The harvest is great, but the workers few." The nation of Israel as a whole rejected the Lord, but individually speaking, there were still a great number who needed reaping. The workers are those who labor and toil. Although the harvest is great, not many workers can endure the hardships in laboring and toiling.</P><P>Verse 38:" Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest." Here we see a great spiritual principle: In His heart the Lord intended to send out the disciples, yet He first would ask the disciples to beseech Him for the thrusting out of workers, and then He would carry out the sending.</P><P>The chain of prayer is as follows: (1) A certain matter is of God; (2) man prays concerning it; and (3) God works to accomplish His will. In answering prayers, God is accomplishing His own will. For that reason, Gordon Watt said that prayer is the laying of tracks for God's will to run on.</P><P>The Lord asked the disciples to beseech Him to thrust out workers. Afterward, those who were thrust out were the disciples themselves. When we pray to God for a certain matter, we ourselves must first be prepared to be willing to do it. If God cannot change those who pray, He cannot change those who are prayed for. If we ourselves are not ready to be sent by God, we should not expect God to send others.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER TEN</H1><P>Verse 1:"And He called His twelve disciples to Him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they would cast them out and heal every disease and every sickness." "Gave them authority." This refers to the powers of the age to come. The Lord wants the disciples to preach the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens, so He does the things of the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Verses 2-4:There were twelve apostles divided into six pairs: Simon and Andrew, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew, James and Thaddaeus, and Simon and Judas. The arrangement in Luke 6 is a little different because the emphasis there is on the selecting; Luke 9 is on the sending.</P><P>Peter means "a rock." Most likely Bartholomew was Nathanael. "Matthew the tax collector." Only in this Gospel is Matthew specifically designated "the tax collector." Matthew recorded this in remembrance of his salvation. It seems that he was writing this with tears. "Betrayed Him" may be rendered "delivered Him up." Some say "Iscariot" is Issachar. Issachar means "one who is exchanged for a price" (Gen. 30:18). Therefore, Judas Iscariot can be rendered "Judas the trader." Judas was good at doing business; he treated his Teacher as goods. Iscariot means "a man of Kerioth." Kerioth was the name of a place in Judah. Among the twelve apostles, only Judas was from Judea; all the rest were Galileans.</P><P>Verses 5-6:Their going out this time was to work entirely among the children of Israel. Although the Israelites rejected the Lord, He still sent forth His disciples to preach the gospel of the kingdom to them. Here "Israel" includes all the twelve tribes. Why does it say "the lost sheep of the house of Israel"? Because in God's eyes, in a sense, Israel is lost.</P><P>Verses 7-8:"Heal the sick...cast out demons." These are powers of the age to come. "Freely give." This means that the spiritual power of the gospel is not sold for money.</P><P>Verses 9-10:Here the word "sandals" is plural. The word for "worker" is the same as that in 9:37-38, but it is singular here.</P><P>Verse 11:"And into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and there remain until you depart." "Who in it is worthy" means "who in it is suitable."</P><P>Verse 14:"And whoever does not receive you nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet." To "shake off the dust from your feet" is to show that you have nothing to do with any place that rejects Christ.</P><P>Verse 15:"Truly I say to you, It will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city." This shows us that God's punishment is in varying degrees. Rejecting Christ will result in a more severe punishment than committing many serious sins.</P><P>The Lord told the disciples to go out without money or bag or sandals or a staff. This principle applies to going to the house of Israel, not to the Gentiles. The principle of preaching to the Gentiles is "taking nothing from the Gentiles" (3 John 7). Either receive the provision from the believers, or provide for your own needs. This way of going out without money or staff to the house of Israel also has a time limit (Luke 22:35-38).</P><P>Here, according to the text, we also realize that this is not the principle in preaching the gospel to the Gentiles: (1) Verse 5 clearly says, "Do not go into the way of the Gentiles." (2) "Find out who in it is worthy" (v. 11). To preach the gospel to the Gentiles is to preach to those who are unworthy. (3) "If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it" (v. 13). Since the Gentiles were not yet reconciled to God, how could there be a house for which they could plead peace?</P><P>Here are several principles that can be applied today to the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles: (1) freely receiving and freely giving, (2) trusting in the Lord to supply our needs, and (3) taking nothing from those who do not receive salvation.</P><P>Verse 16:"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be therefore prudent as serpents and guileless as doves." Here, the Lord mentioned not only the serpents but also the doves. The Lord did not say that we should be like serpents; rather, He said that we should be prudent as serpents. This means that we should not provoke others in a senseless way that causes us to suffer loss. To be guileless is to be harmless. The meaning here is that in the midst of the evil ones we need to be prudent, lest we be hurt senselessly; however, neither should we try to make gains for ourselves by hurting others.</P><P>Verses 17-20:The apostles would suffer persecution.</P><P>Verse 21: "And brother will deliver up brother to death, and father his child; and children will rise up against their parents and put them to death." For the sake of the gospel we must break the closest relationships we have on this earth. Because of the Lord's greatness men will rise up against us.</P><P>Verse 22:"And you will be hated by all because of My name. But he who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved." There are many people who are hated by others, but how many are hated because of the Lord's name? If there is no tribulation, there is no joy. There is nothing on earth that gives people joy more than tribulations (Rom. 5:3). If one does not have a heart to obey the Lord, he cannot suffer for the Lord. "He who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved." This is very different from Acts 16:31. The latter is spoken to sinners, the former, to workers. Here, to be saved may mean to be saved from the wicked ones, or it may mean to be saved in the kingdom age, that is, to receive a reward in the millennium. Here, most probably it refers to receiving the reward.</P><P>The three aspects of salvation are: (1) in the present age, (2) in the kingdom age, and (3) in the new heaven and new earth.</P><P>Verse 23:"And when they persecute you in this city, flee into another. For truly I say to you, You shall by no means finish the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes." "Flee." This is the principle for Christians in suffering persecution. It is to flee, not to resist. It is wrong to say that this verse means that the Son of Man would come back before the disciples had finished the cities of Israel. In fact, when the twelve disciples went forth to preach the gospel, they were not persecuted in such a way. Rather, many people followed them. Therefore, according to history, these things are not yet fulfilled. If we compare the situation here to that in Matthew 24, they are quite similar. Therefore, this word here refers to the great tribulation.</P><P>This was the first time the Lord sent the disciples to preach the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens to the Jews. After His resurrection He sent the disciples to preach the gospel of grace. During the great tribulation, the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens will again be preached, because after the fullness of the Gentiles comes, God will prepare the Jews for the kingdom. We may thus see that God's order is: from the Jews, to the Gentiles, and then back to the Jews.</P><P>Verse 24:"A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a slave above his master." This refers specifically to sufferings.</P><P>Verse 25:"It is sufficient for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of His household!" The Lord was reproached to the uttermost. No matter how much a Christian suffers, he could not suffer more than the Lord. This gives us comfort, for the Lord knows all that we may encounter on the earth. He tells us that our sufferings are, at most, the same as His. In the name Beelzebul, Beel means either "fly" or "house," and zebul means "king" or "lord." In other words, Beelzebul means "the king of flies" or "the king of the house." Demons possess the human body, considering it as a house; they occupy the human body as the king of the house. People revile the Lord by calling Him the king of flies, and they call us lunatics.</P><P>In this portion of the Word the Lord shows us that we should not expect people to treat us well on this earth. Every time we are misunderstood, persecuted, or despised, we should remember how people treated our Lord. It is sufficient for us if we become like Him.</P><P>Verse 26:"Therefore do not fear them; for there is nothing covered which will not be revealed, and hidden which will not be made known." The word spoken here gives a principle, a formula, and does not refer to any specific situation. It is the same as Matthew 7:8.</P><P>Verse 27:"What I say to you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear in the ear, proclaim on the housetops." The word spoken here is a detailed explanation and an application of verse 26. It is just like Matthew 7:7, which is a detailed explanation and an application of Matthew 7:8. Matthew 7:8 is a principle and for that reason it begins with the word "for." So it is in this section. Because of verse 26, we should practice the proclaiming mentioned in verse 27.</P><P>On the one hand, verse 26 explains the reason for not fearing. This word has two meanings: (1) What you secretly hold fast for the Lord, even if you are misunderstood to the extent that you are considered the king of demons, will be out in the open one day, for God will make it manifest. (2) The hidden hatred, jealousy, evil plots, and sins in man will also be revealed one day.</P><P>On the other hand, verse 26 states that there is such a principle. Therefore, the Lord speaks the word in verse 27. No one can be a Christian in secret. Because of such a principle given in verse 26, it is most foolish to be a Christian in secret. No Christian who denies the Lord can enter into the kingdom. We may thus see that verse 26 connects the section before with the section following.</P><P>Verse 28:"And do not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna." Those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul are people who are used by Satan. The greatest harm Satan can do is to kill man's body only. To "kill the soul" is to cause man to have no enjoyment. "Destroy," or "corrupt," refers to the suffering of punishment in the kingdom age. From verse 28 on, we know that if one commits sins after being saved, he will still receive punishment in the kingdom age, a punishment which is like that of Gehenna. "Do not fear those" here is the same as "do not fear them" in verse 26.</P><P>Verse 29:"Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion? And not one of them will fall to the earth apart from your Father." "An assarion" may be accurately rendered "a penny," meaning the least expensive. "Without your Father's permission" [this is the Chinese Mandarin Version's rendering for "apart from your Father"-Translator's note] is different from "unless your Father permits." "Without permission" implies the involvement of other parties-when men or demons try to harm us, God, who is beside us, will not give them permission. On the other hand, "your Father permits" may indicate that the Father voluntarily permits something to happen to us; it seems that God is the One who initiates it. Madam Guyon said that everything that happens to us in our environment is permitted by God. However, Jessie Penn-Lewis said that Madam Guyon was in danger of falling into passivity.</P><P>God remembers things that are so small because He cares about the smallest things, He is the greatest One. The most powerful person is also one who is most able to endure.</P><P>Verse 30:"But even the hairs of your head are all numbered." Concerning us, nothing is too small for Him to care for. The number of our hairs recorded in heaven is the same as the actual number of hairs we have. A widow once moved into a small upper room. She asked God for a carpet that was the size of her room. Eventually, someone gave her a carpet together with frying pans and skewers. She confessed that she had forgotten to pray for the last two things. Yet God had not forgotten them. This is the principle of God's counting our hairs.</P><P>Verse 31:"Therefore do not fear; you are of more value than many sparrows." From this we see that even in the smallest things God is not vague about what He wants to do with His believers. Once a couple was crossing the sea together. The wife was frightened, but the husband watched the storm with calmness. His attitude so agitated her that she scolded him. The husband therefore took a knife and gestured to kill her, but the wife was not at all alarmed. The husband asked why she was not afraid. The wife answered that it was because the knife was in his hand. The husband then explained to the wife that he was not afraid of the storm because he knew that the storm was in the hand of God the Father.</P><P>Verses 32-33:"Every one therefore who will confess in Me before men, I also will confess in him before My Father who is in the heavens; but whoever will deny Me before men, I also will deny him before My Father who is in the heavens." This is a great principle. Therefore, we should witness and go forth to preach the gospel. The mistake of the believers today is that the more people oppose, the less they dare to witness. When should the lamp be lit? Does it not shine in the darkness? Should the lamp rest because the darkness is too great? What is the use of the lamp after the day breaks? God wants us to confess with our mouth. Surely our conduct also is important. But the attempt to substitute our conduct for witnessing with our mouth is not a doctrine from God. If a Christian is excluded from the kingdom, it is his own doing.</P><P>Verse 34:"Do not think that I have come to bring peace on the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword." The word for sword has the same meaning as that in Luke 2:35, which says, "a sword will pierce through your own soul," referring in particular to the emotions. "Peace" here means reconciliation, security, harmony. Since men are not reconciled to God, they are not reconciled to God's children. The Lord's coming causes every believer to suffer the pain of "a sword."</P><P>Verse 35:"For I have come to set men at variance: a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law." Here is a requirement of love which is greater than loving our parents. This shows us that while we live on this earth we cannot keep peace with those who oppose Christ. If we can, it must be that we have some problem with the Lord.</P><P>Verse 36:"And a man's enemies will be those of his household." The reason here is that the Lord is their enemy. This is the issue of their jealousy. A man cannot love two persons at the same time. If he does, the loved ones will become jealous. Our loving the Lord makes others jealous.</P><P>Verse 37:"He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me." The Lord requires us to give Him all; if we give just a little less than all, it will not do. This is not a relative love but an absolute love. Our loving the Lord has to be to the extent that it causes us pain; only this kind of love will make us joyful. If we love the Lord yet do not have joy, we have not loved the Lord to the extent of giving us pain. When we are bearing the cross, that is exactly the time that we can sing. There is a line of a hymn that says, "I am captivated by the goal." If we are so satisfied with what we obtain from men, we cannot see the preciousness of what the Lord gives. If we are too close to men, we cannot sense the preciousness of the Lord's closeness.</P><P>The word "worthy" should first be applied to the Lord. Is the Lord worthy of our love? It is altogether a matter of whether or not the Lord is worthy. It is not how much we give up for the Lord, but whether or not He is worthy of our service. If we think it is a great thing for a prince to preach the gospel, we still do not know the Lord's honor and glory. Our Lord is worthy! He is worthy to receive service from all the outstanding men in this world. The Lord is qualified to receive men's absolute, complete, and unlimited love! If we do not love Him, He is colder than we are. Work always follows love. If we do not have an absolute love toward the Lord, the Lord will never commit the care of His sheep to us.</P><P>Verse 38:"And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me." Loving the Lord is the Lord's unique requirement. To love the Lord, one must deny himself. The Lord did not mention His own cross. When He was baptized, the Lord already counted Himself to have been crucified. Therefore, here it speaks of taking the cross. To be crucified is a once-for-all matter-in His crucifixion the Lord carried us. Taking the cross is a daily matter-in our taking of the cross we carry Him. What does it mean to take the cross? It means that we submit to God from our heart. In the garden of Gethsemane the Lord determined to fulfill the Father's will; then He went forth to take the cross. Therefore, to take the cross is to determine that we want only to do God's will.</P><P>Verse 39:"He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it." In Greek lose is a kindred word of perish. "Finds his soul-life" is in the present age; "shall lose it" refers to the future. "Loses his soul-life for My sake" is in the present age; "shall find it" refers to the future. Thus, the condition is the same, and the only difference is in time.</P><P>In other Gospels, instead of the word find, the word save is used (Mark 8:35; Luke 9:24). The Greek word for soul-life means "soul." To find the soul-life is to allow the soul to have its enjoyment and pleasures today and not allow it to suffer. Since finding the soul-life is explained in this way, losing the soul-life must be explained in the opposite way. To lose the soul-life is to cause the soul to have no enjoyment or pleasure so that you feel that you suffer loss. This is the suffering of loss mentioned in 1 Corinthians 3. A believer once said that if one does not feel he is suffering loss, he is not really suffering loss. Therefore, to suffer loss here must be something that can be felt. Hence, to "lose" means to be dissatisfied, whereas to "find" means to be satisfied. The salvation of the soul is fundamentally different from the salvation of the spirit.</P><P>Verse 40:"He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who has sent Me." It is only when we take up the cross to follow the Lord that He would consider those who receive us as receiving Him and those who receive Him as receiving the Father. The Lord and the Father have such a union.</P><P>Verse 41:What is mentioned here is a most wonderful and glorious matter. Here, the Lord reveals the deepest intention within man. The decision one makes concerning a certain truth is an indication of his condition before God. When you receive a prophet or a righteous man, your spirit is the same as his. You are joined to the prophet's teaching, and you are also joined to the righteous one's righteousness. Thus, you will receive the reward that they will receive.</P><P>Verse 42:"And whoever gives to one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward." Anything that is done for the sake of the Lord will be rewarded.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER ELEVEN</H1><P>Verse 1:"And when Jesus had finished giving instructions to His twelve disciples, He departed from there to teach and to preach in their cities." This verse should be placed at the end of chapter ten. What the Lord charged His disciples to do was what He Himself did.</P><P>Verse 2:"Now when John heard in the prison of the works of the Christ, he sent word through his disciples." Verses 2-3 show us John's failure. It seems that John should not have asked in this way because he clearly knew from the beginning what kind of person the Lord was. Then why did John ask in this way? It is obvious from the Lord's reply that John was stumbled. The reason he was stumbled was that he was imprisoned by Herod for many days, and it seemed that the Lord did not care for him. Because the Lord did not work out a way for him, he became weakened in his suffering.</P><P>Some say that John's being stumbled was due to his doubting the Lord. However, if a person has known a certain matter, even though he may forget it, he certainly will not return to the former state of ignorance. John did not doubt the Lord because He had already known the Lord. He was stumbled because he was offended that the Lord ignored him. The Lord did not say that John was doubting. In verse 6, " he who is not stumbled because of Me" should be rendered "he who does not take offense at Me." John took offense at the Lord because he did not get what he expected. Hence, he sent his disciples to provoke the Lord. Therefore, in verse 3 John was not in doubt concerning the Lord, but he took offense at the Lord.</P><P>Verse 4:"And Jesus answered and said to them, Go, report to John the things that you hear and see." The Lord knew that John was offended by Him, so He told John's disciples to report to John two things: (1) the things that they heard and (2) the things that they saw. The things that they heard were the Lord's teachings (doctrines). These were the Lord's words-the doctrinal aspect. The things that they saw were the miracles performed by the Lord. These were the Lord's works-the moral aspect. The things that were heard were mentioned before the things that were seen. From this we see that the teachings of Christ, the so-called theology, are more important than His miracles. To see God perform ten miracles is not as profitable as to hear Him speak ten words, because God's word can work in us for a longer period of time.</P><P>Verse 5:"The blind receive their sight and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; and the dead are raised and the poor have the gospel announced to them." The Lord mentioned first the blind receiving sight, because this was something that had never happened in the Old Testament. The Lord wanted John to see that no one could have done such things except the Messiah. The blind receiving sight signifies the opening of our spiritual eyes; the lame walking signifies that we are enabled to walk in God's way; the lepers being cleansed signifies that the charges of sins against us are removed; the deaf hearing signifies that we are enabled to know God's will; the dead being raised signifies that we have passed out of death into life; and the poor having the gospel announced to them signifies that we all who have nothing to do with God have the gospel preached to us.</P><P>Verse 6:"And blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me." Because John saw that the Lord did not act according to his desire, he took offense at the Lord. Blessed is he who does not take offense at the Lord for the way He has ordained for him. Not being happy with God's will is a cause of stumbling. John did not doubt the Lord, but he took offense at the Lord. The reason for his stumbling was that he was not satisfied with the way God had arranged for him. In His reply the Lord gave John a hint so that he might know his mistake. However, He still testified for John before men. The Lord's answer included what John had heard and seen before, except that the Lord added this word: "Blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me."</P><P>Verse 7:"And as these went away, Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John, What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?" In the wilderness there are plenty of reeds. In other words, at that time John was somewhat like a reed shaken by the wind.</P><P>Verse 8: "But what did you go out to see? A man arrayed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings." John previously lived in the wilderness for the sake of the Lord. But now because of the long imprisonment, he became weakened. People thought that he might want to wear soft clothing, but the Lord said that John was not like that.</P><P>Verse 9:"Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet." The Lord said that John was greater than all the prophets. Men usually divide the prophets into the major prophets and the minor prophets according to the length of the books they have written.</P><P>Verse 10:"This is he concerning whom it is written, `Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.'" This verse should be put in parentheses.</P><P>Verse 11:"Truly I say to you, Among those born of women there has not arisen one greater than John the Baptist, yet he who is least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he." "Least" should be translated "less," in contrast with "greater." John was greater than all the prophets. This does not mean, however, that he was greater than all the prophets in faith, morality, the Holy Spirit, fame, work, or position. In saying that John was greater, the Lord was referring to something specific.</P><P>Verse 12:"But from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence, and violent men seize it." The Pharisees were violently frustrating people from entering the kingdom of the heavens. Hence, those who desired to enter had to do so by violence.</P><P>Verse 13:"For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John." All the prophets prophesied until John. John did not prophesy. Instead, he pointed out the Lord to people, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" (John 1:29). This is where his greatness lies. He was great with respect to the time that he was in; his opportunity was different from that of others.</P><P>"He who is least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he." This does not mean that John's faith, morality, spirituality, conduct, and work were small and that he could not enter into the kingdom of the heavens. Rather, it is because those who are in the kingdom of the heavens can say that the work of Christ has been accomplished and that the High Priest has died. Yet John was in the city of refuge waiting for the death of the high priest. This was the reason that he was the least. This was also a matter of a difference in dispensation. Thus we see: (1) the prophets prophesied that the Savior was coming; (2) John pointed out the Savior in person to people; and (3) Christians have the Savior, whose work is accomplished. In the Bible the kingdom of the heavens refers to the part of the millennium that is related to reward. In other words, it is the reigning as kings for a thousand years. The kingdom of the heavens is the manifestation of God's heavenly rule on earth. What is difficult is determining the time interval between the future kingdom of the heavens and the present kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Ordinarily, if we do not make a comparison, we cannot fully know a certain matter. Comparison brings forth knowledge. The scope of the church today is the same as the scope of the kingdom of God today. The scope of the kingdom of the heavens is smaller than both the scope of the kingdom of God and the scope of the church. The scope in which God gives grace to men is the church. Therefore, it is a matter of position. The kingdom of God is the sovereignty of God. All who believe in the Lord are subject to the authority of God. This is for both now and the future. Therefore, the church and the kingdom of God are likened to the two sides of the backbone. The kingdom of the heavens points to the coming millennium, in which a group of people will reign as kings. Not all who are in the church and in the kingdom of God today can enter into the kingdom of the heavens. Only the excellent ones can enter in. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were not in the dispensation of the law. Their reclining at table in the kingdom of the heavens probably refers to the enjoyment of the gospel.</P><P>Verse 14:"And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah, who is to come." What God had prepared for man He presented before man to allow man to make the decision. The kingdom of God is of two aspects: (1) the spiritual sphere and (2) the coming kingdom of God.</P><P>Verses 15-19:John came in the way of mourning, whereas Christ came in the way of rejoicing. But the Jews showed no response or sympathy. The Lord showed us that both ways were rejected by the Jews: (1) In His righteousness God called them to repent, but they would not believe. (2) In His grace God called them to receive Christ, but they refused. John said that God hated sinners, but men did not feel sorrowful. The Lord said that God loves sinners, but men did not feel happy. "Wisdom is justified by her works." For the word works, some ancient authorities read children. Wisdom is Christ. This is the Christ on the earth, not the Christ in heaven; this is Christ incarnated, not Christ the eternal Word. This is Christ after His birth. The children of wisdom are the saved ones. Those who receive this wisdom are those who justify God's saving way. God's saving way is justified by all who receive the Lord.</P><P>Verse 20:"Then He began to reproach the cities in which most of His works of power took place, because they did not repent." The time for doing works of power and preaching the gospel cannot last for long. If there is no repentance, reproach will follow.</P><P>Verses 21-22:In the day of judgment, many people will suffer. How much they will suffer will be different, and the punishment they suffer will also be different. For those who have had more opportunities, the punishment will be heavier.</P><P>Verses 23-24:Until now, Capernaum is still in Hades. There are two different explanations concerning Capernaum, but regardless of which is correct, God's work is not seen among them today, and they are all like dead ones.</P><P>The purpose of chapter eleven is revealed in the last section. The history of the Lord's being rejected can be seen at the end of chapter nine. In chapter ten the Lord declared His rejection by men, for He was reviled and called Beelzebul. Chapter eleven speaks concerning how the Lord especially gained a remnant, and the end of chapter twelve records that the Lord was again rejected. After chapter thirteen, the line of doctrine is not as clear as the preceding twelve chapters. First, the Lord was the son of David; His first relationship was with the Jews. Then, He was also the son of Abraham; hence, He also had a relationship with the Gentiles. The Gospel of Matthew was written to the Jews, but it was not for the Jews. Matthew's record is according to doctrine. It recorded the small points with the main subject in view. Mark's record is according to history, but the emphasis is on Judea. Luke's record is according to morality. John's record is according to history, yet the emphasis is on Galilee.</P><P>Chapter one tells us, on the one hand, that Jesus is Emmanuel, and on the other hand, that He will save His people from their sins.</P><P>In chapter two the word concerning Jesus being born as the King of the Jews was spoken from the mouths of the Gentiles.</P><P>In chapter three first it says to the Jews that they should produce fruit worthy of their repentance. This relates to the Jews. Then it speaks of how God is able to raise up children to Abraham out of the stones. This relates to the Gentiles. Finally, it speaks of the Lord's death, that is, the Lord's baptism in the Jordan River.</P><P>In chapter four the Lord began His work.</P><P>Chapters five through seven cover the requirements of the spiritual kingdom.</P><P>The end of chapter seven mentions God's will, and the end of chapter twelve also mentions God's will.</P><P>In chapter eight the Lord healed first the Jews and then the Gentiles. Then He went back to the Jews to heal Peter's mother-in-law and finally to heal all the people.</P><P>Chapter nine tells us that the Lord healed diseases and cast out demons, yet He was accused of casting out demons by the ruler of the demons. The rejection of the Lord by the people had begun.</P><P>In chapter ten the Lord still sent His disciples to the house of Israel. This was the final call for them to go out to gain a remnant.</P><P>In chapter eleven we see a remnant which is the result of the work in chapter ten.</P><P>At the end of chapter twelve the Lord declared that from then on He cut off His relationship with the Jews. However, that was only a doctrinal declaration. The formal declaration would be made at the end of chapter twenty-three.</P><P>The teachings after chapter thirteen are not related very much to the Jews; rather, they are directed toward the church.</P><P>Verse 25: "At that time Jesus answered and said, I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants." Here in this verse, all those people mentioned earlier in the chapter were put aside. A remnant is here. The Lord showed us that all those who desire to have the truth concerning the kingdom of the heavens are infants. The wise and intelligent here are not truly wise and intelligent. Rather, they are in contrast to the infants. Here we have a principle: if we read the Bible yet do not understand what we read, it is not because our mind is not good but because our mind is too good. If our mind is not good, it is because our heart is not good. Every time we fail to understand the Bible when we read, it is because we do not have the attitude of an infant. If our judgment is of God, we will not be afraid to read it once more.</P><P>Verse 26:"Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight." Who were these infants? They were the remnant gained by the Lord. Although almost all rejected Him and only a small number, a remnant, followed Him, that was sufficient for Him, for that was well-pleasing in God's sight. M. E. Barber once said something to this effect: "If the Lord desires to imprison me for twenty years, I am willing, though I came to China to save people." The Lord's being a perfect Servant does not depend on the result of His work but on His doing the will of God.</P><P>Verse 27:"All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father; neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son and he to whom the Son wills to reveal Him." "All things" refers to people. From John 6:65 we can see that every saved one is given by God to the Son. Everyone who comes to the Lord is moved by God (John 6:37). From this verse we know that no one knows the Son. Although the Lord was misunderstood by men, He was satisfied as long as He was known by the Father.</P><P>The life of the Lord can be divided into three sections: (1) from the manger to the Jordan River, (2) from the Jordan River to the Mount of Transfiguration, and (3) from the Mount of Transfiguration to Jerusalem.</P><P>By reading Hebrews 10:7 we can see that the purpose of the Lord's entire life was to die, that is, to do the will of God. Herein lies the particular point concerning Christ and the Father. That is, Christ had only One who knew Him, and that was the Father. Love is single and also hidden; otherwise, it cannot be considered love. No one can come to the Father; only He who knows the Father can reveal the Father.</P><P>Verse 28:"Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest." The Lord did not say "all who sin." What does it mean to toil and be burdened? This refers in particular to the lost sheep in the house of Israel, who could not obtain their satisfaction from the world. "Give you rest." This is the other aspect of salvation, that is, the aspect of rest. Toiling is brought forth by sin, as with those who burn incense and bow down every few steps. The Jews fast twice a week; the Hindus sleep on beds of nails. These are toilings brought forth by sin. To "come" is our duty; the rest is done by Him. We do not have to bear our sins.</P><P>Verse 29:"Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls." This means that we, the rebellious ones, will find rest by turning to the Lord. The "rest" in the preceding verse is the rest from sin; the "rest" here is the rest that we need to find because of our heart's disobedience to God, that is, the rest that we have by coming out from ourselves.</P><P>Verse 30:"For My yoke is easy and My burden is light." When we obey, we will feel that His yoke is not difficult. The yoke is difficult only because we do not surrender inwardly.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER TWELVE</H1><P>According to the chronological sequence, the incidents in chapter twelve concerning the disciples' picking ears of grain and concerning the Lord's healing the man with a withered hand took place prior to chapter eleven. Why then in this book are they placed after chapter eleven? This is to show us how the Lord was rejected, so that the book can continue on to chapter thirteen. Matthew's stress is on doctrines; hence, he put together the events that are of the same nature.</P><P>Of the Ten Commandments, nine are moral in nature, and only one is positive. If the only one that is positive, that is, the one concerning the keeping of the Sabbath, is put aside, then it is a matter related to dispensation, indicating that the dispensation for Israel is over.</P><P>In the Old Testament the Sabbath has a threefold significance: (1) Keeping the Sabbath is for the remembrance of God's rest. (2) The Sabbath is a sign of the covenant God made with the children of Israel (Ezek. 20:12). (3) Keeping the Sabbath is for the remembrance of the redemption of the children of Israel (Deut. 5:15). Hence, the Jewish people pay special attention to the Sabbath. They consider the Sabbath as the sign of God's covenant with them and also as a remembrance of God's rest and God's redemption. If the keeping of the Sabbath is shaken, it is a serious matter.</P><P>From the Jews' point of view, it is all right to pick ears of grain, but one must pay attention to the time when he does it, since no work is allowed on the Sabbath. However, in verse 7 the Lord said that the disciples were guiltless in working on the Sabbath. To pick ears of grain is to work, and to work on the Sabbath is to sin. Since the disciples picked ears of grain on the Sabbath, they trespassed against the Sabbath. Therefore, they sinned. However, Christ said that although they trespassed against the Sabbath, they were guiltless. From then on, all those who trespassed against the Sabbath were guiltless.</P><P>The section on the healing of the man with a withered hand is a defense to show that the healing was not in violation of the Sabbath; likewise, the section on the disciples' picking ears of grain is a defense showing that the disciples' violation of the Sabbath was not a sin.</P><P>Christ did not say that it was excusable to eat because of hunger. What He meant was that no exceptions would be permitted with regard to the Sabbath. If the Sabbath should be kept, then all should keep it; if the Sabbath should not be kept, then none should keep it. Did Christ say that it was all right for David to eat the bread of the presence because he was hungry? If so, this would be very serious, for it would be a putting aside of the law. Certainly Christ could not endorse this principle. What, then, did Christ say here? Christ hinted in this section that what formerly could be eaten only by the priests could now also be eaten by the kings. This was a dispensational change. In the Old Testament, there were three different ages in God's dealings with the children of Israel: first through the priests, then through the kings, and last through the prophets. David represented the nation of Israel. Although he was anointed by God, at that time he was rejected. God carried out His dealings with Israel through David. Thus, the priests were altogether put aside.</P><P>From 1 Samuel 2:35-36 we see that from then on, the priest had to walk before the king whom God had anointed. The kings ranked first and the priests ranked second. Numbers 27:21-22 indicates that, formerly, persons in the political realm, such as Joshua, had to stand before the priests. That was the age of the priests. David's eating of the bread of the presence was the putting aside of the priests and the things pertaining to the priests. This was not done as an exception to the law. Hence, David was guiltless. David could eat not only on that day; he could eat even every day. The person was changed. When David ate the bread of the presence, it was at the time when he was being rejected. In Matthew 12, when the disciples picked ears of grain, it was also an indication of the Lord's being rejected. The Lord said that David and those who were with him ate (vv. 3-4). Therefore, the Lord also brought the disciples in.</P><P>Verses 1-4:The Lord told us what kind of person He was. Verses 3-4 show us how the king's violating of the Sabbath was an indication that the dispensation had changed.</P><P>Verse 5:"Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?" The word "or" indicates that this is another section. How did the priests profane the Sabbath? They offered sacrifices on the Sabbath many more times than on ordinary days. They did not profane the Sabbath at home but in the temple. They committed the sin of offering too many sacrifices. Sacrifices are offered because of sins. Where sin is, there is no rest; where sin is, the covenant is over; where sin is, there is no remembrance of redemption. The priests' offering of sacrifices was to solve the problem of sin. Where sin is, there lies the root of having no rest. Therefore, the priests were considered guiltless in their profaning of the Sabbath in the temple.</P><P>This verse says that the priests also profaned the Sabbath. The temple is for God and for God's glory. The temple is the place that is filled with God's glory. The sacrifices are for man's benefit. The priests violated the Sabbath for God's glory and man's benefit. Therefore, when the Lord came as the priest, He did not care for the Sabbath. Because there were sins in the tents of the Israelites, the priests could not rest in the temple, and thus they could not help offering sacrifices. Only the offering of sacrifices could keep the children of Israel from the judgment of sin and also keep God's glory from suffering loss. Because God could not tolerate sin, there had to be the shedding of blood. If the people had not sinned, the priests not only could have rest on one day, but they could have rest every day.</P><P>Verse 6:"But I say to you that something greater than the temple is here." Since the Lord is the place that is filled with the glory of God, what He did for the glory of God was guiltless. The Lord is greater than the priests and also greater than the temple. The Lord said that He was David; this refers to His person. The Lord said that He was the priest and the temple; this refers to His work. By replacing the Sabbath with His person and His work, the Lord altogether put aside the Sabbath. If the problem of sin is not solved, there can be no rest. As long as the Lord was still being rejected, and as long as the people in the world were still in sin, there could not be a Sabbath. The Lord was saying that as long as He was David and the temple, His disciples could profane the Sabbath.</P><P>Verse 7:"I desire mercy and not sacrifice." This is a conclusion, indicating that God does not want men to do something for Him, but He wants to do something for men. "Mercy" is what God gives to men, whereas "sacrifice" is what men give to God.</P><P>Verse 8:"For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath." From this we can see that until today, men still do not know the Lord of the Sabbath.</P><P>Verses 1-50 may be divided into seven small sections: (1) verses 1-13, the question of the Sabbath; (2) verses 14-21, the first time the Pharisees took counsel to destroy Jesus; (3) verses 22-32; (4) verses 33-37; (5) verses 38-42; (6) verses 43-45; (7) verses 46-50.</P><P>Chapter twelve is a transitional chapter; therefore, it is of the utmost importance. Beginning from chapter twelve, the destiny of the Jews is decided. This chapter is crucial in terms of the dispensations. If we fail to see the Lord's turn in this chapter, we are inexperienced in understanding the Word. Prior to this chapter the Lord was evidently for the Jews and hiddenly for the Gentiles. After chapter twelve He was clearly for the Gentiles and hinted that He was rejecting the Jews. Chapter twelve is a turning point, a transitional chapter; this is why there is the need to overthrow one thing-the Sabbath. In type, it is all right to have the Sabbath; in actuality, it is not permissible. Men have sinned, so that even God has no rest. Man does not have rest because God has no rest. Wherever sin is, there cannot be rest.</P><P>From verses 1 through 8 there are two turns-from David to the king, and from the king to the Lord.</P><P>Verse 9:Here is another case of violating the Sabbath among the Pharisees.</P><P>Verse 10:"And behold, a man who had a withered hand was there. And they asked Him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath? so that they might accuse Him." A "withered hand" is a hand that can do nothing. Here, the man was not without a hand; rather, he had a withered hand. The form was still there, but the strength was gone. All men are exactly like this: they are dead spiritually, but they are still human beings.</P><P>Verses 11-12:The Lord did not reply as to whether or not it was lawful; instead, He asked them two questions. When the Lord was confronted with difficult questions, He did not answer first but responded with a question. All truths can stand questioning. Whatever is not the truth cannot stand questioning. The Pharisees talked about men; the Lord talked about sheep. The Pharisees talked about the withered hand; the Lord talked about the sheep falling into a pit.</P><P>Man treasures material possessions but despises sinners; he treasures sheep but despises men. What the Lord meant was that as long as the world remains, there will be pits, and there will be sheep falling into pits. The only way for the Lord was to take hold of the sheep and lift it out. "To do well on the Sabbath" does not point to a particular matter; it speaks of a principle. The Lord always speaks in this way.</P><P>Verse 13:"Then He said to the man, Stretch out your hand." This is the Lord's action. "And he stretched it out." The man acted according to the Lord's word. Life is behind the word of God. God's word is like a capsule filled with medicine, and life is likened to the medicine contained in the capsule. When one swallows the capsule, he swallows the medicine at the same time. Likewise, when one receives the word of God, he also receives the life of God at the same time. There is no word of God that is without power. This means that there is not one word behind which there is no life. The hand was "restored." This shows that the work of Christ is complete. When the life of a sinner is restored, he receives a life that is better than what he had in Adam.</P><P>Verses 14 to 21 form the second subsection.</P><P>Verse 14:"But the Pharisees, going out, took counsel against Him as to how they might destroy Him." This was the Pharisees' plotting to destroy Jesus. The reason for this was that the Lord broke the Sabbath. The Pharisees considered that if the Sabbath was broken, Israel would not be reckoned as God's chosen people. The Sabbath was a sign of the covenant that God had made with Israel. Once this sign was removed, the covenant would become ineffective. The Pharisees knew the Lord's attitude toward the Israelites, that is, to put the Israelites aside. Because the foundation was overthrown by the Lord, the Pharisees wanted to kill Him.</P><P>Verse 15:"But Jesus, knowing it, withdrew from there. And many followed Him, and He healed them all." The Lord "withdrew from there"; He did not run away. On another occasion the Lord "passing through their midst, went away" (Luke 4:30). He went away as if nothing had happened. Such calmness is unmatched. "He healed them all," indicating that He took care of all those who had needs.</P><P>Verse 16:"And He charged them not to make Him known." Those who came because of His fame or because of their curiosity were not necessarily trustworthy. Hence, the Lord did not want them to make Him known.</P><P>Verses 17-21:Here the Gentiles are mentioned twice. Thus, we can see that God has put the Israelites aside and has turned to the Gentiles. This is to show in particular how God has turned to the Gentiles. Isaiah 42:1-4 seems to refer to the millennium, but here the Holy Spirit especially uses this prophecy that refers to the future to signify this age.</P><P>Verse 18:"Behold, My Servant whom I have chosen, My Beloved in whom My soul has found delight. I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will announce justice to the Gentiles." In the entire Bible, whenever it says "behold," its intention is to get people's special attention. The servant mentioned after Isaiah 40 refers in particular to the Lord Jesus. What is mentioned in Acts 8 is also a proof of this. "Chosen" is a matter of will, "Beloved" is a matter of position, and "delight" is a matter of the emotion.</P><P>Verse 19:"He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets." How quiet is the Lord!</P><P>Verse 20:"A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench until He brings forth justice unto victory." A bruised reed cannot produce a sound, yet the Lord will not break it. The Gentiles are already bruised; they are like dogs. However, the Lord still turns to the Gentiles; He still expects to hear music from the bruised reeds. Israelites often put flax in a bull horn and poured oil upon it, using it as a torch for their walking. When the flax began to smoke, they quenched it. "Smoking" Christians not only cannot help others to see, but actually prevent others from seeing. It is easy for them to cause problems in the meetings. However, the Lord will not quench such ones; He still expects them to give light again.</P><P>According to the strict interpretation of the Bible, this section refers to the Gentiles. According to teaching, it also refers to us, the believers.</P><P>Verses 22 through 32 form the third subsection. This section advances further than the previous section. In the first section the sign of the covenant was put aside. In the second section the Pharisees plotted to destroy Jesus. In the third section they not only plotted to cause Jesus to suffer physically; they also blasphemed the Holy Spirit.</P><P>Verse 22:"Then there was brought to Him one possessed by a demon, blind and dumb, and He healed him, so that the dumb man spoke and saw." The Bible speaks of different kinds of demons, such as a weak demon, an unclean demon, and a blind and dumb demon. In man's eyes, blindness and dumbness are of natural causes, but here we are told that they are caused by demon possession. When the demon is cast out, the symptom caused by the demon will also be cast out.</P><P>Verse 23:"Is this not the Son of David?" This means that if this man is not the Son of David, then who is He? From this we can see that the crowds in general had some faith. "The Son of David" is an honorable and great title. Therefore, such an address implies honor. This fits the significance of this book.</P><P>Verse 24:"But the Pharisees, hearing this, said, This man does not cast out the demons except by Beelzebul, ruler of the demons." "But" indicates that what was expressed here is just the opposite of the thought in the preceding verse.</P><P>Verses 25-26:Here the Lord Jesus brought up a very great matter. A demon casting out another demon simply means that one demon goes and another demon comes; it is merely a change of demons. This is like a first robber coming to kidnap a person, and a second coming to negotiate for his release after the first one is gone. In essence, both are from the same source. What the Lord spoke is concerning the fact. Therefore, that the Lord's authority was from God also is a fact. A kingdom requires unity; otherwise, even the unlawful kingdom of Satan will not be able to stand.</P><P>Verse 27:"And if I, by Beelzebul, cast out the demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges." This is the reason given by the Lord in His argument.</P><P>Verse 28:"But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you." What is the outward manifestation of the kingdom of God? The kingdom of God is the sovereignty of God. Where the sovereignty of God is, there the demons have no sovereignty. There are two main things in the Bible: one is the kingdom of God, and the other, the power of God. The kingdom of God represents the sovereignty of God, whereas the Spirit of God represents the power of God. God has authority because there is power behind His authority; the Holy Spirit is the power of the kingdom of God. How does the kingdom of God come? It comes through power. If the King has power here, then the kingdom of God has come, because power is behind authority. The casting out of the demons is the most important matter in the manifestation of the kingdom of God.</P><P>Verse 29:"Or how can anyone enter into the house of the strong man and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will thoroughly plunder his house." All spiritual works are open plundering, not secret stealing. It is the same in dealing with Satan. The term "goods," strictly speaking, refers to all those who are demon possessed. Broadly speaking, it refers to all unbelievers (1 John 5:19). The "strong man" is Satan, a mighty one. Every demon possessed person and every unbeliever have become the goods in Satan's hand. Therefore, he will guard them. The Lord sees such power of Satan, so He plunders openly. To rescue an unbeliever, to release one who is demon possessed, or to heal one who is sick is to openly snatch people out of Satan's hand. One thing has to be done first before demons can be cast out, and that is to bind the strong man. To plunder is to seize by force what someone is unwilling to give. If one casts out demons by the ruler of the demons, he must first make peace with the ruler of the demons.</P><P>Binding the strong man is by the Spirit of God. This was directly mentioned by the Lord. The strong man dwells in the world. The casting out of demons requires the power of the Holy Spirit. The casting out of demons needs to be done in the name of the Lord, and the Holy Spirit is the power of the name of Jesus. How does one bind the strong man? Indirectly, it is done through the cross of the Lord Jesus. On the cross, the Lord crushed the head of Satan. (Genesis 3:15-Satan's whole body will be dealt with in the millennium. The cross dealt only with Satan's head, removing his power. He attempts to bruise the Lord's heel because the Lord is advancing.) Satan tried to bite the Lord from behind. While the Lord was on earth, Satan could do nothing. But after the Lord ascended, Satan tries his best today to bruise His heel by shaking the believers. After the Lord's death, resurrection, and ascension, the Holy Spirit descended to execute what the Lord had accomplished on the cross. With the cross as the base and by the power of the Holy Spirit, we can bind Satan. On our side, we can bind Satan by our prayer out of faith. A great principle of the work is first to bind, and then to plunder. We must bind the strong man by prayer.</P><P>Verse 30:"He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters." Because what is happening today is a positive matter, there are only two sides, with no neutral ground. This is why the Lord spoke this word. " With Me" means "standing on My side"; this refers to position. To "gather" is to gather others together; this refers to work. Not one Christian on this earth should fail to stand on the Lord's side. (Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea were believers who were not absolute for the Lord.) Moreover, not one Christian should fail to gather. It is not right to never bring anyone to the Lord.</P><P>Verse 31:"Therefore I say to you, Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven." Every sin will be forgiven. Sin here particularly refers to one's conduct. Even blasphemy can be forgiven. But blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.</P><P>Verse 32:"And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the one to come." What does it mean to blaspheme against the Holy Spirit? To speak against the Holy Spirit is to blaspheme against the Holy Spirit. This is not to cheat the Spirit or to quench the moving of the Spirit. Rather, it is to speak against the Holy Spirit. And what does it mean to speak against the Holy Spirit? This is a sin committed with full awareness. It is not merely to say something by mistake; it is to say clearly that the Holy Spirit is the ruler of the demons. This is not to be against the Spirit in conduct; it is to be against the Spirit in speaking.</P><P>"It will not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the one to come." In Questions and Answers on the Gospel (The Collected Works of Watchman Nee, Set 1, Volume 20) we mention five kinds of forgiveness: (1) eternal forgiveness, (2) forgiveness for fellowship, (3) governmental forgiveness, (4) forgiveness through another party, and (5) forgiveness in the millennial kingdom. This age, or the present age, is the age of grace; the age to come is the age of the kingdom. The sin of speaking against the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven either in this age or in the age to come. The forgiveness in this age is related to the matter of eternal salvation, whereas the forgiveness in the coming age is related to the matter of position in the kingdom.</P><P>Verses 33 through 37 form the fourth subsection.</P><P>Verse 33:"Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for by the fruit the tree is known." What the Lord meant here is that people can know your heart by looking at your fruit.</P><P>Verse 34:"Offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks." An error in the mouth is preceded by an error in the heart. First the heart has a problem, then the mouth speaks it forth.</P><P>Verse 35:"The good man, out of his good treasure, brings forth good things, and the evil man, out of his evil treasure, brings forth evil things." The word treasure in the original language implies the way a person keeps valuables in a bank safe-deposit box.</P><P>Verse 36:"And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment." A man's being judged only according to his words would be enough to make him feel that he has no place to hide; he would wish that he could crawl into a hole in the ground. When the Holy Spirit is offended and ceases to work, man does not have any hope of salvation. Therefore, it is more difficult for the rebellious ones to repent than it is for the sinners.</P><P>The reason the Sabbath is placed first in this chapter is to show a change of dispensation. This chapter refers to David because David typifies the Lord. It particularly cites the case of the eating of the bread of the presence to prove that David was rejected by the Israelites. It refers to the priests for the purpose of sin. In the millennium the Israelites will still keep the Sabbath and eat the bread of the presence. When David ate the bread of the presence, God did not acknowledge it as the bread of the presence. There were twelve cakes of the bread of the presence, signifying that the Lord was for the children of Israel and the children of Israel were for the Lord. When David was fleeing, not one of the twelve tribes followed him. Therefore, the bread of the presence was not considered as the bread of the presence. If they had received David, how could the occasion of eating the bread of the presence have happened? Likewise, the question today is not a matter of whether or not one should keep the Sabbath, but a matter of whether or not one cares for the Lord.</P><P>What mattered to the Lord was whether or not He was rejected. In verses 1-8 the Lord spoke on the doctrine; in verses 9-13 the Lord did a certain thing. The Lord did not mean to say that the disciples could violate the Sabbath. Rather, He meant that the Sabbath was spoiled by the sin of the children of Israel. What God wants is the Sabbath in reality. If the spiritual reality exists, then the outward appearance of spirituality can be kept. Speaking against the Spirit because of ignorance is not considered blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Speaking against the Spirit knowingly and deliberately is considered blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.</P><P>Matthew 12:37 is different from Romans 10:10. The former refers to being justified before God, whereas the latter refers to being put in a new position before men, that is, to being saved.</P><P>Verses 38-42 form the fifth subsection. All the "thens" in Matthew are different in time from those in Mark, at least by a few months. Matthew recorded the events according to chronological order, with the stress on doctrine.</P><P>Verse 38:"Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, Teacher, we want to see a sign from You." The Bible mentions the following three kinds of miraculous things: (1) miracles-merely pointing to God's acts, (2) wonders-wonderful things, and (3) signs-miracles that have some significance.</P><P>Verse 39: "But He answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet." The length of time the adultery continues determines the duration of this generation. Here we should take note of the following three words, which are renderings of three different words in Greek: (1) world, referring to the organized world on earth; (2) age, referring to time; and (3) generation, referring to man's entire lifetime, in the narrow sense, and to a generation, in the broad sense. "Evil" refers to the nature; "adulterous" refers to the communication.</P><P>Why did the Lord specifically mention the prophet Jonah? We should keep in mind that in this chapter the Lord still took care of the line of doctrine. Jonah was sent not to the Israelites but to the Ninevites. Corporately, the children of Israel were given up by the Lord. Because they blasphemed against the Holy Spirit, the Israelites no longer had prophets. Individually, they were placed in the position of sinners. Therefore, at Pentecost three thousand, and later five thousand, were saved (Acts 2:41; 4:4).</P><P>Verse 41:"Ninevite men will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something more than Jonah is here." Formerly the Ninevites repented after hearing what Jonah preached. Today's Jonah first passed through Judea. Formerly, Jonah was thrown into the sea because of his rebellion. Today the Jews cast "Jonah" into the sea; they reject the Lord of life.</P><P>Verse 42:"The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something more than Solomon is here." The queen of the south was also a Gentile. Today's Abyssinia [name changed to Ethiopia after World War II-Editor's note] is the country of Sheba, which still exists. Jonah as a prophet went to Nineveh; the queen of the south came to Solomon. The One who is more than Jonah goes to the Gentiles; the One who is more than Solomon attracts the Gentiles to come to Him. The Gentiles receive the Lord and are attracted to Him.</P><P>The cross is a sign. Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom (1 Cor. 1:22). However, the cross is not only a sign but also wisdom. Hence, it is sufficient for us. The case of Jonah is a sign, and that of Solomon is wisdom.</P><P>Verses 43 through 45 form the sixth subsection.</P><P>Verse 43:"When the unclean spirit goes out from the man, it roams through waterless places, seeking rest, and does not find it." "Waterless" may also be rendered "dry." The demon possessed people were the Jews. This conclusion is based on the last part of verse 45, which says, "Thus shall it be also with this evil generation." Only human bodies can make the demons feel comfortable. Therefore, the unclean spirit goes everywhere to seek rest, that is, to seek men whom he can possess.</P><P>Concerning the unclean spirits, or the demons, there are two ways to look at this verse:</P><P>First, we consider it from the teaching in 1 Corinthians: demons and idols are the same (1 Cor. 10:19-20). Because of their worship of idols, the children of Israel were carried away captive to Babylon. Later they cast away the idols. After their return, there was the sect of the Pharisees. In the beginning Paul also belonged to this sect. As a religious sect, they were very strict; nonetheless, they were still empty. Therefore, they were still in their former state. When the Lord came, they rejected Him, and their last state was worse than their first state.</P><P>Second, we consider this verse in the light of demon possession. Whenever the Lord sees demons, He casts them out. During the Lord's time, it seemed that the demons had gone out from men, yet men remained empty because they did not receive the Lord. In the coming great tribulation, the last three and a half years of this age, demon possession will be more severe.</P><P>The previous section talks about the repentance of the Gentiles, whereas this section describes the condition of the unrepentant people.</P><P>Verse 44:"Then it says, I will return to my house from which I came out. And it comes and finds it unoccupied, swept, and decorated." The unclean spirit takes man's body as his house. The Greek word translated "decorated" implies that things were added. "Swept" is negative; it is to take things out. "Decorated" is positive; it is to add things in. The Jews were exactly like this, yet the Lord said that they were empty. Historically, this verse refers to idolatry. Morally, it refers to some superficial changes.</P><P>Verse 45:"Then it goes and takes along with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter in and settle down there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. Thus shall it be also with this evil generation." The demons prefer to dwell in the bodies of those who are morally good. Concerning the immoral ones, the most evil ones, not only God and men have no way with them; even the demons have no way with them. If a person has only some improvement in morality but does not have the Lord in him, his condition becomes worse. "The last state" refers to the persecution during the time of the great tribulation; this is seen in the record in Matthew 24:15-31. Some thought that the Jews considered one generation as forty years. Therefore, they said that the Lord's word here referred to the things that would come to pass within forty years. It did so happen that forty years later Jerusalem was destroyed. Hence, the thing referred to by the Lord already has passed. This seems to be quite correct. However, we know that such an explanation does not fit with the context here. "Generation" may also be rendered "race." This is why some people say that this passage refers to a race of people. However, if it is speaking of the race of Israel, does this mean that the race of Israel will be annihilated? Of course, this is not correct. Therefore, "this generation" does not refer to a race in the flesh or to a definite number of years. Rather, it implies that this generation will last the same length of time as the evil and adulterous generation, even longer than one particular age.</P><P>Verses 46 to 50 form the seventh subsection.</P><P>Verse 46:"While He was still speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and His brothers stood outside seeking to speak to Him." By reading Mark 3, we can see that the Lord's relatives came to find the Lord to lay hold of Him, for they thought He was beside Himself (v. 21). Matthew did not record this in that way; his record is different from Mark's because it was written according to the line of doctrine. Here, the Lord's relationship in the flesh with the children of Israel had already been severed.</P><P>Verses 47-48:Here the Lord Jesus showed them that His relationship with the children of Israel, and with His mother as well, had been cut off.</P><P>Verse 50:"For whoever does the will of My Father who is in the heavens, he is My brother and sister and mother." A brother is for rendering help, a sister is for showing sympathy, and a mother is for loving tenderly.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER THIRTEEN</H1><P>Chapters 1-4:The preparation for the Lord to come as King and the temptation of the Lord.</P><P>Chapters 5-7:The moral nature of the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Chapters 8-12:The Lord's hinting that He was for the Gentiles on the one hand and for the Israelites on the other hand.</P><P>Chapter 13 is on the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>The Bible is not primarily for the purpose of morality but for the purpose of doctrine. In the entire New Testament, only one verse tells us of the function of the holy Scriptures, and that is 2 Timothy 3:16. This verse first mentions "teaching," which should be translated "doctrine"; then it stresses the aspect of morality: for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.</P><P>Matthew 13 is truly rich and cannot be exhausted in our entire lifetime. However, it is not for morality but for teaching. Doctrinally, this chapter occupies the greatest position; its subject is the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens. The word "mystery" is used a number of times in the New Testament (some have said there are seven mysteries, but this cannot be determined accurately). All the mysteries are equal, except one, which is seen from another standpoint. The mysteries in the Bible cannot be understood by man's natural mentality; they are revealed and made known to men by the Spirit of God. Hence, they are called mysteries. Among God's manifold mysteries there are the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens. Other mysteries are found in Ephesians 1:9-10; 3:4-6; 5:32; Colossians 1:27; 1 Corinthians 15:51; 2:7; Revelation 17:5; Romans 16:25; and 1 Timothy 3:16. All the chief mysteries in the entire New Testament are found in these verses.</P><P>The mysteries that remain must take place according to their predetermined time, between the Lord's first coming and His second coming. They cannot occur before or after this period. By this we see that the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens take place in this age and have nothing to do with the coming age.</P><P>From verse 35 of this chapter we can see that the mysteries that take place today were not evident in the Old Testament.</P><P>Verse 1:"On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea." "That day" is the day that the Lord broke His relationship with the Jews. A "house" implies that it belongs to someone; it has a boundary and is a place of calmness. The sea does not belong to anyone, is without limit, and is stormy. That the Lord went out of the house proves that God has come out of that which has a boundary and a limitation into that which is unlimited. The evil men are like the stormy sea, while the house is a quiet and orderly place. (This refers to the conduct of the Pharisees.) The Lord departed from the moral sphere. This means that He forsook the Jews and went to the Gentiles. In the Bible the sea signifies the Gentiles, and the earth signifies the Jews (Rev. 13:1, 11; Dan. 7:3).</P><P>Verse 2:"And great crowds were gathered to Him, so that He stepped into a boat and sat, and all the crowd stood on the shore." The Lord went out of the house, but He did not go into the sea. He sat in a boat. The boat, which was in the sea but not of the sea, signifies the church, which is in the world but not of the world.</P><P>The Lord left the Jews and went to the Gentiles. Nevertheless, He did not go to all the Gentiles; He went only to the Gentiles who were in the boat and spoke there (in the church). Why did the Lord need to speak in parables? Verse 11 of this chapter points out clearly that the things of the kingdom are for His disciples to know and not for the outsiders to understand. The disciples understood by faith. Therefore, to them more was given so that they would abound. But from those who do not have (referring to the Jews), even that which they have (i.e., the miracles and wonders which were done by the Lord among them and which they saw) will be taken away from them. From then on the Lord performed no more miracles. He spoke to them in parables because they could neither see nor hear. Their eyes and their ears had problems because their heart had a problem first. Their heart had become fat, and they rejected the Lord, so there was no way for them to be saved (2 Thes. 2:10-12). By this we know that all the parables in the Bible are spoken to the disciples and not to the Jews. This is a principle.</P><P>The phrase "the kingdom of the heavens has become like," or "the kingdom of the heavens is like," is used six times in this chapter. There are seven parables in this chapter, and if the one on the treasure of things new and old is included, there are eight parables. However, the first parable does not say "the kingdom of the heavens has become like" or "the kingdom of the heavens is like." Three parables were spoken in the house specifically to the disciples; three parables were spoken at the seashore where both the Jews and the disciples were present. Whenever the Bible mentions the numbers three, seven, ten, and twelve, they signify completion. The number three is the number of God. Seven is completeness in time (which is temporary). Ten is human completeness. Twelve is eternal completeness; it is a number signifying the relationship between God and men. Although the parables in Matthew 13 apparently do not have positive significance, there is a line of progression going toward God. In contrast, the condition of the seven churches mentioned in Revelation 2 and 3 is not so; it is a line of degradation.</P><P>A very important principle in studying the Bible is that the release of the truths in the Bible has dispensational restrictions. Therefore, we need to be humbled under God's mighty hand (1 Pet. 5:6), and when we have a specific need, God will give us the light.</P><P>Before we go further to see the matter concerning the kingdom of the heavens, let us first review what we have covered earlier. After the Lord was born, there was one who pioneered the way for Him. That one was John, and he preached, saying, "The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near." After him, the Lord also preached this, and He sent out the apostles also to preach the same thing. Actually, what does it mean to say that "the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near"? Later on, we see the Lord healing diseases and casting out demons. This is very much related to the drawing near of the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Matthew chapters five through seven speak concerning the nature of the kingdom of the heavens: absolute righteousness toward oneself, absolute graciousness toward others, and doing deeds in absolute secrecy toward God. Chapter ten is on the Lord's sending out the apostles. Chapters eleven and twelve are a big turning point. It seems that the kingdom of the heavens is taken back from the Jews. Concerning the kingdom of the heavens in chapter thirteen, Scofield said that the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens are just the kingdom of the heavens, which is mysterious. This does not make sense according to logic.</P><P>The Lord Jesus, John, and the disciples all said that the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near. The Lord also declared the nature of the kingdom of the heavens. After the Israelites rejected the Lord, He spoke in chapter thirteen of the kingdom of the heavens in its boundary, its outward appearance (everything in the present age is outward), not the kingdom of the heavens in its nature. Mr. Meyer said that chapters five through seven speak of the nature of the kingdom of the heavens. In order to enter into the kingdom of the heavens in chapter thirteen, one must be of the same nature as the kingdom. But this does not make sense either, because the kingdom of the heavens in chapter thirteen has tares, leaven, etc. Therefore, chapter thirteen speaks of the kingdom of the heavens only in its outward appearance as the boundary.</P><P>The kingdom of the heavens is not the millennium. It is the ruling part in the millennium. The kingdom of the heavens has three aspects: (1) the outward appearance as the boundary, as presented in chapter thirteen; (2) our learning to go on by righteousness and grace under the authority of God-this is the aspect of spiritual conduct and is spoken of in chapters five through seven; and (3) our reigning together with the Lord Jesus in the future, in the millennium-this is the future reward spoken of in chapters five through seven.</P><P>Therefore, first we must enter into the realm of the kingdom of the heavens. We must change to another kingdom and become the people of the kingdom of the heavens. Second, we must have the spiritual reality and conduct presented in Matthew 5-7. Third, the result will be our reigning together with Christ.</P><P>There are three categories of people today. First, there are those who have entered into the realm of the kingdom of the heavens, yet they have not been saved. Second, there are those who have been saved, have entered into the realm of the kingdom of the heavens, and have attempted to keep the teachings in chapters five through seven, but have failed. Third, there are those who have been saved, have kept the teachings in chapters five through seven, and have truly overcome; they will end with the third point mentioned above, which is to reign with the Lord in the future.</P><P>The kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of God are different, but they are inseparable.</P><P>(1) In the first aspect: with some of the parables, while Matthew said, "The kingdom of the heavens is like...," Luke said, "The kingdom of God is like..." From this we can see that the kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of God are equal. This means that, on the level of the outward appearance, or the boundary, the kingdom of the heavens is equal to the kingdom of God, as shown in the parable of the leaven.</P><P>(2) In the second aspect: however, the kingdom of the heavens is not equal to the kingdom of God. The second aspect of the kingdom of the heavens deals with the matter of conduct, as seen in chapters five through seven. On the other hand, the kingdom of God is a matter of peace and joy in the Holy Spirit (Rom. 14:17). The kingdom of God is a spiritual matter, while the kingdom of the heavens deals with spiritual conduct. (To enter into the kingdom of God is merely to go in, whereas to see the kingdom of God is to see its reality.)</P><P>(3) In the third aspect: the kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of God are the same, again, in that both refer to the reigning in the millennium.</P><P>Although in the first aspect the kingdom of God is equal to the kingdom of the heavens, the kingdom of God includes an additional period; that is, the sovereignty of God spoken of by the prophets in the Old Testament refers to the ruling of the kingdom of God, not the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>In the third aspect, not only our reigning with the Lord for one thousand years is the kingdom of God, but to eternity it is the reigning of God. In eternity, the kingdom of the heavens will have passed, and the kingdom of God will be reigning. Therefore, in the third aspect, the kingdom of God has one more period than the kingdom of the heavens. In a certain sense, the kingdom of God includes the kingdom of the heavens, but not vice versa.</P><P>In world history the church today has only the Roman Catholic Church, the state churches, and the private churches. The Roman Catholic Church says that all believers in the world are under her regardless of the country in which they live. The state church, such as the Anglican Church, claims that every citizen of that nation belongs to the church. Due to the dissatisfaction with the state churches, there are also the private churches. As far as the outward appearance, or boundary, is concerned, if someone claims to be a Christian, we cannot cast him out of the kingdom of the heavens, because the Lord has not permitted the collecting of the tares today. However, in the bread breaking meeting, the church may have an unsaved person or an evil person removed (1 Cor. 5:2, 11-13). Therefore, the kingdom of the heavens in its outward appearance may include unsaved ones, just as the state churches do. However, for the church meetings, it is permissible not to receive an unsaved person. This shows that the kingdom of the heavens in its outward appearance and the church are two completely different spheres. There may be tares in the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, but there cannot be any unsaved person in the church. Those who are not saved cannot enter into the church.</P><P>The parables in this chapter may be divided into several sections: (1) The parable of the sower is the introduction. (2) The parable of the wheat and the tares is in contrast with the parable of the good species and the foul species. Just as there are good wheat and bad tares, there are also good species and foul species. (3) The parable of the mustard seed is in contrast with the parable of the leaven. The mustard seed is outward, whereas the leaven is inward. (4) The parable of the treasure is in contrast with the parable of the pearl. The treasure refers to the outward, whereas the pearl refers to the inward. To show contrast is not to repeat; it is for emphasis, because one refers to the church and the other refers to the Gentiles. (5) If the word concerning the new and old treasure is also considered a parable, it is in contrast with the first parable, the parable of the sower.</P><P>Verse 3:"And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow." In this parable the Lord did not say, "The kingdom of the heavens is (or, has become) like...," because the work of sowing the seed was done by the Lord Himself. The kingdom of the heavens in its outward appearance or sphere did not begin until the Lord was rejected and the disciples began to work. This parable speaks specifically of the result of the work of the Lord Jesus on the earth, which is a matter before "the kingdom of the heavens is (or, has become) like...." If we want to be strict in our interpretation, we must interpret it in this way.</P><P>In verses 24-25 a "man" and "men" are mentioned. The man refers to the Son of Man; the men refer to the Lord's servants. The sowing was done by the Son of Man alone; no one else had any part in it. How many kinds of seeds are there? There is only one kind. This means that all the seeds are the same. But what about the earth? There are four kinds. The seeds refer to the word of the kingdom of the heavens, the earth refers to the heart of man, and the sower is Jesus Christ.</P><P>"Went out to sow." If this is not the beginning of a new dispensation, then it must be the preparation for a new dispensation. In the Old Testament God planted Israel as a vine (Jer. 2:21). The vine is planted in the vineyard, and the roots of the vine constantly absorb the moisture from the earth. Therefore, the vine typifies God's earthly people. When the children of Israel went to Canaan, the first evidence of what the good land was like was the grapes from the Valley of Eshcol (Num. 13:24). The blessings of the Israelites are always on the earth. To sow the seed is to sow wheat. After the season is over it is reaped when it has dried. This refers to Christians.</P><P>Although the Old Testament mentions the fig tree, it does not use the fig tree to represent the children of Israel. Rather, it uses the vine to represent the children of Israel. However, the New Testament uses the fig tree to represent the children of Israel (Matt. 24:32). In Luke 13 a fig tree was planted in a vineyard. Because the children of Israel were not good, God put them aside from their chosen position. The fig tree had not produced fruit for three years, but it was to be kept to see if it would produce fruit in that year. Therefore, the vine is a permanent representation of Israel, whereas the fig tree is a temporary representation of Israel. Here in Matthew 13 what is presented is the sowing of seed; it is neither the permanent representation nor the temporary representation.</P><P>What does "beside the way" refer to? (1) The "way" is land that has never been tilled, and it has the most traffic. That is, it is a place that has not been dealt with by God or sown by men. This is the place where the evil spirits dwell. The field signifies the world, so the place "beside the way" must be the air. (2) The place "beside the way" is not the way itself; it is close to the way. This shows that it is a place that is especially close to the demons. It is probably very corrupt in morality.</P><P>"When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the evil one comes... This is the one sown beside the way" (v. 19). A person's rejection of the Lord is due to the unwillingness of his heart. This is just Satan blinding the eyes of man's heart to keep the glory of Christ from shining in (2 Cor. 4:4). In Matthew 5-7 the Lord presented the word of the kingdom of the heavens in a way that cannot be any more clear. But the people were not able to receive it. It does not say that they did not believe, but that they did not understand. This word was spoken especially to the Jews. The Jews do not believe because they do not understand. This corresponds to the word spoken in verses 13 through 15 concerning not being able to understand. Therefore, the Lord said that they are neighbors to the evil spirits. People of this kind are not saved.</P><P>Verses 5-6:The second kind of seed is the seed that fell on the rocky places. These are places where there are rocks underneath and shallow soil on top. The deeper the seed is sown, the later it will grow; the shallower the seed is sown, the earlier it will grow because the shallow one is the first to receive the sunlight. See verses 20 to 21 for the explanation. This is the condition of those who are revived especially through revival meetings. For example, in John 2, many believed into the Lord when they saw the signs which He did. However, their believing was different from the believing mentioned in John 3, and the Lord did not entrust Himself to them (John 2:23-24). Many were crowding around the Lord, but not many touched Him (Luke 8:43-48). Many zealous ones crowd around the Lord, but they do not touch the Lord. Those who crowd around the Lord do so merely because of temporary excitement.</P><P>However, this kind of people is not yet regenerated, because the rocks have not yet been removed. Ezekiel 36:26 says that those who are regenerated have their stony heart removed. Those who have not entered deeply will go out easily. Many can easily have a display, but actually they have not obtained anything. Because they have no depth of earth, the seeds immediately spring up and can easily make a display. The Lord said that people of this kind do not have root in themselves but have rocks underneath the surface. Their soil is borrowed from the outside, and the sprout is not life but a mere momentary display of emotion. The Lord said that they are not saved.</P><P>Furthermore, trials and persecutions are for helping the believers to grow. All the north winds are for helping the trees to grow firmly. If the seed has no root, it cannot withstand persecution and affliction. If the seed is rooted, the scorching of the sun will help the seed to grow. If the seed is not rooted, the scorching of the sun will cause the seed to wither.</P><P>Verses 7, 22:The people described in these verses are probably saved. Thorns grow without anyone sowing the seed. But wheat does not grow if no one sows. Therefore, everything that is of God requires work; everything that is natural does not require work. To be anxious and to be greedy for riches are very natural.</P><P>Is the word of God crowded in you? Do you give the word of God sufficient room within you? A person can be outwardly very busy, very rich, and very strong, but the most important thing is whether or not the word is crowded within. The Lord's eyes do not look only at life. The Lord always looks at the bearing of fruit. The sprout grows before men. If the seed sprouts, there is life. But if it does not bear fruit, the owner will not have gained anything. The truth of the kingdom of the heavens is that God wants to gain something.</P><P>Verses 8, 23:There is only one kind of seed; the difference is in the soil. The kind of soil you are is determined by you; no one can force you. Concerning the truth of the kingdom of the heavens, it is a matter of understanding, not believing. In other words, spiritual revelation is necessary. When a person has the practical seeing, then he can bear fruit. Furthermore, the Lord does not pay attention to anything under thirty. A hundred is perfect, sixty is more than half, and thirty is not quite half. Therefore, the Lord does not pay attention to anything under thirty. The measure of death one has determines the measure of his fruitfulness.</P><P>Verse 24:"Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field." Take note that this parable is the first of the six parables of the kingdom of the heavens. Therefore, the realm of this parable is somewhat broader. It must include the outline of the kingdom of the heavens. The speaking was carried out at the seashore, and the interpretation was given in the house. The parable of the sower stresses the four different kinds of soil; this parable stresses the good seed. In the first parable there is only one kind of seed, while in this parable there is only one field.</P><P>The previous parable is like a preface. It does not say, "The kingdom of the heavens is (or, has become) like...," because the work He did on earth was received only by some people. This parable refers to that which took place after He did His work. In the previous parable there is only one man; in this parable there are men sleeping. The previous parable emphasizes man's heart, whereas this parable stresses the realm of work.</P><P>As the sower in the previous parable is the Son of Man, so the sower in this parable also is the Son of Man. The "field" is the world. In chapter twenty-eight the disciples were told to go to all the nations, that is, to go into all the world. This is different from going only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. The previous parable stresses only man's heart toward the Lord, while this parable stresses the preaching of the gospel to the whole world. Now there are no more boundaries. This indicates that the realm of the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is as broad as the world. The church rescues people out of the world, and the kingdom of the heavens is a new sphere on the earth. The church comes out of the world, whereas the kingdom of the heavens goes into the world. Therefore, we can remove people from the church, but we cannot remove them from the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>The good seed are the sons of the kingdom (v. 38). In the previous parable the seed is the word of the kingdom; in this parable the good seed are the sons of the kingdom. In the previous parable the seed is the word of God; in this parable the word passed through men, making them the sons of the kingdom. When the seeds are sown into the ground, one by one they become wheat; when the word falls into our heart, we become sons of the kingdom. By the word we are made sons of the kingdom. First Peter 1:23 says that we have been regenerated through the word. We have received the new life through the word of God. When the word of God falls into our heart, it immediately becomes life.</P><P>The sons of the kingdom are those who belong to the kingdom. From this we can see two meanings of the kingdom of the heavens: (1) The sphere of the kingdom of the heavens in its appearance is as large as the world. (2) When the sphere becomes more restricted, we have only the sons of the kingdom.</P><P>The sons of the kingdom are those who are qualified to inherit the kingdom; they are those who represent the kingdom and who belong to the kingdom. They are the opposite of the sons of the evil one. How can man be regenerated? When a gospel preacher preaches a certain word to you, you believe and receive this word. Then you also receive life, which is in the word.</P><P>Verse 25: "But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and went away." Here it is the men sleeping, not the sower. The Lord as the sower never sleeps or slumbers. The men were the slaves. Broadly speaking, they refer to us; strictly speaking, they refer to the people at that time. There are two aspects to sleeping: (1) It is natural and therefore cannot be criticized. (2) It is to be tired, that is, not to be watchful.</P><P>The "enemy" is the devil (v. 39), and the "tares" are people. In verse 38, as the wheat signifies men, so the tares also signify men. The "sons of the evil one" are not the unbelievers in the world; rather, they are those who mixed with the wheat, like the mixed multitude among the children of Israel when they went out from Egypt. There have been tares in the church in every age, such as Judas in the early days and H.E. Fosdick [a modernist] in the present time.</P><P>Concerning the wheat and the tares, someone who was familiar with the geographical background of the Jews gave the following explanation: After the wheat and the tares are sown, they sprout and grow up to a height of one foot, two feet, or four feet. At these stages they are the same. When they bear fruit, they are still the same. Not until their fruit has ripened are they distinguishable. The fruit of the tares is black, and that of the wheat is golden yellow. In order to determine which is a tare and which is wheat, one must wait until the fruit becomes ripe.</P><P>"His enemy ... went away." This is the enemy's way of doing things. Bible prophecies tell us that in the last days there will be a great apostasy, a great turning away from the truth. We do not know the truth that they will turn away from, but the Bible tells us how the turning away from the truth will be carried out. It will be just as Paul said: men will forbid marriage and command the eating of vegetables (1 Tim. 4:3)-things related to our conduct. John told us that, with regard to the truth, the apostates will deny the Father and the Son (1 John 2:22). Therefore, John stressed the matter of confessing that Jesus is the Christ. Peter in his second Epistle said that the apostates will care only to have money, and the result they are seeking is the separating of the flock (2 Pet. 2:15). This kind of situation was already mentioned at the time of Paul, John, and Peter. Since the second century there have been countless debates concerning the person of the Lord Jesus. According to history, those who sow the tares are those who deny that Jesus is the Christ, yet they still call themselves Christians.</P><P>Verse 26: "And when the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then the tares appeared also." The clause "when the blade sprouted" has two meanings. First, it refers to the time of the ripening for the harvest. Second, it refers to the time the conduct is manifested. The harvest of the field is at the end of the age. The time of the manifestation of the conduct is indicated in verse 27, where the slaves of the master of the house have already begun to wonder. In the second century, when the heresies were rising up, the slaves had no idea what was happening, so they told the master of the house.</P><P>Verse 27: "And the slaves of the master of the house came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where then did the tares come from?" The slaves did not know who had sown the tares. When they saw the tares coming out, they did not understand why it was happening. Today it is the same in pioneering a work. Originally, there are a few very good ones, but later some bad condition suddenly appears. The slaves knew only the result but did not know the cause. However, the master said that it was done by the enemy. The tares are mixed with the wheat. Satan's work is not only to oppose but also to imitate. Not only does Satan transfigure himself into an angel of light, but his followers also transfigure themselves into ministers of righteousness (2 Cor. 11:14-15). If possible, Satan persecutes; if not, he imitates. Therefore, persecution should not be feared as much as counterfeiting. There is not one kind of spiritual experience that Satan cannot counterfeit. Satan will counterfeit even such high matters as the fellowship between God and man and the union of God and man. For instance, Frank Buchman, [founder and director of the Oxford Group], wrote a book concerning regenerated Christians. Although the book was well written, it mentions neither the death of Christ nor the blood of Christ. Without blood, one can still be regenerated! This is really heresy! Buchman also spoke on the union of God and man. How did he put it? He said that all that is required is meditation. He spoke neither of the reading of the Bible nor of the Holy Spirit. It is strange that without reading the Bible or depending on the Spirit, one can still understand God's desire! That he did not touch these things is a real danger. Today the revival movement at Oxford University is of the Buchman group. However, there were students who testified that they did not believe in Jesus of Nazareth. Today Satan counterfeits regeneration, salvation, and the fellowship between God and man. Therefore, without the truth, the experience must be false. When people are saved, they should have a spiritual salvation and not a psychological salvation.</P><P>Verses 27-28:When the slaves were wondering about the appearing of the tares, the master said that it was done by an enemy. To collect in Greek means "to root out by violent force." Rooting out is done not by a peaceful means but by a violent means; it is to cut off (Prov. 2:21-22; Deut. 29:28). The specialty of the Roman Catholic Church has been to put to death those who believed in heresies. The same has been true with the state churches. The Episcopalian Church also practiced burning people to death by fire. This is the "collecting" of tares. Unfortunately, however, some who did not believe in heresies were also killed; even the wheat, the good believers, were put to death. A good number who were "collected" were wheat rather than tares. "Collecting" is not allowed by the Lord.</P><P>Verse 30:"Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares and bind them into bundles to burn them up, but the wheat gather into my barn." Because of this, some think that it is expected that tares be present in the church. But the word here concerns the field, the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. First Corinthians 5 says that the church should remove the evil man from her midst. The church is formed by the Lord, so she should not have the mixed multitude in her midst. But in the sphere of the appearance of the kingdom, a mixed multitude is unavoidable.</P><P>"Until the harvest." This is where the whole matter is. " The time of the harvest" is "the consummation of the age" (v. 39). On the one hand, the age refers to the present age of the gospel. On the other hand, it probably began from the time of Daniel, because God gave the authority to the Gentiles then, and that began a new age. This is the strictest interpretation. Daniel said that God is "the God of the heavens" (Dan. 2:18-19, 37, 44). When God appeared to Abraham, He was "the God of heaven and earth." All the way until David, He was called "the God of heaven and earth." Ezekiel 8 through 11 show that God gradually withdrew Himself, and eventually He withdrew to the heavens. The reason God withdrew to the heavens was that the children of Israel were worshipping idols. Therefore, Satan became the god of this age, and God committed the earth to Satan. Although at the time of Nehemiah there were people who were returning to their country, God was still called "the God of the heavens." This is why Paul said in Galatians 1:4 that this age is an evil age. The consummation of this age ends with the great tribulation. At the conclusion of this age two things will be manifested: the wheat and the tares. The " harvest" refers to the consummation of the age, and the "reapers" are the angels.</P><P>In verse 30 there is the binding into bundles. Men have now bound themselves into associations. In an effort to become more intimate, they have bound themselves into " bundles." This bundling has already begun. By studying church history in detail, we can see that within the past one hundred years since 1828, the truths of the Bible have been selected out one by one. Those who believe, believe; those who do not believe, do not believe. Those who preach the personal gospel, preach the personal gospel; those who preach the social gospel, preach the social gospel. Those who preach premillennialism, preach premillennialism; those who preach postmillennialism, preach postmillennialism. Yes is yes, and no is no. Twenty years ago the mixing in the church was very serious. It was not until 1915 that fundamentalism came into existence, and a division took place. Now the tares are being bound into bundles. A sign of Christ's second coming is this "binding into bundles," that is, the so-called fellowship. Men such as Fosdick have been exposed as modernists by the missionaries of the China Inland Mission. The binding into bundles is for burning.</P><P>Revelation 14:1-5 is on the firstfruits; verses 6-13 are on the great tribulation (that is, the warning of the three angels); verses 14-16 are on the reaping of the wheat; and verses 17-20 are on the gathering of the grapes. When will the warning of the three angels occur? It will take place at the time of the great tribulation. Therefore, the rapture of the firstfruits in 14:1-5 will take place before the great tribulation, while the harvest of the wheat and the gathering of the grapes will take place after the great tribulation. What is the harvest? In the Bible it refers to the rapture. How do we know that the harvest of the wheat refers to the rapture? Because the wheat is gathered into the barn. The houses of the Jews were in one place and their fields were in another place. The barn is built near the house, and the wheat is stored in the barn, which is far away from the field but close to the house. Therefore, the barn is the air. Since the field is the world and the house is where God the Father dwells, the ripened wheat cannot be stored in either of the two places. Therefore, the barn must be the air. This is according to the significance of the harvest.</P><P>From the types in Leviticus 23 we can have a clear picture. Leviticus 23 records the following feasts: (1) the Sabbath, (2) the Feast of the Passover, (3) the Feast of Unleavened Bread, (4) the Feast of the Firstfruits, (5) the Feast of Pentecost, (6) the Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets, (7) the Feast of Propitiation, and (8) the Feast of Tabernacles. Not only was the Sabbath placed as the first, but also within every feast there was a Sabbath. This does not signify God's rest after creation; it signifies the completion of redemption. God rests, and man also rests. This means that both God and man approve of what the Lord did.</P><P>There are three feasts in the first month. First, the Feast of the Passover is on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening (Lev. 23:5). Second, the Feast of Unleavened Bread is on the fifteenth of the month (vv. 6-8). Third, the Feast of the Firstfruits is on the day after the Sabbath and three days after the Passover (vv. 9-11). There is one feast in the second month-the Feast of Pentecost. It takes place on the fiftieth day, counting from the day after the Sabbath, that is, the day that the firstfruits are brought in, through the completion of seven Sabbaths to the day after the seventh Sabbath (vv. 15-21). There are three feasts in the seventh month. First, the Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets is on the first day of the month (vv. 24-25). Second, the Feast of Propitiation is on the tenth of the month (vv. 26-32). Third, the Feast of Tabernacles is on the fifteenth of the month (vv. 33-43).</P><P>The first month is the time of Christ's working, and the second month is the time of the Spirit's working. After this there is a gap, a period with no feasts. Then in the seventh month there are feasts again. All the things of redemption begin with the Feast of the Passover. Closely following the Feast of the Passover is the Feast of Unleavened Bread. No one can keep the Passover without putting away the leaven. Three days after the Feast of the Passover is the Feast of the Firstfruits. What is offered in this feast? A sheaf (not a single stalk) of the firstfruits is to be waved before God (Lev. 23:10-11). Therefore, in Jerusalem many believers came out of the tombs after the Lord's resurrection (Matt. 27:53). At the death of Christ, many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised (v. 52) because the Lord had overcome the power of death. After the Lord's resurrection, they came out of the tombs. This is the "spoil" mentioned in Isaiah 53:12, indicating the glory of victory. The Feast of Pentecost refers to the descending of the Holy Spirit. It is what the two loaves of bread baked with leaven and offered as a wave offering typify. One of the two loaves refers to the Jews and the other to the Gentiles. The Feast of Pentecost has already begun, and we are enjoying the accomplishment of Pentecost. The Feast of Pentecost has not ended yet; it will go on until the Feast of Propitiation. This is like the case of the new covenant. In the future God will make a new covenant with the children of Israel, but today we are already enjoying the blessing of the new covenant. The Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets, on the one hand, is applied to the Jews, and on the other hand, is related to us. This is in the future. The Feast of Propitiation is also in the future. However, today we have a foretaste of it (Heb. 6:5). The Feast of Tabernacles refers to leaving the houses and rejoicing and points to the millennium. It is still temporary, not eternal.</P><P>Concerning the wheat, there are four steps mentioned in Leviticus 23. First, there are the firstfruits, referring to the Lord's resurrection. (In the Bible many were resurrected, but the Lord was ordained to be the Firstborn from among the dead.) "Firstfruits" implies that others are not ripened yet. Hence, firstfruits are reaped first. Second, in the Feast of Pentecost the loaves of bread as firstfruits refer to those who are raptured first, that is, before the great tribulation. Third, there is the general harvest; this is the rapture after the great tribulation. Fourth, there is the gathering of the gleanings after the harvest; this refers to the rapture of the fragments.</P><P>Matthew 13 records a comparison between wheat and tares, showing that their ends are different. Revelation 14 and Leviticus 23 record a comparison between different kinds of wheat, showing that their ends also are different. Although all are wheat, they are harvested at different times. Some say that all will be raptured together before the great tribulation. They are merely trying to comfort themselves. Otherwise, the Lord should have said, "Blessed are you because you are the wheat. You do not have to watch or endure." If the requirement for rapture is not the maturity in life, then all the warnings are meaningless.</P><P>Wheat needs to be dried; it is different from grapes, which need water. Therefore, it needs sunshine. At the time of harvest, the standard for harvest is the amount of water. When the stalks and roots are all dried up, then they can be reaped. We are all wheat, so we must be dried up; that is, we must not love the pleasures of this earth. Mr. Panton once said that wheat dries toward the earth as it ripens toward heaven. Sunshine signifies the grace of tribulation, while the dew signifies the grace of blessing. Sunshine helps the wheat to grow and ripen; it causes the wheat to be dried and not to love the world. Furthermore, wheat is an annual plant. The earth is not our permanent dwelling place; it is our temporary place of sojourn. The wheat are ripened group after group. One martyr said, "I can give my life for another to die." Wheat has no safeguard on the earth. It does not have the thorns of roses, and it is not as strong or firm as the fig trees or as high as the vine trees. It is most tender and easily bent by the wind. God is wise in using wheat to represent the saints, the sons of the kingdom of the heavens. The Lord will see whether or not we are ripened, and then He will reap. The rapture of the believers is determined by the believers themselves.</P><P>Before the Lord's coming, the first rapture will take place, in which very few saints (the hundred and forty-four thousand mentioned in Revelation 14) will be taken before the throne, which is in heaven. These also are the loaves offered in the Holy Place at the Feast of Pentecost. Revelation 14:6-13 concerns the gospel and the warning during the great tribulation. Verses 14-16 cover the harvest. The Son of Man being on the cloud is the situation described in 1 Thessalonians 4. In Revelation 14:15, ripe in the original language means "cooked by roasting." Since the sunshine is ineffective, the Lord has to use fire-persecution and tribulation-which is more severe than sunshine to roast them until they are done, that is, ripe. Therefore, eventually the believers have to give up the world and become dried, either by the scorching of the sun or by the roasting of fire. One day you may love the world, but the world may not love you. The difference between the five foolish virgins and the five prudent virgins is merely a matter of those who are early and those who are late; in other words, which believers are ripened first? In Revelation 14:17-20 the sickle is related to the angels, and the "grapes" are the evil men (not a type of the Israelites, whose type today is the fig tree). These grapes are the slain mentioned in chapter nineteen who fall at the battle of Armageddon. What follows that is the Feast of Tabernacles (Deut. 16:13-15). The gathering of the gleanings takes place after the harvest; it signifies the rapture of the fragments. Those who are raptured first are the firstfruits; the general harvest is the rapture after the great tribulation (1 Thes. 4; 1 Cor. 15). All the wheat will be harvested; it is just that some will be reaped first and others later.</P><P>The day of the Lord's coming is near. In the last days the believers need to endeavor in three great matters: (1) the eternal life, (2) the rapture, and (3) the reward. Concerning the first thing, we thank God that He has already done it for us. He has chosen us before the foundation of the world that we might have eternal life through Christ's death. The other two things require our own preparation. Rapture is related to our living-our watchfulness, endurance, and holiness. Reward is related to our work. But this distinction is not absolute, for both are mutually related. For instance, Philip was raptured (in type) while he was working (Acts 8:39).</P><P>Two passages of the Bible reveal the direct requirements for rapture. First, Revelation 3:10 mentions the keeping of the word of the Lord's endurance. When people revile the Lord today, the Lord endures and does not strike them to death with lightning. (This will not be so in the millennium-Zech. 14:17-19.) We need to stand in the same position with the Lord (Rev. 1:9), not loving glory, because the Lord has not received glory and was silent when rejected (Isa. 53:7). Second, Luke 21:36 says, "But be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail [or, be accounted worthy-KJV] to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man." We need to be watching at every time, not just for five minutes. In the dark night we should not sleep but should be able to discern the Lord's brightness and the world's darkness. We must always pray that we may be truly accounted worthy and considered qualified to participate in the first rapture. If we cannot refuse the blessings of this world, neither can we escape the calamities of the great tribulation.</P><P>The reapers are the angels, the sickle mentioned in Revelation 14. They do not refer to men; otherwise, the religious inquisitions carried out by the Roman Catholic Church would be approved. The tares will be burned up in the furnace of fire, that is, the lake of fire, beside the Valley of Hinnom (cf. Isa. 30:27-33; 31:9; Rev. 20:10; Isa. 66:23-24).</P><P>Matthew 13 speaks of three kingdoms: (1) the kingdom of the heavens (referring to the realm-v. 11); (2) the kingdom of the Son of Man (v. 41), referring to the millennial kingdom on the earth, which is for the Gentiles and the Jews; and (3) the kingdom of the Father (v. 43), referring to the heavenly millennial kingdom, which is for the believers and at which time the righteous will shine forth like the Lord as the Sun of righteousness. (During the tribulation, He will be the morning star.) Therefore, he who has ears to hear, let him hear.</P><P>The parable of the mustard seed: The mustard seed is not the seed mentioned in the first and second parables. Here the emphasis is on the mustard seed as the smallest seed. The Israelites usually use the mustard seed as a figure of the smallest (Matt. 17:20), just as we use dust as a figure.</P><P>Verses 31-32: The mustard seed signifies the principle of God's word of life. "A man" signifies Christ, while the "field" signifies the world. While men were unaware, the Lord sowed the word of God in the world. (In Palestine, the shortest mustard plants are about ten feet high, and the tallest are about fifteen feet high. The Lord used the mustard seed to signify the smallest thing becoming the largest thing.) Before 1828 the majority of Bible expositors said that the mustard seed signifies the outward prosperity of the church, for in just a short time the church had spread throughout Asia. They also said that the leaven signifies the inward prosperity of the church and that the three measures of meal signify the whole world. After 1828 people such as J.N. Darby rose up to criticize the error in this, because this kind of explanation was altogether unscriptural and was based merely on personal imagination. If the whole world could be improved, then there is no need to mention the tares in the previous passage, or to mention the fruitlessness of three-fourths of the soil. The subsequent passage concerning the species in the sea also is unnecessary. Furthermore, where in the Bible has God used the number three to represent the world? We can find only the numbers two (the Gentiles and the Jews) and four (every nation, all tribes, all peoples, and all tongues-Rev. 7:9) representing the whole world. According to the facts in the foregoing parables, we cannot expect the world to have a good result.</P><P>How then should we explain the parable of the mustard seed? From Genesis 1:11-12 we see that in God's creation everything is after its kind. Therefore, the vegetables will always be vegetables, and the birds will always be birds. Monkeys can never become human beings. Nevertheless, this mustard seed became a tree. This is contrary to God's will. Originally, the church was ordained to be the smallest, the weakest, and the least noticeable. However, the church has become Christianity, signified by the tree. Today the composition of Christianity is very complicated. This is due to the invasion of the church by Gnosticism during the second and third centuries, as portrayed in the second parable. From then on, under the hand of the Roman Catholic Church, the church brought forth many shameful things. Under one command, tens of thousands of soldiers were baptized in one day. By becoming Christians, people had the privilege to receive four ounces of silver and two changes of white raiment. Alas! The church became a tree! The birds of heaven signify the evil one, Satan (Matt. 13:4). He is most clever, and he knew where he could settle down. Therefore, how could he let this opportunity pass by? The Roman Catholic Church is truly absurd and thus becomes Satan's headquarters. The Protestant Church also follows in its footstep in things such as Christmas, which is a "bird" that "flew" from the Roman Catholic Church to the Protestant Church.</P><P>What do the birds denote? And what does the tree refer to? Daniel 4:20-22 speaks concerning the power and authority of Babylon. Ezekiel 31:3-6 speaks concerning the power and authority of the Assyrian king. Therefore, the tree here refers to the power and authority of this world, especially in relation to the political aspect. Birds denote sins, which come from Satan. Therefore, the sins in today's church actually include the sins of the entire world. What sin is not found in the church? The church has become Babylon, which is utterly in confusion. She is also like a large department store. Satan is most clever, and he devoured the seed (Matt. 13:4). However, he was not altogether successful. Therefore, he changed his tactics by causing the tree to grow larger so that all the birds could come and lodge there. This is, in effect, hanging up the signboard of Christianity but selling the medicine of Satan.</P><P>What has the Lord ordained for the church? First John 3:1 says that the world does not know us; Galatians 6:14 says that the world has been crucified; and 1 Peter 2:11 says that we are strangers and sojourners. What the Lord has ordained is so small, even having no relationship with the world. To the Christians the world is a pathway when they are alive and a tomb when they die. Mr. Panton once said something to this effect, "When I am living, the world is a pathway; when I die, the world at most will give me a coffin. If it does not give me that, I will not mind either." Actually, how did the church become great? (That is, how did the mustard seed grow to be a tree?) It is because her roots are very long, and they grow deeply into the earth to get nourishment. Thus, the world helps the church to grow. Therefore, a Christian should not obtain glory from the world. For example, the archbishop of the Anglican Church is a member of the House of Lords. When that happens, the mustard seed has become great. Vegetables and trees are different. First, vegetables are annual or biannual herbs, whereas trees are perennial plants. Today the church has lost her sojourning nature. Second, vegetables have leaves, and trees have branches. The church's enterprises are greatly advertised, and the church is divided into sects. Third, the roots of vegetables are only two to three inches deep, whereas the roots of trees are several times longer than their trunks and go down deeply into the earth. This indicates that the church is worldly and has been rooted in the world. Vegetables will die in two or three months, but the trees will not. This means that the church has lost her original attitude of looking to God. God desires the church to return to the principle in Genesis and be a vegetable. Unfortunately, the church prefers to be a tree. The church as a tree has merely an outward appearance and is without reality. Moreover, she has lost her chastity and is unable to lead the world to repentance. Satan is the one who gets the most profit. Hence, we must preserve our "smallness" and not admire others' greatness. Let us surpass others in suffering hardships and yield to others in enjoying comforts. We should have the mind, the determination, to suffer, which is more precious than actually going through the sufferings. We may be poor in our pocket so long as our spirit is not poor. The secret of overcoming is to stand in the position that the Lord has given to us. Saul considered himself to be small, and God used him (1 Sam. 9:21). Later on, when he became great, God turned to David (1 Sam. 15:30: 16:1). God seeks the small vessels, not the large ones (1 Sam. 10:21; Acts 9:15).</P><P>Verse 33: the parable of the leaven. In the entire Bible leaven signifies evil things. This is a principle in the Bible that cannot be overturned. (See Exo. 12:15, 19-20; 13:6-8; Lev. 2:4-5, 11; 6:17; 10:12; Deut. 16:3-4; Amos 4:4-5.) In the New Testament three kinds of leaven are referred to. The first kind is the teaching of the Pharisees (Matt. 16:12), which stressed the outward greatness of ceremonies and rituals. Those who keep rituals are proud of such greatness. The second kind of leaven is the teaching of the Sadducees, who did not believe in the supernatural. The Sadducees were like today's modernists, those who rebel against the Lord. The third kind is the leaven of Herod (Mark 8:15), referring to those who are worldly, who love political activities, and who persecute the church. Leaven refers to teachings or doctrines (Matt. 16:12); it also refers to conduct or morality (1 Cor. 5:6-8). The two are related. First there is the improper doctrine, and then there is the improper conduct. In the Bible woman represents religious organization. There are four women in the Bible whose names are not mentioned: Revelation 12, 17, 19, and Zechariah 5. They all represent religious organizations. The woman here refers particularly to the Roman Catholic Church. In a broader sense, she refers to those who preach or invent heresies. Three measures is the ordinary quantity needed for making meals (cf. Gen. 18:6; 1 Sam. 1:24); one ephah equals three measures (Judg. 6:19). The woman in Zechariah 5:7 is the woman in Revelation 17, which is the Roman Catholic Church and which will eventually move to Babylon. Meal, for making the meal offering, signifies Christ as food to His people. Three measures of meal signifies the manifestation of Christ. (The number one is the number of God, and the number three is the number of God's manifestation.) By combining the two together, it means that the Roman Catholic Church has mixed leaven with the pure food supply given by Christ to His people, so that the whole lump was leavened. In the future the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Church will be joined together. The church becomes prosperous through its heresies, such as the social gospel and modern beliefs. Hear the Lord's calling: "Come out from their midst and be separated" (2 Cor. 6:17). Again, "Come out of her, My people, that you do not participate in her sins and that you do not receive her plagues" (Rev. 18:4). Today there is leaven everywhere, and it can be contacted most easily. Hence, we must reject (1) the outward greatness and (2) the inward heresy.</P><P>Verses 34-35: Apart from parables the Lord spoke nothing to them. Because the Jews had rejected the Lord, the Lord spoke to them in parables (not as clear as when He spoke in plain words) so that they could hear but could not understand. Verse 35 shows that the word of Psalm 78:2 is thus fulfilled.</P><P>Verse 36: "Then, leaving the crowds, He went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, Make the parable of the tares of the field clear to us." Here, "leaving" should be rendered "sending away." Verses 1 through 35 are by the seashore, while verses 36 through 52 are in the house. The "house" here does not refer to Israel; it refers to the church because the disciples were in the house. Therefore, the seven great parables may be divided into two large categories: (1) the sowing, the tares, the mustard seed, and the leaven; and (2) the treasure, the pearl, and the net. The Lord first explained the parable of the tares because, as the first parable of the kingdom of the heavens, it is the most important and the broadest in scope. If one understands this parable, he can understand the others (see verse 51, which says that the disciples understood all these things). The parables spoken inside the house are more precious and intimate, because in speaking to His own people or close friends, He could surely speak in a deeper and more advanced way.</P><P>Verse 44:"The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden [past participle] in the field, which a man found and hid [past tense], and in his joy goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field" (the tense in the second half of the verse is changed to the present). The parables of the tares and the treasure are the most important and the richest in mystery.</P><P>Bible expositors interpret this parable mainly in the following ways. The first kind of interpretation is that the treasure signifies Christ and the field signifies the gospel, and therefore Christ is hidden in the gospel. The man represents the sinner who forsakes all to follow the Lord. If so, we may ask: (1) Since the gospel is for manifesting Christ, how can it be hiding Christ instead? (2) Where does the Bible refer to the field as the gospel? (3) What can a sinner buy? (4) Is Christ a piece of merchandise that one has to pay a price for? (5) Since He was found, why was He covered again? (This is altogether contrary to the fact.) (6) How is He covered? (7) If the gospel can be bought, can it be the gospel? The second kind of interpretation is that the field refers to the Bible, the treasure signifies salvation, and the man is the sinner. Salvation is hidden in the Bible, and when man finds salvation he forsakes everything to get it. We may ask: (1) Does the Bible hide salvation or make it manifest? (2) Is salvation found by man or is it preached to man? (3) Does one have to pay the price to understand the Bible? (4) How much must one pay to buy a Bible? (5) Can one definitely obtain Christ after he buys a Bible? (6) After he has gained Christ, why does he hide Him again? Is he afraid that Christ might be discovered by others? The third kind of interpretation is that the field signifies the world, the treasure signifies the church, and the man signifies Christ, who found the church and gave up everything to obtain her. We may ask: (1) When the Lord was on the earth, where and when did He discover the church? Or does it refer to the glory of the church? (2) When the Lord was on the earth, when did the church manifest her glory? The fourth kind of interpretation is that the treasure refers to sinners. However, (1) when the Lord was on this earth, sinners were everywhere, and thus there was no need to find them. (2) After He found the sinners, why would He hide them again?</P><P>The parable of the treasure. Since the Lord did not explain the treasure, we can find the explanation from other portions of the Scriptures. The treasures (or, storehouses) mentioned in 1 Chronicles 27:25 represent the glory of the kingdom of David. The treasure mentioned in Ecclesiastes represents the riches of the kingdom of Solomon. The glory of a kingdom lies in its treasures. Even during the period of theocracy (from Moses to the judges before Saul), the treasures also represented glory. When a kingdom is strong, the treasures are protected. But when a kingdom is weak, the treasures are captured. The field signifies the world. Why is the treasure hidden in the field? The glory of the kingdom of God has never been revealed on the earth. Furthermore, after the captivity of the Jews, God became the God of heaven. Man has not seen God's ruling of the universe. Even before the captivity, the glory of God's kingdom was hidden to men, with a few exceptions. From before the age of Moses, the kingdom of the heavens was always hidden until John the Baptist, who began to preach that the kingdom of the heavens was near. How long was the kingdom of the heavens hidden? From the creation of the world to the time of John (Matt. 13:35; 25:34). Who hid the glory of the kingdom of the heavens? God did (Prov. 25:2; Rom. 11:33-"depth" means "hiddenness").</P><P>Continuing the thought in the preceding section, the field is the world; otherwise, the Lord would have given another explanation. By this we know that the kingdom of the heavens will be related to the world. The kingdom of the heavens will appear on the earth (Zech. 14:5, 9; Psa. 8-a psalm of the kingdom, where verses 7-9 mention the whole earth). Its realm will be on the earth, but the part of the Lord's governing will be in the heavens, and the world will be destroyed after the kingdom. "Which a man found" refers to what the Lord did on the earth. When the world was in a time of confusion, there was a man crying in the wilderness, "The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near." The Lord also preached this message. Moreover, the teachings of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 5-7) and the power of the kingdom of the heavens (such as healing and miracles) all have been manifested. (Verse 44 does not imply the thought of seeking; it is merely a discovering.) The Lord discovered first; no other person discovered before Him. The "man" refers to Christ. The angels and the prophets could not reveal it (cf. Heb. 2:5-8). Afterward, the Lord hid it. The first half of this verse the Lord spoke in the past tense; from this point on, He used the present tense. From this we know that "hidden" and "found" were accomplished facts. But "hid" here and "sells" and "buys" in the last half of this verse are things to be carried out at the time of the Lord's speaking. Why was it hidden again? It is because of the Jews' rejection. From the middle of chapter eleven they began to reject, and in chapter twelve they carried out the rejection (see Matt. 11:20, 25). Therefore, the treasure is hidden. According to 13:41-44, this thing is now hidden. Afterward the Lord did not perform many miracles. (When He did, He did it for individuals.) The Lord Himself was also hidden (cf. John 8:59; 12:36; Luke 4:30). Why was He hidden? It was because something went wrong (that is, the Jews rejected Him) and because there was danger (Jer. 41:8); the children of Israel had evil intentions. The Lord hides Himself from the entire nation of the Jews, not from the individuals or disciples. The Lord forsook the entire nation of the Jews, yet He did not forsake individuals.</P><P>The Lord rejoices for the glory of the kingdom. (We may refer to Luke 10:17-18 and 21, the only place that records the Lord's rejoicing. The disciples went to preach the gospel and the power of the kingdom of the heavens; they rejoiced because the power of Hades was being cast into the bottomless pit-cf. Matt. 25:21, 23; Heb. 12:2). "In his joy goes" indicates that the Lord went to the cross in Jerusalem. This going is different from the going in verse 46. There it is to go out, to depart; here it is to go back, as in Matthew 5:24; 8:13; 9:6; 19:21; Mark 2:11; 6:38; 7:29; 10:21; John 3:8; 4:16; 6:21; 7:3. This proves that the place where the treasure is found is not in the house but in the field, that is, in the world. Therefore, He had to return to sell all that He had. This means that He had to pay the price and give up Himself. When the Lord came to the earth, He had forsaken a great part of His possessions (though not all), and on the cross He gave up even His life (see Acts 20:28; 2 Pet. 2:1; Rev. 5:9). The purpose of buying is for obtaining the treasure hidden in the field. However, the realm is the world (2 Pet. 2:1). Therefore, the unsaved also are bought. The Lord as the sin offering is for the believers; He is even the propitiation for the sins of the whole world (1 John 2:2). God has great expectations for the earth; therefore, He bought it. The kingdom in the future will be related to the earth-the kingdom will be on the earth (Rev. 11:15; Matt. 6:10) and the Lord's heart is also on the earth (Matt. 6:21). Hence, the Lord will come back to the earth to establish the kingdom of the heavens. In the Bible, when buying and selling are mentioned, sometimes neither the seller nor the cost is mentioned. The spiritual meaning cannot be too material.</P><P>Verses 45-46:Bible expositors have explained the parable of the pearl in the following ways. The first kind of interpretation, which began from the time of Luther and continues to this day, maintains that the pearl refers to Christ and the man represents the believers. But how can the believers buy Christ? Christ is the only Savior. How could He become a pearl of great value among the fine pearls? The second kind of interpretation is that the pearl refers to the choicest parts of the church, which are scattered among the churches. Men would forsake everything to seek for them in the churches. However, men do not need to sell all that they have in order to seek the truth. Both the rich and the poor can seek the truth. The third interpretation, which was given a hundred years ago, is that the pearl refers to the righteousness of God. The fourth interpretation is that the pearl refers to the church. This is partially correct, for the pearl does not refer to the substance of the church but to the parts of the church. Otherwise, the pearl and the church cannot be linked together.</P><P>The parable of the pearl should be interpreted as follows: The pearl signifies the beauty of the church. The beauty of the pearl is the expression of life, not something of human work. The stress of the treasure is more on the Israelites; another interpretation of the field is that it refers to the Jews. Pearls are produced in the sea, not in the field. The sea refers to the Gentiles, the multitudes of peoples. The mystery mentioned in Romans 11:25-26 is related to the Jews; the mystery mentioned in Ephesians 3:4-6 is related to the Gentiles. The treasure is something precious to a nation or a family; a pearl is something valuable to an individual. (Concerning the pearl, see the following references: Job 28:18; Matt. 7:6; 13:45-46; 1 Tim. 2:9; Rev. 17:4; 18:12; 21:21.) From these references we can see that pearls are ornaments for personal beautification and satisfaction. The Lord desires to obtain a good number of pearls. (Seeking the beauty of the pearl is the work of the Lord.) The Lord did not say that no other pearls were found; He only said that one pearl of great value was found. The beauty of the church surpasses everything (see Eph. 5:27). The church is glorious, having no spot or blemish (no stains of sin) or wrinkle (not getting old but staying fresh), just like the infants mentioned in Matthew 11:25. "One pearl of great value." "You have been bought with a price" (1 Cor. 6:20). "Sold all" points to the Lord's death. The beauty of the church is the ornament of the Lord. People will see and praise such a beauty.</P><P>The origin of the pearl is that it is produced out of an oyster, which is the ugliest animal. This is just like the church, which is produced out of a most humble Christ. The pearl is produced because of the presence of a foreign object inside the oyster. The oyster spreads over the object with mother-of-pearl. To produce a pearl, the oyster needs to be wounded. The roundness of a pearl completely depends on the tenderness of the oyster's body. The more tender the oyster is, the rounder the pearl is. Christ is most tender (Matt. 11:29). The pearl is in the sea. The pearl of a living oyster is not as good as that of a dead oyster. Therefore, the pearl divers would first kill the oyster. Diamonds are taken out of the mountains. After much grinding, they become shining. Pearls are formed by accretion. Their color is white, signifying pureness. (Even the Pharisees loved to counterfeit pureness-whitewashed graves.) Merchants surely seek pearls.</P><P>Verses 47-50:The parable of the net is the most easily misunderstood. The common interpretations of this parable are as follows: (1) The net signifies the gospel, the sea signifies the world, the fishermen signify the preachers, and the good and the foul species signify the good people and the evil people mixed in the church. (2) The sea is the Gentile world; the fishermen are the gospel preachers, who rescue the unbelievers from the world into the church; the vessels refer to the work in the churches, in which the foul ones are cast out but the good ones are kept in the vessels. According to this interpretation, it is not enough to be in the church only. This interpretation is close, but it is still wrong. During the medieval period, these two kinds of interpretation were very common; the Brethren also believed this.</P><P>This parable has two particular points: (1) Men signify angels (to say that men are gospel preachers is a contradiction to the Lord's explanation; otherwise, as in the preceding passage, the Lord did not have to give a specific explanation). (2) The time of drawing the net refers to the consummation of the age. By understanding these two points, we can see that the two earlier interpretations are definitely wrong. The mistakes of the first interpretation are as follows: (1) It is wrong to say that the fishermen are the preachers of the gospel, since those who cast the net are obviously those who draw the net. (2) "Cast" is in the past tense. (3) The drawing of the net will be at the consummation of the age and will occur only once. However, the gospel net today is being drawn all the time, even daily. (4) The number of times for the drawing-once and for all. (5) If the sea refers to the Gentiles, then this means that the church has only Gentiles and no Jews. (Romans 9:24 clearly says that there are Jews.) (6) The way of judging the tares is by binding them into bundles, which contradicts the way here of picking out one by one. The tares point to the gospel age; however, the foul fish do not refer only to false believers. Concerning the second interpretation, in addition to the preceding six points, the errors are as follows: (7) The net "was filled." But when is the gospel filled? (8) What does "shore" signify? (9) Gospel preachers are not allowed to choose. (10) The drawing of the net here is different from other places. In the text following, the Lord does not say "fish," but "species." (11) If this is the net of the gospel, it should be drawn daily. However, here it is drawn at the consummation of the age. (12) Men surely would not cast out the foul fish. (13) The Lord only said that we would gain people as fish, but He never said that the saved ones are like fish caught in a net (this kind of saying cannot be found in the Scriptures). How can one's being caught in a net be considered his being saved? Unless the fish are under oppression, they are not willing to leave their own place. (14) The gathering is voluntary and is beyond the expectation of the ones casting the net. (15) Drawing the net with the fish in it signifies the flesh leaving its own sphere. (16) The selecting is done in the net. However, the gospel does not judge people; it only accepts. (17) The "consummation" is the fullness of the time.</P><P>In drawing a comparison between the parable of the net and the parable of the tares, the parable of the tares stresses the beginning, in which men slept, whereas the parable of the net stresses the consummation, that is, the fullness of the time, and is therefore given as the final parable. In verse 47, the word "again" indicates that there is new light and, therefore, what follows must be different from the parable of the tares. Three-fourths of the world is sea, representing the Gentiles; one fourth is land, representing the Jews. The sea covered the earth, indicating that there were no chosen people in the beginning. The sea signifies the Gentiles (see Dan. 7:2-3; Isa. 60:5). The land is different from the sea because the land is solid and has substance that can be stood upon. In Numbers 23:9 the people who dwelled alone are different from the nations. In Genesis 22:17 the stars signify the church, and the sand signifies the Gentiles. The net was cast into the sea. The net is the gospel (see Rev. 14:6-13). The age is at its consummation, indicating that during the great tribulation, the angel will preach the eternal gospel, the gospel of judgment. The angel will preach the eternal gospel to the Gentiles. Both the believers and the unbelievers are in the net.</P><P>"Gathering from every species" refers to all the Gentiles (see Ezek. 47:10). "Species" here means "race" (see Mark 7:26). That the net "was filled" means that the gospel has been preached enough and the time also is sufficient. "Brought onto the shore" means that they were gathered by the word of God, and everyone was forced to leave his own place. "Sat down" means having authority (it does not imply rest, since there cannot be rest while fishing and selecting-1 Kings 1:13, 20; Matt. 5:1; 20:21) and executing judgment (Exo. 18:13; Judg. 5:10; John 19:13), the good ones being kept in the vessels and the foul ones being cast out (according to the distinction in Lev. 11:9-13). Here we see a separation of categories; this is different from the bundling of the wheat and the tares. "Furnace of fire." See Ezekiel 22:18-22 (cf. Isa. 31:5-6, 8-9; Mal. 3:18; 4:1; Isa. 30:33; 66:20, 23-24). The net was cast from the land, and it returned to the land (the earth signifying the Jews). The seashore signifies the area between the Jews and the Gentiles.</P><P>The good fish here are the "sheep," and the foul fish are the "goats," as mentioned in Matthew 25:31-36. The Gentiles who fear and glorify God, do good, and take care of the godly Jews and Christians will be the citizens in the millennium. The citizens in the millennium include the godly Jews and Gentiles. The righteous and the evil here are the righteous and the evil there.</P><P>Verse 51:"Have you understood all these things? They said to Him, Yes." (Matthew 1-13:51 constitutes the first major section, and 13:52 through chapter fourteen constitute the second major section.) The Lord asked this question because in speaking the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, He specifically desired that the disciples understand and that the blasphemers not understand at all (see Matt. 13:11-16). Therefore, the question asked here is a conclusion of verses 11-16.</P><P>Verse 52:The "scribe" refers to those who are familiar with the Old Testament. From this we know that the kingdom of the heavens is surely not the kingdom of the Messiah; otherwise, the scribes would have participated in it. "Every scribe discipled" means that the scribes were taught concerning the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens. (The kingdom of the heavens here refers to the church on the earth today.) The "householder" is the scribe. A house has a boundary, not in the open air but in the inner chamber (see S.S. 1:4). "Old" refers to the Old Testament, and "new," to the New Testament. There is authority in the house to bring forth new and old things, that is, the New Testament and the Old Testament. A "treasure" denotes a storehouse. What we speak should also be brought forth out of the treasure.</P><P>The main subject of the second major section (13:52-14:36) is the four things that the Lord accomplished after His rejection. Yet these things are still spoken in a hidden way. Within the second major section, we can further divide it into four smaller sections.</P><P>The first subsection of the second major section focuses on the rejection of the Lord by two kinds of people-the common people (the men of Nazareth) and the rulers (Herod).</P><P>Verses 53-54:The people of Nazareth acknowledged that the Lord's speaking was with wisdom and was accompanied by works of power, and they greatly admired Him. However, they were wrong when they asked, "Where did this man get ...?" If they acknowledged that the Lord had wisdom and did works of power, then they should have known that He came from God and should not have asked "Where did this man get...?"</P><P>Verse 55:"Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?" Because of their doubting in the preceding verse, they were led by the evil one into more erroneous thoughts. Because of the turn in this verse, such people became hopeless.</P><P>Verse 56:"And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this man get all these things?" The names of the sisters are not revealed. Some confess the Lord in the flesh; they know the Lord's parents, brothers, and sisters. Hence, they reject Him. Human beings like people or things that are mysterious; they think that someone who is powerful must also be mysterious. If someone is known by everyone, then he becomes common, having nothing extraordinary. This was the situation with the people of Nazareth. They thought that Christ must be mysterious and different from them. "But we know where this man is from; yet when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from" (John 7:27).</P><P>Verse 57:"And they were stumbled because of Him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house." The Lord was rejected by the Jews not only because He was too familiar to them, but also because He was not in a territory where prophets would be honored.</P><P>Verse 58:"And He did not do many works of power there because of their unbelief." This is an unfortunate word. Many people hindered the power of God because of their unbelief. God's works of wonders are limited only by our faith. God delights to perform works of power in us; unfortunately, our faith is insufficient. Our faith is like a water bucket, whereas God's power is like water in the well. Without the bucket, we can have no water. Today our faith is like a wicker basket that leaks out the power of God.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER FOURTEEN</H1><P>Verse 1:"At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus." (This section is on the rejection of the Lord by the ruler, Herod.) A tetrarch is a king under the emperor. Herod "heard the report concerning Jesus." This might have been because of the preaching carried out by the twelve disciples.</P><P>Verse 2:"And he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he has been raised from the dead, and because of this these works of power are operating through him." Herod recognized the Lord merely as John the Baptist and not as the Christ.</P><P>Verses 3-4:That was before the twelve disciples were sent forth to preach the word. Herod married his brother's wife and thus committed adultery. John spoke frankly to him. From this we see that we should not be careless concerning sin. This is the only place in the Bible that mentions the celebration of a birthday. To celebrate birthdays is not very good, for it easily gives rise to trouble. Sin easily enters when men indulge in pleasures. Herodias was obviously an adulteress. John was put in prison on account of her, for John had said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her" (see also Mark 6:18).</P><P>Verse 5:"And though he desired to kill him, he feared the crowd because they held him as a prophet." Early on, Herod desired to kill John, but he feared the crowd. After having contact with John, he realized that John was a righteous and holy man (Mark 6:20), because his conscience was touched by John's preaching. The king feared John and kept him safe (Mark 6:20). Although his conscience was touched, he could not stand against the power of Satan. In times like this, Satan is hiding behind the scenes to oppose the children of God. The same is true with us today; although our conscience functions, we do not have enough strength to resist sin.</P><P>Verse 6:"But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced in their midst and pleased Herod." Children should not be allowed to be exposed in public places. Today's parents should give heed to this matter.</P><P>Verse 7:"Hence, he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked." When one is at the peak of his pleasure, it is easiest for him to lose self-control. Herod's promising with an oath is an example of this.</P><P>Verse 8:"And she, being instigated by her mother, said, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist." The innocent daughter was instigated by her mother to request the head of John to be placed on a platter. Having this kind of education, this girl's entire life would be disastrous; surely she would become a vicious woman. Parents are responsible for their children in things such as movies, dancing, reading materials, etc.</P><P>Verse 9:"And the king was grieved, yet because of the oaths and those reclining at table with him, he commanded it to be given." Although the king's conscience was pricked, he was afraid of losing face. He would rather sin than lose his face.</P><P>Verse 12:"And his disciples came and took the corpse and buried it; and they came and reported the matter to Jesus." This verse shows us one of the principles of Christian conduct in the world. Without any noise or publicity, John's disciples buried the corpse; they only went and reported the matter to Jesus. The corpse was the evidence of John's having been treated unreasonably and an irrefutable proof of his having been falsely accused. When you suffer mistreatment, you should keep silent, hide the evidence, and report the matter to Jesus. But we are not like this. When we encounter such situations, we take delight in exposing the evidence of our having been wronged.</P><P>Verses 13-21:This portion is the second subsection within the second major section. The general thought here is that the Lord Himself had to die; the multiplying of the loaves signifies the Lord's death for us. John 6:1-14 records the same incident as this section. From John 6:26 on, the meaning of the multiplying of the loaves is explained. It does not mean to have some refreshments, but it actually signifies the Lord's death (John 6:35, 48, 51, 53-58).</P><P>Verses 14-16:Compassion is the Lord's nature. Regardless of how much He was rejected, He was always compassionate toward people. The disciples asked the Lord to send the crowds away. This means that they wanted people to leave the Lord. How improper that was! Often we also have the same kind of tone. Believers should not have an attitude of being irresponsible; rather, they should seek opportunity to be responsible and imitate the Lord Jesus' being responsible here. We should not be willing to make bricks only because we are under the leather whip. The Lord here not only preached but also ministered to people. The Lord was a rich poor man. "You give them something to eat." We believers should not act poverty-stricken or be poor rich men.</P><P>Verses 17-18:Why did the Lord ask the disciples to give them to eat? It was because the disciples had something. Regardless of how little, it must be given first to the prophet (1 Kings 17:13-14). So it is with the matter of donating money. "Bring them here to Me." Whatever is the least, after being put into the Lord's hand, will become the most.</P><P>Verse 19:"And after commanding the crowds to recline on the grass, He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed them and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds." Every loaf of bread that is placed in the Lord's hand will be blessed. However, after the blessing, there must be the breaking. People want the blessing but not the breaking. A grain of wheat falls into the ground, but unfortunately it is not willing to die. "If it dies" indicates that there is the possibility of not dying. Every loaf of bread that is in the Lord's hand will be broken. If it is not broken, the five thousand cannot be satisfied. Whenever and wherever we resist the Lord's breaking, we will be put aside by the Lord. Whenever the Lord accepts our consecration, He immediately begins to break us. Unfortunately, most of us cry out in pain. After the breaking, there is the need to distribute to the crowds. To distribute to the crowds requires power. If the believers would obey, after being broken they will spontaneously have the power. Sometimes after our consecration we encounter some unusual situations, such as losing our child or losing our wealth. This is the breaking. Ordinarily, there would be no breaking, but after consecration, there will be the breaking.</P><P>Verse 20:"And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve handbaskets full." Only after the loaves had been broken did the crowds all eat and become satisfied. When the Lord gives to people, He gives until they are fully satisfied. Another example of this is the living water becoming a spring and then also becoming rivers (John 4:14; 7:38). There were twelve handbaskets full of leftovers. This is a fact. Every time we offer something to the Lord for His use, there will always be an increase. Oftentimes after our work we sense a lack and thus need some spiritual cultivation. This is a great mistake if our life is like a car that is run by electricity, not by gasoline. The Lord was hungry, but after He gave the living water to the Samaritan woman, He Himself became full (John 4:6, 13-15, 32). Hence, we should feed others even when we ourselves are hungry; we must not be spiritually selfish. " Twelve handbaskets full." " Twelve" denotes eternal perfection, that is, the effectiveness of the Lord's death being eternally perfect. (The seven baskets full in chapter fifteen denotes the full perfection of God's Israel in the millennium.)</P><P>Verse 21:"And those who ate were about five thousand men, apart from women and children." Why were the women not counted? It is because the married women are one flesh with their husbands (see Gen. 2:24). Even if there were virgins, they needed to be hidden. As to the children, since they were not of age, they were not counted.</P><P>Verses 22-33:This portion is the third subsection of the second major section. It implies the Lord's resurrection, His ascension ("He went up to the mountain"), His intercession ("to pray"), the disciples' remaining on the earth, the great tribulation ("the fourth watch of the night," that is, the darkest period), and the Lord's coming back ("He came to them [the disciples]").</P><P>Verse 22:The "boat" is the church. The boat in the sea signifies that the church is in the world.</P><P>Verse 23:The Lord went up to the mountain to pray, signifying that He resurrected and ascended to the presence of God to intercede for the saints.</P><P>Verse 24:"Now the boat was already in the midst of the sea, being battered by the waves, for the wind was contrary." The wind being contrary signifies the persecutions that the church suffers in the world. That the Lord compelled the disciples to step into the boat means that He wants us to suffer trials in the world so that we may grow. This occurred in the night, meaning that after the Lord's departure from the world, the world has become dark, for the Lord is the true light (John 1:9; 9:5). The world has to wait until His second coming for the appearing of the morning star, the Sun of righteousness (Rev. 22:16; Mal. 4:2). Therefore, in the eyes of the Lord the church is a lampstand (Rev. 1:20) and the believers are the light of the world (Matt. 5:14).</P><P>Verse 25:"And in the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea." The fourth watch signifies the great tribulation, the darkest period. After the darkest time there will be the dawn. "Morning is coming, / But so also is night" (Isa. 21:12). This verse has the same meaning, that is, during the great tribulation the Lord will go to where the disciples will be.</P><P>Verses 26-27:Before this time people despised the Lord because He was not mysterious enough, and thus they did not believe Him (Matt. 13:54-57). But when the Lord became too mysterious, people were afraid of Him. Such was the case with the disciples. "Immediately" indicates the expression of the Lord's love; the Lord immediately comforted people.</P><P>Verses 28-31:This section concerns Peter's walking on the sea. We can see several principles here: (1) The Lord's calling needs our asking-"Command me to come to You" (v. 28). The believers should ask the Lord to command them. (2) The believers should imitate Peter's distinctive trait and his initiative in following the Lord. Peter came to the Lord by himself earlier than the other disciples did. (3) "Command me" (v. 28). This word indicates that Peter was obedient. (4) Although while in the boat Peter was bothered by the unsteadiness caused by the waves, he still made a move to advance farther. (5) "Come" (v. 29). This is the promise of the Lord's word. Without the Lord's promise, any move we take would be a senseless venture. People may say that Peter liked to be in the limelight. However, the Lord did not rebuke him; rather, He said, "Come," as a promise to him and also a commendation of him. (6) People think that there is security in the boat and that there is no need to walk on the sea to follow the Lord. However, we must know that the believers' life is altogether by faith. Corporately, it is easy to have faith; individually, it is difficult to have faith. However, faith is personal. Peter's walking on the sea was his personal faith, and it was praised by the Lord. (7) Taking risks is wrong. However, the believers should take risks based on the Lord's word. Such risks are risks of faith that produce experience and approvedness. (8) Since Peter did walk on the sea (that he did not sink immediately indicates that he could have succeeded in crossing), he should not have looked at the wind anymore. Since he had the word of the Lord, all the more he should not have looked at the wind. Once he looked at the wind, he immediately forgot the Lord's word. Without the Lord's word, he could not have walked on the sea even if the sea had been calm and unruffled. Since his walking on the sea did not depend on the wind or the waves, he should not have looked at them. When walking on the sea, one must look only at the Lord; then spontaneously he will not look at the wind and the waves. (9) The Lord expects to see that some will have an increase of faith to come down from the boat (the brothers and sisters in the church) and walk on the sea. (10) When one encounters the wind and waves, he must hold on to the Lord's word. The word of God is the sword of the Spirit, which is the only weapon used for active resistance. (11) Sometimes the believers do not have sufficient faith, yet the Lord's love is so great that He will still sustain them with His grace. (12) Before Peter began to sink, the Lord immediately stretched out His hand and took hold of him. (13) "You of little faith, why did you doubt?" (v. 31). Doubt comes from little faith. First there is little faith, then there is doubt.</P><P>Verse 32:"And when they got up into the boat, the wind ceased." " They" refers to Peter and the Lord. This was Peter's most satisfying and joyous experience.</P><P>Verse 33:"And those who were in the boat worshipped Him, saying, Truly You are the Son of God." Those who were in the boat could not help but worship the Lord.</P><P>Verses 34-36:This is the fourth subsection of the second major section. It is a prefigure of the Lord's return to the Jewish land in the millennium.</P><P>Verse 34:"And they crossed over and came to land at Gennesaret." Gennesaret means "the king's land of protection," that is, the kingdom. Jesus is already in the millennial kingdom.</P><P>Verse 35:"And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent word into all that surrounding region and brought to Him all who were ill." Since the Lord is the Lord Christ, He cannot hide His love, compassion, holiness, and righteousness. Can the believers be recognized as Christians? All those who were ill were healed simply by touching the Lord. How precious this is! Are all our prayers answered? I am afraid not. Even Paul's prayers were not all answered. Paul could not heal Timothy's stomach sickness (1 Tim. 5:23). Healing is a matter in the millennium.</P><P>Verse 36:"And they begged Him that they might only touch the fringe of His garment. And as many as touched were completely healed." It is not necessary to touch His hand. It is sufficient just to touch the fringe of His garment. When we pray, we also need to touch the Lord. Unfortunately, many people crowd around Him, but few touch Him. How does one touch the Lord? When we come to Him, we must not be purposeless. Many times our faith, motive, and words show that we are not touching the Lord but crowding around Him.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER FIFTEEN</H1><P>This chapter gives us a hint concerning the heart of God. The book of Matthew and the book of Mark both have the same goal, which is to cause people to know God's heart-He so loved man that He gave His only begotten Son. The Lord Jesus did not say directly that He is the Son of God, because He wanted to give people a hint concerning this. The Lord has already done many things in the past, but now He will continue to do things in order to give us sufficient evidence to know Him as the Son of God.</P><P>Verse 1:"Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem." The Pharisees were the pragmatists, whereas the scribes were the theologians. Originally, these two groups did not agree with each other, but here they joined together to trouble the Lord. From this we can realize that the Lord has the influence and the balancing power. If the Lord did not have the influence, they would not have had to join together. Jerusalem was the center of religion as well as the center of rebellion. Therefore, the Lord wept for Jerusalem (Luke 19:41). However, in Matthew 2 Herod and the people of the entire city were troubled; they did not welcome the Lord. This was the reason that during the final week the Lord did not stay in Jerusalem. Rather, He stayed in a home in Bethany, a home that had life, love, and service.</P><P>Verse 2:"Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread." These people had already questioned Jesus concerning the transgression of the commandment (see ch. 12), but they had failed. Therefore, they questioned Him now concerning tradition. Tradition may be kept, but it must not be considered as having any power in itself, much less should it be considered equal to the word of God. People often consider tradition as the word of God. Because the Lord saw such harm, He purposely transgressed tradition, although He knew hygiene.</P><P>Verse 3:"And He answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?" Refer to Mark 7:7. What the Lord was arguing with was whether their tradition could replace the word of God. The common traditions in this age, such as not shopping on the Lord's Day, are taught by men as teachings; therefore, such people worship the Lord in vain.</P><P>Verses 4-6:Whether it is man's tradition or a supplement to the word of God, after a short time people emphasize tradition and make void the commandment of God.</P><P>Verse 5:"A gift to God." This is the "corban" (Mark 7:11). There are two kinds of offerings: (1) a direct offering to God (such as putting money into the offering box), and (2) an offering like that of Jephthah's. (This is like making a vow, a personal offering. For instance, if a person became ill and he vowed to God that he would not eat meat or spend money, then his parents could not eat meat or spend money.) The vow of Jephthah (Judg. 11:29-40) was a corban that violated the commandment regarding not killing. This is to transgress the commandment of God because of men's tradition which is against God's judgment. The prayer book of the Anglican Church is tradition, and they place it above the Bible today. Anything that is placed together with the commandment of God is liable to be higher than it. Those in the Anglican Church would rather have idol worshippers as their teachers than those who have been baptized. The Jews would rather keep corban and abolish the commandment of God. We often say, "The Bible says thus, but..." This but leads to trouble; this is the teaching of tradition.</P><P>Verse 7:"Hypocrites! Well has Isaiah prophesied concerning you." To be hypocritical is not to be truly evil; it is to be falsely good. False good is worse than true evil.</P><P>Verse 8:"This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart stays far away from Me." Anyone who advocates the authority of tradition honors God with his lips, but his heart stays far away from Him.</P><P>Verse 9:"But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as teachings the commandments of men." Since their heart is far away from God, their worship of God is in vain. God desires His worshippers to worship in spirit and truthfulness (John 4:24).</P><P>Verse 10:"And He called the crowd to Him and said to them, Hear and understand." He said this not merely to the scribes and Pharisees but also to the multitude. This word is also for people today. What He spoke concerned not merely the tradition of the washing of hands but also all traditions.</P><P>Verse 11:"It is not that which enters into the mouth that defiles the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man." Man's evil is not on the outside but on the inside. Therefore, there is no need to wash the hands. Only that which proceeds out of the mouth defiles the man.</P><P>Verse 12:"Then the disciples came and said to Him, Do You know that the Pharisees were stumbled when they heard this word?" Because the Pharisees had prejudice in their hearts, they were stumbled.</P><P>Verse 13:"And He answered and said, Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up." (1) The Lord acknowledged that traditions come from men. (2) All traditions will one day be rooted up by God. Let us not wait until that day to have them rooted up. (3) "Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted" refers to the teachings of the Pharisees. May all our teachings of tradition be rooted up today and not wait until the day when we will stand before the judgment seat. (4) From this verse we can realize that all heresies of men will be removed.</P><P>Verse 14:"Let them be. They are blind guides of the blind; and if a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit." "Let them be" indicates that the Lord was not anxious. Time will prove what is real and what is false. We are just the opposite; we are most anxious. Not only the Pharisees but even the crowd who heard the Lord's speaking that day were blind. A blind man guides a blind man-whoever follows a blind man must also be a blind man himself. One who sees will not follow a blind man. Those who love excitement like to listen to those who love excitement, and those who are cloudy-minded like to listen to those who are cloudy-minded. Those without sight always like to lead; those without learning like to instruct others; those without foundation in the Bible love to preach (their preaching may be likened to holding an exhibition, showing that they have this and that); and those who are ignorant of God's will love to tell others about God's will. In the whole world who makes rash moves? Only the blind do; they are most subjective.</P><P>Verses 15-20:"This parable" is the parable of a blind man leading a blind man, referring to the washing of hands. The heart is the source of evil. The traditions of the Pharisees require people to wash their hands until they are clean and white, but such traditions ignore the fact that the people's heart remains defiled. One does not need to go to Africa to find a savage; savages are everywhere in America, England, China, Japan, etc. This section shows (1) how defiled man's heart is, (2) how loving God's heart is, and (3) that it is the heart that needs cleansing; this is not an outward need. The foregoing passage speaks concerning man's heart being defiled, whereas the following passage speaks concerning God's heart. If we do not know man's heart, neither can we know God's heart.</P><P>Verse 21:"And Jesus went from there and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon." Because He desired to leave those hypocritical ones, the Lord withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon, which were places cursed by God (see Isa. 23; Joel 3:4). God openly cursed Tyre and Sidon through the prophets. The Lord preferred to leave the secret sinners to go to the open sinners. "The parts" means the realm. Although we do not live in Tyre and Sidon, we are in that realm.</P><P>Verse 22:"And behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried out, saying, Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter suffers terribly from demon possession." This Canaanite woman belonged to the race of the Canaanites, who were also cursed (Gen. 9:25-26). She came out from a cursed place. "Lord" is a cry for mercy; "Son of David" is a cry by mistake. The Son of David had nothing to do with a Canaanite woman.</P><P>Verse 23:"But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and implored Him, saying, Send her away, for she is crying out after us." If the Lord were only the Son of David, He could have nothing to do with the Gentiles. This woman was standing in an improper position to lay hold of the Lord. Hence, when we pray, we should not be careless in the way we address the Lord. The disciples were impatient with the bothersome woman, so they asked the Lord to fulfill her desire quickly.</P><P>Verse 24:"But He answered and said, I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." All the works of the Lord on the earth were for the Jews; His open works for the Gentiles would begin in the house of Cornelius. Until then the Lord's works toward the Gentiles were only suggestive. Even in His going to the house of Israel, He went only to the lost sheep (the remnant). Why did the Lord speak such a word? He wanted to give the woman a handle. The Lord was sent only to the house of Israel. Now, since He was to go to the lost sheep, the realm had become much broader. Was the woman not a lost sheep? Could she not receive grace? All she needed to do was to admit that she was a lost sheep. The Lord stayed at a far distance to allow her to think. His not answering was not a refusal; rather, it was a silent permission. Although the Lord did not open His mouth at that time, His heart was beating unceasingly, and He was eager to give grace. However, since the woman did not stand in the position of a sinner, it was inconvenient for the Lord to answer her request. God's silent delay is not a rejection. When our God delays, it is not that He rejects us; rather, He is waiting for us. After the Lord speaks one sentence, He stops. But within, He eagerly expects and loves us immensely. His outward distance is not a real distance.</P><P>Verse 25:"But she came and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, help me!" This woman began to realize the handle of the Lord's word, and she held on to it. She thought, "Oh, I thought that all the Israelites were moral and good people. Little did I know that they are lost sheep. Since this is grace, there is not the limitation of position. Although I am a sinner under the curse, I am also a lost sheep and therefore may receive grace." The Lord Jesus brought the entire nation of Israel down to the same level as Tyre and Sidon-all are sinners. Now she called the Lord only "Lord" and eliminated the title "Son of David," for she now understood what salvation was.</P><P>Verse 26:"But He answered and said, It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs." This was the first time the Lord answered the woman directly. The previous word was spoken indirectly to the woman but directly to the disciples. The Lord likened the Jews to sheep and the Gentiles to dogs. Only the Israelites are qualified to be God's flock; they are the Lord's sheep mentioned in John 10. The "other sheep" are the Gentiles who are saved. Not all Jews are sheep, but the Jews considered themselves as sheep. Therefore, the Lord said that they were lost sheep. The Gentiles thought that they too were sheep, but the Lord said that they were dogs. A sheep has divided hoofs (outward cleanliness) and chews the cud (inward cleanliness). This woman considered herself a sheep, yet the Lord said that she was a dog and refused her. However, He still did not give her up; rather, He again gave her a handle to hold on to.</P><P>Verse 27:"And she said, Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table." In saying, "Yes, Lord," the woman acknowledged that what the Lord had spoken was right and that she was wrong. In Greek there are two different words for dog. One is used in reference to wild dogs and the other is used in reference to domestic dogs. Here the word used is that for domestic dogs. The Lord gave her the handle of His word, and she held on to it. What she meant was this: "Although I am a dog, I am Your dog. Since I am Your dog, I can eat the crumbs."</P><P>Verse 28:"Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you as you wish. And her daughter was healed from that hour." The Lord here addressed her as "woman," and He first praised her and then gave her what she had asked. (The way of the Lord's rewarding is also first by praising and then by giving-Matt. 25:21, 23). The Lord's heart leaped because He greatly marveled at her faith. God's delay and God's trial are training schools of our faith. The longer the delay in answering, the greater the faith. "Son of David" denotes a natural relationship. If you consider that your behavior is good and that your conduct is not bad, then God will give you up. If you are willing to humble yourself and stand in the position of a dog, God will bless you. May we learn from this passage how to pray and hold on to the handle of God's word. (This portion speaks of the heart of the Gentiles.)</P><P>Verses 29-31:The Lord returned to the midst of the children of Israel. The Lord went first to the Jews, then to the land of the Gentiles, and then back to the midst of the children of Israel. The Jews need to repent and the Gentiles need to believe. This portion is a type of the beginning of the millennium. At that time the Lord will return to the midst of the Jews. Realizing that they are sick, the Jews will come to the Lord. Then the Lord will heal and save them. (Healing is a manifestation of the power of the millennium.) The children of Israel will glorify God because of the Lord.</P><P>Verses 32-39:In the preceding passage what the woman ate was crumbs. But now the Lord was preparing a feast, signifying the grace and riches in the kingdom. There is not one age in which the number of saved ones is greater than during the millennium. Five thousand is the number of responsibility. Four (signifying the created man) comes from three (signifying the Creator). This means the creatures come out of the Creator. Four thousand represents a great number. "Five loaves" is the number of responsibility; "two fish" signifies testimony. "Seven loaves" is the number of completeness; "seven baskets" signifies great abundance. There is another precious and significant thing, and that is that the Lord Jesus was also without anything to eat for three days. The Lord knew how to stand on the same position as man. We may listen to the Lord's speaking for three days and not feel hungry; the Lord can speak for three days and not feel hungry. For others, after three days He performed the miracle of multiplying the loaves. However, for Himself, after forty days of not eating He would not make the stones become loaves of bread (Matt. 4:2-4). In caring for others we should have compassion and put ourselves in their position. However, toward ourselves, we should be strict and exercise selfrestraint. Whether the Lord would or would not do something, both were miracles. He did not want to see the people go away hungry.</P><P>At present there are two kinds of people. One is the kind who are given to social service. The other is the kind who care only for spiritual needs. Both are wrong. The latter kind are the ones spoken of by James, who have faith only, but no works. It is most natural to have a compassionate heart, unless, as John said, one shuts up his affections (1 John 3:17). Therefore, to help the brothers in material things is something that every believer should endeavor to do. Those who say, "Where can we get so many loaves?" (v. 33), are people who look at circumstances. The first lesson of faith is to remove doubts. Not one prayer of faith ever asks such a question. As long as God has spoken, that is good enough. The loaves given by the Lord to the disciples signify resurrection life. The loaves of bread originally in the disciples' hands would never have increased, but after they were broken by the Lord, the leftovers filled seven baskets (seven being the number of greatest abundance). When life is dealt with by the cross, it is no longer natural but supernatural, and it is multiplied.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER SIXTEEN</H1><P>Verse 1:"And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing Him asked Him to show them a sign out of heaven." The Pharisees and Sadducees had a new agreement. In chapter fifteen the Pharisees and the scribes were joined together. The Pharisees and scribes were not absolutely opposing one another, but the Pharisees and the Sadducees were opponents of one another, yet they came in one accord to test the Lord. They tested the Lord because of unbelief. The gimmicks of the unbelieving ones are the same. In chapter twelve the Pharisees and the scribes asked for a sign because of unbelief. Why then did they ask for a sign again? The Pharisees, the scribes, and the Sadducees were Jews specializing in asking for signs. The sign they asked for in chapter twelve was to satisfy their own curiosity. Here it was purely for testing the Lord and not necessarily for them to see the strangeness of a sign. The Lord kept His former decision and would not change. People in the world make improvements, but the Lord does not, for He is perfect (Heb. 13:8) and His thought never changes. Testing means unbelief. To have faith is to believe in God's word. Without God's word, man has only sin-unbelief and disobedience. Unbelief is the root, and disobedience is the issue. To test the Lord is an indication of one's not believing in Him. It seems that the Pharisees and the Sadducees were saying, "We will not believe unless you perform something for us to see." This is just like people in the world wanting to see God before they believe in Him, or like a school testing the students before admitting them. But the Lord will never perform a sign to subject Himself to be tested by men. The Lord can perform signs, but not to be examined or controlled by men. He will not attract the unbelieving ones by performing signs for them.</P><P>Verses 2-3:Because they talked about heaven, the Lord spoke on the same thing. He rebuked them, saying that they could discern the signs in the sky yet could not discern the signs of the times. The Lord acknowledged that they were scientists. The unbelieving ones today are the same. In the Lord's eyes they know only that a certain cause produces a certain effect, but they do not know the signs of the times. It is very easy for people to neglect the signs of the times. It is most unfortunate that the signs are present, yet people do not see them. Their self-satisfaction (just like the scientists') makes them blind. Since signs already exist, the Lord would no longer perform other signs. The sign at this time is the cross.</P><P>Verse 4:"An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah. And He left them and went away." The sign of Jonah testifies of the Lord's death and resurrection. Jonah had to leave his own place; the Lord did the same. "Evil" here refers to man's nature; "adulterous" denotes improper communications. From this we see that not only one but everyone is evil. Therefore, the Lord left them.</P><P>Verses 5-6:To beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees is to beware of the temptation of the Pharisees and Sadducees. The teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees is like leaven, which has the possibility to ferment. They said things and did not do them; they tried to reform others, but they themselves would not be reformed (Matt. 23:3). Therefore, we need to be careful in making friends. The unbelievers and the ungodly ones can contaminate us and leaven us. The Pharisees represent the dead conservatives, while the Sadducees represent the modernists. The leaven here means to ask the Lord to do something first before one will believe (or do a certain thing); this is tempting the Lord. The Lord warned us because it is possible that we might become leavened.</P><P>Verse 7:"But they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we did not take bread." The disciples were puzzled. They misunderstood the Lord because they thought leaven was for making bread. This is a misinterpretation of the Bible, thinking that leaven is related to bread. This kind of erroneous logic is most common today. This kind of misinterpretation also shows their unbelief and their foolishness. Even if they did not take bread, would the Lord have said such a word? The disciples forgot the case of the Lord's multiplying the loaves. Subjectiveness easily leads to misinterpretation.</P><P>Verses 8-12:Nothing can be hidden from the Lord. To have little faith is not to be without faith. But the Lord is not satisfied with those who have little faith. Reasoning indicates little faith. When men misinterpret the Scriptures, it is always their fault, not God's. The summary of 15:1-16:12 is that this generation must beware of the leaven of the Pharisees.</P><P>Verses 13-20:From this point on, the Lord began to reveal Himself; prior to this time He had only given hints concerning Himself. The phrase "from that time" in verse 21 is the center, the backbone, of the book of Matthew. Caesarea Philippi derived its name from Caesar and Philippi; the latter was the brother of Herod. This is a strange way to derive a name. The church is built at the center of the Gentile land.</P><P>Verse 13:"Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?" Why did the Lord call Himself the Son of Man? Names are quite important in the Scriptures. In the Epistles the Lord is called mainly the Lord Jesus or Jesus Christ because salvation has been accomplished. In the Gospels He is called the Son of God or the Son of Man because salvation was not yet accomplished. In Acts He is called God's Servant (3:13) until the time of the incident at the house of Cornelius. "The Son of Man" indicates that (1) He was rejected, (2) He was glorified for our sake, and (3) He is a man. Here it refers to the matters after the Lord was rejected.</P><P>Verse 14:"And they said, Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets." John was very much like one who rendered service to people, Elijah was most zealous for religion, and Jeremiah was most pessimistic. No one would acknowledge (believe) that the Lord was the Christ. John had testified that the Lord was the Son of God, yet people still said that He was a prophet.</P><P>Verse 15:"He said to them, But you, who do you say that I am?" Today the Lord is asking us also, "How would you answer?" Are you a religionist, a social worker, a philosopher, or a revolutionist? Even if you say that He is a prophet, He is still not satisfied. Do you confess that He is the Christ?</P><P>Verses 16-17:Bar means "son" and jona means "dove"; hence, Barjona means having the revelation of the Holy Spirit. People's observation of the Lord and their discussion about Him were inaccurate because they did not have the revelation of God. They went only by their own view, and therefore, the Lord was not satisfied. At this time the Lord again asked the disciples. When Peter answered as he did, that was the time of his regeneration (1 John 5:1; 4:15). The name Christ means that He is the One in whom God's hope (or plan) is accomplished. Peter said, "You are the only One who accomplishes God's hope and plan." Whenever the name Christ is mentioned, it is related to the Lord's work. Whenever the title the Son of God is mentioned, it is related to the Lord's person and His personal glory. The Lord has threefold glory: (1) personal glory, the glory He has in eternity as God; (2) human glory, the glory He had on the earth as a man; and (3) moral glory. Peter always spoke (see 1 Peter); his acknowledging signifies two things: (1) the Lord's work and person, and (2) his own regeneration. Simon was Peter's old name. Barjona means the son of the Holy Spirit; this indicates being born of the Spirit. We are blessed if we confess the Lord as Christ, for such confession indicates that we have received the revelation of the Holy Spirit. It is wrong to trust in theology or mere preachings. We are Christians not by reasoning but by revelation (see Gal. 1:16). God has given us four great revelations: (1) the revelation of nature, such as the heavens, the sun, the moon, and the stars; (2) the Book-the Holy Scriptures; (3) the most --the Holy Spirit; and (4) Jesus. The revelation of the Holy Spirit is most important, for without it, no one can be saved.</P><P>Verse 18:"And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it." "Also say." One thing has been said already; now He will go on to the second thing. By this word we know that at that time the building of the church had not begun. Peter (Petros) means "a little stone." Here rock in Greek is Petra, meaning "a large stone." Therefore, these are two different kinds of stones. The church cannot be built on Petros; no one builds a house on a small stone. Peter was only a small stone; the rock (Petra) is the Lord Jesus (1 Pet. 2:7-8). Peter confessed the Lord and therefore became a small stone. Hence, whoever confesses the Lord is also a small stone, that is, a living stone to be built into a spiritual house, the church, the dwelling place of God (1 Pet. 2:5). This rock is the Lord Christ whom Peter confessed. If the rock was Peter, the church would have been in great jeopardy when he trembled at the sight of a maid and denied the Lord three times. Without such a confession, there can be no church. The eunuch first had to confess before Philip would baptize him. The church (ekklesia) is a called-out congregation. This congregation is called out and separated unto holiness, that is, separated from the world, sin, temper, etc., as the fruit of the Spirit. Therefore, every saint is holy and every saved one is sanctified. Hebrews 9:13-14 says that we are sanctified by the blood.</P><P>"Gates of Hades." Gates are entrances and exits. Hades cannot block the coming in and going out; death cannot hold the believers or the church, for the incorruptible life has been manifested in man (2 Tim. 1:10). The body of Christ: (1) the Lord's physical body, which expresses the Lord's divine life; and (2) the church on the earth which the Lord put on after His resurrection and ascension. Hence, the church is the place where the Lord deposits His life today. Because the incorruptible life has come out from Hades, the Lord has the authority to allow life to freely come in and out of Hades. The Lord has put into the believers the life that cannot be held by Hades. This means that He has regenerated them. We already have this life, which cannot be held by Hades. We will also be resurrected first, because we have this life. The life of the unbelievers is seized by Hades after their death. Resurrection means a life that cannot be held by death. This is also true while we are in our body today. The environment may be deplorable-trials, persecutions, violence, killings, etc. It seems that we have walls all around us. Yet we have the life that cannot be held back, and no environment can overcome us.</P><P>Verse 19:"I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in the heavens." This verse is easily misinterpreted. Were the keys of the kingdom of the heavens given only to Peter? Does the binding refer to forgiveness of sins? The Catholic Church has this kind of wrong interpretation, and so does the Anglican Church. They both believe that the church has the authority to forgive sins. Are the keys (the Greek word being plural in number) (1) for the Jews-at Pentecost, and (2) for the Gentiles-at the house of Cornelius? Different people do not make the keys different. One does not have one kind of key for Mr. Wong and another kind of key for Mr. Lee, for the same door. Verse 18 mentions the gates of Hades, which are versus the gates of the kingdom of the heavens. The subject in verse 18 is the church, whereas the subject in verse 19 is the kingdom of the heavens. The church in verse 18 is to be built by the Lord, and the kingdom of the heavens is to be built by men. Here it does not say "The keys of the church" but "The keys of the kingdom of the heavens." Otherwise, Peter would have truly become a pope. The church is built by the Lord, and it is constituted of those who have been regenerated, who have received life, and who have the inspiration of the Spirit. This is not something revealed by flesh and blood but by the Father who is in the heavens. In the kingdom of the heavens God gives us the right to be believers. Yet in this kingdom of the heavens we have our duty and responsibility as disciples. Here it seems that the Lord was saying to Peter, "You can bring people into the kingdom of the heavens." (To say that he brought people into the church is the greatest blasphemy.) This was the first step, the first thing that brought men into the kingdom of the heavens. This key was in Peter's hand. The first few things used by Peter to bring people into the kingdom of the heavens are seen in Acts. (1) Peter had the key of testifying-his preaching on the day of Pentecost. (2) He had the key of baptizing people-he charged people to be baptized into Christ (Rom. 6:3), to be in subjection to His command and thus to obey Him. Therefore, in Matthew 28:19 the Lord tells us to "disciple all the nations"; this is the first key. Then He tells us to baptize them into the name of the Triune God; this is the second key. Therefore, a person who is not baptized is in the church but not in the kingdom of the heavens (see Matt. 21:31-32; cf. Acts 2:47; 16:5, which say that the Lord added to the church daily). Preachers can only bring people into the kingdom of the heavens, which is the business office of the church. There may be tares in the kingdom of the heavens, but not in the church.</P><P>These keys of the kingdom of the heavens were given not only to Peter but also to the other disciples. Moreover, they are also given to us. Only when we have the keys do we have the authority to bind (i.e., not to open) and the authority to loose (i.e., to open). Matthew 18:18 gives the same promise. This proves that the keys are given also to others. The "you" in Matthew 18:18 is plural and refers not to Peter alone but to all those who are in the church. Therefore, we also have these keys. Since Peter's keys were for preaching and baptizing, ours are the same. As the first one to be regenerated and the first one to confess the Lord, Peter was qualified to receive the keys first and to begin preaching the gospel and baptizing people. We have the authority not to preach the word and the authority not to baptize someone (if in our consideration such a one is not saved and therefore should not be baptized), because the keys are in our hands. The confession of Christ is the rock (petra), the foundation. The church and the kingdom of the heavens cannot be separated, though they can be distinguished. A person may be in the kingdom of the heavens, but he may not be in the church. In Matthew 28 the eleven were only disciples; they were not apostles yet (apostleship is a gift in the church). In the entire Bible there are two lines: (1) the church and (2) the kingdom of the heavens. The two are distinct but not separate.</P><P>Verse 20:"Then He charged the disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ." The Lord as the Son of God should be mentioned to anyone. But the Lord as the Christ should not be mentioned to certain groups of Jews, those who blasphemed the Holy Spirit. The Son of God is eternal, whereas Christ is for the fulfillment of God's plan. Therefore, there is no need to mention this to the Jews who rejected the Lord. This also proves that from the time they blasphemed the Holy Spirit, recorded in 12:24, the Jews were rejected by the Lord.</P><P>Verse 21:"From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised." Here, "from that time" means after Christ was confessed and the church was revealed. The death that the Lord referred to is not the redeeming death but the death by the suffering of persecutions and the death by being rejected. (According to the Bible, the Lord's death has two aspects. The conservatives hold to the redeeming death, while the modernists hold to the death of rejection.) Many of the Lord's sufferings were not for redemption but were due to His being rejected by men. The Lord prophesied here only concerning His death by rejection. The same prophecy was spoken three more times in the latter chapters. From that time on He no longer hinted but spoke plainly concerning His death by rejection. Verse 13 gives a hint that the Lord would be rejected and would suffer death; the words "from that time" signifies a great turning point, a great backbone in Matthew.</P><P>Verse 22:"And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord! [or, God forbid it, Lord!] This shall by no means happen to You!" Peter took the Lord aside, acted according to his old disposition, and without careful consideration he quickly rebuked the Lord. The Lord will not be persuaded by men and will never accept teaching from men. Peter's persuasion came out of his affection, his love; it is similar to our urging those we love not to suffer. An unrestrained mind is dangerous, but an unrestrained emotion is even more dangerous. Peter acted impulsively according to his unrestrained emotion. Apparently it was good, but in reality it was a hindrance that the Lord hated. When we try to dissuade people from taking the narrow way, it is just like Peter trying to dissuade the Lord Jesus. We also say, "God forbid it!"</P><P>Verse 23:"But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men." The Lord would not forgive Peter's mistake, nor would He accept Peter's kindness. "He turned" shows that Peter was at the Lord's back. It must have been that Peter came from behind the Lord and took Him aside. Speaking behind people is usually wrong. "Get behind Me." This is strange since Peter was already behind Him. It means that the Lord would not give Peter the opportunity to speak. Whoever tries to teach or help the Lord is surely wrong, for He is perfect. (We can give two examples of how the disciples tried to teach the Lord: "You see the crowd pressing upon You" (Mark 5:31) and "They have no wine" (John 2:3).) This is the Lord's moral glory. Peter had just received the regenerated life, yet immediately he was trapped and utilized by Satan. The victory at Jericho is followed immediately by the defeat at Ai. Therefore, we should be especially on our guard after any victory. Anything that prevents people from going to the cross is from Satan. "Get behind Me!" This was because Peter was a stumbling block that caused others to be stumbled and stopped from going on. The Lord considered Peter's frustrating as something of Satan. Whoever sets his mind on the things of men is of Satan. Satan is very close to men. Perhaps he has already been in and out of our mind today fifty times.</P><P>Verse 24:"Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me." If we interpret the cross here as redemptive in nature, then we cannot follow the Lord, for how can we have a part in the redemptive work? Only the high priest can enter the Holy of Holies. Therefore, redemption is the Lord's work alone. The cross is not only for redemption but for suffering-obedience in persecutions. The Lord calls us to suffer, not to accomplish redemption. Here it is a matter of following Jesus, not of believing in Jesus. Believing puts us in the church, and following enables us to be in the kingdom. To believe and not to follow is most dangerous. Following is the cheapest price we pay. The least requirement of the Lord to us is that we deny ourselves, that is, that we follow Him. We need to reject our own mind and seek to satisfy God's will. To deny ourselves equals taking up our own cross. There are two kinds of crosses: (1) the cross of Christ for redemption (John 11:50-52), and (2) the cross of sufferings-the cross ordained by God for each believer. The cross that the Lord arranges for each believer is different. Although the ways are different, they are the cross just the same. The cross is the blows we suffer on our way. After we have been saved, we desire to take one way, but God wants to take another way. May God's blows be always upon us. The Lord is teaching us through Peter. He rebuked Peter for setting his mind on the things of men, that is, for disobeying the blows that come from God. The denial of self is the only condition for following the Lord. To deny the self, which is negative, is to refuse to mind our own things. To take up the cross is to endure the pain in our refusing to mind our own things. To follow the Lord is to take the Lord's way, to obey Him.</P><P>If we want to save our soul in this age, we will lose it in the coming age; if we lose our soul in this age, we will save it in the coming age. The soul includes the mind, the will, and the emotion. To save our soul is to satisfy our mind, will, and emotion in this age, that is, to not deny the self. To lose the soul in this age is to deny the self, which is the opposite of saving the soul. He who sacrifices for the Lord loses his soul. Whoever does not want to lose his soul today will lose the satisfaction of his soul in the kingdom, just like the one-talented slave who will be weeping and gnashing his teeth in the kingdom. Those who enjoy the pleasures in the world, who do not labor for the Lord, and who, instead of wiping their sweat with their handkerchief use it to wrap up their talent, will lose their soul, that is, suffer shame, in the millennium, though they will still have the eternal life. To gain the soul in the future is to have the enjoyment in the kingdom, that is, to receive glory.</P><P>Verse 26:"For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life?" Why take the trouble to gain the whole world, that is, the wealth and glory of the world, yet lose the glory of the kingdom of the heavens? What can we give in exchange for our soul? In the Lord's eyes those who save their soul today are the most foolish.</P><P>Verse 27:"For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each man according to his doings." From here on the Lord called Himself mainly the "Son of Man," signifying sufferings. "Then" proves that what is mentioned earlier in this passage will take place in the future. "Doings" refers to saving the self today or losing the self for the Lord. The doings are the basis for the reward and have nothing to do with the eternal life. (We should take note that this portion is concerned with our doings, not with our faith.) Therefore, at the Lord's coming, this is what will happen:</P><div align="center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/CWvol15ch16.gif" width="400" height="100" border="0" alt="The Lord's Coming"></div><P>Here we see two entirely opposite outcomes. Therefore, in order to find out whether or not we will receive a reward in the future, we do not need to wait until we come before the judgment seat. Rather, we just need to examine our doings. If we lose our soul today, we can be assured that we will gain it in the future; if we gain our soul today, we can also be assured that we will lose it in the future.</P><P>Verse 28:"Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom." This verse is connected to chapter seventeen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MISCELLANEOUS NOTES ON CHAPTER 16</H2><P>(1) God is most patient. When the world says that He is not there, He is not anxious but continues to hide Himself.</P><P>(2) Today's preachers are like actors; they act and advertise, only with the intention of making a performance.</P><P>(3) Foolishness and unbelief are twins.</P><P>(4) We are all "missionaries" here, because we are not citizens of this earth.</P><P>(5) The Lord's trial before the high priest was indeed very unjust; he asked the Lord if He was the Christ.

The most important thing is that we are God's servants and should know His requirements.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</H1><P>The words "there are some" in Matthew 16:28 refer to Peter, James, and John. "His kingdom" refers to the kingdom of the Son of Man. (The kingdom of God lasts for eternity, while the kingdom of the Son of God refers only to the heavenly part of the millennium.) Here, it is the kingdom of the Son of Man. (See Matthew 13:41 and Psalm 8. Revelation 3:21 mentions two thrones. The throne in which we will participate is the throne of the Son of Man. See Revelation 1:13, where the Lord is the Son of Man). "In His kingdom" refers to the glory in the millennium. Why does the preceding portion call for self-denial? When will one see the realization of gaining the soul through losing it, and losing the soul through saving it? "For the Son of Man is to come" (v. 27). The preceding portion mentions death and resurrection; here, in verse 27, it mentions His coming. What does His coming mean? Verse 28 is an explanation of this. Peter, James, and John were with the Lord on three special occasions: in the house of Jairus, on the mount of transfiguration, and in Gethsemane. This chapter reveals the beauty of the kingdom of the heavens; what happened was not a type but the real kingdom of the heavens. First it was revealed and then was taken back again. In 2 Peter 1:16, Peter mentioned the "coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." This proves that it was the actual coming of the kingdom of the Son of Man. "Some...shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom." These three persons had indeed seen it.</P><P>Verse 1: "And after six days Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and brought them up to a high mountain privately." "And after six days." Works and battles have all passed away. (Luke says eight days, because the first day was also included. Matthew is a book of doctrine; hence, it was not written carelessly.) Peter, John, and James, all three, were ministers. "Privately." All great revelations are revealed in private. Only in private can one receive God's revelation and God's fellowship.</P><P>Verse 2:"And He was transfigured before them, and His face shined like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light." The Lord was transfigured in His position as the Son of Man. There is no possibility of change as the Son of God. He was not transfigured from the Son of Man to the Son of God, but from the humble, suffering, rejected Son of Man to the One receiving the kingdom, honor, and glory. With such glory in view, is it not worthwhile for one to bear the cross? This proves that Peter's word, "God be merciful to You, Lord!" in 16:22 was wrong. This encourages us to suffer and to bear the cross. "His face." Only Matthew pays attention to the glory of the King. The sun is a type of the kingdom, which also means glory.</P><P>Verse 3:"And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, conversing with Him." "Moses and Elijah." The way that the three gospels record them is different: Mark says "Elijah with Moses" (Mark 9:4) because Mark speaks concerning the Slave. Moses was a servant of God and was therefore placed in a lower position. Luke says "two men" (Luke 9:30) because Luke speaks concerning man. "Moses and Elijah"-one is a representative of the law, and the other is a representative of the prophets. The two spoke with the Lord all the time, not only once. The law says that the Lord became a sacrifice for sin. The prophecies foretell how He will become the King and receive glory. The law refers to His suffering, while the prophecies speak of His glory. "Conversing with Him." They were probably talking about how the Lord fulfilled the law and the prophecies. Luke said that they "spoke of His departure, which He was about to complete in Jerusalem" (Luke 9:31).</P><P>Verse 4:"And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make three tents here, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah." Peter opened up his mouth the third time, and again he spoke words of ignorance. Peter could only fish. He could only do his part at Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius; he could not make tents. The latter was Paul's business, which is to build up the church. The Lord was a carpenter; therefore, He was crucified. Peter's expression here showed that he understood the joy of the glory in the kingdom of the heavens; therefore, he did not want to go down from the mountain. "Make three tents." This is wrong, because: (1) Peter thought that one could enjoy the glory of the kingdom of the heavens without suffering, losing the soul, or bearing the cross. He did not feel the need to descend from the mountain in order to suffer. (There were demons at the foot of the mountain.) Many people are like this. When God blesses them a little, they would not strive to make any more progress. They become lazy and avoid sufferings. Instead, they desire to have the blessing. (2) Many think that the kingdom is now and that the millennium is now. This is like Peter and the other disciples, who thought that they could enjoy the kingdom of the heavens right then. (3) Peter thought that Moses and Elijah could stand in the same position as the Lord. In the world, the Lord indeed had emptied Himself and had made Himself of no reputation. But in the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord is the highest One. Moses and Elijah were men among men and were respected by all. But they could not be ranked in the same position with the Lord, for the Father loves only the Son (see the following), and every knee shall bow unto the Lord (Isa. 45:23; Rom. 14:11). Moses resurrected from the dead, and Elijah was the first one to be raptured; yet they could not be ranked together with the Lord. The Lord would not answer Peter's question. The answer that is without an answer is the best answer. (Peter had forgotten the acknowledgement in chapter sixteen.)</P><P>Verse 5:"While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight. Hear Him!" "While he was still speaking." God interrupted Peter's senseless speaking and did not want him to go on. Therefore, He said, "Hear Him!" "A bright cloud." This is for the Holy of Holies, which appeared when God descended on the holy mountain (Exo. 24:16). The "voice" is an experience pertaining to the ark. "My Son, the Beloved." This elevated the Lord to a position above Moses and Elijah, signifying that grace far exceeds the law and the prophecies. The same words were spoken during the Lord's baptism. Why was there the need for repetition? The Lord's baptism was an indication of His death and resurrection. The incident here indicates the Lord's determination to be crucified (by refusing Peter's intervention). Today God also delights in the obedient ones who bear the cross. God delights in the suffering ones who receive the kingdom. "Hear Him!" Do not speak rashly, but hear Him. (Many people can only talk but cannot hear.) What should they hear? They should hear all the words that the Lord speaks, especially those concerning self-denial and the bearing of the cross (Matt. 16:24-27). "Hear Him!" Now there is only He; there is no more Moses and Elijah.</P><P>Verse 6:"And when the disciples heard this, they fell on their face and were greatly frightened." "Greatly frightened." Who would not be afraid of God's descending?</P><P>Verse 7:"And Jesus came to them and touched them and said, Arise, and do not be afraid." "Do not be afraid"-because we are still in the age of grace.</P><P>Verse 8:"And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone." "They saw no one except Jesus Himself alone." The glory of the Son of Man covers everything. The law, the prophecies, the voices (visions), and the companions will all pass away. Only Jesus remains. May we have only Jesus.</P><P>Verses 1-8 reveal the kingdom of the heavens on the holy mountain. (1) Christ receives glory and becomes king; (2) Moses signifies the believers who have died and resurrected (1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thes. 4:13-17); (3) Elijah signifies the believers who will be raptured while still alive (1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thes. 4:13-17); (4) Peter, James, and John signify the untransformed Israelites as the people in the kingdom (Ezek. 37:21-28); and (5) the people at the foot of the mountain signify the nations (Isa. 11:10-12). From verse 1 through verse 8, we see that after a man dies, his body changes, but his form remains the same as before. The three disciples knew Moses and Elijah. The rich man died and he recognized Abraham.</P><P>Verse 9:"And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is raised from the dead." "Tell...to no one." Why is this? This is because the Lord had already been rejected, and to draw the unbelievers by His glory was quite meaningless. To draw people while they are touched is meaningful, but it is useless to draw the unbelievers. The three disciples were all special ministers; therefore, they needed special strengthening.</P><P>Verse 10:"And the disciples asked Him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?" The three asked this question because they had just seen Elijah. They still had a fresh image and thought that the revelation on the mountain was the fulfillment of the prophecies (Mal. 4:5).</P><P>Verse 11:"And He answered and said, Elijah indeed is coming and will restore all things." "Elijah indeed is coming." According to God's arrangement, if a man was willing to receive the testimony of John, he would know that John was Elijah (Matt. 11:14). Although he was not Elijah reincarnated, he had the spirit and power of Elijah (Luke 1:17).</P><P>Verse 12:"But I say to you that Elijah has already come; and they did not recognize him, but did with him the things they wished. So also the Son of Man is about to suffer by them." It is a pity that no one received John's testimony, and they even "did with him the things they wished." Today we cannot see Elijah, because the Son of Man was rejected. If one mistreated the forerunner, he would surely mistreat the Son of Man also. Since Elijah was rejected, the Messiah also would be rejected. Therefore, although there was the glory on the mountain, it had to remain covered because there was no need for such testimonies in this age. The Lord also said that the slave is not above his master (Matt. 10:24). The Messiah was rejected, and Elijah also was rejected. Again He said, "He who rejects you rejects Me" (Luke 10:16). Without the Messiah, what is the use of having an Elijah?</P><P>Verse 13:"Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them concerning John the Baptist." The Lord did not mention John's name, but the disciples already knew that He meant John. Although sometimes the Bible does not mention something directly, we should understand the Lord's mind.</P><P>Verses 14-15:"And when they came to the crowd, a man came to Him, falling on his knees before Him and saying, Lord, have mercy on my son, for he has epilepsy and suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire and often into the water." The general subject of this section (vv. 14-21) is the Lord's feelings toward man's unbelief. No other deed or achievement can reveal this kind of feeling. "A man." This one was a remnant and was obviously a sinner. When the son was possessed, he was thrown "into the water" and "into the fire." Water is cold and fire is hot. This means that when a demon takes possession of a person's body, he makes the person feel either cold or hot. In other words, the person becomes an epileptic. There are many demons of this kind.</P><P>Verse 16:"And I brought him to Your disciples, and they were not able to heal him." The disciples thought that casting out demons was an easy thing and that they had the experience. Since they had been with the Lord for quite a long time, they assumed that they should have this ability. In spiritual matters one should never assume anything. If you do not have the real capability, you will surely fail. The disciples wanted to try; it is no wonder that they failed. The disciples could not cure the man and were instead deceived by the demon, which signifies that the Jews will be deceived by Satan's power during the great tribulation.</P><P>Verse 17:"And Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverted generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me." Here we can see the suffering given to the Lord through the heart of unbelief. Endurance is a suffering. The suffering of unbelief is worse than that of being scolded or beaten. "How long shall I be with you?" When the Lord was in the world, He had to endure all the time. He had no choice but to endure; therefore, He had to say this. (Because the Lord was honest, people did not like to dwell with Him; this was the Lord's heart.) "Unbelieving" is toward the Lord, while "perverted" is toward oneself. "Bring him here to Me." The father (and the mother), the child himself, and several of the disciples did not have the solution. The Lord said these words to show that only He had the solution. The child's father was comforted immediately. These words are truly precious and comforting. Why did he not go to Jesus first?</P><P>Verse 18:"And Jesus rebuked it, and the demon came out from him; and the boy was healed from that hour." "Rebuked." This is to say that the demon ought not to do that. Following the rebuke, there must be a command. In casting out demons, prayer alone is useless. There must be the rebuking and the commanding. We dare only to pray, but we dare not rebuke. Prayer is the receiving of authority and power from God. After receiving these, you still need to apply them by rebuking the demon in order to cast it out, because the demon knows the Lord Jesus. When the man sought for healing, he only said, "He has epilepsy," but when the Lord cured him, He "rebuked" the demon. This shows that whenever we pray for healing, we should have such spiritual insight that we can distinguish whether the source of the sickness is natural or supernatural. The man said that it was sickness, but the Lord said that it was a demon. When the demon was cast out, the sickness was cured. It may be said that the demon was the source of sickness. When you pray for man's sickness and have faith that God will surely heal him, but such faith does not bring any result, you must immediately discern whether or not the sickness results from a supernatural cause. (All those who believe Romans 6:10, yet still lose their temper and fall, must be bound by an evil spirit. It is not they themselves who have sinned, but the evil spirit that has compelled them to sin. Romans 6:10 deals only with sin, not with the demons.)</P><P>Verse 19:"Then the disciples, coming to Jesus privately, said, Why were we not able to cast it out?" Verses 19-21 are a textbook on casting out demons. "Privately"-because they were afraid to lose face.</P><P>Verse 20:"And He said to them, Because of your little faith; for truly I say to you, If you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you." "Little faith" should be translated "unbelief." This unbelief refers to the unbelief of the believers, not to disbelieving in Jesus as the Savior. "Mountain" and "mustard seed" are both figures of speech. A mountain is most stable and firm. But by faith one can remove many mountains. Many difficulties are not like meteors but are as firm and stable as mountains. For example, there may be sons and daughters in your family who are unbelieving or jobless. Faith not only can remove mountains but also can deal with anything; it can deal with all kinds of difficulties. Why did they first ask others for help?</P><P>Verse 21:"But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting." Faith is different from praying and fasting. Here the Lord shows us the prayer that backs up one's faith. We always say that once we have faith, we do not need to pray but only to give thanks. If we continue to pray, our faith will be shaken, especially when we are asking God for something. However, in dealing with the demons, this is not true. Once we have faith, we still need to pray unceasingly. Once we have the faith to cast out demons, we need to ask for the execution. In Luke 18 we see the widow's continual petition for the avenging of her adversary, Satan. In order to deal with Satan, we need to attack him every day (by the way of praying) until the time of death. Even when we have faith, we still need to pray and fast. These two are works indeed, and they also are an attitude. (On that specific day, the Lord Himself had not prayed and fasted.) Since the Lord could cast out the demon, we know that He must have prayed and fasted previously. The Lord had the attitude of praying and fasting, which is the attitude of relying on God and overcoming oneself, controlling oneself. Therefore, besides the works, we also need such an attitude. For this, every believer needs to be on the alert all the time for this kind of demon, which is the most fierce of all the demons. There are small demons, and there are big demons; the small demons can be overcome by the singing of hymns or the reading of the Bible. Since we are Christians, we should not consider any demon to be too great, but neither should we consider it as too small. Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis once said, "Underestimating the evil spirits is the cause of suffering loss, while uplifting the evil spirits is the cause of losing one's dignity." We need to keep 1 John 4:4 firmly in mind and acknowledge that we cannot do anything in ourselves and that, therefore, we need to pray and fast.</P><P>The necessary conditions for casting out demons are: (1) Faith-believing that the name of the Lord has been exalted by God to be "above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth" (Phil. 2:9-10; Eph. 1:20-22; Heb. 1:4). Every demon knows Philippians 2:9. Let us believe firmly in Philippians 2:9. Sometimes it is sufficient to know only Jesus because Jesus is the sign of victory, power, and authority. We may say, "Jesus is Lord" or "Jesus is the Victor." (2) Boldness-if you are afraid, you have no faith; at least your faith is not sufficient. Since the name of the Lord is exalted, we must demonstrate our courage and power. Keep 1 John 4:4 in mind; either you will have to lose, or the demon will have to be cast out. (3) Endurance-the demon can at best delay (even ten times, to and fro). Never suppose that the name of the Lord is ineffective; instead, hold fast this determination. If the demon stays for one hundred days, I must not leave for one hundred one days. Beelzebul is the lord of flies. The demons are indeed like flies; they leave and then come back again. The demons can endure well.</P><P>Verse 22: "And while they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men." The second time the Lord declared that He would be killed was different from the first time (Matt. 16:21). The first time indicates that the Jews-the elders, chief priests, and scribes-rejected the Lord. The second time indicates that the Gentiles rejected the Lord. "Be delivered into the hands of men"-this is to be delivered by the Jews to the Gentiles (Pilate).</P><P>Verse 23: "And they will kill Him, and on the third day He will be raised. And they were greatly grieved." "Greatly grieved"-because they could not see that the cross is the sign of victory. After humiliation, the glory comes; after suffering, the throne comes. With us also it is the same; we often worry about the narrow path of the cross.</P><P>The origin of the temple tax: the temple tax is the propitiation silver offered in ancient times (Exo. 30:13-15; 2 Chron. 24:6). Formerly, the half-shekel was paid during roll call; later, it was used for the expenses of the temple. During the time of Nehemiah, it was changed to one-third of a shekel (Neh. 10:32). By the time of the Lord Jesus, it had been changed again to a half-shekel. Everyone, whether rich or poor, had to pay the same temple tax. The temple tax gatherers thought that the Lord was a strange person; therefore, they asked Peter first.</P><P>Verses 24-27:"And when they came to Capernaum, those who take up the temple tax came to Peter and said, Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax? He said, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers? And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said to him, So then the sons are free. But that we do not stumble them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. And when you open its mouth, you will find a stater; take that and give it to them for Me and you." Peter had said "Yes"; his old temperament came out again. The Lord is the Son of God; therefore, He does not need to pay the tax. Peter also did not need to pay because the Lord had set him free (John 8:36). Not only is the Lord Himself free, but He has also made others free. "But that we do not stumble them" means not to offend them. If a principle touches God's person, holiness, and work, we should not yield and should not be afraid of offending men. Nevertheless, concerning the other minor matters that are not related to God, we should follow the example of the Lord and should not offend others. Here the Lord was indeed wise. He was meek but not weak; He was humble but did not shrink back. In many matters we should leave some leeway for people. There is another lesson: believers today should not misuse the name of the Son of God, whether in the present life or in the kingdom. We should not persecute others; rather, we should be persecuted. If the government today gives every Christian a certain privilege, we would rather not accept it. Today is the time for paying taxes. "Go to the sea and cast a hook." On the one hand, the Lord showed meekness and grace; on the other hand, He showed power and honor. "Me and you." Why did He not say "us"? It is because the Lord can never stand in the same position as us. He is the firstborn Son, the only begotten Son; we are the many sons. On account of His glory, the Lord paid the tax. On account of His grace, the Lord paid for Peter. The Lord can supply all our needs.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</H1><P>Verse 1:"In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?" "In that hour" can be translated "at the same time." It is connected with the fishing in the preceding portion. The fishing there indicates that the Lord covers His own glory and manifests His own grace. The first section of chapter eighteen indicates how the believers in the present life should imitate the Lord in hiding their own glory, manifesting grace, and giving up their privileges. "Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?" The disciples argued concerning this matter several times. It was truly an unsolvable problem to them. Even on the night the Lord was betrayed, they were still arguing. On this occasion the disciples were arguing because: (1) nine people had been left at the foot of the mountain (17:1); (2) Peter was called Petros (16:18), the rock for the building; (3) the keys of the kingdom of the heavens were placed in Peter's hands (16:19); and (4) the Lord had paid the temple tax for Peter (17:27). All men like to be great; no one likes to be small. Men aspire to great achievements within their limits. There is not one person who does not desire to be great.</P><P>Verse 2:"And He called a little child to Him and stood him in their midst." The Lord used not only parables but also demonstrations. He called a little child to stand among the disciples, to make a comparison with them. One can know a child by a glance; there is no need to ask. Concerning many matters, there is no need to ask; one only needs to look.</P><P>Verse 3:"And said, Truly I say to you, Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens." "Turn" indicates regeneration; it is to begin a new life. "Become like little children." This does not mean that we should behave like children, but that we should become children; it is not to be childish like a child. One who can pretend to be a child is surely not a child. (Only a wise man can pretend to be a fool.) Everyone who lives in this world must pass through the stage of being a child. Likewise, everyone who enters into the kingdom of the heavens must pass through the stage of being a child. There are three explanations concerning the kingdom of the heavens: it is (1) the realm of Christianity, (2) the church, and (3) the millennium. Here it refers to the second. This does not mean that to enter into the kingdom of the heavens one must be a child physically; it means that one must become like such. The actual child is only used as an illustration. Otherwise, Nicodemus could not have been regenerated. One who is not regenerated cannot understand the matter of regeneration. "Become like little children." This means to be selfless, dependent, and humble.</P><P>Verse 4:"He therefore who will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens." Verse 3 deals with the problem of entering in. Verse 4 deals with the problem of being great or small. After regeneration, if a person remains humble and always like a little child, this one is the greatest. Unfortunately, the conditions are here, yet most men reject them and do not care for them. There are some infants who act too much like an adult. They think that they have been pastors for sixty years or have been elders for twenty years, yet in reality they are still infants (1 Cor. 3:1). "Become like little children" is the condition for entering into the kingdom. If one can always keep this condition, he will become great. When the Lord was paying the temple tax, He was humble like a little child. It is right for believers to progress in knowledge and to teach and help other people. The humility here refers to the attitude. One should have a humble attitude like a little child who does not look at himself and who does not try to compare himself with others. (The worst thing is to compare in spiritual matters.) Paul considered himself the least of the apostles (1 Cor. 15:9). He did not come to this conclusion by comparison. For the salvation of Israel, he would rather be separated from Christ (Rom. 9:3). He was altogether selfless, not looking at himself; he was the best child. Paul ran the race and did not look at Peter or John; he cared only for the things that were before that he might gain the prize from above (not from below) (Phil. 3:13-14). To be humble is to be without pride. It does not mean that one should not conduct revival meetings or preach the word. Even a little child can have pride. It is only when one is humble and "becomes" a little child that he can be without pride. "He who humbles himself shall be exalted" (Luke 18:14).</P><P>Verse 5:"And whoever receives one such little child because of My name, receives Me." "Because of My name" is deeper than "for my sake." To receive "one such little child" is to be humble. With him there is the glory and honor of Christ. Therefore, to receive him is to receive Christ. The saints should love not only Christ but all the saints as well (see Philem. 5). Hence, he who humbles himself should at the same time regard others highly.</P><P>Verse 6:"And whoever stumbles one of these little ones who believe in Me, it is more profitable for him that a great millstone be hung around his neck and he be drowned in the open sea." In dealing with people, a believer either receives them or stumbles them. To cause others to stumble is worse spiritually than to become a murderer in the flesh. A person who stumbles others shakes their faith in Christ and affords them the opportunity to rebel against God. Christ paid the temple tax. On the one hand, He was humble, and on the other hand, He did not want to offend others. If a person does not want to offend others, he must be humble and must lower himself.</P><P>Verse 7:"Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! For it is necessary for stumbling blocks to come, but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes." There are many offenses in the world. "Woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes," especially if he is a Christian. Although he will not lose eternal life, he will suffer much loss in the millennium.</P><P>Verse 8:"If your hand or your foot stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire." How can a person not be stumbled? First he should mind himself. If he will not stumble, others will not be stumbled by him. If he is stumbled, others also will be stumbled because of him. (If you gamble, others will be stumbled, and they will gamble as well or will begin to despise Christ.) If the conduct of your hand and the action of your foot cause you to stumble, you should rather pay the greatest price to cut them off. If you retain them, you will stumble others. If one keeps himself from any acts of stumbling, he will not be touched by the eternal fire, though such fire is eternal.</P><P>Verse 9:"And if your eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the Gehenna of fire." The "eye" here refers to the lust of the eye. Those who lust after a woman by looking at her (see the interpretation in Matthew 5:27-30) should pay the price to cut such conduct off. There are two reasons for stumbling: (1) a person is stumbled in himself; (2) a person despises others. Therefore, in order for one not to stumble others, he must not be stumbled himself, and he must not despise others.</P><P>Verse 10:"See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of My Father who is in the heavens." We should not despise anyone but should treasure their souls. The "little ones" refers to those who are worthless materially or physically. The "angels" are the "ministering spirits" (Heb. 1:14) (Scofield, Kelly, and other Brethren groups all said that the "angels" here refer to man's spirit (Acts 12:15). If that is the case, unless the little child dies, how can he always behold the face of the heavenly Father?) On the ladder the angels are ascending and descending (John 1:51). They ascend with prayers and descend with gifts. Therefore, we should not allow our angels to become idle. Today we have the Holy Spirit in our hearts; hence, the ministering of the angels is rarely seen.</P><P>Verse 11:"For the Son of Man has come to save that which is lost." Not only do their angels always behold the face of the Father in heaven, but the Lord's coming is to save them also. Therefore, we should not despise the little ones.</P><P>Verses 12-13:"What do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and seek the one that has gone astray? And if it so happens that he finds it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray." The explanation of this parable is similar to that of the parable in Luke 15:1-7, but the implications are different. The parable in the Gospel of Luke tells sinners the matter of salvation. Here it tells saved believers the intention of salvation. "Any man" refers to the Lord Jesus. The Lord does not want to lose any believer. "Goes astray." A sheep is naturally dumb; if it goes astray, it cannot return (see Isa. 53:6). "Ninety-nine which have not gone astray." This is only an assumption; it surely does not refer to the righteous man, because there is not one righteous man in the world. "Go." This means that the Lord went Himself. He did not entrust this work to the angels. The Good Shepherd is willing to give His life for the sheep.</P><P>Verse 14:"In the same way, it is not the will of your Father who is in the heavens that one of these little ones perish." Even so, the heart of the heavenly Father is unwilling that one of these little ones should perish. How can we offend others or cause others to perish? God takes pleasure in salvation. Although believers on the earth cannot enjoy the pleasure of this world, they should seek for their joy through saving others. Since the Lord is not willing to lose a little sheep, and since God rejoices in granting salvation to others, believers should not stumble others. But if a person sins and offends you, what should you do? We need to consider verse 15.</P><P>Verse 15:"Moreover if your brother sins against you, go, reprove him between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother." We should still have a heart to recover such a one, as we would in saving a lost sheep. In this verse the Lord did not correct the wrong and sinning brothers, but He corrected those who are not wrong. Every time a man corrects others, he should realize that he also is in the wrong. Therefore, it is easy to deal with a righteous person, but it is difficult to deal with an evil person. It is easy for men to deal with proper things having an improper attitude. Moses failed in this point; the Israelites erred, but Moses dealt with such a proper matter with improper words. Do not become wrong just because others are wrong. Do not help others and in the process become one who needs help yourself. If you do, you also will fall into sin. When that happens, the only difference between you and them will be a matter of time-one sins sooner and the other sins later. "Between you and him alone." This is with no other people present; this means that one should hide evils. "Reprove him." This is not to demonstrate one's prowess or dignity, nor to rebuke; rather, this is humility, which is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens. If you rebuke such a brother, you consider yourself better than he. That is the self-boasting of the Pharisees (Luke 18:11). "You have gained your brother." The purpose of a rebuke is to turn others through love.</P><P>Verses 16-17:"But if he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector." "If he does not hear you." You must exhaust all means-the testimony of two or three witnesses, the arbitration of the church-before you can deem him (1) a Gentile, with whom you cannot associate, and (2) a tax collector, who is despicable. (There is no need to excommunicate this kind of person, because most of their sins involve merely being too strong in the will. However, if a person sins as in 1 Corinthians 5:11, he needs to be put away immediately.)</P><P>Verse 18:"Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven." The meaning of this verse is similar to that of Matthew 16:19, which is a kind of indirect forgiveness. God would bind or loose through the church or through Peter. "You" here is plural; it refers to the church. When a person requests that he be allowed to break bread or be baptized, the church has the authority to arbitrate in the matter. Therefore, one should not harden his heart, because the One in heaven will also bind and loose accordingly. The binding and the loosing must be under the control and authority of the Holy Spirit. (See John 20:22-23.) One will surely fail if he relies on himself.</P><P>Verse 19:"Again, truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens." Who has this authority? Does the Roman Catholic Church or the pope have this authority? No, they do not. The word "again" connects this verse with the preceding portion and adds new meaning to it: the binding and the loosing not only involve brothers but also involve prayers. "On earth" corresponds to "in heaven." Two persons constitute the least among the plurals, but they are enough. Verse 19 refers especially to the corporate prayer. There are two kinds of corporate prayers: (1) those that loose God's power, gifts, and the door of preaching, and that loose from sufferings, the burdens of sin, etc.; and (2) those that bind Satan, evil men, unforeseen disasters, etc. The word "harmony" is from a word whose Anglicized form is symphony. It is most difficult to pray in harmony. For example, in praying for healing, one may pray for God to heal the sick one (the "for" stand), whereas another may pray that God's will be done (the "neutral" stand); at the same time, a third one may pray that God would chasten the sick one through the illness (the "against" stand). In this way, there is no harmony. Harmony means that everyone has the same view and the same mind.</P><P>Verse 20:"For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst." The word "for" is very precious because it indicates that the following passage is an example. It explains why they receive an answer to their prayer. "Gathered into My name." This does not necessarily mean a prayer meeting. No one can have a meeting by himself; all are called to meet in Christ's name. We are like iron, and the Lord is like a magnet. The magnet attracts iron but does not attract brass. The Lord's life in the Body urges us to meet together and to come under the name of the Lord; this is not to come under the name of any denominational church. There is no such thing in the Bible as "joining a religion." The Lord does not want us to belong to any other name. When a woman marries, she accepts her husband's name and can no longer have another name. Christians today have so many other names besides the name of Christ. A man would not allow his wife to take any other name; similarly, the Lord would not allow Christians to take any other name. If one does not belong under the name of the Lord, he is rebellious. If one belongs under the name of the Lord and then takes on another name, he or she has committed adultery. Christians are a bride, and as such, they must be chaste. The Lord praises the church in Philadelphia because she has not denied the Lord's name, but has kept the Lord's word of endurance. (The church in these three verses-verses 18-20-is the local church. It is but the embryonic form of the whole church in Ephesians 5:23. The church in Matthew 16 is the whole church.) Some people tolerate the reviling of Christianity or Christians but will not tolerate the reviling of their denominational churches or the members of their churches. To them it is acceptable to put Christ to shame, but it is not acceptable to put their denominations to shame.</P><P>Verse 21:"Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?" The preceding portion speaks of the relationship between committing sins and the church. This portion speaks of the relationship between committing sins and the kingdom of the heavens. The preceding portion mentions the matter of forgiveness; therefore, Peter asked this question here. Perhaps this question is based on Luke 17:3-4. Peter assumed that seven times was the most generous. (At that time there were two famous rabbis who had set down a rule that it was enough to forgive three times a day.) "Seven times" is more than double three times already.</P><P>Verse 22:"Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven." The phrase "I do not say to you" shows clearly the Lord's authority and power. "Seventy times seven" refers to infiniteness; however, if one can forgives seventy times seven, it is good enough. Seven (perfection) times seven (perfection) times ten (man's perfection) equals four hundred ninety (perfect perfection).</P><P>Verse 23:"For this reason the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who desired to settle accounts with his slaves." "The kingdom of the heavens has become like a king." This refers to the Lord, who is God. "His slaves" refers to the saved believers. Some have said that it refers to the unsaved sinners, but that is impossible. This is because: (1) They are called slaves. (2) They deal with God directly and do not come through the Lord's blood. (3) The slave here refers to Peter. Peter asked, "How often shall...I [one already saved] forgive him [a saved brother]?" (4) Verse 35 reads "So also will My heavenly Father do to you [saved ones]." "Settle accounts with his slaves" (v. 23) indicates that God never forgets and is never confused about the believers' shortcomings. Therefore, the believers should realize that if they have come short of God at ordinary times, sooner or later God will reckon their account with them. The time of reckoning is in the present life; God will give them a serious illness or allow them to encounter dangers or inflict serious chastening upon them. Some have said that this reckoning will happen in the coming age, before Christ's judgment seat (1 Cor. 3:10-15). This is impossible, because: (1) the one who owes ten thousand talents can never be raptured; (2) at that time there will be no grace, only righteousness; therefore, the lord of the slaves will not be moved with compassion; (3) in the kingdom of the heavens one cannot take his brother by the throat and cast him into prison; and (4) verses 23-31 concern the present age, while verse 32-34 indicate the time before the judgment seat in the coming age. Therefore, the teaching in verse 35 is that if one does not forgive his brother in the present life, he will be dealt with in the same way by the One in heaven in the life to come.</P><P>Verse 24:"And when he began to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him." To "owe" speaks of the believers' indebtedness to God. We do not know if the "ten thousand talents" is gold or silver, but we know that it is an enormous amount. The slave can never pay back the whole sum. (One gold talent equals 1,152 ounces of gold; one silver talent equals 1,152 ounces of silver. Therefore, ten thousand talents equals 1,152 times 10,000 which equals 11,520,000 ounces.) Believers owe debts (in relation to God), while sinners commit sins. What the believers owe in their daily life may be more than this amount. In this reckoning, the Lord must have suffered quite a loss.</P><P>Verse 25:"But since he did not have the means to repay, the master commanded him to be sold, as well as his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made." This does not mean that the master actually wanted the man to sell his wife, children, and all that he had; it indicates that God wants to deprive man of all that he has.</P><P>Verse 26:"Then the slave fell down and worshipped him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you all." Four matters are included here: (1) repentance (he fell down); (2) humility (he worshipped); (3) asking for mercy ("be patient with me"); (4) making a vow and a consecration ("repay you all").</P><P>Verse 27:"And the master of that slave was moved with compassion and released him and forgave him the loan." "Moved with compassion." This was because the slave repented, humbled himself, and asked for mercy, not because the slave was willing to pay back the debt. The master knew perfectly well that the slave could not repay; therefore, he forgave him the debt. "Released him" means set him free; this means that this takes place in this age. If the setting free and the exemption from debt were in the coming age, the Lord's righteousness would be damaged. In the present age God not only has patience toward us but also wipes away all our debts. God's grace always surpasses man's expectation.</P><P>Verse 28:"But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, and he took hold of him and began to choke him, saying, Repay me what you owe." "Went out" means to depart from God's reckoning of our account or to depart from the days of discipline. The "fellow slave" is another slave, one who is saved. "A hundred denarii" is a small sum; it denotes a small shortcoming. After a man sins, if he has not confessed his sin thoroughly before God, he will not have a deep impression of his wrong even though he has repented. This is why after a short while this slave quickly forgot the matter and became violent with his fellow slave. This slave repented first out of anxiety and not because he realized the hopelessness of his debt; he still hoped to pay back the debt. Therefore, although he was humble and although he repented, the impression was not deep. After a short while he quickly forgot the Lord's great mercy. David was also like this. He did not know his own sin and condemned the rich man in Nathan's parable.</P><P>Verse 29:"Then his fellow slave fell down and begged him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you." The debt was small, and his fellow slave made the same repentance, showed the same humility, asked for mercy, and vowed his vow.</P><P>Verse 30:"But he would not; instead, he went away and threw him into prison until he would repay what was owed." Although this one's plea for mercy was the same as his, he could not remember his own pleading at the beginning and his receiving mercy, for at that time all his pleading was out of his anxiety and not out of a realization of the desperateness of his debts. "Threw him into prison." This means to deal with the matter according to the law and to forget about grace. Although he did it according to righteousness, righteousness could not be applied to this case because he could not annul the mercy he himself had received at the beginning. If he had not received mercy at the beginning, then it would seem lawful for him to cast others into prison. But after he had received mercy, it became a matter of righteousness for him to show mercy to others.</P><P>Verse 31:"Then his fellow slaves, seeing what had taken place, were greatly grieved and came and explained fully to their master all that had taken place." The prayers of the saints reach God.</P><P>Verse 32:"Then his master called him to him and said to him, Evil slave, all that debt I forgave you, because you begged me." This verse can refer to this life, in which case it means that God takes a person away from the world. This verse can also refer to the coming age, in which case it refers to God's judgment in the future.</P><P>Verse 33:"Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave even as I had mercy on you?" The Lord rebuked him for forgetting the mercy he had formerly received. This verse is the center, focus, and lesson of this parable.</P><P>Verse 34:"And his master became angry and delivered him to the torturers until he would repay all that was owed." His master was not breaking his promise. Because of righteousness, he made void his former mercy. "Repay all" means to fulfill the punishment of the one thousand years.</P><P>Verse 35:"So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts." Verse 35 is the summary. Verses 21 and 22 are the introduction. Verses 23-34 are the parable. Here, in the summary, it applies the lesson to men of the present age. From this we see that this parable concerns matters of the present age. "From your hearts." So many times one forgives in his face, by his mouth, or in his conduct, but not "from the heart." The Lord stresses the heart. If a believer does not forgive others, he will be cast into prison and will not be released until he repays all that he owes. Therefore, a believer who does not forgive others should not ask to be forgiven. There should not be a believer who is so stubborn as to refuse to move his head, speak to others, or communicate with others. </P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER NINETEEN</H1><P>Verses 1-2:"And when Jesus finished these words, He departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan. And great crowds followed Him, and He healed them there." Every time, after the Lord finished teaching people, He always did some works such as healing the sick, casting out demons, etc. Here again the Lord healed the sick.</P><P>Verse 3:"And some Pharisees came to Him, testing Him and saying, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?" From verse 3 on, there is another problem: the kingdom of the heavens and the natural relationship of man. The Jews proposed that a divorce could be made for whatever reason a person provided. Among the Chinese there are seven conditions for divorce. The Jews probably have seventy-seven times seven conditions. If a meal was not prepared satisfactorily, that could be an excuse for a divorce. The Pharisees liked to have divorces, yet they still felt constrained. Therefore, they asked the Lord.</P><P>Verse 4:"And He answered and said, Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female." This verse gives us two principles: (1) marriage is ordained by God, and (2) monogamy, the institution of one husband and one wife. There were only one Adam and one Eve. The Lord's answer implied that this is not a question of the law but a matter of looking into the origin of the matter.</P><P>Verse 5:"And said, `For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh'?" The relationship between father and son or mother and son is intimate enough. However, there is still another relationship, that between husband and wife, which is even more intimate. If one cannot separate fathers from sons or mothers from sons, how much more should husbands not be separated from their wives.</P><P>Verse 6:"So then they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has yoked together, let man not separate." In the record of the Bible, the number of the women was not reported; hence, the two had become "one flesh." Before God, husband and wife count as only one unit. "So then they are no longer two, but one flesh....let man not separate." This is the verdict.</P><P>Verse 7:"They said to Him, Why then did Moses command us to give her a certificate of divorce and divorce her?" The Pharisees naturally quoted the law of Moses, assuming that by quoting Moses the Lord could most easily be defeated. They assumed that the Lord's word contradicted that of Moses. "Why then did Moses command?" Moses did not command this, he only allowed it. Only the Lord could discern their fallacy.</P><P>Verse 8:"He said to them, Moses, because of your hardness of heart, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so." In verse 8 the Lord did not deny the reason for the establishing of the Old Testament. However, he pointed out that Moses allowed certain things because of the hardness of heart of the Israelites in not following God's original will from the beginning. This shows that the law cannot regenerate man or perfect man (Heb. 10:1). In the beginning God's will was not like this.</P><P>Verse 9:"But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her who has been divorced commits adultery." Although there are many kinds of legal divorces among different nations today, only one kind of divorce is proper: for reason of fornication. The Bible did not put stress on the wedding or the engagement. Marriage originates out of a voluntary (rather than involuntary) relationship of the flesh. (According to 1 Corinthians 6:16, "the two shall be one flesh.") This relationship of the flesh is most pure, because it is ordained by God. Whenever there is a relationship of the flesh, regardless of the law and the customs of society, before God one becomes responsible and the two are one flesh. This is why in the Old Testament, if a man ruined the virginity of a woman, he had to marry her. This is because the joining of the flesh is a critical element in marriage. Fornication is an act to ruin the fact of "the two shall be one flesh." Divorce is a breaking down of oneness before God. Hence, these are the conclusions: (1) any fornication destroys the oneness before God; and (2) no divorce is permitted except because of fornication. Although we believers are in the world, we ought not to follow the current of the age or the human law. We ought to obey God's will. To marry one who has been put away is to commit adultery because if the woman did not commit fornication and yet was put away, that oneness still exists before God. For someone to marry her would damage the oneness. If the woman was put away because of fornication, then to marry her is to commit adultery with her. What if, before a man believed in the Lord, he had married a woman who was put away? Then whatever was done has already been covered by the precious blood; he cannot put her away any more. Paul talked only about separation if it is because of (1) need and (2) its being profitable. But the believer should not initiate it. Rather, he should choose to be at peace and be patient. Separation is for waiting. Perhaps God will use the separation period to cause the unbelieving one to believe. Suppose a believer has a wife who has committed fornication. According to the law and the Lord's word, she can be put away. However, according to the Lord's grace, if the wife repents, he should still forgive her (cf. John 8:3-11).</P><P>Verse 10:"His disciples said to Him, If the case of the man with his wife is like this, it is not profitable to marry." The disciples had their own inclinations; they agreed with having divorce at will. When they saw that this could not be done, they said that it was not profitable to marry. This also violates God's original plan.</P><P>Verse 11:"And He said to them, Not all men can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given." The amount that one can receive depends on the capacity one has. No one can compel another not to marry. To compel others to divorce is sin, and to compel others not to marry also is sin. "Not all men can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given." On the one hand, the Lord unveiled God's original purpose. On the other hand, He also unveiled the fact that God is able to raise up certain ones who would not marry.</P><P>Verse 12:"For there are eunuchs who were born so from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens. He who can accept it, let him accept it." "He who can accept it." There are three types of people who can accept it: (1) those born eunuchs-those who are physiologically handicapped; (2) those made eunuchs by man-those who became such through circumstances or punishment; and (3) those who are eunuchs "because of the kingdom of the heavens," the apostle Paul being one such example. He refrained from marriage for the sake of God's work. If he had married, God's work would surely have been affected. Those who "made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens" have special positions in the kingdom of the heavens (see Rev. 14:4). In order to avoid misunderstanding, the Lord said, "He who can accept it, let him accept it." This became a special privilege to encourage those who "made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens."</P><P>Verses 13-15:"Then little children were brought to Him that He might lay His hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them. But Jesus said, Allow the little children and do not prevent them from coming to Me, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens. And after He laid His hands on them, He went on from there." These three verses tell us that no person should consider himself so great as to find anything too small for him to do. The disciples thought that the Lord was the Rabbi of the rabbis and that He ought not to do such a small thing. The disciples prevented the little children because they were impatient with them and because they tried to assume the position as disciples. The Lord told them to allow the little children to come to Him because: (1) Every great person can do the smallest thing. Thus, brothers should sweep the floor, clean the windows, and do such things. (2) In the kingdom of the heavens, everyone is like a little child. This does not mean that one is a child, but that he has the innocence, the humility, and the dependence of a child. (3) Children have souls also, and we should love them. (4) The love of God can be manifested in the smallest matter. "He went on from there." The opportunity was not always available because the Lord was going on. If a man misses the opportunity to receive grace, there is really no way to regain it. This is most pitiful. Therefore, accept the Lord's salvation while it is the time of salvation. Although the door of grace is open now, one day it will be closed. This is why one should never miss the opportunity. Every time the Lord departed, there were always sick people and sinners who were left behind.</P><P>Verse 16:"And behold, someone came to Him and said, Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?" Verses 16-30 are difficult to expound. The other Gospels mention a ruler of the Jews (Luke 18:18). This title implies that the young man was in a good position. For a long time the young man had heard of the Lord's name and had sought after Him. He already had quite an amount of knowledge because (1) he knew that one should have eternal life; (2) he did not have eternal life; (3) he knew that by doing good, one could secure eternal life; and (4) he did not know what kind of good he should do to gain eternal life. This young man did not ask whether or not there was eternal life. He was not pursuing the worldly pleasure but was seeking the pleasure of the next age.</P><P>Verse 17:"And He said to him, Why do you ask Me concerning what is good? There is only One who is good. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments." The Lord answered the young man according to his background and his real condition. This does not mean that the Lord admitted that good works can secure eternal life for a person. If a man assumes that by doing good he can be saved, and he comes to seek the words of eternal life, the most natural way to answer him would be, "Why not do good then?" This would make him realize the failure and the unreliability of doing good. "There is only One who is good." Nothing else is good, because only One is good. "If you want to enter into life, keep the commandments." Surely, "He who does them shall live because of them" (Gal. 3:12). Unfortunately, there is none who is justified before God by keeping the law (Rom. 3:20). This is because by trespassing against one of the smallest commandments, one is guilty of trespassing against the whole law (James 2:10). Therefore, Paul said that the law was originally ordained to be the ministry of the Lord, but it had become the ministry of death (2 Cor. 3:9). As the dumb cannot ask how to sing in order to please God and the lame cannot ask how to dance in order to be welcomed by man, so also man cannot ask how to do good in order to gain eternal life. The sinners today also like to ask how to do good in order to be saved.</P><P>Verses 18-19:"He said to Him, Which ones? And Jesus said, `You shall not murder; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness; honor your father and mother; and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.'" The young man thought that there were a great many commandments, and he did not know which one the Lord was talking about. Therefore, he asked which commandment. Those that the Lord indicated were all from the second tablet, that is, from the fifth to the tenth commandments; they speak of one's responsibilities before man. The first tablet, which comprises the first to the fourth commandments, speak of one's responsibilities before God. The Jewish people all thought that they had closely followed the commandments on the first tablet. Therefore, the Lord asked him about the second tablet. If he could be clear before man, then perhaps he could also be upright before God.</P><P>Verse 20:"The young man said to Him, All these things I have kept. What do I still lack?" "All these things I have kept." The Lord mentioned the commandments with the hope that the young man would say that he had not kept them. Yet the young man said that he had kept all these things. Here the Lord still could not make him recognize God or Himself.</P><P>Verse 21:"Jesus said to him, If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me." This young man's attitude was most vigorous; he thought that there was not one good thing he could not do. Therefore, the Lord pointed out one good thing that he was unable to do-to sell all and give to the poor. "If you want to be perfect." This shows that even if one could keep all the Ten Commandments, he would still not be perfect. "Go, sell your possessions." The young man was not opposed to selling because he could still keep the money. "And give to the poor." This is impossible. "And come, follow Me." This means to wander without a place for rest; this is even more impossible.</P><P>Verse 22:"But the young man, hearing this word, went away sorrowing, for he had many possessions." "Went away sorrowing." This proves that the young man could not do good. He could not even keep the Ten Commandments; he could not give to the poor and could not love his neighbor as himself. God gave the law originally, knowing that man could never keep it. He desired only that after man had committed sin, he would know that he himself is a sinner (Rom. 3:20). The young man would rather forsake eternal life to gain worldly pleasure. Hence, he was a perishing one.</P><P>Verse 23:"And Jesus said to His disciples, Truly I say to you, Only with difficulty will a rich man enter into the kingdom of the heavens." "And Jesus said to His disciples." Here the Lord turned to another problem-the reward of the kingdom of the heavens. The seed of this parable was sown in verse 21. Seemingly, this parable is difficult to understand because eternal life, the kingdom of the heavens, the kingdom of God, and salvation are all mixed together. Actually, it is not difficult. One must distinguish two clear lines: (1) the young man was pursuing eternal life; and (2) the Lord used the incident of the young man as a teaching through which to explain to the disciples clearly the reward of the kingdom of the heavens. Verse 21 was the word of the kingdom. The Lord assumed that the young man was saved; hence, He used the word of the kingdom to point this out to him. To lay up treasure in heaven refers to the riches in the kingdom. "A rich man enter into the kingdom of the heavens." This word was for the disciples. The Lord assumed that this young man was a saved person. That is why this parable is so difficult.</P><P>Verse 24:"And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God." The eye of a needle has been referred to as the gate of a city. That is inaccurate. A camel was an animal used to carry the heavy burden and treasures of a rich man. It is not that a rich man cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Suppose the rich man forsakes his treasures when the Lord demands this of him. Certainly he can enter into the kingdom of the heavens. Therefore, it does not say that it is impossible for a rich man to enter the kingdom. Here the definition of a rich man is a person who is unwilling to commit to God that which he loves. This is a rich man. Therefore, it is possible to be a rich man with only five or ten dollars. "The kingdom of God." In the previous verse the kingdom of the heavens is mentioned. Here it says "the kingdom of God." What is the reason for this? There are three meanings of the kingdom of the heavens: (1) the realm of Christianity, (2) the church, and (3) the millennium. There are also three meanings of the kingdom of God: (1) spiritual experiences (Luke 14:15), (2) the millennium, and (3) eternity. The kingdom of the heavens in verse 23 refers to the millennium. But to avoid misunderstanding, verse 24 calls it the kingdom of God. (The only thing common between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens is the millennium.) This means that the kingdom of God in verse 24 has a specific meaning.</P><P>Verse 25:"And when the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and said, Who then can be saved?" "Greatly astonished." The disciples misunderstood because the Lord turned from the question of eternal life to the question of the reward. It is impossible for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. Hence, they assumed that no one could be saved. That was why they inquired of the Lord.</P><P>Verse 26:"And looking upon them, Jesus said to them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible." "And looking upon them." The eyes could speak. "With God all things are possible." Again, the question of the disciples turned the subject back to the matter of eternal life. Salvation depends on God. God can change the greediness of man. God can raise up Paul, Barnabas, Levi, Ceasar's household (Phil. 4:22), and the steward of Herod (Luke 8:3). The young man spoke as if he were able. Actually, he was not; only God is able.</P><P>Verse 27:"Then Peter answered and said to Him, Behold, we have left all and followed You. What then will there be for us?" Peter's question actually exposed (1) his self-righteousness, and (2) his commercial mentality. The Lord had two impressions concerning this question: (1) He agreed with Peter that the reward of the kingdom did actually depend on works, and (2) He disagreed with Peter's self-righteousness and his commercial mentality. In verses 28-30 the Lord encouraged and confirmed Peter's knowledge of the kingdom reward (Matt. 20:1-16); then He rebuked him for his commercial mentality.</P><P>Verse 28:"And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that you who have followed Me, in the restoration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." "You who have followed me." This refers to those who learn of the Lord, who walk on the narrow way, who bear the cross, and who are patient and meek. "In the restoration." This word is used twice in the Bible, here and in Titus 3:5. In the latter case it refers to personal revival, which is regeneration. Here it refers to the restoration of the world, which is the millennium (Rom. 8:19-23; Isa. 11:6-9). From Adam to Moses sin was in the world. From Moses to the Lord Jesus sin ruled. In this age the regenerated ones are delivered only from the power of sin; they are not delivered from the presence of sin. The same is true of the restoration of the world; first, there is the deliverance from the power of sin. (Satan will be bound for one thousand years. This means that in the millennium the Lord will improve society, but this will not be done through man.) After this, there will be the new heaven and the new earth. "Twelve thrones." Of course, Judas will not be there. That is why the Lord did not mention him. We do not need to find out who will replace him.</P><P>Verse 29:"And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for My name's sake shall receive a hundred times as much and shall inherit eternal life." These are no small words. The Gospel of Mark recorded "at this time" and "in the coming age" (Mark 10:30). Matthew does not use these phrases because everything mentioned here concerns the millennium. "A hundred times" does not mean one hundred fathers, but one hundredfold joy (which is many times more than the grief and pain one suffers when forsaking all). Eternal life here means eternal life in the kingdom. There are three stages of eternal life: (1) eternal life in the present age (John 5:24), (2) eternal life in the millennium (in the coming age, which means the next age, the millennium-Mark 10:30; Luke 18:30), and (3) eternal life in eternity (Rom. 2:7).</P><P>Verse 30: "But many first will be last, and many last first." This indicates that there is a difference in reward. Also, it is used as a warning against Peter's self-righteousness.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER TWENTY</H1><P>Verses 1-16:"For the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, who is a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire workmen for his vineyard. And having agreed with the workmen for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market place, and to those he said, You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you. And they went. And again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour and did likewise. And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and said to them, Why have you been standing here all the day idle? They said to him, Because no one has hired us. He said to them, You also go into the vineyard. And when evening fell, the master of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the workmen and pay them their wages, beginning from the last ones to the first. And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, they received each a denarius. And when the first ones came, they supposed that they would receive more. And they themselves also received each a denarius. And when they received it, they murmured against the householder, saying, These last ones worked one hour, and you have made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the scorching heat. But he answered one of them and said, Friend, I am doing nothing unrighteous to you. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? Take what is yours and go. I want to give to this last one even as I have given to you. Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is mine? Or is your eye evil because I am good? Thus shall the last be first and the first last."</P><P>This parable and the parable at the end of chapter eighteen are the most difficult ones to expound. We cannot expound them in detail but can only find out from them the teachings. First we have "a man, who is a householder" (similar to the king in chapter eighteen). The part that has to do with man cannot be explained; only the part that has to do with God can be explained. For example, the hiring of workers is mentioned. But God never hires any worker. Moreover, what does the denarius a day refer to? Then there is the murmuring-who as God's worker dares to murmur before Him? Therefore, concerning this kind of parable, only the principles can be applied and not the details.</P><P>Verse 30 of chapter nineteen should be included as the first verse of this chapter. (Notice that the division of the chapters and verses in the Bible was made not according to the leading of the Spirit.) Verse 30 is similar to verse 16 of this chapter. The Lord needed to deal with two things in answering Peter's question: (1) to express agreement by saying that one who has forsaken all for the Lord will receive a reward, and (2) to deal with Peter's wrong attitude-his self-righteousness, his commercial mentality, and his working for reward and not out of love for the Lord. Verses 28-29 of chapter nineteen deal with the first matter, while 19:30-20:16 deal with Peter's attitude. God has the final authority and is not restricted by the law. That is why in this parable the emphasis is on the sovereign authority of God and the fact that reward is according to His grace. Some have suggested that this parable refers to salvation. This is wrong, because salvation was accomplished by the Lord and is not gained through work. The householder here is God. In the early-morning shift, the first shift, God set the wages. In the second shift (the third hour), "whatever is right I will give you"; no agreement was made. The same is true for both the third shift (the sixth hour) and the fourth shift (the ninth hour). With the fifth shift (the eleventh hour), the reward was not even mentioned. The crucial point here is that the law does not come in. "Early in the morning" refers to one's youth. "A day" refers to a person's whole life. The ones hired in the eleventh hour had been standing idle since early morning because they were not called until then. For example, there are people who began to work for God when they were thirty years old, and there are some who began when they were forty years old. Verse 8 mentions that while giving the wages in the evening, they were given first to the laborers hired in the eleventh hour. If it had been the other way around, the ones working from the earliest hour would have received their wages first and would not have seen the reward of the later ones and would not have murmured against the householder. If that were the case, the Lord would not have been able to bring out the teaching of this parable. During the time of the reward, there will still be grace. If a man deserves a dime and only eight cents is given, that is unrighteous. Only grace can give the same reward to those who do not work as long as others. This is God's sovereignty. (This means that the Lord was saying, "Peter, you should not be self-boasting and self-righteous. In everything you have tried to be one step ahead of others. Yet my reward-the throne-did not shortchange you. God has the right to give to the latecomers, who sacrifice less, the same reward as He gives to you.")</P><P>Through this the Lord destroyed Peter's concept of legality and commerce. Peter had altogether forgotten God's grace and God's right. God cannot exercise His right to do unrighteous things; yet He can exercise His right to bestow grace. Those who emphasize reward too much will forget the Lord's love. That is why, after the Lord's resurrection, He asked Peter three times, "Do you love Me?" After that He said "Feed My sheep," which means to labor (John 21:15-18). There is a slight difference between the conclusions in Matthew 19:30 and 20:16. The "many" in 19:30 is more broad; it refers to Christians in general, probably including us and Peter. "The last" in verse 16 refers specifically to the eleventh hour laborers in the parable. The laborers were murmuring and had forgotten the things mentioned in Romans 9:14-15, 20. The eleventh hour laborers who received a denarius surely had thankful hearts. Hence, the Lord's teaching is to remind us that we are those who begin working at the eleventh hour. One must forget what he has forsaken for the Lord. In this way he will receive his denarius with satisfaction and thanksgiving. Otherwise, he will only remember his own sacrifices; he will not be satisfied with a denarius and will be stumbled. This is only a teaching; it does not mean that God is actually an employer, or that the laborers actually receive a reward. With the actual reward there is a difference between ten cities and five cities, and such a reward is given only in the millennium.</P><P>Verses 17-19:"And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside privately, and on the way He said to them, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes. And they will condemn Him to death, and deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify Him, and on the third day He will be raised." This is the third time the Lord foretold His own death. This shows that His death was not a martyr's death. Martyrdom occurs as an incidental matter, but the Lord knew how and when He was to die. There are two parts to the Lord's word: (1) The chief priests and the scribes were the religious part. The Lord was judged and condemned first by the Jews. (2) The Gentiles were the political part. Later He was executed by the Gentiles. These were all eventually fulfilled. First He was condemned by the Jews, and next He was delivered to Pilate. In the council the Jews accused Him of blasphemy. Before Pilate they accused Him of rebellion. The Jews were the directors and the instigators, and the Gentiles were the executors and the administrators.</P><P>Verse 20:"Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Him with her sons, worshipping and asking something of Him." The mother of the sons of Zebedee had only heard of such things as the reward and the throne. After hearing of these things, her heart was very much drawn. But she had also heard of the cross and the difficult requirement of self-denial. So she came to the Lord herself to discuss this matter. Her thought was that for her two sons to merely sit on one of the twelve thrones was not sufficient; they had to be the thrones of the greatest honor. The same thought is present among Christians today who think that they must be the greatest Christians. To them, merely to preach is not sufficient; they must lead revival meetings. She thought that since the Lord had once borrowed a boat, a net, and food from her, she could now ask something from the Lord and would not be rejected.</P><P>Verse 21:"And He said to her, What do you want? She said to Him, Say that these two sons of mine will sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your kingdom." The Lord asked, "What do you want?" After petitioning the Lord she still could not make the Lord understand what she wanted. She wanted one son to sit on His right hand and the other to sit on His left hand. She thought that if her sons received glory, she herself also would be honored. This is to bring the natural man into the kingdom. She thought that things in the kingdom of the heavens are the same as they are in the flesh.</P><P>Verses 22-23:"But Jesus answered and said to them, You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup which I am about to drink? They said to Him, We are able. He said to them, My cup you shall indeed drink, but to sit on My right and on My left, this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father." She thought that she knew what she was asking, but the Lord said, "You do not know what you are asking." They all said with one voice that they were able. They did not realize what they were saying. While the Lord was suffering, Peter escaped. To drink the cup means to submit to the Father's will. The baptism refers to the death of the cross (here there is no mention of baptism). The cup was in the garden of Gethsemane, while the baptism was on the cross (Luke 12:50). The cup signifies sacrifice and submission to God; baptism signifies death. The Gospel of Mark presents the Lord as the Servant; thus, it mentions baptism (an act of being put to death). The Gospel of Matthew presents the Lord as the King; hence, there is no mention of baptism, but only of the cup, which signifies the heart of submission. The position in the kingdom is not gained through relatives or prayer. "This is not Mine to give." This means that it cannot be given based on the Lord's likes and dislikes. The position in the kingdom is not gained at will; it is preassigned and is given to those who fulfill the requirements. Hence, any man who thinks that the saved ones can receive the kingdom is a son of Zebedee.</P><P>Verse 25:"But Jesus called them to Him and said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them." Verse 24 mentions ten disciples. The disciples were divided into two parties, one group of two and one group of ten. The ten thought that the two were too fleshly, unspiritual, proud, and discontent, not satisfied with what the Lord had given them, and were too selfish, caring only for themselves and not for their fellow disciples. Thus, the ten thought that they were indignant for righteousness's sake. Actually, they themselves also had selfish motives and pride; otherwise, they would not have quarreled. The two parties were the same, differing only in their words and intention. The ten disciples were sorry only that they did not have such a mother to speak up for them. "Jesus called them to Him." The Lord knew them; hence, He called them and spoke concerning three matters: (1) The church cannot be like the Gentiles, having rulers and great ones, because "you are all brothers" (Matt. 23:8). Therefore, to have the pope, the bishop, the pastor, and the priests is unscriptural and is against the Lord's command. Even if the title is not used and yet the fact exists, it is still not permitted. To rule and instruct others spiritually is permitted, but to rule over others positionally is absolutely forbidden. In the Bible the overseers, the shepherds, the elders, the teachers, etc. are all spiritual. Today in the church a very fleshy pastor can rule over a most spiritual carpenter. Men desire to be an elder or a deacon only because they want to increase their own power in the church. We ought to serve the Lord faithfully and strive to please Him. However, if a person tries to gain a higher position over others in the kingdom through his service, it is a sin.</P><P>Verses 26-27:"It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave." (2) A servant is one who is sent yet still has freedom. (3) "Slave" is a stronger word. "To be first" is to be the best within a group of people. Hence, those who want to be great must be a servant (less severe), while those who want to be the first must be a slave (more severe). The position in the kingdom is exactly opposite to today's situation. We want to be great and to be the first in this age, but the Lord wants us to receive the reward in the coming age. Man wants a reward but is unwilling to pay the price. To be great spiritually is to be humble and to suffer spiritually. We are able to be humble before God, yet it seems that we are unable to be humble before man.</P><P>Verse 28:"Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many." "The Son of Man" came. He descended from the highest position to the lowest position. He humbled Himself and took upon Himself the form of a slave, specifically to serve man; and not only did He serve man, but He became the Savior of man. (Today's YMCA probably has forgotten this verse in the Bible.)</P><P>Verse 29:"And as they were going out from Jericho, a great crowd followed Him." Jericho was a cursed place, but when the Lord came, it began to receive blessings.</P><P>Verse 30:"And behold, two blind men sitting by the road, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!" "Two blind men." The other Gospels mention only one. Actually, there were two. Matthew particularly recorded this because Matthew is a testimony of the Lord being David's descendant (One who is the King). Two is the number of testimony.</P><P>The two blind men's testimony attested to God's will: although the Lord was rejected, He still was the King. This incidence in Jericho was the prelude to His entrance into Jerusalem in chapter twenty-one (as the book of Jude is the prelude to Revelation).</P><P>Verse 31:"And the crowd rebuked them so that they would be silent, but they cried out the more, saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!" God's intention was to make them speak louder. To rebuke means to forbid; the crowd forbade them from testifying, yet God caused them to cry out even louder.</P><P>Verse 32:"And Jesus, standing still, called them and said, What do you want Me to do for you?" The Lord did not know the purpose of their prayer. That is why our prayers need to have a purpose. The reason our prayers uttered in times of crisis often receive an answer is that we ask with a purpose.</P><P>Verse 33:"They said to Him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened." Here the purpose of the prayer was given.</P><P>Verse 34:"And Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed Him." Many people, after their eyes are healed, immediately go sightseeing. After men receive blessings, they seek pleasure. However, these two men followed Him.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</H1><P>Verse 1:"And when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples." "Drew near to Jerusalem." This is the place where God's prophets were killed. Bethphage means "the household of the unripe figs." Jerusalem was originally the place of the kings. However, when the Lord came, He was rejected. This was because the figs were still unripe.</P><P>Verse 2:"Saying to them, Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her; untie them and lead them to Me." In the other Gospels only a colt was mentioned. In the Gospel of Matthew there are a donkey and a colt because this has typological significance. A colt was unclean. Only after it was ridden did it become clean.</P><P>Verse 3:"And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, The Lord has need of them; and immediately he will send them." "The Lord has need of them." Here "the Lord" is Jehovah. Therefore, the Lord Jesus made use of them in the capacity of the Creator. All things belong to the Creator. Bible expositors all say that the donkey signifies the Gentiles and the colt signifies the Israelites. Actually, the colt signifies the Gentiles and the donkey signifies the Israelites. The Lord gained the power through the Gentiles, but the Jews followed. It is most difficult to ride on a colt; even a donkey expert cannot do it. Every saved person was once a colt. After we were saved, the Lord rode on us as a colt. A horse signifies war; a donkey signifies peace. This time the Lord came as the Prince of Peace. When He comes the second time, He will ride on a white horse (Rev. 19:11).</P><P>Verse 4:"Now this took place in order that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying..." This verse fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet in Zechariah 9:9.</P><P>Verse 5:"Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your King is coming to you, meek and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, a foal of a beast of burden." In the prophet's prophecy there were such words as "righteous" and "salvation." In the Gospel of Matthew, the quotations from the Old Testament regarding salvation and righteousness refer to the kingdom. Thus, what the Lord indicated here was that although He was rejected, He was the King.</P><P>Verses 6-8:"And the disciples went and did as Jesus directed them, and led the donkey and the colt. And they put their garments on them, and He sat upon them. And most of the crowd spread their own garments in the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them in the road." The healing of the blind previously was the prelude because in that incident the Lord was called "the Son of David." Here, the people also called Him "the Son of David." Many Bible scholars say that this was the Lord's last offering of Himself to the Jews. But this cannot be right, because the Jews had already been rejected in chapter thirteen. Otherwise, why did the Lord dwell in Bethany? It was because Jerusalem had already become a forsaken place.</P><P>Verse 9:"And the crowds who went before Him and those who followed cried out, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!" "Hosanna" is a cry for help. (It indirectly means to praise.) It means that this One has the power and is worthy of our praise.</P><P>Verses 10-11:"And when He entered into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, Who is this? And the crowds said, This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee." It was a pity that on the way they addressed Him as "the Son of David," and yet here they identified Him as "the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee." Not too long after that they crucified Him on the cross. "All the city was stirred." This is parallel to the situation in chapter two. The situation on the way was good, but once He entered the city, things became different.</P><P>Verses 12-13:"And Jesus entered into the temple and cast out all those who were selling and buying in the temple. And He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling the doves, and He said to them, It is written, `My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you are making it a den of robbers." This was the Lord's purifying of the temple the second time. At the beginning of His ministry, He purified it the first time (John 2:13-17). Here it was the conclusion of His ministry, and there was the need for another purification. The first time it was "My Father's house," and He was purifying it in His qualification as the Son of God. Here it was "My house," and He was purifying it in His qualification as the Son of David and as the King. For the Lord to become a king, He must have the pure worship. "Money changers...selling the doves." To exchange money and to sell sacrificial animals surely provided convenience for those worshipping God. However, the Lord viewed these things as being unclean. In the matter of worship, the Lord has no need of an intermediary or a go-between. These things advertise themselves as providing convenience for men; actually they are there merely for monetary gain. Apparently it was for the convenience of the temple, but in reality it was in the nature of merchandizing. "A den of robbers." This does not refer to stealing. To open a shop on a big street is to do business. To open a store on a straight street also is to do business. But to open a stand in the temple is robbery. To be a teacher in a school is to do business; but to be a pastor in a church is to be a robber. A robber steals while people are not paying attention. The robbers in the church also work while people are not paying attention, the only difference is that people are thankful for their work. The Lord shows us that the temple must be pure.</P><P>Verse 14:"And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them." First He purified, which is to maintain the moral standard; then He healed, which is the outflow of grace. Here the sick ones are not sick with leprosy, but are sick with blindness and lameness. The Lord healed the eyesight and the strength. This means to make people understand His purpose and do His will.</P><P>Verses 15-16:"But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that He did and the children who were crying out in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David, they were indignant. And they said to Him, Do you hear what these are saying? And Jesus said to them, Yes. Have you never read, `Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings You have perfected praise'?" The previous praises were heartless praises; the praising ones were only following the crowd. This is why only a few little children remained here. When the chief priests and others saw the wonderful things that He did, they were very displeased. Apparently, they were jealous. The reason they could not praise Him was that they were not little children.</P><P>Verse 17:"And leaving them, He went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there." "To Bethany." During the last seven days, the Lord always went to Bethany and stayed in the house of Mary. There was no need for the Lord to notify the hostess concerning when He would go there. Today the demand on us should be the same. If He cannot find a dwelling place in Jerusalem, He could dwell in Bethany. In Bethany there was a household with life, love, and service. Bethany denotes a house of grace, love, and singing.</P><P>Verse 18:"Now in the morning as He returned to the city, He became hungry." "Returned to the city." The Lord returned from Bethany to Jerusalem. "Hungry." This means that there was one thing He had not gained and that He was not satisfied. The fig tree signifies the Jews (just as plum blossoms are the national flower of China). Grapes, figs, and olives all refer to Israel.</P><P>Verse 19:"And seeing a fig tree on the way, He came to it and found nothing on it except leaves only. And He said to it, May there no longer be fruit from you forever! And the fig tree was instantly dried up." The Gospel of Mark mentions that "it was not the season for figs" (Mark 11:13). This seems to imply that the Lord should not have cursed the fig tree. Christ said that the Jews had two harvests of figs: while the leaves were flourishing, the first-ripe figs were on the tree, after which there would be the harvest of ripe figs. This was why the Lord came to the fig tree to look for figs; otherwise, He would not have come to look for them. The time spoken of in the Gospel of Mark in relation to this event was during the big harvest. The Lord cursed the fig tree because its leaves were flourishing, and the outward appearance was quite good, yet in reality it was empty and deceiving. Leaves here refer to man's righteousness; leaves were used to cover the nakedness of Adam (Gen. 3:7). The fruit refers to that which truly satisfies God. "On the way." The meaning here is the same as that in chapter thirteen. It signifies being near to Satan. However, the tree will still revive and blossom in the future, but it will not be that particular tree.</P><P>Verses 20-21:"And when the disciples saw this, they marveled, saying, How did the fig tree instantly dry up? And Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, it will happen." All these things are done by faith. Once the Lord speaks, we should believe in His word. What we believe in are God's promises and His words. The sea signifies the Gentiles, whereas the mountain signifies the Israelites. To remove the mountain into the sea signifies the scattering of the Jews among the Gentiles until they disappear. The principle here is that sometimes our prayers ought to be directed at the mountain. The mountain, in teaching, signifies obstacles, a kind of fixed difficulty (flatness signifies ease). If we have sufficient faith and urgency in our prayers, we should speak directly to the difficulties. In healing the sick and in casting out demons, we not only should ask God, but when we have faith, we should rebuke the sickness and the demons also.</P><P>Verse 22:"And all that you ask in prayer, if you believe, you will receive." This is the greatest promise. We only need to believe.</P><P>Verse 23:"And when He came into the temple, the chief priests and elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching and said, By what authority do You do these things? And who gave You this authority?" The chief priests and the elders saw the wonders of His works, and they presented these two questions. These two questions are actually one question. If one is answered, the other is answered also.</P><P>Verses 24-27:"And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things. The baptism of John, from where did it come, from heaven or from men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, He will say to us, Why then did you not believe him? But if we say, From men, we fear the crowd, for all hold John as a prophet. And they answered Jesus and said, We do not know. He too said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things." "I also will ask." Believers can learn from the Lord here. When people ask you unwarranted questions, you can ask them something back. The Lord did not answer because He had already given them too much light and revelation. Too much light can only blind the eyes. The Lord's question was quite meaningful. John was the forerunner of the Lord. They had once asked John if he was the Christ. John had testified that he was not. Hence, if they would first answer the question concerning John, their other question would be solved by itself. They were most cunning. They did not believe, yet they were unwilling to speak up. They said: "We do not know." This was a lie. Actually, they could not say that they knew. If they said it, they would lose their face. "Neither do I tell you." It is a question of authority; the Lord did not say that He did not know or that He could not answer. He is omnipotent and omniscient, and He could never lie. The principle here is to either ask a question in return or not answer at all.</P><P>Verses 28-30:"But what do you think? A man had two children. And he came to his first son and said, Child, go today and work in the vineyard. And he answered and said, I do not want to; yet later he regretted and went. And he came to the other and said likewise. And he answered and said, I will, sir; yet he did not go." This parable points out the positions of the Pharisees, scribes, elders, chief priests, etc. The two children both refer to the Israelites, because according to the flesh, they were the chosen ones. (In this age only the saved ones are brothers; in John 8 the Jews were considered the sons of the devil. "The first son" refers to the publicans and the harlots, the sinners who have obeyed and repented. "The other" refers to the Pharisees and those like them; they were sons only in name. They prayed on the street and decorated their garments with the Scriptures, but they did not keep the important parts of the law. Here the Lord asked them to draw their own conclusion. In dealing with sinners, we should do the same; we should ask them to draw their own conclusion. Here they could not draw the conclusion.</P><P>Verses 31-32:"Which of the two did the will of the father? They said, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the harlots are going into the kingdom of God before you. For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him. And you, when you saw it, did not later regret it to believe him." "The way of righteousness" here means the way of peace. Although John encouraged them once, and the faith of the tax collectors and harlots encouraged them once again, they still would not believe. "The kingdom of God." Why not say "the kingdom of the heavens"? If "the kingdom of the heavens" had been used, the real significance would be lost here. The kingdom of God mentioned here refers to the spiritual reality. Without regeneration one cannot enter into the kingdom of God (John 3:3, 5). "Before you." This is a Greek expression; it does not mean that the Pharisees would eventually enter the kingdom of God after the tax collectors. Rather, it means that the tax collectors would enter while these Pharisees would not.</P><P>Verses 33-40:"Hear another parable. There was a man, a householder, who planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower; and he leased it out to vinedressers and went abroad. And when the time to harvest the fruit drew near, he sent his slaves to the vinedressers to get his fruit. And the vinedressers took his slaves and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. Again, he sent some other slaves, more than the first, and they did likewise to them. Then later he sent to them his son, saying, They will respect my son. But the vinedressers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and take possession of his inheritance. And they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. Therefore when the master of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?" This parable is concerning "a man, a householder." Hence, it cannot be interpreted on the human level, because (1) God never goes away to a foreign country, and (2) God foreknew that the Jews would kill the Lord. The householder refers to God. The vineyard signifies the realm of Israel. The hedge signifies protection (Job 1:10). "Winepress." Wine refers to that which makes man happy. The tower is a watchtower, by which one acquires knowledge. "Leased it out." It is not for sale, and it is absolutely not given away. To lease it out means that God has the ownership and that He asked the Jews only to manage it for Him. If interpreted on the human level, the fact that He "went abroad" is unexplainable. "And when the time to harvest the fruit drew near." This shows the earnestness of God's desire. Before the Lord came, God already had such a desire. The "slaves" signify the prophets who came before the Lord, who were all persecuted and even killed. "His son" refers to the Lord Jesus. "They will respect my son." This was spoken according to human logic. As far as God is concerned, the Lord did not stumble into death at the hands of fate; instead, He came purposely to die, to humble Himself, and to take the form of a slave. "This is the heir." Again this is true only as far as the human aspect of the parable is concerned, because the scribes and the Pharisees basically denied Him as the heir. The vinedressers signify the Pharisees, the scribes, the chief priests, etc.</P><P>Verse 41:"They said to Him, He will miserably destroy those evil men and will lease the vineyard to other vinedressers, who will give the fruit to him in their seasons." They drew this conclusion by themselves. This was fulfilled at the time Titus destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70. However, only a part was fulfilled; the major part will be fulfilled during the great tribulation. They said, "His blood be upon us [A.D. 70] and upon our children [the great tribulation]!" (Matt. 27:25). The "other vinedressers" (v. 41) are the Jews in the kingdom and not the Jews at the present time.</P><P>Verse 42:"Jesus said to them, Have you never read in the Scriptures, `The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner. This was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" "The builders" signify the scribes, the Pharisees, and the chief priests. "The stone...the head of the corner" signifies the Lord Jesus (see Psa. 118:22-23; Acts 4:11). "Marvelous." The Jews, who have a blood relationship with the Lord, do not believe, yet we, the Gentiles, believe. The cornerstone also refers to resurrection. "Have you never read?" They could ask themselves.</P><P>Verse 43:"Therefore I say to you that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing its fruit." The kingdom of God here refers to the spiritual reality. One can take away only another's spiritual experience.</P><P>Verse 44:"And he who falls on this stone shall be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it shall crush him to powder and scatter him like chaff." To the Jews the Lord was the rock of stumbling. The Jews were stumbled because the Lord was not splendorous and did not have a kingly demeanor (see Isa. 8:14-15; Rom. 9:32-33; 1 Cor. 1:23; 1 Pet. 2:8). To the church the Lord is the rock and the cornerstone (1 Cor. 3:11; Eph. 2:20-22; 1 Pet. 2:4-5). To the Gentiles the Lord is the smiting stone (Dan. 2:34). The first part of verse 44 refers to the Jews, and the second part refers to the Gentiles. Concerning the Gentiles they must wait for the coming of the kingdom (Dan. 2:44). Today the Jews say that He is the carpenter's son, a deceiver, and they are stumbled.</P><P>Verses 45-46:"And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they perceived that He was speaking concerning them. And though they sought to seize Him, they feared the crowds because they held Him as a prophet." Unbelievers are fearful of everything. Christians are bold; they are not afraid of being despised and ridiculed. Fearful people dare not believe in the Lord; they reap for themselves eternal perdition.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</H1><P>The parable in verses 1-14 is again a parable that cannot be applied fully in the human sense, because it is unreasonable for one to kill his slaves; the king cannot be so free as to socialize with the poor people; and he would never send an army to kill the ones he has called. </P><P>Verse 1:"And Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying." "Again" means that this verse is a continuation of the previous parable. This parable is very much related to the parable of the wicked vinedressers, which refers to God's rejecting of the Jews because they had rejected the Lord. The next parable refers to the acceptance of the Gentiles by God after He had rejected the Jews. However, not every Gentile will be saved.</P><P>Verse 2:"The kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son." "The kingdom of the heavens has become like a king." It does not say "the church," but "the kingdom of the heavens." Hence, the sphere here includes the unsaved. The church (the universal church, not the local church) includes only all the saved believers. It does not include the unsaved. (The similar parable in the book of Luke exclusively touches the matter of the gospel. The nature of the parable there is different from the nature of the one here. From this we can say that they refer to different things.) A wedding signifies the establishing of a covenant. The feast signifies the riches of God prepared for man. No bride is mentioned here because the bride is not the goal. (The church is likened to a bride only in this age. In the future the Lamb's wife will be the New Jerusalem and not the church. The Lamb's wife is a type, while the New Jerusalem is an actual description. An actual description cannot be considered a type nor can it be used to typify something else. For example, the seven golden lampstands are a type; they equal the seven churches as an actual description. The seven churches equal seven actual churches at the time.)</P><P>Verse 3:"And he sent his slaves to call those who had been called to the wedding feast, yet they would not come." The slaves refer to the disciples of the Lord and of John the Baptist. "Those who had been called" are the Israelites. God sent the slaves to invite the Israelites to come and enjoy the riches of God. Such is the ministry of the twelve apostles and the seventy disciples and of the disciples of John. "Yet they would not come." They would not believe their testimonies.</P><P>Verse 4:"Again, he sent other slaves, saying, Tell those who have been called, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatted cattle have been slain, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast." "Other slaves." At Pentecost the apostles and the disciples testified to the Jews the second time. They worked all the time in Jerusalem and did not even go into Samaria. Therefore, God allowed persecution to come upon them to scatter them among the Gentiles (Acts 8:1, 4). When Paul first began to work, he was the same; he worked only among the Jews until all the Jews in the diaspora [dispersion] had rejected the Lord. At that point he declared his turn to the Gentiles (Acts 13:46-48). Verse 3 only gives the call, and then in verse 4 it says, "My oxen and my fatted cattle have been slain," which means that the Lord Jesus has already died and resurrected. (The Gospel of Luke does not stress His Messiahship; hence, it does not mention this matter.)</P><P>Verses 5-6:"But they disregarded it and went off, one to his own field and another to his business, and the rest took hold of his slaves, treated them shamefully, and killed them." "Disregarded it." This was the situation at Pentecost. Although three thousand and five thousand were saved, that was still a small number. It was only a small remnant. Josephus said that the day when the Lord was crucified there were three million people in Jerusalem. "Field" signifies agriculture, whereas "business" signifies commerce. "Took hold of his slaves...and killed them." They killed Stephen, murdered James, and imprisoned the apostles (Acts 7:58-60; 12:2-4). "The rest" are those who were neither in agriculture nor in commerce. This means the chief priests, the scribes, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, etc. Both verse 4 and verse 5 were fully fulfilled.</P><P>Verse 7:"And the king became angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city." This was fulfilled in A.D. 70 when Titus destroyed Jerusalem; blood was shed all over the streets.</P><P>Verse 8:"Then he said to his slaves, The wedding feast is ready, but those who have been called were not worthy." "Those who have been called" refers to the Jews. The riches of God cannot be wasted just because of their refusal.</P><P>Verse 9:"Go therefore to the crossroads, and as many as you find, call to the wedding feast." The previous called ones were preassigned. We, the Gentiles, seem to have received our salvation by accident and by grace. "As many as you find." Whoever believes shall have eternal life; the Gentiles received the grace.</P><P>Verse 10:"And those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found, both evil and good, and the wedding feast was filled with those reclining at table." "Both evil and good." The calling today does not depend on how good or bad a person's past history was. The riches of the gospel have nothing to do with the good or evil in the past. The final goal of the gospel is the glorifying of His Son.</P><P>Verse 11:"But when the king came in to look at those reclining at table, he saw there a man who was not clothed with a wedding garment." "He saw there a man." This is to stand before the judgment seat. Within the realm of the kingdom of the heavens, the gospel has been preached everywhere. However, not all will be saved. "A man who was not clothed with a wedding garment." In Oriental countries the wedding garment is not prepared by the guest. The wedding garment signifies Christ as our robe of righteousness. We are clothed with Christ (Rom. 13:14; Gal. 3:27). God has clothed us with the robe of righteousness (Isa. 61:10). This wedding garment was prepared for us by God; "all things are ready" (v. 4). Unfortunately, this man thought that his clothing was good enough (self-righteousness); he was unwilling to take it off and was unwilling to change. He did not rely on the righteousness of Jesus.</P><P>Verse 12:"And he said to him, Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment? And he was speechless." The Lord did not ask why he had beaten others, lied, or transgressed against the law prior to this. He only asked why he had no wedding garment. The Lord does not ask for our past history; He only asks whether or not we have the righteousness of Christ. The word "speechless" proves that this man knew that this was wrong, and yet he transgressed intentionally. Although the man was poor, the king had already made the provision. The man might have considered himself unworthy, but the king had the garment. The only problem was that he would not remove his own garment and put on the king's.</P><P>Verse 13:"Then the king said to the servants, Bind his feet and hands, and cast him out into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth." The fruit of not depending on Christ is perdition. The darkness here is different from that in chapter twenty-five.</P><P>Verse 14:"For many are called but few are chosen." There are many people in the realm of the kingdom of the heavens, but the number of saved ones is small. Do not think that because there was only one person, that must be the Jews. Within the church today there are more tares than wheat.</P><P>Verse 15:"Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might ensnare Him in His words." The following verses are the record of how the Jews tempted Jesus. They could not find anything that they could hold against Him concerning His conduct. Hence they tried to find it in His words. Today men do the same thing.</P><P>Verse 16:"And they sent to Him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that You are true and that You teach the way of God in truth and do not fear anyone, for You do not regard the person of men." The Pharisees and the Herodians (those who pleased the foreigners, the traitors of the Jews) formerly opposed one another, but now they joined together to tempt the Lord. "Their disciples." Only the blind students would come under the tutelage of blind instructors. "You are true." First they flattered the Lord because they were afraid that He would lie and that they would not be able to entangle Him. "And do not fear anyone." This means, "You, Jesus, will speak the truth to us, the Pharisees and Herodians, regardless of Caesar." "Do not fear anyone" means the same thing as "do not regard the person of men." Even before Pilate He would speak the truth.</P><P>Verse 17:"Tell us therefore, What do You think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?" "What do You think?" They did not say that this ought to be done or that this was according to the law. By asking, "What do you think?" they thought that they could trap Him. "Is it lawful...or not?" Both ways posed a trap. One way would make the Lord a traitor to Israel, while the other way would make Him a rebel to Rome.</P><P>Verses 18-19:"But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, Why do you tempt Me, hypocrites? Show Me the coin for the tribute. And they brought to Him a denarius." He exposed their hypocrisy and their evil plot right then and there. He did not have silver or gold. "Show Me the coin for the tribute." Only those who give tribute will have Caesar's money; the Lord did not have it.</P><P>Verses 20-21:"And He said to them, Whose is this image and inscription? They said, Caesar's. Then He said to them, Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar and the things that are God's to God." The question and the conclusion of the Lord are not only full of wisdom, but they are also full of instructions. (1) The believers should not become involved with politics, because the things that are Caesar's should be rendered to Caesar. (2) The believers ought to pay taxes, because the things that are Caesar's should be rendered to Caesar. (The saved ones themselves are the possessions of God; hence, they should not be used for the government.) (3) The reason that the Jewish nation was in captivity was that they had not rendered the things of God to God. On the contrary, they had worshipped idols; therefore, God had to punish them. "Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar" is the instruction of the entire book of Jeremiah. At first the Jews thought that they would not render the things of God to God or the things of Caesar to Caesar.</P><P>Verse 22:"And when they heard this, they marveled. And they left Him and went away." One cannot help but marvel at such wisdom. If any reader does not feel that this is marvelous, he must be worse than the Jews.</P><P>Verse 23:"On that day some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to Him and questioned Him." The two parties departed and the Sadducees appeared on the scene; this is like a round-the-clock war. The Sadducees believed that there is no resurrection and that a person is completely terminated after he dies. Hence, they believed that there are neither demons nor angels. Men are prone to develop hypothetical problems to entangle others, just as the Sadducees of old did.</P><P>Verses 24-28:"Saying, Teacher, Moses said, If anyone dies and does not have children, his brother as next of kin shall marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother. Now there were seven brothers with us. And the first married and died, and having no seed, he left his wife to his brother. Likewise also the second and the third until the seventh. And last of all the woman died. In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her." The supposedly difficult problem, "Now there were seven brothers with us," was absolutely fictitious.</P><P>Verse 29:"And Jesus answered and said to them, You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God." "You err." This was the Lord's judgment concerning them. The phrase "not knowing the Scriptures" indicates that they had no spiritual knowledge. The phrase "nor the power of God" indicates that they had no spiritual experience. These are the reasons for making mistakes. Hence, a believer ought to have both knowledge and experience.</P><P>Verses 30-32:"For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, `I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living." "For in the resurrection" refers to the rapture. "Neither marry nor are given in marriage" does not refer to the angels. The Lord not only pointed out resurrection; what He was saying was: "You say that when a person dies, he is terminated. If that is the case, God should have introduced Himself in the section concerning the bush as `the God of the dead,' and such a God could never have encouraged Moses." The logic here was that God is the God of Abraham; since Abraham is a dead person, this would make God the God of the dead. However, He is not the God of the dead. Therefore, although Abraham is dead, he will become alive again (cf. 8:11). Jacob and Isaac also will be resurrected. Concerning resurrection, see 1 Corinthians 15:50-58.</P><P>Verse 33:"And when the crowds heard this, they were astounded at His teaching." Their being astounded is the indication of defeat. They thought that it was a difficult problem. However, the Lord still was able to answer it. "Astounded" means to marvel.</P><P>Verses 34-35:"But the Pharisees, when they heard that He had muzzled the Sadducees, gathered themselves together. And one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him." The phrase "gathered themselves together" indicates that they regrouped because they sympathized with one another's similar defeats. The lawyer was so proud that he would not admit to being humbled by the Lord's eloquence.</P><P>Verse 36:"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?" The lawyer asked the Lord, "Which is the great commandment in the law?" because a person cannot emphasize one commandment and neglect another (cf. James 2:10).</P><P>Verses 37-38:"And He said to him, `You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the great and first commandment." "The great and first commandment," because it includes the entire law. To violate one of the commandments of the law equals not loving God with "all."</P><P>Verse 39:"And the second is like it: `You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'" "Neighbor" refers to anyone besides oneself. The neighbor can also refer to the Lord Jesus. See the parable of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:30).</P><P>Verse 40:"On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets." The two commandments encompass the entire law. The former includes all laws in relation to God, and the latter includes all laws in relation to man. The Ten Commandments were originally divided into two parts, those related to God and those related to man.</P><P>Verse 41:"Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus questioned them." "Jesus questioned them." It seems as if the Lord was saying, "You have asked Me enough questions. Let me now ask you one question."</P><P>Verse 42:"Saying, What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose son is He? They said to Him, David's." "What do you think?" This is parallel to verse 17. This question seems to be one for a three-year-old child. The Lord did not ask a difficult question, because He was afraid that they would not answer (see Matt. 21:27).</P><P>Verses 43-45:"He said to them, How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, `The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies underneath Your feet'? If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?" "The Lord said to my Lord." The first "Lord" is Jehovah, and the second "Lord" is the Messiah. The Lord desires to show us that according to the flesh, Christ is the Son of David. Yet according to the Spirit, He is the Lord of David. The Pharisees knew the Lord only as the Son of David. They were like today's modernists. Thank God that He is also the Lord of David.</P><P>Verse 46:"And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone from that day dare to question Him anymore." The reason they could not answer was that they knew the answer yet were unwilling to answer.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</H1><P>Chapter twenty-three is the easiest chapter in the Gospel of Matthew. This chapter contains only teachings; it does not have any doctrines.</P><P>Verse 1:"Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples." In the Lord's preaching, He never mixed the multitude with His disciples. Therefore, the mixing here is quite unusual. The reason the Lord mixed them together is that the following teaching put the disciples in the position of the Jews. The teaching in this chapter is specifically for the Jews.</P><P>Verse 2:"Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in Moses' seat." "Seated themselves in Moses' seat." According to Jewish history, since the time of Moses the Jews underwent several significant changes: wicked kings, captivity, and destruction. Therefore, people had become ignorant and no longer observed the law of Moses. The only exception was a group of zealous individuals who came out publicly to lead the Jews back to the original law. This kind of people were the forefathers of the Pharisees and the scribes. In the beginning these people were genuinely standing in the position of Moses to execute and teach the law. Yet generation after generation went by until the time of Jesus, when only the name remained but not the reality. Here the Lord did not deny that, nominally, they were still sitting in Moses' seat.</P><P>Verse 3:"Therefore all that they tell you, do and keep; but do not do according to their works, for they say things and do not do them." "Do and keep" all the law. Before the death of the Lord, the Jews still had to observe the law. The law did not cease until the Lord died. At that time they were not yet free from the law; hence, the Lord charged the Jews and His disciples to observe the law. The principle in this verse is very important. Today among the churches there are two opinions concerning the law: (1) A person is saved by grace and not by keeping the law. After one is saved, he still does not have to keep the commandments, except the commandment of grace. (2) A person is saved by grace and not by keeping the law. However, if one desires to be sanctified, he must observe the law. The first opinion is the correct one. According to the main focus of the book of Romans, a sinner cannot be justified by keeping the law. According to Galatians, a saved person cannot be sanctified by keeping the law. Therefore, these two books are sufficient to prove that justification and sanctification can never be obtained by keeping the law. The teaching in Romans 7 shows that a saved person who still keeps the law is an adulterer. If he still keeps the law, then the law is not yet dead. If he then desires to marry Christ, this is fornication. Therefore, we must die completely to the law in order that we may gain eternal life through Christ. Because of the period of time the disciples were in then, the Lord spoke concerning the keeping of the law. After the Lord resurrected, He did not mention this matter anymore.</P><P>"They say things and do not do them." This is altogether contrary to the Lord. The Lord is "powerful in work and word" (Luke 24:19). Today many preachers also can say things but cannot do them.</P><P>Verse 4:"And they bind burdens, heavy and hard to bear, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger." "And they bind burdens, heavy and hard to bear, and lay them on men's shoulders" means that based on the law, they created more laws besides the existing laws, and bound them on men's shoulders; yet they themselves would not follow the law. Originally, they decided that (1) the transgressor of Moses' law would be punished, but the transgressor of their law could be forgiven. (2) Gradually the two laws became equally important; transgressors of both laws would be punished equally. (3) Finally, it was the transgressor of the law of Moses who could be forgiven, and the transgressor of their law who had to be severely punished. They considered their law the essence of Moses' law, and that they were, therefore, more important. The corban was one example of this (Mark 7:11-13). (Today's charters, creeds, beliefs etc. are of the same principle.) Among the laws, they observed the easy ones. Those that they could not observe, they charged the multitude of Jews to observe. Today men are the same. They take the easy ones among the commandments in the Scriptures to be for the Gentiles, and the hard ones (such as Matthew 5-7) to be for the Jews or for the millennium. Can it be that they have learned from the Pharisees?</P><P>Verse 5:"And all their works they do to be seen by men, for they broaden their phylacteries and enlarge the fringes of their garments." Here the Lord pointed out that "all their works they do to be seen by men." The Lord exposed their true form and real image and pointed out that this was most dangerous. Donations and preachings are but the false masks of some who want to show off their zeal and "spirituality." "Phylacteries"- the Jews strapped Scripture quotations to their bodies (see Deut. 6:8; 11:18). "Fringes"-the borders of the garments; the Scriptures were sewn on the borders of their garments.</P><P>Verse 6:"And they love the place of honor at the dinners and the chief seats in the synagogues." This is pride before men. The following verses are concerning men.</P><P>Verse 7:"And the salutations in the market places and to be called by men, Rabbi." The same is true with men today: they like to be others' teachers. Nevertheless, here the Lord wants us to see clearly their goal and intention. Many times we are very zealous, and we do many good works. But what is the goal and the intention of all these?</P><P>Verse 8:"But you, do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers." The Lord turned the subject here for our instruction. "But you, do not be called Rabbi." All believers are equal on earth, and no one can be higher than another. In the church, the term pastor is but another name for Rabbi. Elders and deacons are appointed only for the purpose of service; there is no existence of rank. Whoever receives a clerical rank or a clerical position has degraded to the position of the Pharisees.</P><P>Verse 9:"And do not call anyone on earth your father, for One is your Father, He who is in the heavens." The word "father" here does not refer to the father in a family but to a father in the church, one who is in authority, such as the "fathers" in Catholicism. (The following "Father...who is in the heavens" proves that the "father" here denotes a religious father.) Unfortunately, by the second century the church fathers had come into being in the church; these were actually the disciples of the apostles.</P><P>Verse 10:"Neither be called instructors, because One is your Instructor, the Christ." An instructor is less honorable than a rabbi; it refers to a religious person. To be called a rabbi is a great thing, and one should never accept such a title. The Lord has ordained that we call one another brothers and sisters.</P><P>Verse 11:"And the greatest among you shall be your servant." This is the second time the Lord mentioned this matter (see Matt. 20:26-27). The principle here is most important. To be genuinely great does not depend on fame, position, or title; it depends only on whether one can work and serve.</P><P>Verse 12:"And he who will exalt himself shall be humbled, and he who will humble himself shall be exalted." This is the way of the cross. To humble oneself is a self-initiated humbling. A person does not need to wait until he is despised by others; he should be without vainglory in himself.</P><P>Matthew 23:13-33 mentions seven woes. (Verse 14 is found only in some ancient manuscripts and does not have sufficient support from the authorities.) The first through fourth woes belong to one category, and the fifth through seventh woes belong to another category.</P><P>Verse 13:"But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you close off the kingdom of the heavens in the face of men; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to enter." The Lord said woe only to the scribes and Pharisees. He did not say woe to the sinners, the harlots, the tax collectors, the Sadducees (the modernists), and the Herodians (traitors). This is because the woe of the latter group of people is obvious; even the women and the young ones all know it, and it is not worth describing. However, the Pharisees and scribes were like the respectable ones in the church; people think that they should receive a reward and a blessing. Hence, the Lord specifically exposed their real condition. "You close off the kingdom of the heavens." The kingdom of the heavens refers to a spiritual realm; it signifies the genuine church on the earth, the corporate entity that loves the Lord directly. The Pharisees and scribes prevented people from believing in Jesus; their unrighteousness stumbled others, and their erroneous teachings caused others to fall.</P><P>Verse 15:"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you go about the sea and the dry land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna as yourselves." They proselytized Gentiles to Judaism. They zealously preached and declared that the Gentiles who worshipped idols would perish, and that they ought to worship the only true God, who created the heavens and the earth. After these Gentiles entered into Judaism and became proselytes, the Pharisees and scribes could not nurture them, nor could they testify anything to them. Instead, they brought in their original wickedness in addition to the wickedness of the Pharisees. Therefore, they became "twice as much a son of Gehenna."</P><P>Verses 16-17:"Woe to you, blind guides, who say, Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound. Fools and blind men, which is greater, the gold or the temple which sanctifies the gold?" These were the laws they added, that is, that the gold is greater than the temple. The reason they prized gold as greater was because gold is valuable.</P><P>Verses 18-19:"And, Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift which is upon it, he is bound. Blind men, which is greater, the gift or the altar which sanctifies the gift?" The Pharisees considered the gift as greater than the altar because they were for the gift. However, the Lord said that the temple and the altar were greater because they sanctified the gold and the gift. Here the Lord shows us the teaching related to sanctification. To be sanctified is not to uproot the root of sin, as in pulling out a painful tooth. Otherwise, what would both the gold and the gift pull out? To be sanctified means to be separated. There are gold and gifts everywhere, but those that are separated unto God are sanctified, and no one can touch them. It is the same with the sanctification of the believers; to be sanctified is to be separated from among men. There are two sanctifications, which are typified by the temple and the altar. The temple typifies Christ (Matt. 12:6; John 2:21), and the gold in the temple typifies our abiding in Christ. The altar typifies consecration, the consecration after being saved, which is to be separated for the Lord's use.</P><P>Verses 20-22:"Therefore he who swears by the altar swears by it and by all the things upon it; and he who swears by the temple swears by it and by Him who dwells in it; and he who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it." These verses point out how their laws were hypocritical and without foundation.</P><P>Verses 23-24:"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you give a tenth of the mint and the anise and the cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law-justice and mercy and faithfulness. But these you should have done and not neglected the others. Blind guides, who strain out the gnat but swallow the camel!"</P><P>The following three woes speak of their living. They kept the ordinance of the law in vain and had no heart to walk in justice, mercy, and faithfulness. They would strain out the smallest gnat from their food, but would swallow a camel without feeling anything.</P><P>Verse 25:"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish, but inwardly they are full of extortion and self-indulgence." The above passage speaks of the Pharisees' avoiding the important issues and dwelling on the unimportant ones. They seek only after the outward appearance. "Extortion" indicates utilizing one's own lustful desire to repress and control others. "Self-indulgence" refers to indulging in lustful desire with one's own body.</P><P>Verses 26-28:"Blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and the dish so that their outside also may become clean. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you resemble white-washed graves, which outwardly appear beautiful but inwardly are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. So you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness." "Graves" refers to the dwelling places of the dead. White-washing means to beautify. To whiten the outward appearance when the flesh is dead is to cover up its death.</P><P>Verses 29-30:"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build up the graves of the prophets and adorn the tombs of the righteous, and say, If we had been there in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets." They were very fond of building monuments for people, thinking that their forefathers were most wicked because they killed the prophets. It is the same with the Jews today. They think that if Christ had been born in this age, they would not have crucified Him.</P><P>Verses 31-32:"So then you testify against yourselves that you are the sons of those who murdered the prophets. And you, fill up the measure of your fathers!" Their boasting only proved that they were the generation of vipers. "Fill up" refers to killing the Lord and His disciples.</P><P>Verse 33:"Serpents! Brood of vipers! How shall you escape the judgment of Gehenna?" The Lord here indeed did not "regard the person of men"; He rebuked them as serpents and as the brood of vipers (serpents refer to Satan). They called God their Father and they called themselves the descendants of Abraham (John 8:39, 41), and yet they were really "the children of the devil" (1 John 3:10; John 8:44). Here the Lord mentions more concerning hell. Preachers should mention hell because God is not "good" in an irresponsible way. But the heretical preachers would not teach this.</P><P>Verse 34:"Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city." In this verse the Lord prophesied how the saints would suffer persecution and martyrdom later on. The Lord said that the scribes and Pharisees not only white-washed the graves and adorned the tombs, but were setting traps.</P><P>Verses 35-36:"So that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah, son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. Truly I say to you, All these things shall come upon this generation." Abel was the first person who was killed. The Zachariah here is not the Zechariah in 2 Chronicles 24:20-21. That Zechariah was too early, and he was also the son of Jehoiada. This is Zechariah the prophet, because he was the son of Berechiah (Zech. 1:1). Berechiah and Barachiah have a similar pronunciation, the only difference being that one name is Hebrew and the other is Greek. This is similar to Messiah and Messias, and Elijah and Elias, being the same person. The prophet Zechariah certainly was the last prophet, the prophet after the captivity. He was killed in the temple. After the destruction of the nation, he was one who suffered public persecution and was unfortunately killed. "This generation" extends from that day until now. Its scope is very broad and includes not only the Jews.</P><P>Verse 38:"Behold, your house is left to you desolate." "Your house" means the temple. The Lord did not say "the Father's house" or "My house," because the Jews were already rejected. (See the following passage in 24:1, where it says that Jesus left the temple.) After this the Lord said, "You shall by no means see Me from now on until you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord" (v. 39). After the great tribulation and during the millennium, the Israelites will bless the Lord. But at the present time the wild olive tree of the Gentiles is being grafted in (Rom. 11:24).</P><P>The great tribulation means the end of the dispensation of grace. All the dispensations have similar endings. At the end of the dispensation of innocence there was the exile from Eden. At the end of the dispensation of the conscience there was the flood. At the end of the dispensation of human government there was the confounding of the languages. At the end of the dispensation of the promises there was the sojourning in Egypt. At the end of the dispensation of the law there was the captivity. At the end of the dispensation of grace there will be the great tribulation, and at the end of the dispensation of the kingdom there will be the destruction by heavenly fire.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</H1><P>In order to understand Matthew 24 and 25, we must first understand the rapture. After we have understood the rapture, we still need a considerable foundation before we can understand Matthew 24 and 25. These two chapters are prophecies concerning (1) the Jews, (2) the church, and (3) the Gentiles. Besides Revelation, these two chapters are the most important prophecies in this age. Revelation covers the details, whereas Matthew covers the principle. These two chapters are most difficult to understand. Until a hundred years ago, no one paid much attention to them. It was not until 1828 that people began to study them in detail. Because of differences in background, the expositions were different. Generally speaking, there are three schools: (1) Newton maintains that both these chapters refer to the church. (2) Darby and Scofield maintain that both these chapters refer to the Jews. (3) Our attitude is that some parts refer to the Jews and some parts to the church. The reasons put forth by the three schools respectively are: (1) the disciples represent the church, (2) the disciples represent the Jews, and (3) the disciples are Jews (representing the remnant of the Jews) and also at the same time are pillars of the church.</P><P>It is most important to see the difference in the division of these two chapters; otherwise, we will be misled by the first two schools. We must read carefully, and we must read it ourselves. This is like bringing our own scales to buy our groceries; it is the only way to assure that we will not be cheated.</P><P>Let us look at the background of chapters twenty-two and twenty-three first. In Matthew 21:43 the Lord prophesied about the taking of the kingdom of God from the Jews, and in 22:21 the Lord commanded the Jews to submit to the Gentiles. In chapter twenty-three the Lord rebuked the Pharisees. In 23:38 the word "house" has the same root word as the word "buildings" in 24:1. It should have been the Father's house, but at that time it had become "your house." Here the Lord was clearly rejecting the people of Israel. This is the background.</P><P>Before the Lord there are two groups of people: (1) the rejected Jews, and (2) a nation producing its fruit (21:43). The disciples represented both the remnant of the Jews and the called ones, that is, both the Jews and the church. Thus, we should first find out which section refers to the Jews and which section to the church. Matthew 24:1-31 refers to the Jews; whereas 24:32-25:46 refers to the church. The reason for this division is based on the internal evidence and the external evidence. The internal evidence is the text itself; the external evidence is the proof from the Epistles.</P><P>(1) Matthew 24:1-31 refers to the Jews because these verses are all interpreted literally, whereas 24:32-25:46 must be interpreted spiritually. For example, in Matthew 24:20 the "winter" refers to the wintertime, to the hardship in escaping. The Sabbath day also should be interpreted literally. On the other hand, the "summer" in 24:32 is interpreted spiritually; it refers to the coming of the kingdom. The fig tree refers to some Israelites. Also, the reference to the "inner rooms" in 24:26 is interpreted literally, while the "house" in 24:43 is interpreted spiritually. All those verses that refer to the Jews should be interpreted literally, and all those that refer to the church should be interpreted spiritually (see Matt. 13:11-13).</P><P>(2) Before Matthew 24:31, all the verses have a Jewish background; for example, "holy place" (v. 15), "in Judea" (v. 16), and "Sabbath" (v. 20). After verse 31, everything is in the open, and there is no restriction according to location.</P><P>(3) Before Matthew 24:31 everything is material; after verse 31 everything is moral. For example, when it mentions "nations," "those who are pregnant," and "babies," all these are literal. On the other hand, the "virgins," the "slaves," the "master of those slaves," the "goats," and the "sheep" in chapter twenty-five all have moral meanings. Furthermore, there is a difference in meaning of the words "go forth" in Matthew 24:26 and "went forth" in 25:1; one is literal and the other spiritual.</P><P>(4) Before 24:31 there is no moral requirement; there is only the need to escape. After verse 31 all the requirements are moral-being watchful and being prepared are all the responsibility of the saints in the end time.</P><P>(5) False Christs-The Jews believe that another Christ will come. So before verse 31 there is the difference between the Jews and the Gentiles ("kingdom against kingdom" means the Gentiles against the Gentiles). After verse 31 there is no such distinction because the reference is to the church.</P><P>Panton also said that verse 31 is a great dividing line. In summary, Matthew 24:4-31 refers only to the Jews. Matthew 24:32-25:30 refers to the church. Matthew 25:31-46 speaks to the church concerning the things of the Gentiles (see chart).</P><P>Verse 1:"And Jesus came out from the temple and was going away, and His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the temple." When the disciples looked back to see the temple, they felt that it was most glorious. No nation had such a temple. The stones outside were brightly polished. It was most beautiful. Inside, the vessels were pure gold. It was precious, valuable, and shining.</P><P>Verse 2:"But He answered and said to them, Do you not see all these things?" Does this refer to the stones and the golden vessels? The Lord knew their hearts. "Truly I say to you, There shall by no means be left here a stone upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down." This is the Lord's spiritual insight. What man sees is just what is before the eye and what is outward. But the Lord's sight is penetrating. Man sees the world as beautiful and all the material things as cultured and refined. But according to the Lord's spiritual insight, all elements of material things will be burned away by fire. So why are we concerned with the things of the earth? The temple is a type of the church. But look at today's church. It has only a vain name and has lost its reality. Even though there are good worship services, they inevitably have become like the temple of that day.</P><P>Why did the Lord question the disciples? What the Lord meant is this: "Do you want to understand prophecy? If you want to understand it, you will need to adopt My attitude." Basically, when man looks at the world, he does not think about prophecy. If a believer cannot receive any light from prophecy, it is because he has been veiled by the light from the world. He does not realize that although the world is beautiful and good, eventually it will be burned away. That day will come. Why did the Lord leave such a wonderful temple desolate to them? It is because the glory of the temple is not in the gold, silver, and treasures but in the presence of the Lord. If the Lord has departed, even if there are the gold, silver, and treasures of the whole world, of what use is the temple? Hence, it should not remain. Let us beware of this ourselves, since we are the temple of God. Do we have the presence of God or do we have only the outward appearance?</P><P>"There shall by no means be left here a stone upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down." This verse was literally fulfilled in approximately A.D. 70. When the Roman prince Titus led his soldiers and conquered Jerusalem, he saw the overlaid gold in the temple and ordered all the gold to be stripped. He thought that since the outside was gold, the inside also must be gold. Thus, he turned over all the stones. And so the Lord's word was fulfilled.</P><P>Verse 3:"And as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us, When will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming and of the consummation of the age?" The Lord sat upon the Mount of Olives. In the Gospel of Matthew, a mountain is mentioned eight times. Each time something special occurred. In particular, there were two times when the situations on the mountain were about the same: in 5:1 and 24:3. On the mountain in Matthew 5:1 (although it does not mention specifically the mountain's name), the Lord spoke concerning the law of the kingdom of the heavens, the prerequisite for entering into the kingdom of the heavens, for the future reigning with the Lord. In Matthew 24 what He spoke are the prophecies that concern the rapture, the tribulation, and the judgment.</P><P>Why were these things spoken on the mountain? Since they were spoken on the mountain, the listeners must labor to climb the mountain (to pay the price). All those who are not willing to pay the price cannot expect to understand the prophecies. The reason people do not like to listen to prophecies and the reason that they deny the things concerning the Lord's coming is that they are not willing to climb the mountain or to pay the price. Moreover, on the mountain it is quieter. The book of Revelation was received on a desolate island. All those who like excitement are not qualified to study the prophecies.</P><P>The disciples had three questions: (1) When will these things be? (2) When will the Lord's coming be? (3) What are the signs of the consummation of the age? We cannot mix these three questions together. The Lord's answer was also in three separate sections. Concerning the first question, there are records in Mark and Luke, and these records are very detailed. But the scope in Matthew is wider. For this reason we need the supplement from Mark and Luke. The remaining two questions are not recorded in Mark and Luke, although some of the teachings are there. The direct goal of Luke's writing is not the rapture.</P><P>The first question is, "When will these things be?" What are "these things"? Since it says "these things," they must be plural. Aside from the destruction of the temple, there must be other things. After considering the background in chapter twenty-three (remember that the division of chapters and verses was not inspired by the Spirit), we know that there are six things: (1) The Israelites will fill up the measure of their fathers' evil (Matt. 23:32). (2) The Lord will send prophets and wise men and scribes (v. 34). Note that the prophets here are not the prophets in the Old Testament, because the Lord said that they would kill and crucify them; yet in the Old Testament, the cross was never used. (3) The Lord will avenge the evil things the Israelites did (vv. 35-36). (4) The temple will be destroyed (24:2). (5) All the house of Israel will look on the Lord's coming and say, "Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord" (23:39). (6) The Lord will gather all of Israel like a hen gathers her brood under her wings (v. 37).</P><P>Since the disciples referred to these six things in their question, the Lord's answer must have six aspects. We can see this in chapter twenty-four: (1) Israel will fill up their fathers' evil (vv. 10-12). (2) "You" equals those sent by the Lord (v. 9). In the future the Lord will send more prophets. (3) The Lord will avenge, and there will be tribulation on the house of Israel (vv. 21-22). (4) The temple will be defiled and destroyed, just as prophesied by Daniel (v. 15). (5) "All the tribes of the land" (v. 30) refers to the twelve tribes of Israel. (6) The Lord will gather them (v. 31).</P><P>The second question of the disciples concerns the coming of the Lord. Concerning His coming there are three Greek words that we need to differentiate: (1) parousia, (2) epiphaneia, and (3) apokalupsis.</P><P>The disciples asked the Lord about the sign of His coming. The word "coming" here is the Greek word parousia. This word should be translated "presence." Coming is not exactly the right sense. Parousia is used in the Bible twenty-four times. Except for the five or six times when it refers to the coming of certain men, in the other ten or more times it refers to the appearing of the Lord. The incidences where it refers to men are as follows: Philippians 2:12; 1 Corinthians 5:3; 2 Corinthians 7:6; and 1 Corinthians 16:17. The incidences where it refers to Christ are as follows: 1 Corinthians 15:23; 1 Thessalonians 2:19; 3:13; 4:15; 2 Peter 1:16; 3:4; 1 John 2:28; Matthew 24:3, 27, 37, 39.</P><P>The word epiphaneia (appearing) occurs in the following places: 1 Timothy 6:14; 2 Timothy 1:10; 4:1, 8; Titus 2:13; 2 Thessalonians 2:8. It means to make visible.</P><P>The word apokalupsis (unveiling, revelation) occurs in the following places: 1 Peter 1:7, 13; 4:13; 1 Corinthians 1:7; 2 Thessalonians 1:7. It means to make people understand.</P><P>In Matthew 24:3 the word "coming" is parousia. Why does the Spirit use this word? It is because the things concerning the second coming are very complicated, and parousia has a very broad meaning. The Lord's parousia will begin at the first rapture, which is to the throne. James 5:7 says, "Therefore be long-suffering, brothers, until the coming ( parousia) of the Lord." James 5:8 says, "You also be long-suffering; establish your hearts because the coming ( parousia) of the Lord has drawn near." All those who have long-suffering will be in the first rapture (Rev. 3:10). See again 2 Peter 3:4: "Where is the promise of His coming ( parousia)." Read 1 Thessalonians 2:19: "Our Lord Jesus at His coming (parousia)." Will you be able to stand before His parousia? First Thessalonians 3:13 says, "At the coming ( parousia) of our Lord Jesus with all His saints." First Thessalonians 4:15 says, "Unto the coming (parousia) of the Lord." Hence, the period when the Lord comes to the air is also included in the parousia. First Thessalonians 5:23 says, "At the coming ( parousia) of our Lord Jesus Christ."</P><P>What will happen during the parousia? First Corinthians 15:23 says that all those who are Christ's will be resurrected. Second Thessalonians 2:1 says that the Lord's parousia is the gathering of the believers to His gathering place. Second Thessalonians 2:8 says that the Lord's parousia is versus the Antichrist. Second Thessalonians 2:9 speaks of the parousia of the "lawless one." First John 2:28 says, "Not be put to shame from Him at His coming (parousia)."</P><P>From the above verses, we can conclude that the parousia includes the throne and the air. As far as time is concerned, it spans the period from the first rapture to the coming of Christ with His saints to the earth. Thus, the parousia is actually between the church and the kingdom. It includes the first rapture to the throne, the Lord's coming to the air during the tribulation, the great tribulation, the second rapture of the believers, and Christ and the saints descending to the earth.</P><P>In the parousia there are three periods, which occur in three places: (1) The beginning of the parousia commences with the overcoming believers' being raptured to the throne (Matt. 24:37-41). (2a) After awhile the Lord will come to the air from the heavens (please remember that the throne is in the heavens, Rev. 4:1-2). (2b) Meanwhile, the believers "who are living, who are left remaining" are raptured to the air. By then, the believers will meet the Lord in the air (1 Thes. 4:16; 1 Cor. 15:23). (3) At the end of the parousia, the Lord with His saints will come from the air to the earth and will destroy Antichrist with the brightness of the manifestation of His coming (2 Thes. 2:8-9) (see diagram).</P><P>What should the attitude of the saints be toward the parousia? Please read James 5:7-9: "Be long-suffering...awaits." First Thessalonians 3:13: "Establish your hearts blameless in holiness." First Thessalonians 5:23: "May your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame." What will believers do in the parousia? They will be judged according to their works (1 Thes. 2:19; 1 John 2:28; 1 Cor. 3:12, 15).</P><P>We can see a type of the parousia from the appearing of the Lord's glory on the mount of transfiguration, as recorded in 2 Peter 1:16 and 18. The parousia is the center of the Lord's second coming. To understand the second coming, we must understand the parousia.</P><P>Two other words are also related to the parousia: (1) apokalupsis, which means the Lord's revelation of Himself, and His removing of the covering veil; (2) epiphaneia, which is a raising of the curtain, through which one sees the Lord.</P><P>Many think that the Lord's appearing must wait until the Lord's coming. This is a wrong understanding because apokalupsis and epiphaneia are also for the church. It does not say that the Lord will appear only to the world, but that He will appear to the church also. In the parousia, both apokalupsis and epiphaneia are included. Since we are with the Lord, He must apokalupsis, reveal Himself, to us, and we shall see His ephipaneia. Hence, we are waiting for the Lord's parousia, to be with Him, and we are also waiting for the Lord's apokalupsis and epiphaneia, to know Him and see Him. We are not waiting for the Lord's coming to the earth. Although we are with the Lord today, this is spiritual and is by faith. We still hope to see Him face to face on that day.</P><P>In the original text there is another word worth noting concerning the Lord's coming again. It is erchomai, which means "to come"; it is an active verb. Parousia means "presence"; since it is a matter of presence, there must be two persons, and hence the rapture is implied. When the Lord's erchomai is mentioned, it does not include the rapture of the saints. Erchomai is used seven times in Matthew 24 and is used eight times in Matthew 25 (Matt. 24:5, 30, 39, 42-44, 46; 25:6, 10-11, 13, 19, 31, 36, 39).</P><P>There is another word, proserchomai, which means "to come to the presence." It is also used here (Matt. 24:1; 25:20, 22, 24).</P><P>There is another word, deute, which means "come here" (Matt. 25:34).</P><P>There is another word, heko, which means "has come already" (Matt. 24:14, 50). From this we can see the accuracy of the Bible in using words.</P><P>The third question of the disciples was, "And what will be the sign...of the consummation of the age?" For the word age there are two Greek words: (1) kosmos, which means the material aspect of the organized world and is different from aion; and (2) aion, which refers to time. In the Bible there is the term of the world; it means to be caught by the organized things in the world. According to Genesis 1:1 this world is already the second one. In the Bible there is also the term of the age, that is, to be caught by the customs, the current, of the age, or to be fashionable.</P><P>The disciples asked concerning the consummation of this age. The word "age" here is aion. "End" is a specific term. It can be translated "the end time"; it can also refer to the great tribulation (which will last for three and a half years and not seven years). The consummation of this age is the end of the age of grace, the age of the church. "The consummation" spans a period; it begins with the rapture to the throne and ends with the appearing of the Lord with His saints from the air. Hence, this is comparable in time to the parousia. But the locations are different, because the parousia refers to the things that are happening above, while "the consummation" refers to the things that are happening on the earth.</P><P>Now let us see when the first major section will be fulfilled. Generally, there are two explanations: (1) It was fulfilled at the time Titus destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70, because verse 2 has been fulfilled completely. (2) It has not yet been fulfilled, because the subject of Matthew 24 is the great tribulation. But we do not agree with either of these explanations. Those who agree with the first explanation include Scofield, and those who agree with the second explanation include Darby. We know that there are two destructions of Jerusalem. In A.D. 70 the destruction by Titus was only the first.</P><P>There are seven big reasons to argue against the first explanation: (1) At that time there were self-proclaimed Christs, but they did not perform miracles (v. 24). (2) The abomination of desolation has not been fulfilled. The abomination of desolation is the idols. This means that idols are put into the temple. The first school says that this has already been fulfilled because there was the flying of the flag in the temple. However, at the time of the flying of the flag in the temple, the Jews were no longer able to flee. Yet verse 16 says, "Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains." (3) The Lord commanded the Jews to flee. This kind of fleeing is a most urgent kind of fleeing, but at that time there was not such a necessity. (4) After such a destruction the whole world should be influenced, but at the time of Titus there was not a worldwide influence. (5) At the time of Titus the celestial phenomena did not change. (6) The result of the destruction should be the Lord's appearing, but at that time the Lord did not appear. (7) This section is parallel with Revelation 6. Revelation was written in A.D. 96. The destruction by Titus occurred in A.D. 70. If it had already been fulfilled, why would Revelation speak about things that had happened twenty-six years before?</P><P>The temple will be destroyed at least twice. Daniel 9:26 says, "And the people of the prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary." Verse 18 uses the word "desolations." Daniel 9:27 says that "he...will replace the sacrifice and the oblation with abominations of the desolator." This is the second destruction. These two destructions are completely different in time. One took place after the sixty-two weeks, whereas the other will occur within the one week. Verse 26 mentions the people of the prince, and not the king. Titus was a prince and was not a king. Then verse 27 refers to the king himself, who will be the Roman king. In the original text, "the end" and "to the end" in verse 26 both refer to the end of the age. Hence, we know that the first destruction is before the end of the age.</P><P>We will compare a few verses. By these verses we will become more clear that there must be a second destruction of the holy city. Revelation 11:2 says that the Gentiles will trample the holy city for forty-two months. (See also 13:5 and 2 Thessalonians 2:7, which do not refer to the destruction by Titus, because after the destruction by Titus the gospel began to spread.) Matthew 21:41 states that after the first vinedressers were killed, new vinedressers were hired. So in the first major section, verses 4-6 have already been fulfilled. Verses 7-14 are not yet completely fulfilled. They are still being fulfilled. Verses 15-31 are not fulfilled yet.</P><P>In comparing the other three Gospels, we see that both Mark 13 and Luke 21 record these things, but there are differences. Matthew, Mark, and Luke, all three Gospels, record the first question. Mark and Luke contain more detail than Matthew. Whatever was said by Matthew was said by Mark and Luke also (except for the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom to the earth). Concerning the second question, there are more differences, and concerning the third question, there are even contradictions.</P><P>What is emphasized in Luke is the holy city; what is emphasized in Matthew is the temple. Luke 21:20 says, "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that her desolation has drawn near." The question in Luke concerns the signs before the destruction of the temple. The question in Matthew concerns the signs before the consummation of the age.</P><P>Luke does not mention the false Christs, whereas Mark and Matthew both mention them. This may be because it was already mentioned in Luke 17. Mark and Luke are generally the same because these two Gospels are the same concerning the first question. Although the temple has already been destroyed once, there will be still be another destruction in the future.</P><P>The special point of Matthew is the parousia, the second question. The disciples asked well, "What will be the sign of Your coming and of the consummation of the age?" The parousia and the consummation of the age are put together. This shows that the disciples had a certain amount of understanding already. Mark and Luke do not emphasize the parousia. This is why they do not have parables such as Noah, the master of the house, the slaves, the virgins, and the giving of the talents. All these five parables have to do with the parousia.</P><P>There is one more similarity among all three Gospels: they all refer to the church and the Jews. Mark 13:5-27 refers to the Jews, and verses 28-37, to the church; Luke 21:8-28 refers to the Jews, and verses 29-36, to the church.</P><P>With regard to the third question, the question concerning the end, Mark and Luke seem to be different from Matthew. This is because "the consummation of the age" is related to both the Jews and the church. Matthew 24:20 says to pray that the flight not be in the winter, nor on a Sabbath. This applies to the Jews. Luke 21:36 exhorts us to pray that we may escape the things that are about to happen, and such an exhortation is moral in nature. The exhortations in the two books are different. One is to the Jews, and the other is to the church. Neither Mark nor Luke mention the promise of Noah, because the disciples did not ask about the things of the parousia, the rapture.</P><P>In the second section of Matthew 24, there are two signs: (1) Noah, concerning the sign of the parousia, and (2) the fig tree, concerning the sign of the consummation of the age. The parable of the sheep and the goats also is not in Mark and Luke because that too has to do with the consummation of the age. It is right that this parable should not be in Mark and Luke because what is spoken in Mark and Luke concerns the things that are near the end; they do not concerns the things at the very end of the age. The sheep and the goats refer to the things at the very end.</P><P>Concerning the parousia there are two signs: the sign of the celestial phenomena and the sign of the days of Noah. Concerning the rapture, one will be taken and one will be left behind. One sign of the end of the age is the gospel being preached throughout the earth. However, this does not mean that all will repent and be saved; it merely means that all will have the opportunity to hear the gospel. The fig tree must not be interpreted literally, because this is a parable. It refers to the reestablishing of the Jewish nation and its religion. The budding refers to its being revitalized. Recently one hundred twenty thousand Jews returned to Palestine as a result of Hitler's oppression. There has been no "rain" there for two thousand years. But now it is raining.</P><P>The temple is related only to the Jews. Hence, it is mentioned only in the first section. The consummation of the age is related to both the church and the Jews. The parousia is related only to the church.</P><P>Verses 4-6 belong to the first section, because the end of the age has not yet come.</P><P>Verse 4:"And Jesus answered and said to them, See that no one leads you astray." The disciples asked about the destruction of the temple. This was the question they were concerned about. In answering them the Lord first warned that they should take heed that they not be deceived. Our purpose in studying prophecy is that we can take heed and not be deceived. But regrettably, many believers do not pay attention to prophecies. As a result, many mistakes are made. Prophecy is like a lamp shining in a dark place (2 Pet. 1:19). To not be led astray means to be able to discern; it means to consider right as right and wrong as wrong.</P><P>Verses 5-6:"For many will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ, and they will lead many astray. And you will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for it must happen; but the end is not yet." "They will lead many astray." Who will lead them astray? (1) The false Christs. In his book, Josephus (a Jewish historian) described the false Christs as impostors who exhorted people to go to the wilderness, and who pretended that they could perform miracles by God's arrangement. The false Christs deceived the Jews because the Jews rejected Christ. (2) "Wars and rumors of war." After the Lord's death, there were many rumors of war. "See that you are not alarmed...but the end is not yet." The disciples asked when the temple would be destroyed, and the Lord answered by two signs, the false Christs and the wars. But do not misunderstand this to be the end of the age. When the two signs are fulfilled, the temple will be destroyed. But "see that you are not alarmed, for it must happen; but the end is not yet." (In all the books of the prophets, except Daniel, we have no prophecy concerning the things of Titus. The destruction of the holy place by Titus is merely a symbol of the future destruction.)</P><P>Verses 7 through 14 form the second section; it is in the process of being fulfilled. Verses 7 through 31 refer to both Jews and believers; however, it is very much related to Christians. After the first rapture God gradually becomes more favorable to the Jews and gradually departs from the Gentiles. At the beginning God's dropping the Jews was gradual and was not sudden. For example, Paul's preaching gradually shifted from the Jews to the Gentiles. In the future, after the first rapture, the Jews will gradually be more and more favored, while the church will gradually lose her position. At that time the believers should stand in the position of the Jews. This is just like salvation for the Jews today: to be saved, they should stand in the Gentiles' position. The believers who will be left on the earth will have to learn how to flee according to the way of Matthew 24.</P><P>The second section, verses 7-14, refers to the things in the beginning. Verses 15-31 refer to the things during the end time. So between "the end" in verse 6 and verse 15, approximately nineteen hundred years have passed. During these nineteen hundred years, God has not acknowledged the position of the Jews. But in the future the situation will be restored to that which existed when the Lord was on the earth. The Sabbath, the offerings, the temple, etc. will all be restored.</P><P>Verses 7-8 are a small section describing the situation on the whole earth during the nineteen hundred years. In verse 7 after the word "famines" there should be the word "pestilences." The events of verses 7 and 8 will be more obvious and more numerous before the end of the age. Now in this age they have already increased, so we know that we are at the beginning of the end of the age.</P><P>During the European War [World War I], ten million people died, and countless wealth and property were lost. Today the small wars happening in various places cause more damage than the European War. In this world there is not one day of peace. In Russia five million people have starved to death. During the flood in China the year before last, eighty million people starved to death. In America, while there are plenty of agricultural products, the cost of harvesting is more than the price of the harvest itself. Last year in our country the bumper crop caused the price of rice to be so low that the farmers suffered greatly. In South America pestilences killed six million people within twelve weeks. In India five million died at one time in an earthquake. In 1923 the big earthquake in Japan affected Tokyo, Osaka, and Kobe. It was over within a few hours-two out of every ten thousand people died. In 1927 there was a big earthquake in Kansu Province in China. Two out of every thousand died. In July 1927 there was an earthquake in Jerusalem. On the average there are three or four earthquakes every day. Let us consider these things with spiritual eyesight. Today peace is abnormal, while war is commonplace. In the past it was more "kingdom against kingdom"; today it is more "people against people."</P><P>What is recorded in Matthew 24:7-8 is somewhat similar to what will happen during the first four seals mentioned in Revelation 6. The white horse in Revelation 6:2 may refer to the false Christ in Matthew 24:5. The red horse in Revelation 6:4 in the second seal is the war in Matthew. Red is the color of blood, while the sword supplants peace; the red horse has already come to the earth. The black horse in the third seal in Revelation 6:5-6 refers to famine. Man's skin turns black during a famine (Lam. 5:10). The balance refers to the time when material goods become very expensive, when one cannot be wrong by even a denarius-one day's wage (Matt. 20:2). Although one denarius buys a choenix of wheat, that is not enough to sustain one family. Oil and wine become items of luxury and cannot be wasted. In Revelation 6:7-8 the pale horse (green according to the original text) in the fourth seal refers to those who die of the plague and who have turned pale green. Hades is the place where dead people go. "Hades followed" means that Hades picks up and collects all those dead ones who have died of the plague. It is like the dust pan that follows the broom. During the sixth seal in Revelation 6:12 there is a great earthquake. There are five mentions of earthquakes in Revelation. But actually there are only three, and all of these are close to Jerusalem. But Matthew also says "earthquakes in various places."</P><P>Verse 7:"For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places." In conclusion, there are four calamities: (1) war, (2) famine, (3) plagues, and (4) earthquakes. All these four are the birth pangs. All those who give birth are in pain at the beginning, but afterward they rejoice. For the Jews to enjoy the joy of the kingdom on the earth, they must first pass through the birth pangs. All those who have the eyesight will say that the end of the age has come. War, famine, plagues, and earthquakes are merely the birth pangs. Here the woman is Jerusalem, which represents the Jews, and the child to be delivered refers to the overcomers. In Psalm 48:6 the birth pangs refer to the Gentiles. First Thessalonians 5:3 also refers to the Gentiles: "When they say, Peace and security, then sudden destruction comes upon them, just as birth pangs to a woman with child."</P><P>Verse 8:"All these things are the beginning of birth pangs." Although these four things are the birth pangs, they are merely the beginning of birth pangs. More serious things are coming.</P><P>Verse 9:"Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations because of My name." This is the real beginning of the tribulation. Verses 9-13 are another small section, which deals with persecution. The "you" in verse 9 refers to the Jewish disciples. Recently, in northern Europe such kinds of Jewish believers were discovered. They keep the commandments and the Sabbath, and they believe that the Lord is the Messiah. They are the prophets mentioned in Matthew 23:34. These kinds of prophets and wise men will be persecuted and even killed (James 5:6). This is recorded in more detail in Mark and Luke. These Jewish believers will be delivered to the synagogues, and the Holy Spirit will speak for them. Mark 13, Luke 21, and Matthew 24 all speak of the Jewish believers. These are the same disciples as those going to "the house of Israel" in Matthew 10. Luke 22:35-38 refers to the Gentile disciples. By the time of Luke 22, the age of grace had begun; this is why He sent the disciples to the Gentiles, and this is why they had to take money and other material things. Hence, the prophecy on the mountain is the same as Matthew 10:5-6. Compare (1) Matthew 23:34 with 10:17-18; (2) Luke 21:14 with Matthew 10:19-20; (3) Matthew 24:9-10 with Luke 21:16-17 and Matthew 10:21-22; and (4) Matthew 24:13 with Matthew 10:22. All these verses refer to the Jewish disciples, the synagogue, the assembly, etc. All these have a Jewish color.</P><P>The "nations" are the unbelieving Gentiles. From this we know that "you" refers to the Jewish believers. Isaiah 49:9-10 prophesies that the Jews in the future will preach the gospel and will be zealous for the Lord. In the fifth seal in Revelation, those who were slain were calling out for vengeance, and the Lord comforted them and charged them to wait until the number of those brothers who are to be killed would be fulfilled. Therefore, the brothers who are being killed in Revelation 6 are the Jewish disciples in Matthew 24:9.</P><P>Verse 10:"And at that time many will be stumbled and will deliver up one another and will hate one another." The stumbling, killing, and hatred are inevitable results of the persecution (see John 16:1-2; Matt. 10:36; Mark 13:12-13; Luke 21:16).</P><P>Verse 11:"And many false prophets will arise and will lead many astray." Among the Jews there are false prophets (Hosea 9:7-17). There are such false prophets in the church also (1 Tim. 4:1; 2 Tim. 3:13; 2 Pet. 2:1). Their purpose is to deceive.</P><P>Verse 12:"And because lawlessness will be multiplied, the love of the many will grow cold." The result of being led astray is (a) the multiplication of lawlessness, and (b) love growing cold. This creates the environment for the coming of Antichrist (see Dan. 8:11-12, 23; 11:30-31; Isa. 65:11-15; 66:3-4; 2 Thes. 2:11-12).</P><P>Verse 13:"But he who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved." To endure to the end means to wait continually and to look continually to the Lord. To be saved, as mentioned here, is different from the salvation of eternal life that one receives. (Compare Isa. 30:18; Heb. 2:3; Dan. 12:12-13; Jer. 14:22 and Rev. 21:6.) The salvation here refers to the escaping of the tribulation and the entering into the kingdom (Psa. 80:3, 7, 19; Jer. 23:6; 30:7).</P><P>Verse 14:"And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come." The "gospel of the kingdom" is mentioned three times in Matthew (4:23; 9:35; 24:14). Paul, in the book of Galatians, says that there is only one kind of gospel (Gal. 1:6-9). Regardless of the difference in the names of the gospel, the gospel is still one. Acts 20:24 speaks of the gospel of grace, which, according to many, differs from the gospel of the kingdom. However, this is not so. The gospel is the same; only the viewpoint is different. Therefore, there is the difference in names. The gospel of the kingdom is the gospel that the Lord preached on earth; it includes the coming of the kingdom, the fall of the image in Daniel, the Lord's imminent return and reign, etc. When this gospel was preached, there were the signs of healing and casting out of demons. The gospel of grace emphasizes the matter of sin and the way of God's redemption. The gospel of the kingdom stresses the authority of the Lord. This kind of gospel of the kingdom must be preached in the whole earth before the coming of the end of this age.</P><P>In chapter twenty-four, "nation" in verse 7 and "all the nations" in verse 9 both refer to the Gentiles. Here "all the nations" also refers to the Gentiles. Those preaching the gospel of the kingdom must be the Jews and not the church. If it were the church, then in verse 14 it would have to be "for a testimony to all the sinners," because the church is of the Gentiles. The biblical basis for the Jews testifying to the Gentiles is in Isaiah 40:5-9; the "all flesh" there refers to the Gentiles. Isaiah 42:9-10 refers to Jacob, which means the house of Israel (41:8; 42:1). "You who go down to the sea and all that fills it, / You coastlands and their inhabitants" refer to the Gentiles. Isaiah 44:2-3, and 8 all indicate that Jacob will testify. What will Jacob testify? See Psalms 145:10-13; 96:3-4, 10 (in verse 3, "among the heathen" refers to the Gentiles; "all people" refers to the Jews); 68:9, 11. The purpose of preaching the gospel of the kingdom is to testify to the Gentiles. Not every Gentile will be saved or will receive repentance. Revelation 3:10 speaks of the great tribulation that is coming upon the whole inhabited earth, so the Lord first gives them the opportunity to escape. "And then the end will come." Matthew 24:15-31 mentions the things concerning the end of the age. Today we are in verses 7 and 8. We have not seen His person (because we have not arrived at the end of the age yet), but we have heard His voice. No one knows how long a period of time will pass before verse 14 comes to pass, but between verses 15 and 31, there is a definite period of three and a half years.</P><P>Verse 15:"Therefore when you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him who reads understand)." "The holy place" refers to the holy of holies in the temple in Jerusalem of Judea. The abomination of desolation refers to an idol, to the image that Antichrist will set up in the temple of God. That is the beginning of the great tribulation. In Matthew 24:16, 19, and 21 there are the words "then," "in those days," and "at that time." Since it is "then," there is not a difference of even one second. Concerning the end of the great tribulation, see verses 29 and 30. Immediately after the tribulation, the Lord will come again. The tribulation will begin when the idol is put into the temple and will end when Christ comes again. How long is the tribulation? Revelation 11:2 says that it will last for forty-two months. Revelation 11:3 and 12:6 say that the duration is a thousand two hundred and sixty days. This is "a time and times and half a time" in Revelation 12:14, which is three and a half years. Revelation 13:5 again says forty-two months. Revelation 11:2 says that for forty-two months the holy city will be trampled. The destruction of the temple in Matthew is the same as the trampling of the holy city in Revelation 11:2. From Luke 21:20, 23 and Matthew 24:15-21 we can see that the destruction of the city and the destruction of the temple take place at the same time. Therefore, the end of the age is the great tribulation, which begins from the time the idol is brought into the temple and continues until the Lord's coming. This period is forty-two months.</P><P>In the Old Testament there are prophecies concerning the end of the age. Nahum 1:9 refers to "a full end," which means to bring in the end of the age. Lamentations 4:18-19 says, "Our end had come"; therefore, we must escape. This also is the end of the age. Ezekiel 7:2-4 and 15-24 refer to an end, which is the end of the age, as do Daniel 8:17, 19; 11:27, 35, 40; 12:4, 6-7, 9.</P><P>Abomination is a Jewish idiomatic expression for idols. It is similar with the village people in China who call idols Buddha or fathers. See Deuteronomy 29:17; 1 Kings 11:5-7; Jeremiah 4:1; 13:27.</P><P>The abomination of desolation has two meanings: (1) Since God must bring in destruction wherever there is an idol, the idol becomes the main cause of destruction. Therefore, we say that the abomination brings in desolation. (2) Antichrist is called "the desolator" (Dan. 9:27), the one who makes abominable desolation. In Revelation 9:11 Antichrist is called Abaddon (Gk. Apollyon), which means "the destroyer."</P><P>The record in the book of Daniel is very detailed in regard to the desolation caused by Antichrist (see Dan. 11:30-31). The holy covenant refers to the Ten Commandments, which is the covenant between God and the people of Israel. Those who break the covenant are the rebellious Jews. Daniel 9:27 says, "He will replace the sacrifice and the oblation with abominations of the desolator." Daniel 12:11 mentions "a thousand two hundred and ninety days," which is one month in excess of the one thousand two hundred and sixty days. This one-month period refers to the judgment of the sheep and the goats after the tribulation.</P><P>In the New Testament, 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4 refers to the appearing of Antichrist, and verse 9 indicates that the Antichrist can perform signs and wonders. In Revelation 13:3-6 and 11-15 there are two beasts: Antichrist and the false prophet. The sea (Rev. 13:1) refers to the Gentiles. The earth (Rev. 13:11) refers to the Jews. Therefore, after the resuscitation of Antichrist, the false prophet will make an image of him and will cause people to worship it. This image will be the one put into the temple; "let him who reads understand." The Lord added this word because Antichrist, the abomination of desolation, the holy place, and similar things are very much misunderstood. This also indicates that Matthew 24 must be read along with the books of Daniel and other prophets.</P><P>Many people say that Matthew 24:15 refers to the situation in the church. This is unlikely because the Lord mentions Daniel, and the prophets in the Old Testament would not prophesy concerning the church. Others say that this refers to the desolation of Jerusalem in A.D. 70. This also is not accurate, because Daniel's prophecies regarding the resurrection from the dead, the cleansing of the temple, the understanding of the wise, etc. were not fulfilled at that time.</P><P>Matthew 24:15-31 has not yet been fulfilled. Although Luke 21:20-28 is somewhat similar, many of the prophecies there were fulfilled during the battle led by Titus. Luke and Matthew have different purposes: the former pays attention to the destruction of Jerusalem, whereas the latter emphasizes the desolation of the temple. The book of Daniel emphasizes the destruction of the temple also; therefore, Matthew quoted from it. Luke did not emphasize the matters concerning the very end of the age; he merely said that all these were near the end. What is revealed in the book of Luke was fulfilled at the time of Titus and will also be fulfilled in the future. In the Bible there is often a principle concerning prophecy: first there is a partial fulfillment, and later there is the complete fulfillment. At the time of Titus, all the believers, even those with the least faith, escaped to the foot of the Mount of Olives.</P><P>In Luke 21:22 the word "all" is an important word. At the time of Titus's destruction, not "all" things were fulfilled, but only a portion of them. In verse 24 "fall by the edge of the sword" and "led captive" have been fulfilled. Therefore, today the land of the Jews, Israel, still remains in the hands of the Gentiles, and it is still "the times of the Gentiles." But these times will soon be over. In verse 25 the signs in the sun, moon, and stars refer to the future.</P><P>There are two expressions for the end of the age: (1) the great tribulation and (2) the hour of trial. The former refers to the Jews (Dan. 12:1 and Matt. 24:21; Daniel is clearly speaking to the Jews), and the latter refers to the Gentiles (Rev. 3:10). The center of the coming great tribulation is Jerusalem, and the circumference is the Jewish nation. As to the hour of trial, the center is Rome, and the circumference is the whole world. In Revelation 16:10 the throne of the beast and his kingdom refer to the recovered Roman Empire. At the end of the age the great tribulation and the great trial will center, respectively, in Jerusalem and in the Roman Empire. In these places the tribulation and the trial will be the most severe. At the circumference, for the nation of the Jews and for the inhabited earth, the situation will be less severe (see diagram).</P><P>When we read Matthew 24, we need to pay attention to Matthew 23:38, which says, "Behold, your house is left to you desolate." Concerning the Jewish nation, the Lord clearly announced that He had rejected it (although individuals can still be accepted). Thus, Matthew 24 speaks concerning the Jews as a nation but does not address the Jews as individuals. When the Lord spoke the prophecy to the disciples, He was regarding them not as representatives of the Jewish nation but as disciples who had two standings: (1) they were the Jewish remnant loyal to the Messiah, believing that the Lord was the Messiah, and (2) as members of the church, the disciples were also the pillars of the church. Therefore, Matthew 24 as a whole is definitely not addressed to the Jewish people. Each of the disciples had two standings. They cannot represent only the church and not the Jewish remnant. Therefore, we must clearly define which part of Matthew 24 refers to the church. Verse 31 is the dividing line.</P><P>Let us look again at the questions of the disciples: (1) What are the signs of the coming of these things? (2) What are the signs of His coming? (3) What are the signs of the consummation of the age? What were the disciples referring to when they asked concerning the Lord's coming and the consummation of the age? Their understanding then and ours now are not the same. Originally, in the minds of the disciples there was no concept of the church; there was only the thought of the kingdom of Israel (see Acts 1:6). Even after the coming of the Holy Spirit, the disciples still would not leave Jerusalem. Peter was reluctant to go to Cornelius's house. After he went, the rest of the brothers contended with Peter. In the beginning Peter did not know the church. What did the term "consummation of the age" mean to them? It meant the end of the age in the Old Testament. The reigning of Messiah would be after "the consummation of the age"; therefore, the consummation of the age to them was the age before the kingdom. They did not know; therefore, they asked. Even though they were mistaken, the Lord did not answer in a mistaken way. Ignorance cannot stop the answer of the Lord. Most of the prophecy given on the mount was related to the church.</P><P>Verse 15:"Therefore when you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him who reads understand)." The period of time from the setting up of the idol in the temple to the appearing of Christ is three and a half years. Once the idol is set up in the temple, the destruction of the temple is not far away. The destroyer first defiles the temple and then destroys it (Psa. 74:3-7; Isa. 64:10-11; Lam. 4:1; Dan. 8:11). God allowed the temple to be defiled and destroyed because the Jews themselves defiled it first (Jer. 32:34; Ezek. 8:5-15).</P><P>Verse 16:"Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains." "Let those in Judea flee" here and the woman's flight into the wilderness in Revelation 12:6 have the same meaning. The dragon's trying to devour the woman is the same as Satan's persecuting the Jews; therefore, the Jews must flee and the woman must flee. The "water" (Rev. 12:15) indicates an army. Revelation 12:16 says, "And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river." Thus, if the Jews listen to the Lord's prophecy to flee, they will live for a thousand two hundred and sixty days and will not have to suffer.</P><P>Verse 17:"Let him who is on the housetop not come down to take the things out of his house." "Him who is on the housetop." The Jewish houses had a flat top with a ladder on the outside. Do not come down to take things out of the house; in other words, do not come down the ladder on the outside of the house to take the things that are in the house.</P><P>Verse 18:"And let him who is in the field not turn back to take his garment." "Him who is in the field." Those who work in the field must flee quickly and not turn back to take their clothing. This means that one should not value material things, because the tribulation is at hand. All who delay will experience woe.</P><P>Verse 19:"But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days." It is inconvenient for those who are with child and who nurse babies to escape. They cannot escape quickly; therefore, the Bible says, "Woe" to them.</P><P>Verse 20:"And pray that your flight may not be in winter, nor on a Sabbath." One cannot flee quickly in the winter because one cannot sleep in the open. The weather is also colder on the mountain than on the flat land, and there is no food and no water. The "Sabbath" in this verse is a further proof that verses 4-31 are directed to the Jewish people. According to the law of Moses, on the Sabbath day one cannot walk more than approximately four thousand eight hundred and fifty-four feet (Acts 1:12).</P><P>Verse 21:"For at that time there will be great tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor shall by any means ever occur." God already prearranged for the great tribulation to come, although because of grace and prayer (Exo. 32:34) it has been delayed. We sin every day, but because we pray, the disciplining whip delays its coming. However, we have to know that God's whip is merely withheld; it is not cancelled or locked away. It may come suddenly at any time. Nebuchadnezzar is a good example. (See also Isa. 65:6-7; Deut. 4:30-31; Jer. 30:6-7. Only approximately one-third of the Jews will be saved.) Both Daniel 12:1 and Revelation 12:7 refer to Michael chasing the dragon away.</P><P>Verse 22:"And unless those days had been cut short, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the chosen, those days will be cut short." The record concerning the great tribulation in Isaiah 13:9-11 and 26:21 shows that it is terrible to the uttermost; therefore, the Lord intends to cut short those days to only three and a half years. If they were prolonged, no one could withstand them.</P><P>Verse 23-24:"At that time if anyone says to you, Behold, here is the Christ! or, Here! do not believe it. For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen." The purpose of this small section is to show that the Lord's parousia (the "coming" in verse 27) is not secret but public to the Jews because the Lord comes from heaven on the clouds. It is not that He comes to the earth first and then reveals Himself. This section warns the Jews against the deception of the false Christs-"Behold, here is the Christ! or, Here!" Since Christ must come from heaven, the believers do not have this danger as the Jews have. Since the Jews desired to have a Messiah come to live among them, they rejected Jesus. "Behold, here...or, Here" means anywhere. Christ will come from heaven like lightning; hence, if there are any selfproclaimed Christs appearing on the earth, they must be false Christs.</P><P>The false Christs and false prophets are plural. They do not refer only to one person. The "great signs and wonders" that occur during the three and a half years take place because the dragon is there giving authority to the first and second beasts. Second Thessalonians 2 and Revelation 13 are the records of the wonders of these three evil ones. A wonder is not an outright hoax or a sleight of hand. The purpose of doing wonders is to make people believe a falsehood. This is in contrast to the Lord's signs, which guide people to believe the truth. If, at the end of the age, we should see the evil spirits doing wondrous things, this means that Satan is trying to make false things real. Those Christians living at the end of the age should pay even more attention to this. Our receiving of the truth is not because of wonders but because we believe the word of God. We should know that wondrous things will be abundant at the end of the age. "So as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen." The chosen here refer to the Jews (Isa. 65:9; Rom. 10:21; 11:28), but, doctrinally, it is not unrelated to us. We believers also have the possibility of being led astray. Those who think they are able to stand should be careful.</P><P>Verse 25:"Behold, I have told you beforehand." This is most precious because it is the Lord's prophecy concerning the things of the end of the age. Suppose we were able to foresee the things in the future. Would this not be precious? Robbery and accidents could be avoided in this way. Yet regrettably the saints do not treasure the prophecy of Christ. "Behold" in the Scripture means that something important must follow, so we know that the prophecy on the mount is important. The prophecy is a lamp to our feet (2 Pet. 1:19). If one does not know prophecy, it is easy to stumble and fall in the darkness. Today, the reason people have so much hope for the world, the country, and society is that they have no lamp shining upon them. The Lord has already spoken; if we still suffer loss at the end of the age, the Lord will not be responsible.</P><P>Verse 26:"Therefore if they say to you, Behold, He is in the wilderness, do not go forth; Behold, He is in the inner rooms, do not believe it." False Christs and false prophets have already been mentioned several times in verses 5, 11, 23, 24, etc. Here they are mentioned again to emphasize the importance of this subject. Concerning the wilderness, a place far from the world, it is easy for people to think that this is a likely place for Christ to be found. When John the Baptist was in the wilderness, some asked him if he was the Christ. "Inner rooms" are mysterious places, secret places. Psychologically, whatever is mysterious has power and attraction. When something is no longer secret, it loses its power. The Corinthians did not like Paul because his appearance was not outstanding.</P><P>Verse 27:"For just as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be." "Lightning" is in the sky, and everyone can see it, but not everyone can see what is in the wilderness. However, the Lord's coming will be entirely public; He will come on the clouds. Some people say that the Lord's coming to the earth will be in a stealthy way. This is not accurate. However, the first rapture will be in secret; His coming to the air will remain secret. As lightning is hidden in the clouds waiting for the opportunity to strike, so Christ first hides in the clouds for a period of time; then He will come on the clouds (Rev. 1:7; Acts 1:11). In the book of Acts it is recorded that when the Lord ascended to the heavens, at first there was no cloud; then a cloud received Him out of their sight. When He comes, the situation will be the same, only the order will be reversed: first, there will be clouds to cover and hide (including the period of the rapture); then there will be the appearing (coming). All the saints will have already been raptured before His coming; hence, we are not waiting for the coming of the parousia but are waiting for the going of the parousia.</P><P>Verse 28:"Wherever the corpse is, there will the vultures be gathered together." "Corpse...vultures." According to some, the "corpse" signifies Christ, and the "vultures" signify Christians, because from the time the Lord died, Christians have eaten His flesh (referring to the taking of the bread). This is not only inaccurate but is even ridiculous and ungodly. The Bible not only speaks concerning the death of Christ; it also speaks concerning His living. The One in whom we believe is the Lord who died and resurrected. He is not a corpse. Paul told the Corinthians that "if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is vain; your faith is vain also" (1 Cor. 15:14). A corpse also stinks and is rotten (John 11:39). This could never refer to the Lord. What then is the explanation of the corpse? (1) A corpse plus life equals a living person. A living person minus life equals a corpse. For this reason, the corpse represents those who are without life, that is, all those who are in Adam (1 Cor. 15:22). Believers are not in Adam. They have life; thus, they should not be called corpses. The Lord said, "This is My body," indicating life; it is not a corpse. (2) Corpses stink (John 11:39; 1 Cor. 15:50, 53); therefore, when men die, they are buried (Gen. 23:4). Therefore, a corpse also refers to corruption, to the rottenness of those who die in Adam. The vulture in the Bible has several meanings: (1) It refers to God's people (Isa. 40:31; Deut. 32:11-these two verses emphasize the way of the flying of the eagle). (2) In Leviticus the eagle is considered abominable because it eats carcasses (11:13-14; Rev. 19:17). The eagles' eating of the carcasses represents God's judgment, so here it should be the same. Wherever there is the rottenness of the dead person in Adam, God's judgment is there also. (Here, the reason it is explained spiritually is that in the previous text there was the parable of the lightning).</P><P>Verse 29:"And immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken." The word "immediately" is most precious and important. The reference to the sun, the moon, and the stars is literal. Some say that this means that the kings, high officers, generals, princes, etc. will be shaken, but if so, the sun, the moon, and the stars would have already been shaken before the Lord's return. The calamities in Matthew 24:29 and Revelation 6:12-13 are similar, but the times in which they take place are different. In Revelation it is mentioned that after the sixth seal there are the calamities of the trumpets and of the bowls. The sixth seal is merely the beginning of the calamities, but here in Matthew the things are after the calamities. "Immediately after the tribulation of those days." This shows that the tribulation will begin with the change of the heavenly scene and also end with the change of the celestial bodies. Joel 2:31 and the sixth seal in Revelation refer to the same thing. Joel said explicitly that the time will be before the tribulation: "Before the great and terrible / Day of Jehovah comes" (2:31). Matthew said explicitly that the time will be after the tribulation: "Immediately after the tribulation of those days." Therefore, we know that these two take place at two different times.</P><P>Verse 30:"And at that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the land will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory." "At that time" refers to the time immediately after the tribulation in verse 29. We do not know what the sign of the Son of Man will be. There are two common explanations: (1) The Lord Himself-but this is not proper because the Lord said "the sign of the Son of Man"; He did not say the Son of Man Himself. (2) The cross-the reason is based on Matthew 12, where the Lord gave the sign of Jonah to the scribes and the Pharisees. The latter might be the better explanation, but we are still not completely certain. Therefore, in our explanation here, we do not say that it is the cross, nor do we say that it is not the cross. But we do know that the sign here must be mysterious and also supernatural because it appears in the sky so that all the tribes can see it. "All the tribes of the land" means all the tribes of the Jews. They will mourn (see Zech. 12:10-14).</P><P>"They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory." In the first coming of the Lord, He manifested authority (such as in casting out demons and healing the sick) and glory. The second coming of the Lord will manifest power and glory. During His earthly ministry, people were astonished that His teaching had authority (Matt. 7:28-29). The Pharisees asked about the source of His authority (Matt. 21:23). (See also the words of the centurion in Matthew 8:8-9.) The second coming will manifest not only authority but also power. He will no longer ride on the foal of a donkey (as the King of peace) but will ride on a white horse. His coming in power is for the execution of God's judgment. In the future Satan will perform many lawless deeds. The Lord will destroy him with His power. Authority and power are two things. The moving of a car demonstrates power, while the hand of a policeman is a sign of authority. In the Lord's first coming, His healing of the sick, casting out of demons, and calming of the wind and the waves were a matter of the exercise of authority. But at His second coming, He will exercise His power. The Lord overthrew the tables and whipped the sellers of cattle and sheep. Although this was an exercise of His human strength, the real whipping was not executed on the human bodies; the real significance was a demonstration of His authority. "Coming on the clouds of heaven." The first rapture will be a rapture to the throne; the second rapture will be to the clouds in the air. Then the Lord will descend on the clouds.</P><P>Verse 31:"And He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His chosen together from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other end." This verse has been fulfilled. Thus, according to Matthew 23:37, after the great tribulation the Lord will call together all the chosen who are scattered among the Gentiles (Isa. 45:4; 65:9; Deut. 7:6). "From the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other end" does not indicate a rapture, because the word used for "coming" in verse 30 is erchomai and not parousia, and here in verse 31 it is only a "gather[ing]...together" (Deut. 30:3-5). After the destruction of Jerusalem, the Jews were killed, captured, or scattered among all the nations. They will remain scattered until, according to this passage, the Lord begins to call them back (see Isa. 43:5-7: "From the east, / And...from the west. / I will say to the north...  / And to the south." Isaiah 49:9-13: "From the land of the Sinim," referring to China. In Hunan province there are still many Jews. They take the last name Tseng. Isaiah 49:22-26; 51:11; 56:8; 60:4; 62:10-12; 27:13; and Ezekiel 34:13; 37:21 also refer to the dispersed Jews. The expression "the four winds" means that there are Jews everywhere, because winds continually move and have no fixed place. Therefore, here the calling together, or gathering together, does not refer to the rapture of the church for the following reasons: (1) The parousia has passed, and the rapture is within the scope of the parousia. (2) Here it is a gathering together; it has nothing to do with the rapture. (3) To say that it is the rapture of the church does not agree with the previous texts. (4) If it refers to the Jews, it is consistent with Matthew 23:37. (5) In 1 Thessalonians 4 there is the sound of the trumpet and the Lord coming to the air. (6) The previous texts all refer to the Jews.</P><P>The above verses are the first large section.</P><P>Verse 32:"But learn the parable from the fig tree: As soon as its branch has become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near." The Lord spoke this section of the prophecy on the Mount of Olives. There were many fig trees there, so the Lord used them in the parable. "As soon as its branch has become tender" refers to the return of life. "Puts forth its leaves" indicates the manifestation of life. The fig tree signifies the Jews (Jer. 24:2, 5, 8). Previously the Lord cursed the fig tree that had leaves but no fruit. This means that He cursed those Jews who had an outward form but not the reality. Leaves signify a show or outward behavior, indicating the law of Moses. At that time the Passover, the Feast of Purim, and all the offerings and sacrifices will be restored. Summer refers to a time for growth. Winter refers to the time of death and drying up. In the summer everything is flourishing and full of life; everything is bright. It is a golden time. This is the kingdom. The Jews today are in the winter. Winter refers to tribulation, particularly to the great tribulation. Spring refers to the rapture (S.S. 2:10-11, 13). Summer refers to the kingdom (Luke 21:30-31). Luke 21:29-30 mentions all the other kinds of trees. These trees refer to the nations (see Daniel and Judges). All the nations also put forth branches; that is, today among all the tribes and races, nationalism is especially prevalent. Even Scotland, Mongolia, and the tribe of Hui in Xingjiang province have all tried to become independent.</P><P>Verse 33: "So also you, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the doors." Keep in mind that verses 4 through 31 constitute one continuous section and should not be broken up. The difference between 24:4-31 and 24:32-25:46 is that the first section refers to Jews and the second section refers to the church. The phrase "all these things" in verse 33 is linked to 23:36, which says, "All these things shall come upon this generation." In 24:8 "all these things" refers to the beginning of tribulation. Therefore, in verse 33 "all these things" refer to the false Christs, wars, famine, pestilence, earthquakes, etc.; they also refer to the beginning of the tribulation. "Know that it is near." "It" refers to the kingdom. This corresponds with Luke 21:31, which says that "the kingdom of God is near."</P><P>Verse 34:"Truly I say to you that this generation shall by no means pass away until all these things happen." "Generation" is genea, which is not the same as aeon. The Chinese interpret a generation as thirty years. Other nations consider forty years as a generation. Such an understanding makes it difficult to explain this passage. "This" generation would become the generation who lived when Matthew lived. Then these things should have already been fulfilled; by now they should have already taken place. The teaching of the historical school that Matthew 24 has taken place is based on this. They say that the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus was exactly forty years after the Lord spoke verse 34, and that was a generation. Because of this kind of difficulty, some change the word "generation" to "race," saying that it refers to the Jews. This is not correct, because: (1) in Matthew 1:17 there would be fourteen races from Abraham to David. (2) We cannot arbitrarily change the word because we encounter some difficulties. (3) If it were the word "race," then "this generation shall by no means pass away until" would indicate that the Jewish race can become extinct. This can never be. The Lord Himself was a Jew. What then is the explanation of genea? We should seek proofs from the Old Testament. According to Psalm 12:7, "this generation" means the moral condition of a people; it is not a physical generation. The generation in Deuteronomy 32:5 is not thirty or forty years or a lifetime, but the period in which the condition of crookedness and perversity lasts. That is how long the generation lasts. If the perversity is not taken away, it will continue to be the crooked generation. In Deuteronomy 32:20 the word "generation" is genea in the Septuagint. Proverbs 30:11-14 says, "There is a generation." Obviously, this does not refer to a lifetime or a few years; it refers to a period of time characterized by its moral climate. In what follows there is light also. In Matthew 11:16 and 12:39, 41 the sin of "this generation" refers to all the wicked and adulterous people of the past and future put together; thus, the generation lasts as long as the wicked and adulterous ones last. Matthew 12:42, 45 and 23:36 also contain the word "generation" ( genea). Therefore, the meaning of 24:34 is that before this wicked, adulterous, perverse, and crooked generation will pass away, all these things will have been fulfilled. The generations in Matthew 1:17 refer to people, not to people's morality; hence, it is different from "generation" in verse 34. "This generation" includes three kinds of people: (1) the Gentiles who worship idols and reject God, (2) the Jews who reject Christ, and (3) the apostates, the modernists. Before these people pass away, all the tribulations must be fulfilled. The Lord Himself will cast these things away. Before the kingdom comes, all these things shall be fulfilled. The kingdom comes after this generation passes away.</P><P>In the Scriptures cosmos should be translated "world"; aeon, "age"; and genea, "generation."</P><P>Verse 35:"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away." The word of the Lord endures longer than heaven and earth. This means that before heaven and earth pass away, His words will be fulfilled. The word "heaven" has two usages: (1) In the singular it means heaven in contrast to the earth. (2) In the plural it means the kingdom in which the Lord rules, which is the universe. Here it is singular.</P><P>Verses 36-42 are a small section and are most difficult to explain.</P><P>Verse 36:"But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but the Father only." "That day and hour." The "day" is longer and "the hour" is shorter. It seems that the Lord categorized the things of the future as to day and hour. The disciples asked concerning: (1) the sign of His coming ( parousia) and (2) the sign of the consummation of the age. The Lord used the fig tree as the sign of the consummation of the age and our rapture as the sign of the parousia. The Jews' fig tree is a sign to us, and our rapture is a sign to the Jews. Although there is a sign for one to know, the day and the hour cannot be known, because the Lord said that no man knows. But, regrettably, today there are many people who try to calculate the day and the hour. Some people do not calculate the day and the hour, but they calculate the year and the month. This is not godly. Mrs. White of the Seventh-day Adventists calculated that the coming of the Lord would be in 1844. Mr. Russell of the Russellites (Jehovah's Witnesses) calculated that it would be in the 1800s. Both of them were wrong. Every year some people make some assertions, but they all fail. Even the angels of heaven do not know. Neither does the Son know. This seems strange. In Hebrews 1:13 and Psalms 110:1 the Father told the Lord, "Sit at My right hand until I set Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet." The Lord today is waiting; He does not need to know. Although the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are triune, the Son would rather wait and not know. It is not that He cannot know. Archbishop Trench said that the words "but the Father only" can be translated "if not the Father only," that is, "If the Father does not know, man would not know, angels would not know, and even the Son would not know." But this does not make sense. My personal opinion is that the Lord meant in verse 36 that at that time only the Father knew, and that all the rest did not know. The word "knows" in "no one knows" is in the present tense. Today the Lord does know, but man cannot tell the time when He will know. Some people say that although "knows" is in the present tense, it means "will never know." I cannot agree with this. If that is the case, the Lord Jesus will never know.</P><P>Verses 37 through 42:There are four things in these verses: (1) At the end time man's condition will be very much as it was in the days of Noah. At that time, even though men knew that the flood was about to come (as it had been preached by Noah), they still would not be awakened; they continued eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage as usual. (2) As God kept the household of Noah from the destruction of the flood, so God will also preserve the remnant of the Jews to pass through the great tribulation. (This is what is spoken of in Revelation: the earth opened up her mouth to swallow up the flood of water from the dragon-12:16.) (3) The flood took the rest of the people away. (4) As in the day that Noah entered into the ark when the flood came, at the time of rapture, one will be taken and the other left.</P><P>Verse 37: "For just as the days of Noah were, so will the coming of the Son of Man be." There were seven things in the days of Noah: (1) After Enosh was born, men began to call on the name of Jehovah. From this we know that, although men worshipped God prior to Enosh's time, they did not worship Jehovah. There is a difference between worshipping God and worshipping Jehovah. Not to worship Jehovah is not to worship Jehovah the Savior. Likewise, men today believe that there is a God, but they do not believe that Jehovah is God, much less that Christ is God. (2) In Genesis 4:19 and 22, the names of the women recorded include Adah ("ornament"), Zillah ("shadow"), and Naamah ("pleasant"). These three names represent the beauty, vainglory, silliness, and frivolity of the women of those days. Today, women's adornments and cosmetics are selling exceptionally well. Women love to be vain and frivolous. This tells the believers that the day of Noah is approaching. (3) Genesis 4:17 says that "he builded a city," and verses 20-22 speak of music, husbandry, and metal-working. Today all these are very flourishing. In the area of music, there are the gramophones and the radios. At that time iron was for making knives and swords; today it is for guns and cannons. (4) With regard to the church's degradation, before the flood there were two lines that God especially paid attention to. They were the line of Cain, representing the world, and the line of Seth, representing the church. But in the line of Seth, Enoch was the only one who was raptured. The rest did not walk with God but mixed with the world instead and failed. Today's church also mixes with the world; it is indeed degraded. If one does not see that the church is degraded, he himself has already become degraded! (5) In Genesis 6:1 men began to multiply, and it is the same today. The rate of population increase has grown rapidly. Just three years ago (1930) there were 1.7 billion people; today there are 2 billion. Today in China alone there are 500 million. (6) Jude 14 and 15 say that Enoch prophesied the word of the Lord's coming and judgment, yet many people ignored it. Today's situation is exactly the same. Since 1828 there have been some who preached the word of the Lord's second coming, yet very few have accepted it. (7) Of particular importance is Genesis 6:2. The sons of God (angels) became fallen and took the daughters of men as wives. Today it is just the same. Spiritualism has become very popular. Communication with demons and with the dead has become very convincing. After the European War [World War I], many women in France became pregnant by evil spirits. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (of the Royal Society) was promoting spiritualism very aggressively. No one dared to speak of these seven things in the past hundred years because there was no light.</P><P>Verse 38:"For as they were in those days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day in which Noah entered into the ark." Are the events concerning Noah a sign of the rapture of the saints or of the believers' passing through the tribulation? It is more accurate to say that they typify the rapture of the believers. Generally, it is assumed that Enoch typifies the rapture, whereas Noah typifies the believers' passing through the tribulation, because this is according to the facts in Genesis. However, the sign of Noah does not typify only one thing. What did the Lord say in Matthew 24:37? Here the Lord spoke of His parousia. The parousia in verse 37 is equal to Noah's ark in verse 38. The one of every male and female entering into the ark to escape the flood are the raptured ones. The event of Noah's entering into the ark typifies the rapture. Consider the following: (1) Noah (typifying the Lord) brought one male and one female of every animal into the ark. The Lord also will lead one male and one female into the rapture section of the parousia. (2) Noah shut the animals inside the ark; the world did not see them. When Christ raptures us, the world will not see us either. (3) Noah rescued them from the flood. Likewise, the Lord will also keep us from the great tribulation (Rev. 3:10). The animals could represent men, as they did in the vision that Peter saw. At that time, men gave themselves to eating, drinking, and marrying. Today it is the same. Men eat and drink lavishly. The giving in marriage also is increasing.</P><P>Verse 39:"And they did not know that judgment was coming until the flood came and took all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be." Just as the situation was in the days of Noah, so it is today. As the flood came suddenly, so the coming of the Lord will also be sudden.</P><P>Verses 40-41:"At that time two men will be in the field; one is taken and one is left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left." "One is taken and one is left." What is the reason for this verse? According to typology, all those who belonged to Noah entered into the ark. Will not all the saints then be raptured? The Lord feared that we might have this misunderstanding, so this verse was especially added. Just as it was in the days of Noah, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be. But there is an exception; thus, the Lord made it known here.</P><P>There are three possible explanations concerning verse 40. (1) Both people refer to the Jews during that time. (2) The raptured one is regenerated, whereas the one left is not regenerated. (3) The one taken and the one left are both Christians. Let us first carefully examine the first and third explanations. If both are Jews, then the one taken would be punished, and the one left would enjoy the blessing of the kingdom on earth. If both are saved ones, then the one taken would enjoy glory and blessing, and the one left would go through the suffering of the great tribulation on this earth. First, we must know the meaning of being taken and being left behind. If the meaning of being taken is positive, then it must be for Christians, because the rapture of Christians is a blessed matter. If the meaning of being taken is negative, then it must refer to the Jews, because in that case they cannot stay on this earth to enjoy the blessing of the kingdom on earth. The word "taken" in the original language is paralambano, which means "to bring and set aside." This word is used fifty-two times in the New Testament with a positive meaning. For example, in John 14:3 it is rendered "receive" (paralambano). The Lord spoke of rapture in a direct way only once. Three times the Lord "took" Peter, John, and James (Mark 5:37; Matt. 17:1; 26:37), and each time was positive. In Mark 5:40, "took (paralambano) the father of the child" is also positive. In John 1:11, "His own did not receive (paralambano) Him" also is positive in meaning, because if "His own" had received Him, everything would have been well. "Received" in Colossians 2:6; 1 Thessalonians 4:1 and 2:13; "receiving" in Hebrews 12:28; "take" and "took" in Matthew 2:13-14; "taking" in Acts 15:39; and "took" in Acts 16:33; 23:31, etc., are all paralambano, and all have a positive meaning. In the Old Testament also this word has a positive meaning. "Took" in Genesis 5:24, referring to the rapture of Enoch, and "fetched" in 1 Samuel 10:23 also have positive meanings. Therefore, we can know that those in Matthew 24:40 must be Christians.</P><P>The word "left" in the Bible may also have a positive meaning (Gen. 32:8; Num. 26:65; Isa. 24:6). Thus, the word "left" has dual meanings, both good and bad. The question is, who left them? If you are left by the devil, that is a blessing; if you are left by the Lord, that is a woe. It is woe also if you are taken by the devil, but a blessing if you are taken by the Lord. In spite of this, in the Bible the word "left" has mostly a negative meaning: in 1 Samuel 17:20, "left" means "leaving," and in John 4:28 "left" means "left behind."</P><P>Although there is evidence from the meaning of the word, this is not sufficient. We cannot focus only on the meaning of the word; we should also take care of the context. Matthew 24:19 indicates woe to those who are left behind and cannot escape. The "thief" in verses 41-43 is the Lord. The things stolen are the best things. In chapter twenty-five, the virgins who are taken are the good ones; those left behind are the five foolish ones.</P><P>This eliminates the first explanation and limits the choice to the second and third explanations. There is not sufficient reason to say that the ones left behind are unsaved ones. We assert that whether they are taken or left, they all are saved ones. The reasons are as follows: (1) "Therefore" in the phrase "watch therefore" in verse 42 shows a continuation of the preceding verses 40 and 41. The "you" in verse 42 are the saved ones. Only those who have life can be watchful. The lifeless ones can never be watchful. The condition for the rapture does not depend on whether or not one believes; it depends on the work after one is regenerated, not merely on the life of regeneration. The Brethren say that whoever is regenerated will be raptured. This is erroneous. (2) "Your Lord" (v. 42). The unsaved one has absolutely no master/servant relationship with the Lord. Others can use this word mistakenly, but the Lord never uses it by mistake. Some are not yet saved, yet they consider themselves the Lord's servants; but the Bible cannot misuse the term "your Lord." In the Old Testament, one first serves and then is rewarded. In the New Testament, first we become His children; then we serve. (3) Verse 43 mentions the thief. Suppose a thief comes to steal apples. He would surely pick the ripe ones and leave the unripe ones. It is not a difference in substance but a difference in the degree of ripeness. (4) The example of the virgins in chapter twenty-five. The five foolish ones are not false virgins. They are merely not as wise as the prudent ones. The prudent ones were not afraid and brought oil with them. The foolish ones were lazy and did not bring oil in their vessels. Nevertheless, they are all virgins, and all went out to greet the bridegroom. (5) As far as typology is concerned, the ones left behind also are saved. Enoch and Noah were both saved. Abraham (interceding before God) and Lot (passing through tribulation) were both saved. Elijah and Elisha were both saved. When the Lord ascended, the disciples who were left were all saved. Philip and the eunuch were both saved. Hence, we conclude that the "taken" ones and the "left" ones in verses 40 and 41 are all saved.</P><P>Verse 42:"Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes." If we connect verses 40 and 41 to verse 42, we can see that the distinction lies in being watchful or not being watchful. If this were not the only distinction, the Lord would not use "therefore" and also would not warn us to be watchful. If the condition for the rapture were based merely on regeneration and not on the watchfulness and work after regeneration, there would be no reason for the Lord to exhort us to be watchful. In this verse the Lord did not entreat us to repent, to believe in the Lord, to be regenerated; He charged us only to be watchful. Hence, we know that in verses 40 through 42, those taken and those left behind are all saved ones. The Lord cannot charge those who are not regenerated to be watchful. What does it mean to be watchful? Some say that to be watchful is a matter for the Jews, and that we Christians need only to wait and do not need to be watchful. But even if the Jews are watchful, they still must pass through the great tribulation; they can never escape God's wrath. They must pass through the time of Jacob's distress (Jer. 30:7). It cannot be that because of their watchfulness the great tribulation will not come. Only the church needs to be watchful. The meaning of being watchful is to not be careless. Christians are often too self-confident. Being watchful is in contrast to being careless. Those who sleep must be those who are self-confident, for they think that nothing will happen. Those who watch must be those who do not trust in themselves. If one is self-confident, there is the possibility that he may fall. Or if one says, "I am not the same as before," failure is near. It is only when you feel that you are lacking and cannot be depended on that you will be watchful. Being watchful means being careful, not careless, every day on the alert against the possibility of stumbling. All those who consider that they themselves will not stumble cannot be watchful. If everyone will be raptured, then there is no need to be watchful. The reason that Christians must be watchful is that we do not know when the Lord will come. If we knew, then we would not need to be watchful. But since the Lord did not let us know, there must be a group of people who are the real watchers. Thus, the theory that all believers will be raptured is not one to be depended on.</P><P>Verse 43:"But know this, that if the householder had known in which watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into." Under the subject of the rapture, four parables are used to expound the Lord's parousia. Hence, these four parables are actually parables concerning the parousia; they explain verse 42. Beginning from verse 43, what the Lord says is fully for the church. Verses 4 through 31 answer the first question; verses 32 through 42 answer the second question. The disciples did not even understand the questions they asked, but the Lord is a good teacher for He answered more than what they asked. The parable of the sheep and the goats points to the things of the end of the age.</P><P>(1)The house, (2) the householder, (3) the thief, (4) the stealing-what do all these refer to? (1) The house means the dwelling. It refers to the work of the saints after they believe in the Lord. The "house" in Hebrews 3:6 is the house of faith. Mark 13:34 refers to the house of the Lord, in which we are all doorkeepers. Matthew 7 refers to the work of the believers-to build a house (v. 24). (2) Since the house refers to our behavior, the householder should be us. (3) The thief is the Lord. (4) The thief comes to steal things, to cause the householder to suffer some loss. But the Lord comes to make the householder gain a greater blessing (see 1 Thes. 5:2; 2 Pet. 3:10; Rev. 3:3; 16:15). Usually, we do not know who the thief is, but the Lord is the Thief who informed us in advance. Not only so, but the Lord steals in the daytime-"in the field" and "at the mill" both signify in the daytime. When a thief steals something, he brings it to his own house. The Lord also steals something and brings it to the throne-to His own place.</P><P>"Would not have allowed his house to be broken into." If something has been stolen, this means that the house has been broken into. If nothing has been stolen, the house has not been broken into. A thief steals the good things and takes them away. The bad things are left behind by the thief. Then the householder suffers a loss. It is most regrettable that today many Christians are prepared to be left behind. First Thessalonians 5:4-10 says that our position is that of the sons of light; thus, we should not let the Lord come as a thief. "And you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you" (Rev. 3:3). When the church is like the believers in Thessalonica, they are the sons of light. When the church is like Sardis (corrupted Protestantism) with its dead works, the Lord will come upon it as a thief. "You shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you." The church in Sardis does not know when the Lord will come upon her.</P><P>The householder had his house broken into, but he himself was left. This was his own fault, because every head of a household should know beforehand that a thief will come; the prophecy informs him of this. After the Lord left this world, it became a long, dark night (that is, moral, spiritual darkness). Our position is that although we do not know at what hour He will come, we do know that in this long night the Lord will come quickly. We do not know at what hour He will come, so we should always take this ignorance as a motivation for being watchful. We should compensate for our ignorance by our watchfulness. The failure of the householder is that he despised what he knew and did not compensate for what he did not know. We should always be watchful toward the enemy, the world, and the self. Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis said that we should be watchful from the very first day of the Christian life. To the Jews, the rapture will be a sign; to those believers who will have been left behind, it will be the coming of the suffering.</P><P>The previous verses, verses 4-31, should be explained literally. For example, "those days" (vv. 19, 22, 29) are all explained literally. But "those days" refer to a period of time. The "things" in verse 17 are material. In verse 43, the "house" is spiritual and has to do with the church (the parable of the thief refers to the church). The parousia will be like lightning to the Jews (after the tribulation); it will be like a thief to the church.</P><P>Verse 44:"For this reason you also be ready, because at an hour when you do not expect it, the Son of Man is coming." Some people, such as Scofield, consider this to be the Lord's addressing the Jews as the Son of Man, with no reference to the church. However, the Son of Man is also the name of the Lord in the kingdom, and it is also used in His addressing Christians. Stephen was a person in the church. He too saw the Lord as the Son of Man (Acts 7:56). In Hebrews 2:6 the "son of man" refers to the Lord receiving glory in the kingdom (see also Heb. 2:9). According to John 5:27-29 the Son of Man has authority to judge in the kingdom. In Matthew 19:28 the Son of Man is in the kingdom; in Matthew 25:31 the Son of Man comes in the kingdom. Matthew 13:41 and 16:27-28 also refer to the kingdom. In John 6:53-54, the Son of Man is related to the resurrection in the last day, which also refers to the kingdom. John 12:23 is also a matter of receiving the kingdom. Thus, the Son of Man is a name used by the Lord in the kingdom; He is the King in His qualification as a man.</P><P>Verse 45:"Who then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the proper time?" Verse 45 begins another parable, concerning two kinds of slaves. The Lord said that there are two kinds of stewards, but actually, there is only one person. This person can be a good steward or a bad steward.</P><P>Verses 45-47:"Who then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the proper time? Blessed is that slave whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing. Truly I say to you that he will set him over all his possessions." This speaks of being a good slave. This section can be divided into four small sections: (1) the household, (2) the Lord's commission, (3) the Lord's requirement, and (4) the Lord's reward.</P><P>(1) The household here is different from the house of the householder in the previous parable. The former is individual and belongs to the man himself; the latter is corporate and belongs to the Lord. This corresponds with Hebrews 3:6 and Mark 13:34. This household includes all the believers (1 Tim. 3:15); hence, it refers to the church.</P><P>(2) The Lord's commission. (a) To be set over a household implies authority. (b) To give food at the proper time implies ministry. On the one hand, such a one ministers before God; on the other hand, he ministers before man. (We should not be misled to think that this signifies one slave ruling over the whole household; if we are, there will be ground for a pope, as in Catholicism. Nor does it signify a pastor ruling over a parish, because he has "fellow slaves" in verse 49, and fellow slaves are those who serve together. The Lord simply used one slave as an example.) The work is to rule or to manage. Every slave in the house of God has a portion of the authority. Every slave who has been bought by the blood of the Lord has authority to rule, to serve, to minister, and to give food at the proper time so that the whole household has food to eat. Some say that today's church should have its attention turned to the outside and should preach the gospel in one accord. Actually, to preach the gospel is still a thing within, because this is for the perfecting of the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12). To preach the gospel is to produce material for the church; therefore, to save sinners is the procedure, not the end. To perfect (to give food at the proper time) is the goal. So let us do our best to serve our Father by giving food at the proper time.</P><P>"To give them food at the proper time" is to minister, that is, to serve people with the things of God and the word of God. It is to take Christ's ministering to serve people; this is to be a minister. Thus, this section is spoken to the believers. To give food is to preach, but preaching is not necessarily to give food, because in giving food, one must be able to nourish people. The preaching which can lead others to repent, to know their sins, to be saved, to follow God's will, to believe, and to obey is the real giving of food. Let us find those brothers who need help and, according to their need and level, give them food. But always remember: do not take the attitude of Hezekiah or the attitude of being "holier than thou"; otherwise, they would rather starve to death than eat.</P><P>(3) The Lord has two requirements: to be faithful and to be prudent (i.e., wise). Faithfulness is toward the Lord, and wisdom is toward the brothers. But we are always the opposite. We are too faithful. We scold others and think that this is being faithful. At the same time we are too unwise, that is, too loving in heart to speak a true word. Toward God we are too unfaithful; we are not absolutely obedient. At the same time, we are too wise, excusing and comforting the self with all kinds of reasons. (Toward man we need to be faithful also; wisdom alone will make one too political. If one is only faithful, he can easily become faithful foolishly. We must be faithful and must also be wise.) Faithfulness means not to discount. We accept however much the Lord says. It also means not to consider one's own gain or loss, and not to become unfaithful through considering one's gain or loss. Therefore, those who want to be faithful must bear the cross and exercise self-control. They must deny cleverness. Cleverness is from man's natural being, whereas wisdom is from God. Today many of those who are the most faithful are the most foolish, the most rude, the most inconsiderate, and the most independent. This is why we must have wisdom. Much of God's work is spoiled and destroyed by those who are faithful but not wise. However, it is better to have faithfulness without wisdom than to have wisdom without faithfulness. Today there are too many who have wisdom but are not faithful. They have enlarged the narrow gate. This kind of person is not worthy to be God's steward.</P><P>(4) The reward-being set to rule over all His possessions. "So doing" in verse 46 means to carry out faithfully what the Lord commanded. When we carry out such a command with wisdom, we are blessed. "Blessed" refers to the reward in the kingdom. "He will set him over all his possessions." The way in which men are busy today is not like the way in which one will be busy in the kingdom. In the kingdom many things require one's ruling. The busy activities today are merely a test to see if one can endure being busy. If you can serve the brothers today, you will be able to serve in that day. Today God assigns you a few things; in that day the Lord will assign you to rule over all things. One who is lazy will never have the opportunity to rule.</P><P>Verses 48-51:"But if that evil slave says in his heart, My master delays, and begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with the drunken, the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know, and will cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth." Verses 48-51 are also divided into four sections: (1) Is the evil slave a Christian? (2) What error has he made? (3) The reason for the error of the evil slave. (4) The result.</P><P>(1) Is the evil slave a Christian? Yes, he is a Christian; he is saved. The reasons are: (a) This evil slave is the slave appointed by the Lord in verse 45. The Lord's commission is neither like man's laying on of hands nor like the setting up of committees or supervisors. Man's laying on of hands and appointment may contain mistakes. The Lord does not make this kind of mistake in His appointments. This evil slave is the same person as the faithful and prudent slave. Whether he is a faithful slave or an evil slave depends on how he serves. (b) Identifying the Lord as "my master" shows that he has a personal relationship with the Lord, and "in his heart" also substantiates this fact (just to confess with the mouth may not prove his relationship). See also Romans 10:9 and 1 Corinthians 12:3. (c) He believed in and also waited for the Lord's coming again. His only mistake was that he thought the Lord would delay His coming. Those who are not saved would not say this.</P><P>The above three points are most obvious. But many think that this slave is not saved, based on his conduct and the punishment he receives. They think: (1) if he were saved, how could he beat his fellow slaves and eat and drink? The fact of the matter is that a saved Christian is still capable of committing any kind of sin. In 1 Corinthians 5 there was an adulterer, but he was still saved (v. 5). (2) The Lord appointed his portion with the hypocrites. This word "with" is very important. It is clearer in Luke 12:46: "And will appoint his portion with the unbelievers." From this we know that he is not an unbeliever. (3) "Cut him asunder." One cannot trust in a literal interpretation of this, because otherwise, how can there be weeping and gnashing of teeth in the succeeding part of the verse? In the original text to "cut asunder" does not mean to put to death; it means only to separate him from the Lord. Read Luke 12:46-48. There is a possibility that a slave may be whipped; however, to be whipped does not mean to perish, because the Lord's sheep never perish (John 10:27-28).</P><P>(2) What errors did the evil slave make? There are two sins in verse 49: (a) to beat his fellow slaves (this is toward the believers within) and (b) to eat and drink with the drunken (this is toward the unbelievers without). To beat means to abuse the authority given by the Lord. To eat and drink means to have fellowship with the world, to traffic with the world. Discipline is in God's hand. Between brothers, there can at most be a rebuke. To beat is to usurp God's disciplinary authority. Whenever you think you have special authority to rule over a fellow slave, you are beating. Matthew 23:8 says, "You are all brothers." To beat a brother also means to lose the ability for self-control. When you do not smite others, you rule over yourself. To beat does not necessarily mean to use a stick or a whip or a rod. It means to cause people to suffer pain or to be wounded. If you hurt others with your words, or if you cause pain and suffering to others through your meanness or sarcasm, that is also to beat. If the purpose is to make others feel bad for three or five days so that you can feel better, this also, in reality, is to beat. We can only use oil and wine to heal wounds; we cannot perform surgery. God's children already have enough sorrows. How can we add more painful wounds to them! Yet he who is proud and independent and has a temper finds it easy to beat others.</P><P>The evil slave is also associated with the world. In the Bible the "drunken" are those who indulge themselves in the world. When man becomes stupefied through wine, he is drunk. Today man becomes stupefied because of money, wealth, a name, etc. This also is to be drunk. The slave is a believer; therefore, he should not have fellowship with the drunkards (in accordance with the teaching of 2 Corinthians 6). In the Bible, eating and drinking specifically imply fellowship. The first sin of the world occurred when two were eating together (Gen. 3:6). After Lot quarreled with Abraham, he began to have fellowship with the world (13:5-13). Whenever you dislike a brother and instead like the people of the world, you are fallen. The above two sins are easily committed by any believer.</P><P>(3) What is the reason for these errors? The reason is seen in verse 48: "My master delays." The slave believed that the Lord was coming again, but he also believed that He was delaying His coming. Anyone who does not believe that the Lord is coming quickly is an evil slave. The reason for the slave's mistake, according to what the Lord said, is in verse 48. Even though with his mouth he said that the Lord would come quickly, in his heart he still considered that the Lord would delay. This kind of person is in peril. If one does not take the attitude that the Lord will come quickly, he will not be watchful.</P><P>Many people do not want the Lord to come quickly. They are afraid that when the Lord comes, He will spoil and terminate their plans. They cannot pray John's prayer: "Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!" (Rev. 22:20). We must have an attitude and a desire for the Lord to come quickly. To merely know the prophecy well is of no use. The evil slave was also well versed in prophecy.</P><P>(4) The result: the Lord came a little sooner than the slave expected. If you think that the Lord will delay, He will come sooner than you expect. In His punishment the Lord will separate you from Himself and will appoint your portion with the hypocrites. To be appointed a portion with someone does not necessarily mean to suffer the same punishment as that one. The prisoners in a jail have all been appointed the same portion which is the prison, but they do not all experience the same kind of punishment. To be appointed the same portion means to suffer together. "There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth." This signifies much regret and remorse.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE RAPTURE</H1><P CLASS=INDENT1>(Editor's Note: The following study concerning the rapture is similar to the four articles entitled "The Rapture and the Tribulation" published in Notes on Scriptural Messages, Issue Nos. 43, 49-50, and The Christian (Resumed), Issue No. 1, which appear in Volume 19 of the Collected Works.)</P><P>To understand Matthew 24 and 25, we need to understand the matter of the rapture first. The rapture is the most important matter before the end of the age. Regrettably, many people misunderstand it.</P><P>The word rapture is equivalent to the word "receive" in John 14:1-3. To be raptured is not to climb up by oneself. To be raptured is be received by the Lord up to the heavens. Therefore, rapture is a special term. He will come quickly, and when He comes, He will receive us.</P><P>Concerning the matter of the rapture, there are many different opinions among the believers: (1) Some say that all the saved ones will be raptured before the great tribulation. (2) Some say that all the saved ones must pass through the great tribulation. (3) Some say that part of the saved ones will be raptured before the tribulation and part will be caught up after the tribulation. With these three schools, each regards the others as heretical and cuts off fellowship with the others. This is a mistake.</P><P>In all these schools there are well-known persons. In the first school are Darby, Kelly (whose mind Spurgeon once said could encompass the universe), Torrey (who later changed to the post-tribulation school), Moody (who later changed to the second school), Brooks, James Gray, Gaebelein, Weiss, Scofield, etc.</P><P>The second school includes Muller (who first believed in pre-tribulation rapture), A. J. Gordon (of Boston), Simpson, Erdman, Moorehead, Henry Frost (of Canada), Chamberlain (a co-worker of Taylor), James Wright, Newton, etc.</P><P>In the third school are Hudson Taylor, Robert Chapman, Robert Govett (Spurgeon extolled the light of his writing as surpassing the previous century's, and said that in his writing there is gold), Pember, Panton (the "king of prophecy"), etc.</P><P>Although none of the three schools can ignore the others, only one school is right. Let us have an impartial attitude in studying this. Let us be the prosecutor, and not the lawyer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. REASONS FOR THE FIRST SCHOOL-<br>RAPTURE BEFORE THE TRIBULATION</H2><P>A. The proponents say that in 1 Thessalonians 1:10 "the wrath which is coming" is the great tribulation. Since the verse says "delivers," it must therefore mean that the rapture is before the tribulation. Also, they say that 1 Thessalonians 5:9 tells us that God has not appointed us to wrath, and that wrath equals the great tribulation. To assume that the above evidence refers to the great tribulation is completely wrong. Why must wrath here be the wrath of the great tribulation? Even if we assume that the wrath here is a part of the great tribulation, there is still insufficient reason to believe that the wrath equals the tribulation. The great tribulation, on the one hand, is God's punishment and wrath upon the unbelievers; on the other hand, it is Satan's punishment and wrath upon the believers. Satan's attack on the believers causes them to come under great suffering, but this is not the believers suffering under God's wrath.</P><P>B. These say that in Jeremiah 30:6-7 "a time of distress for Jacob" indicates that the great tribulation is only for the Jews, not for the Gentiles or the church. Since the church is not Jewish, in the concept of these men, we will not pass through the great tribulation (Dan. 12:1).</P><P>If the whole Bible had only the above two references, the great tribulation would indeed be for the Jews. But we must look at other places in the Bible, for example, Revelation 3:10: "To try them who dwell on the earth." Because the prophecies of Jeremiah and Daniel were spoken to the Jews, there are the terms "Jacob" and "thy people," etc.</P><P>C. Revelation 4:1-4. The advocates of this school think that (1) Revelation 2 and 3 refer to today's church age, (2) Revelation 4:1 refers to the church, (3) the twenty-four elders in Revelation 4:4 signify the church's being raptured and glorified, and (4) Revelation 5 and 6 then go on to mention the beginning of the great tribulation.</P><P>But Revelation 4:1 does not address the whole church; it addresses only John when it says, "Come up here." This is an accomplished fact that occurred on the island of Patmos. Otherwise, Philip's being caught away in Acts 8:39 would indicate that he also was raptured.</P><P>As to the twenty-four elders being the glorified church, this is truly nonsensical because: (1) Twenty-four is not the number of the church, but seven and multiples of seven are numbers referring to the church-for example, the seven churches. (2) There is no place in the Bible where elders signify the church. In the church and among the Jews there are elders, but not every believer is an elder. God first created the angels, then selected the Jews, and finally gave grace to the church. How can elders be taken to be the church? (3) In Revelation 4 and 5 the elders are sitting on thrones and are crowned with crowns of gold, and Christ is standing. Since the thrones and crowns of gold are symbols of kingship, can it be that the church was glorified before Christ was glorified? (4) Some say that the white robes that the elders wear refer to the righteousness of the Lord, and that they were washed in the Lord's blood. However, in the Bible there is no record that says that the robes of the elders were washed by the blood. Because of sin our robes need to be washed white by the precious blood, but the twenty-four elders never sinned. (5) These elders never sang the song of salvation for themselves. In chapter four they sang of God's creation. In chapter five they did sing the song of salvation, but they were not referring to themselves. They were referring to the redeemed ones. Several versions of the Bible translate the passage in verse 9 as "redeemed us." This translation is wrong. The word "us" should be "men." It is absurd for the church to sing a song referring to God saving others. (6) Revelation 4 does not speak concerning the church, the Gentiles, or the Jews, but refers to the universe. Thus, the elders there are the elders of the universe. The church is not the elders of the universe. (7) According to Revelation 5:8 the church cannot bring man's prayer to the presence of God. (8) In Revelation 7:13, if John also is part of the church, then it becomes the church asking the church. (9) Since John addressed the elders as "Sir," or "My lord," obviously John's position is inferior. If the twenty-four elders are the church, since John is a patriarch, he would be the elder among the elders. (10) The number twenty-four is interpreted literally; it is not a symbol. Since one among the elders spoke with John, how could one twenty-fourth of the church speak with John? Since the number is fixed, the elders also are fixed. The twenty-four elders are in fact the archangels who govern the universe. Even under Satan there are princes and rulers.</P><P>D. These say, "Do not 1 Thessalonians 4:16 and 17 refer to the rapture?" Of course they refer to the rapture, but they do not say at what time. They mention the fact of the rapture but not the time of the rapture. This cannot prove that the rapture is before the tribulation.</P><P>E. First Corinthians 15:50-52 shows that both the dead and the living will be raptured. This refers to the fact of the rapture, but it does not say that the rapture will be before the tribulation. On the contrary, it proves that the rapture will be after the tribulation, at the time of the last trumpet, which equals the seventh trumpet in Revelation 11:15. Some say that according to the Roman custom, the trumpet was blown three times, and therefore the last trumpet would be the third trumpet. This is wrong, because the Holy Spirit does not borrow the Roman way in giving revelation. There is no connection and it is meaningless.</P><P>F. These argue that in Luke 21:36 the Lord clearly promised that the church can escape the great tribulation and "stand before the Son of Man," which, to them, is the rapture. But here this promise is conditional. It is not conditioned on salvation by regeneration; it is conditioned on watching and praying. If one is accounted worthy after he watches and waits, it becomes a promise conditioned on watching and praying. Not everyone in the whole church is watching and praying. We need to pay attention to this.</P><P>G. Revelation 3:10 is, for these ones, the strongest reason. But here it is also a conditional promise. One cannot say that, based on this, all will be raptured before the tribulation. In the church not everyone will follow the word of the endurance of Christ. What does "the word of My endurance" mean? Today men revile the Lord, curse Him, and deny Him. Yet the Lord does not send lightning from heaven to kill them. The Lord does not punish them. This is the word of the endurance of Christ in this age. Today we endure together with Christ; we do not resist. Is it really possible that everyone keeps this word of endurance? If this is so, then all the believers can be raptured; if it is not so, then not all the believers can be raptured before the tribulation. And if this is the argument, then it follows that the whole world will be saved according to John 3:16. But they forget the condition in John 3:16, "every one who believes into Him." The promise of the Lord here in Revelation 3:10 was to the whole church in Philadelphia. They say that since Philadelphia is a representation of the church, the whole church will therefore be raptured before the tribulation. At that time in Asia Minor there were the seven churches, but this promise of the Lord was spoken only to one of the seven. Thus, Philadelphia cannot represent all the churches. Otherwise, the overcomers in the other six churches could not be raptured and would have no hope of being saved from the tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE FIRST SCHOOL LACKS A SCRIPTURAL BASIS<br>AND USES MANY GROUNDLESS PRESUMPTIONS-<br>A QUESTION AS IMPORTANT AS THE RAPTURE<br>CANNOT BE BASED ON PRESUMPTIONS</H2><P>Their presumptions include:</P><P>A. Those of this school presume that Revelation 1-3 is on the church, and that since after chapter three Revelation never mentions the church again, the church must have been raptured. In the kingdom Christ has no word of endurance; there is only righteousness and majesty. From this these ones conclude that chapters one through three refer to this age, and chapters four through nineteen refer to the period of the great tribulation, in which the church has no part.</P><P>But it is not true that the church is not mentioned. In chapters four through nineteen there are many references to the church, though the term church is not used. For example, in Revelation 19:14, are not the armies the church? Also, Revelation 22:6-16 mentions "these things" (including the things of the great tribulation). It clearly indicates that it was written for the churches. If it does not concern the church and the believers, why was there the need to write? Revelation 5:9 refers to the church, and Revelation 17:6 refers to the saints, who are the church. Although the word church is not mentioned, it cannot be said that those people are not the church.</P><P>B. These presume that after the church is raptured, many others will be saved on the earth. These saved ones will become the saints in the great tribulation (see Rev. 7:9-17). They are saved while in the midst of the great tribulation. The first school has no choice but to admit this presumption. Otherwise, it cannot justify itself. If the church is raptured before the tribulation, where then do all these countless saints come from?</P><P>The multitude that no man could number must exceed two hundred million (200,000,000). This is the largest number in Revelation (Rev. 9:16). Today's world population is 1.8 billion. Before chapter seven one-fourth of the world population died (Rev. 6:8), leaving 1.3 billion. How then can one say that no one can number them? This must refer to all the saints throughout the two thousand years.</P><P>C. During the great tribulation the Holy Spirit has returned to heaven. These presume that since the church is one with the Holy Spirit, the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation. Their ground is 2 Thessalonians 2:6-8, where "the lawless one" equals Antichrist and "that which restrains" equals the Holy Spirit.</P><P>However, "that which restrains" cannot refer to the Holy Spirit, because the tone of the phrase "goes out of the way" cannot refer to the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, the Holy Spirit has many names-the Spirit, the Spirit of revelation-and without exception the word "Spirit" is always there. Although "the Comforter" was used once, the context clearly indicates that the Comforter is the Holy Spirit (John 14:16). Never once in the Bible is the Holy Spirit called "that which restrains." The Holy Spirit cannot go out of the way. The Bible never says that during the great tribulation there will be no Holy Spirit. Moreover, if there is no Holy Spirit, how can some become believers during the great tribulation? For men to be saved, they must be saved through the Holy Spirit! "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit." This is very clearly spoken of in Revelation (see Rev. 5:6). The time of the great tribulation is precisely the time of the latter rain (see Acts 2:15-21 and Joel 2:28-31). The prophecy of Joel was not fulfilled at Pentecost, because there were no wonders: the blood, the fire, the pillar of smoke, the sun's being turned into darkness, and the moon turned into blood. On the day of Pentecost there were no such wonders. All these five wonders will be fulfilled during the great tribulation: blood (the first trumpet), fire (the first and second trumpets), smoke (the fifth trumpet), the sun and moon (the sixth seal). Pentecost was merely a miniature; it was only a small foretaste. Peter did not say that this "fulfilled" the prophecy; he only said, "This is." Here the word "this is" does not refer to the fulfillment of the prophecy. Suppose Mr. A told Mr. B while they were eating, "Don't eat too fast. You must chew the food; then it will be digested." The next day when Mr. A was reading the Bible, Mr. B told him, "You should read the Bible carefully; then it can be digested." Then Mr. A said, "This is that which was spoken to you when I told you not to eat too fast." Hence, we know that the Holy Spirit has a greater work to do during the great tribulation. If there were no Holy Spirit, how would the saints be able to stand during the tribulation?</P><P>D. These assume that the term "disciples" in the four Gospels refers to the Jews, and that the Lord was saying to the disciples, who were the Jews, "You must be watchful and sober, and you must pray." But to this school, since we are Christians, no matter what, we will all be raptured. These ones follow only the Epistles.</P><P>However, the twelve disciples were men in the church; they were Christians. Otherwise, why, out of the few Epistles that were written within these two thousand years (that is, since church history began), were so many written during the transitional period (the age of the disciples)? Furthermore, the Bible calls all Christians "disciples" (Matt. 28:19; Acts 11:26).</P><P>E. They thought that the four Gospels, the Acts, etc. were not written for the Gentile believers. Scofield said that the Sermon on the Mount is exclusively for the Jews. However, he forgot Matthew 28:20: "Teaching them [the nations] to observe all that I have commanded you," and John 14:26: "And remind you of all the things which I have said to you." They use only Paul's word as the ground of their teaching. But please read Colossians 3:16, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly."</P><P>F. "This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth...and then the end will come" (Matt. 24:14). They say that there is a difference between the gospel of the kingdom and the gospel of grace. To them, the time to preach the gospel of the kingdom was restricted to the time the Lord was on the earth and to the time before the tribulation. But our salvation is through the gospel of grace. They think that the gospel of grace does not need to be preached in all the world before one is raptured.</P><P>The gospel of the kingdom of the heavens is equal to the gospel of the kingdom of God. Acts 20:24-25 mentions the gospel of grace. The word of the kingdom of God in verse 25 is the gospel of grace mentioned previously in verse 24. In Acts 1:3 the Lord was teaching concerning the things of the kingdom of God, which would come in the future.</P><P>G. These maintain that when Christ was on the earth, He was a minister to the circumcision. Is it not true that what He said was said against the background of the Jews? Surely, it was. But the age of grace began also with the Lord. Please see the following verses: Matthew 11:13-14; Luke 16:16, "from that time," that is, from Christ's time; Acts 10:36-37; Acts 13:25-27, "the word of this salvation" began from John's time; Mark 1:1, "the gospel of Jesus Christ" began from John the Baptist; and Luke 4:17-19, which records that the gospel of grace is "today...fulfilled" (Luke 4:21). John 4:23 says that from the time of Jesus, another age began. In the age of the law man approached God in the flesh and by ordinances. If anyone touched a carcass, he was unclean and had to offer sacrifices to God; these are the fleshly ordinances. To come to God in the age of grace is to come in spirit and truthfulness. John 5:24-25 says, "And it is now." These two verses speak of the gospel of grace, which "is now."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE IN THE BIBLE<br>TO SHOW THAT THE CHURCH<br>WILL PASS THROUGH THE TRIBULATION</H2><P>We shall consider a few references:</P><P>A. Second Thessalonians 2:1-9. Read carefully.</P><P>The first verse is the subject: the coming of Christ and the rapture. It does not speak only of Christ's coming; neither does it speak only of the rapture. Therefore, the rapture must be to the air. There are hints to show that it will occur after the tribulation. In verse 2 the word "us" includes Paul, and the word "spirit" refers to another spirit, not the Holy Spirit. "Word" means rumors. "The day of the Lord" is the day of the Lord's coming and the rapture. The first school regards the day of the Lord as the great tribulation. But this is wrong. Although the day of the Lord in the Old Testament always refers to the great tribulation, it is not necessarily so in the New Testament. For example, in 2 Peter 3:10 the day of the Lord refers to the things after the great tribulation and after the millennium. Since this is so, we must look at the context. First Thessalonians 2:1 very naturally refers to the second coming and the rapture. At that time there were people who tried to deceive the Thessalonians by saying that the Lord had already come and that they were left behind. In verse 3  "it" is "the day of the Lord," and "deceive" means to threaten or intimidate. Before the rapture, however, there must be two signs: (1) the appearing of the man of lawlessness, the son of perdition, that is, the Antichrist, and (2) the falling away, or the apostasy. This means that the man of lawlessness must be revealed before the rapture of the saints. When will the man of lawlessness be revealed? Of course, he will be revealed during the great tribulation. Thus, the rapture must be after the tribulation. Based on this, at least a part of the church must pass through the tribulation.</P><P>B. First Corinthians 15:50-55 and 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17: The first passage refers to the resurrection and the transfiguration; the second passage refers to the resurrection and the rapture. These two sections are parallel sections. Everyone agrees that the things mentioned in these passages occur at the same time. Are there any hints that point to the time? There is the blowing of the last trumpet. We know this must be after the tribulation. The first school says that the last trumpet is blown before the tribulation, but there is no ground for this, not even one verse in the Bible that shows this. The blowing of the last trumpet will take place after the tribulation; this last trumpet is the seventh trumpet of the seven trumpets. If the last trumpet was blown before the tribulation, this would be absurd because there would then be seven more trumpets after the last trumpet. This is like saying that after the last son there remain seven more sons. Mr. Janning (?) and others say that the trumpet here refers to the church's trumpet, not the trumpet of the tribulation. Where does the Bible mention anything about the first or the last trumpet of the church? Some among the Brethren say that this refers to the last trumpet in Roman military terminology, which was sounded before the whole legion marched, and that Paul borrowed it. But the Holy Spirit does not borrow from the Roman military terminology. Also, this is God's trumpet and not the church's trumpet. Certainly this is the last trumpet of the seven trumpets in Revelation. Moreover in Revelation 10:7, when the seventh trumpet is sounded, God's mystery is finished. This mystery refers to the church.</P><P>C. Miscellaneous evidences: (1) The consummation of the age: Matthew 24:3; 13:40; 28:20; "the age" equals aeon. The great tribulation is at the end of this age. If the rapture occurs before the tribulation, then this age will be three and a half years short. (2) The putting of the enemies under Christ's feet: 1 Corinthians 15:25; Acts 2:35. This event actually occurs after the tribulation. First Timothy 6:14 says, "Keep...until [after the tribulation] the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ." In Revelation no verse indicates that the Lord will leave the throne to come to the air before the tribulation. It is only after the tribulation begins that He leaves the throne (Rev. 14:14). If Christ will come to the air before the tribulation, then we do not need to wait, be sober, and be watchful.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. ALTHOUGH THERE IS EVIDENCE IN THE BIBLE<br>TO SHOW THAT THE BELIEVERS WILL BE RAPTURED AFTER THE TRIBULATION,<br>THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT ALL BELIEVERS<br>WILL BE RAPTURED AFTER THE TRIBULATION-<br>THERE ARE SOME ERRORS IN THE SECOND SCHOOL- THE BIBLE SHOWS VERY CLEARLY THAT SOME<br>WILL BE RAPTURED BEFORE THE TRIBULATION</H2><P>We will consider some of the reasons.</P><P>A. Suppose all believers are raptured after the tribulation. In that case we would not need to be watchful, waiting, or prepared because we are assured that the Lord will come after the three-and-a-half-year period. If so, I could do all manner of evil for three years, five months, and twenty-nine days. This contradicts a most important principle of the Bible.</P><P>B. If all are raptured after the tribulation, then our waiting is not a waiting for Christ. Instead, it becomes a waiting for Antichrist, because Antichrist comes first.</P><P>C. The church will lose its hope. Titus 2:13 says, "Awaiting the blessed hope," that is, the blessing of escaping the tribulation.</P><P>D. The second school does not admit that there is a secret rapture. They forget that the Lord said, "I will come as a thief." The thief comes in secret. He is not preceded by a military marching band. The thief comes to steal the best things.</P><P>E. Concerning the twelve disciples' being Christians, the second school says that they were all Christians. This is exactly opposite to the first school, which says that none of them were Christians. But the fact is that while the twelve disciples were representatives of the Jewish remnant, they were at the same time Christians also. For example, in Matthew 10:5-6 and 23:3 all have a Jewish background. These verses do not refer to Christians.</P><P>F. Not differentiating the rapture (Christ's coming for the saints) from the appearing (Christ's coming with the saints). There is a public rapture. In the book of Jude the Lord's coming, as referred to by Enoch's prophecy, is a public rapture because He puts His feet on the Mount of Olives. Revelation 1:7 speaks of the same thing. But those who believe in only one public appearing are confused. They are of the historical school, which says that the only portion of Revelation left to be fulfilled is that portion after chapter seventeen. They are exactly opposite to the futuristic school, which says that only chapters one through three have already been fulfilled. If the events in the book of Revelation are the things of the past, then it is no longer revelation. Hence, this book would be understood only by scholars and historians and not by babes. Fulfillment in the Bible is usually literal. For example, the virgin Mary, Bethlehem, etc. are all literal. Occasionally there are fulfillments that are figurative, but they are explained at that time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE FIRST SCHOOL LACKED BIBLICAL EVIDENCE-<br>THE SECOND SCHOOL HAS<br>SOME BIBLICAL EVIDENCE, BUT MANY ERRORS-<br>WHAT DOES THE BIBLE REALLY SAY?</H2><P>Let us look at the following:</P><P>A. Revelation 3:10: "Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth." This is the great tribulation. This verse tells us that some people can escape the great tribulation because they have kept the word of endurance. This verse refutes both the first school and the second school. Although Philadelphia represents the true church in the age of grace, it is also only one of the seven churches in Asia at that time. Thus, we know that only a small number (one-seventh) can be raptured before the tribulation. Furthermore, the rapture before the tribulation is not based on regeneration, that is, on being merely children of God. It is based on one condition alone, and that is to keep the word of His endurance. May we ask, "Can all the believers today keep the word of His endurance?" From this, we know that not all can be raptured before the tribulation. The second school says that this verse does not refer to the rapture before the tribulation but to God's preserving of us during the tribulation; it merely means that during the great tribulation God will lead us through the tribulation. This is just as if a house were on fire yet one room is spared the damage. Also, this is like the Israelites who did not suffer the plagues while in the land of Goshen. This is wrong!</P><P>(1) Here it is not to be kept through but to be kept from. In the original Greek, after the word for "keep" there is the Greek word ek, which means "out of" (for example, ekklesia- a called-out group). Hence, it is not a matter of being kept through, but of being kept out of. Ek means "out of." (2) "Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth." ("Kept" and "keep" in the original text are of the same root.) The hour of trial is not the tribulation but the time of the tribulation. For example, I was in the northwest of Shanghai during the Sino-Japanese War. I was not hurt. This was God's keeping me through that tribulation; it was not His keeping me from the hour of that tribulation. If we want to be kept from the hour, we must be kept out of this world. If God wants to keep us out of this world, there are only two ways: death and rapture. Those in Philadelphia have died already, so they are kept from the hour of the great tribulation. But God cannot kill today's church just because He wants to keep it from the hour of the great tribulation. Hence, the only way is to rapture it.</P><P>B. Luke 21:36 also proves that not all, but only a portion, of the church will be raptured before the tribulation. The records of Luke 21 and Matthew 24 are approximately the same, but Matthew emphasizes the Lord's coming and the tribulation, whereas Luke emphasizes the destruction of Jerusalem and the tribulation. Thus, in Matthew there are questions (Matt. 24:3) and also many parables. In Luke there are none of these. Concerning Jerusalem, at the beginning there is the persecution in A.D. 70, and at the end there will be the great tribulation. Luke 21:8-9 refers to the things before the end. Verses 10-19 indicate that the believers will suffer. Verses 20-28 show how Jerusalem will be destroyed. In verse 28 it seems that all the saints will pass through the tribulation. Verses 29-33 are a parable that guarantees that there will be such a thing. If there were not such a section as verses 34-36, we could say that all the believers will be raptured after the tribulation. However, in verse 34 the tone changes. Verse 35 refers to the things of the whole world. Verse 36 mentions the condition for escaping the great tribulation, watch and pray. How can we escape? It is either by death or by being raptured. To stand-this is not in the active voice but in the passive voice. It means to be put before the Son of Man. This, of course, refers to the rapture. Death is not a blessing. We do not pray and hope for death. Here the condition of the rapture is to watch and pray. Not all those who are regenerated can be raptured. One must pray always. What should he pray? He should pray that he can escape all the things that will come to pass. We often pray for clothing and food. We never pray for being raptured. If a man does not know the terror of the great tribulation, he will not pray. Verse 36 should have the words "counted worthy." To be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass is not a question of grace but a question of whether or not one is worthy. What is it to be counted worthy? God cannot receive a person to a place to which he does not want to go (the story of the eagle and the cat). Some feel that heaven would be tasteless because their hearts are snared; they are like light-air balloons that are loaded with things and cannot ascend. Thus, Luke 21:36 puts down the first school and the second school. (1) The second school says that man's rapture is not determined by his behavior. Then, we would ask, can a person be on the bed of a prostitute and be an adulterer, yet be raptured? (2) The second school also says that "all these things" do not refer to the great tribulation but to debauchery, drunkenness, and the anxieties of life. But here it says, "All these things which are about to happen." Debauchery and drunkenness are the things of this life. Also, with these things, there is no question of being worthy or unworthy; one must be delivered from them in any case. Hence, one must watch and should not be deceived.</P><P>C. Miscellaneous evidence: (1) Matthew 24:43 and 1 Thessalonians 5:4 indicate that there must be two raptures. (2) Men will be raptured to different places; that is, they will go to different places: (a) Revelation 7:15 mentions standing before the throne of God; (b) Luke 21:36 speaks of standing before the Son of Man; (c) 1 Thessalonians 4:17 speaks of being in the air. Hence, not all will be raptured, and the raptures will not take place all at the same time. (3) Mark 13:32 records that no one knows the day on which Christ is coming. Yet we know that His coming will be after the seventh trumpet. The reason for this difference is that the former refers to the first rapture, while the latter refers to the rapture after the tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FROM THOSE WHO OPPOSE SEPARATE RAPTURES</H2><P>A. The argument is that the church's rapture cannot be divided because Christ's Body cannot be fragmented.</P><P>However, the Body is a figure of speech and refers to the fact that we have the same life. The church is the Lord's bride. Suppose we interpret the Body according to the letter; then today the Body is already divided. The Lord is in the heavens, Paul is dead, we still remain on the earth, and some are not yet born.</P><P>B. Another argument is that the rapture is a part of redemption, and if redemption is by grace, then the rapture cannot be based on whether or not one is counted worthy.</P><P>Our escaping from the judgment is already according to grace; transfiguration (the act of changing) (1 Cor. 15:51-52) and the rapture (the act of taking) are according to behavior.</P><P>C. These ask: "Is it not cruel to take away the church's hope?"</P><P>There was never such a hope anyway; it was a false hope. We need to be reminded of this.</P><P>D. These argue that 1 Corinthians 15:23 talks only about belonging to Christ; it does not speak of behavior.</P><P>Our answer is that one cannot disregard all the other verses just because of this one verse. Moreover, this verse does not speak concerning the rapture but concerning resurrection. They read the rapture into it, not out of it.</P><P>E. These ask, "How about the dead? If this is the case, they will not have to pass through the tribulation. This seems too easy for them."</P><P>We do not need to worry for God. Can the righteous God do something unrighteous? During the millennium, these people will suffer loss (2 Cor. 5:10).</P><P>F. These argue: "First Corinthians 15:50-52 says that we will all be changed. The word `all' refers to the whole Body."</P><P>It indeed refers to all, but it does not refer to all at the same time. For example, we will all die, but not on the same day.</P><P>G. These contend that although there is a difference between the wheat and the tares, between wheat and wheat there is no differentiation; hence, all will be raptured.</P><P>But the time of ripening is different. There is a difference between the firstfruits and the harvest.</P><P>H. First Thessalonians 4:15 says that those who remain "shall by no means precede those who have fallen asleep." These argue that the dead will be resurrected at the seventh trumpet. Hence, the resurrection will occur after the tribulation. If there is a first rapture, it must take place before the dead are resurrected. But here it says "shall by no means." How then can the rapture be divided into two parts?</P><P>Verses 15 and 17 say, "We who are living, who are left remaining." This is most important and most precious. Some say that to be living and to be left remaining mean the same thing, which is to be on earth. But there is no reason for such a repetition. The words "left remaining" indicate that there is a group that has gone first. These would then argue: "Since Paul said `we,' would Paul consider himself among the second group, `who are living, who are left remaining'?" Here "we" is merely a means of expression; it is like using the term "we" in our daily conversation, without actually including ourselves as one of the group. At any rate, Paul did not continue to live, nor did he remain. Hence, our conclusion is that the third school is right. Some believers will be raptured before the tribulation, and another group of believers will remain until after the tribulation. The latter will suffer the trial of the tribulation.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</H1><P>There are seven sections in verses 1-13: (1) ten virgins going to meet the bridegroom (v. 1); (2) two kinds of virgins (vv. 2-4); (3) their history or experience (vv. 5-7); (4) the discovery of the lack (vv. 8-9); (5) the separation (v. 10); (6) the pleading of the foolish ones (vv. 11-12); and (7) the lesson (v. 13).</P><P>Verse 1: "At that time the kingdom of the heavens will be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom." "At that time" refers to the time of the parousia (the rapture). The kingdom of the heavens is not synonymous with the church. The term "church" was used in Paul's time. When the term is qualified by the name of a locality, such as "the church in Laodicea," it refers to a local church. When there is no qualifier, it refers to the Body of Christ. The church speaks of God's grace, while the kingdom of the heavens speaks of God's righteousness; it speaks of the scope of God's reign. Since the "virgins" refer to the Christians and the "bridegroom" refers to the Lord, why is there no bride? It is because the bride of Revelation 21 is the New Jerusalem, which includes Jesus and the church. Here we have only the church; hence, it can be called only a virgin and not the bride.</P><P>The number ten in the Scriptures alludes to the major  four complete numbers in the Scriptures: three (God's completion), seven (a temporary completion), ten (man's completion), and twelve (eternal completion). In Revelation 21 everything is of the number twelve: the gates, the pearls, the names of the apostles, the tribes of Israel, the precious stones, and the height of one hundred and forty-four cubits (twelve times twelve). Prior to this, seven was the number of completion. Beginning with the new heaven and the new earth in chapter twenty-one, the number twelve is used throughout.</P><P>Three is God's number, and four is man's number. Seven equals three plus four-God's number plus man's number. The number seven can be split up; therefore, it signifies a temporary completeness. Twelve equals three times four-God's number times man's number. It cannot be split up, and therefore signifies eternal completion.</P><P>Ten is only a little less than the number for eternal completion. When two is added to ten, the sum is twelve, signifying eternal completion. The two grinding at the mill in chapter twenty-four represent the believers who are alive. The ten virgins in chapter twenty-five represent the believers who are dead, that is, those who have "slept." In the Greek and Hebrew languages, twelve is spoken as two plus ten. Twelve is the base number and two is the remainder.</P><P>In Genesis 42:3 and 4 there are ten older brothers and two younger brothers; in Numbers 14:37-38 ten spies were with Joshua and Caleb; in 1 Kings 11:29-31 the prophet rent the garment into twelve pieces. The twelve pieces were divided into ten pieces and two pieces. Therefore, as ten is the major part of the whole, the dead believers occupy a major part of all the believers. In Matthew 20:24, ten disciples argued with the two. We have other proofs: Genesis 24:10; Judg. 6:27; Ruth 4:2; Luke 19:13. The beast has ten horns; the revived Roman Empire is divided into ten parts.</P><P>As in all parables, the virgins here cannot be regarded as literal. The virgins are we who have been regenerated by the Lord. The term virgin does not refer to chastity. Even a married woman can be chaste. A virgin is a girl who is not yet married, one who is hidden away. Therefore, virgin cannot refer to the Jews or the unbelievers. Only Christians can bear this title.</P><P>The virgins' only goal is to take their lamps to meet the bridegroom. The lamp in the Bible has many meanings: (1) the word of Jehovah (Psa. 119:105); (2) prophecy (2 Pet. 1:19); or (3) Christian behavior (Matt. 5:14-16). The word used here is not "candle." A candle burns its own oil, but the oil of a lamp comes from outside. The behavior of a Christian should be a proclamation to all of the coming of the Bridegroom. The reason that we preach the gospel is that the Lord is coming soon. In breaking the bread we: (1) remember the Lord's work and (2) remember the Lord's soon return.</P><P>Verses 2-4:"And five of them were foolish and five were prudent. For the foolish, when they took their lamps, did not take oil with them; but the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps." There are two kinds of virgins in verses 2-4. Many Bible expositors consider the five foolish virgins to be unsaved persons, but there are a few dozen sure proofs that will refute such suppositions. We will list only fifteen major reasons to prove that these are saved ones:</P><P>(1) They were all virgins. To the very end they were called virgins. The Lord never questioned this point; He recognized this fact.</P><P>(2) There was light in their lamps (v. 8). This light lasted through half the night, proving that it was of the Holy Spirit which issued forth in good works that glorified God. In verse 8, "are going out" indicates that there was still some light that had not yet died out.</P><P>(3) They all went forth to meet the bridegroom. An unsaved one surely will not welcome the Bridegroom. (Would bandits light lamps to meet the army?)</P><P>(4) "But at midnight there was a cry,...Go forth to meet him!" The archangel will not make any mistake in calling the ten; neither will the Lord call them by the wrong names.</P><P>(5) Having oil in their lamps but not in their vessels. Oil refers to the Holy Spirit; hence, the foolish virgins must be saved ones.</P><P>(6) All the virgins arose. Verse 7 refers to resurrection. The saved ones and the unsaved ones are not resurrected together. They are resurrected one thousand years apart.</P><P>(7) The five prudent virgins went in with Him (v. 10). They were caught up into the air. The five foolish virgins followed afterward, being caught up together in the air also. The only difference is that the five foolish virgins could not partake of the feast.</P><P>(8) The ten virgins differ only in behavior but not in nature. There is no distinction of true and false ones, only a distinction of prudent and foolish ones. Foolish does not mean unsaved.</P><P>(9) Their lamps were going out because of the tarrying of the bridegroom. If He had not tarried, they would have been qualified to be caught up together with the prudent ones.</P><P>(10) They were still virgins in verse 11. When they came they had already bought oil and brought it with them.</P><P>(11) The word "buy" in Matthew 25:9 cannot be used to speak of unsaved persons; only the word "ask" could have been used, because grace is free. Only the saved ones can buy, that is, pay the price.</P><P>(12) Suppose the five foolish virgins were not saved. This would indicate that dead people can still be saved, because the prudent ones advised them to go and buy oil.</P><P>(13) Suppose the five foolish virgins were not saved. The five prudent virgins would not then say, "Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you"; they would not have turned them down. If the five foolish ones were not saved, the five prudent ones would have been willing to pay any price for them. How could they not save those who are dying?</P><P>(14) The Lord said, "Watch therefore." Those who can watch, as in verse 13, must have life. If the five foolish ones are unsaved, they cannot be told to watch; rather, they can be told only to repent.</P><P>(15) Compare Matthew 25 to the gospel feast in Matthew 22. There we have a lost one at the feast. Here the words are spoken to the disciples, that is, the saved ones only. Chapter twenty-two deals with the problem of salvation and perdition, but chapter twenty-five has nothing to do with salvation or perdition. In chapter twenty-two the lost one is bound and cannot do anything, whereas in chapter twenty-five they are still free and can do many things. Chapter twenty-two is concerned with the king's gain or loss, while chapter twenty-five is concerned with the virgins' gain or loss. Salvation is a glory to the King, but the kingdom of the heavens is a gain for the prudent virgins. Today, when they expound the Bible, believers speak only of the problem of salvation. They do not know that after salvation there is still the problem of the kingdom.</P><P>Prudence or foolishness does not refer to one's nature but to the difference in outward behavior. We can prove this from one instance in the New Testament. See Matthew 7:24-26. The prudent one is the one who puts into practice the Lord's words. The foolish one is the one who does not. The "rock" refers to the Lord's words, and "sand" refers to man's opinions. To build on the rock means to base everything on God's words. The foolish one bases everything on his own opinions. Proverbs says that the fear of God is the root of wisdom. Before God, to be simple-minded is wise, and to disobey is foolish. In God's word, it is foolish to say "but," "or," "according to my opinion." To do things according to God's word is utterly foolish in the eyes of man but is prudent in the eyes of God.</P><P>The two kinds of virgins differ only in two respects: the prudent took oil in their vessels, whereas the foolish did not. The prudent could participate in the feast, while the foolish were excluded. However, they have much in common: (1) they were all virgins; (2) they all carried a lamp, signifying their outward behavior; (3) their lamps were lighted, signifying a conduct that glorified God; (4) there was oil, representing the Holy Spirit, in their vessels; (5) they all went out to meet the bridegroom, that is, they were all waiting; (6) they all slept; (7) they all heard the midnight cry; (8) they all arose, signifying resurrection; and (9) they all trimmed their lamps, that is, they all prepared the oil.</P><P>Although the two kinds of virgins have much in common, slight differences can produce widely divergent results. Should we not then be careful in our behavior? The cause determines the effect. A deviation today will cause a further deviation tomorrow. All future deviations arise from present deviations. Whether it will be glory or shame in the future depends on how we make our choice today.</P><P>The foolish virgins did not take oil. This oil is in addition to the oil that is already in the lamp. The five prudent virgins took oil in their vessels. The lamp here refers to outward behavior (Matt. 5:16, "light" refers to good works that glorify the Father), whereas oil refers to the Holy Spirit (cf. Exo. 30:22-33; Zech. 4:2, 12; Heb. 1:9; 1 John 2:20, 27).</P><P>Here there are two kinds of analogies: the oil in the lamp and the oil in the vessel. The oil in the lamp typifies the Holy Spirit, who dwells in the regenerated person. Every Christian has the indwelling Holy Spirit (see Ezek. 36:26; Eph. 1:13). Proverbs 20:27 (ASV) says, "The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, / Searching all his innermost parts." Romans 8:9 tells us that all the regenerated ones have the Spirit of Christ. From 2 Corinthians 13:5 and 1 John 3:24; 4:13 we see that if a man is not disapproved, then Jesus Christ lives in him. The Lord lives in us through the Holy Spirit.</P><P>Having oil in the vessel means that there is not only the indwelling of the Holy Spirit but also the infilling of the Spirit. At the time of regeneration we have the Holy Spirit dwelling within us. But the infilling by the Holy Spirit is conditioned upon our pursuit of the Lord after regeneration. Every believer has the Holy Spirit, but not every believer is filled by the Holy Spirit.</P><P>There are two kinds of filling: (1) being filled with the Holy Spirit and (2) being full of the Holy Spirit. The former is related to the gift for the work, while the latter is related to the holiness of life. The oil in the vessel includes these two kinds of fillings: being filled and being full of. The vessel is something apart from the lamp and is not the main emphasis of this parable. It does not have any special significance. Since oil is not a solid, it needs a vessel to contain it. God's desire is that we will not only have oil in the lamp but will also be filled with and full of oil. A student's goal in studying is not just to pass the examination (that is, to be saved) but also to excel (that is, to be filled).</P><P>To prepare the lamp is not the best way; neither is any kind of dressing up. What God cares for is the extra oil. Yet believers today pay attention only to the outward appearance of the lamp. The less oil there is, the more they strive to dress up with a nice appearance. Shining the lamp, however, cannot replace the need for oil.</P><P>We think that it is enough to have oil once, but God requires that we have oil twice. The second oil is different from the first oil. The first time we receive the oil, it is freely given by God. The second time, we gain it by paying a price. Whoever is not willing to pay the price, deny the self, and pursue the oil will never obtain the second oil. May we all be watchful! If we are loose and lazy today, others may not be able to tell whether we have the second oil or not. But no laziness will escape that day; in that day all will be tried.</P><P>Believers, are you willing to pay the price? The filling of the Holy Spirit is the condition for rapture. A balloon can rise only when it is filled with gas. The same is true with us. Therefore, let us all pay the price to prepare oil in our vessel, lest we become the foolish virgins.</P><P>Verses 5-7:"And while the bridegroom delayed, they all became drowsy and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Go forth to meet him! Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their own lamps."</P><P>Verses 5-7 form one section. They speak concerning the history of the foolish virgins. While on earth we cannot discern this foolishness. The bridegroom's delay in coming was intended as a test to see who is prudent and who is foolish. At first both the prudent and the foolish ones have the light. Perhaps the foolish would laugh at the prudent for unnecessarily taking an extra portion of oil. Many are qualified to be caught up in the beginning, but eventually they fail because of the Lord's tarrying. Those who consider the Lord to be tarrying are the evil slaves, and those who expect the Lord to return soon are the foolish ones. The parable of the evil slave instructs the believers to prepare themselves to meet the Lord today. The parable of the virgins teaches us to consider that the Lord will return no sooner than a few decades later. If the Lord comes back after fifty years, will you be prepared to meet Him? Take heed lest your lamp contains enough oil to burn only till midnight and not after. If you prepare only enough to last till midnight, the Lord will surely tarry until midnight is past. Do not underestimate the Lord's testing. The Lord's tarrying speaks of the need for the oil in the vessel. Whether our lamps will burn only till midnight or will burn throughout the night depends on whether or not we have oil in our vessels. The shining at the beginning is not so crucial here.</P><P>The bridegroom is the Lord. When the Lord tarried, the virgins all slumbered and slept. Parables should be interpreted, of course, spiritually. Sleep in the Scriptures has two meanings: (1) spiritual deadness (Rom. 13:11-14; 1 Thes. 5:6) and (2) physical death (1 Thes. 4:13; John 11:11). Sleep here must fall under one of the above two explanations. If sleep denotes spiritual deadness: (1) Why did the prudent not overcome the sleepiness? (2) Sleep here is not crucial because the prudent did not suffer any loss because of their sleep. (3) The Lord did not reprove them for their sleeping-He was not concerned for this matter at all. (4) Note the instruction in verse 13. The Lord tells us to follow the example of the five prudent virgins in their watchfulness; therefore, it is not reasonable to say that sleep implies spiritual deadness. Based on these reasons, we know that sleep is physical death and that slumber is to become seriously ill, to be at the juncture of life and death (Acts 9:37; 1 Cor. 11:30).</P><P>"At midnight there was a cry." The midnight cry refers to the shout of the archangel in 1 Thessalonians 4:16. This shout is to wake up the dead believers, whereas the trumpet in 1 Corinthians 15:52 is to gather them together. The hearers are the dead believers; the cry at midnight must refer to 1 Thessalonians 4:16. To be raised up refers to resurrection. The bridegroom has come, so go forth to meet Him. Thus both parties come together and meet in the air.</P><P>"All...arose" proves that all Christians are resurrected together. It seems that here there is time for some conversation. Yet in 1 Corinthians 15:52, "in the twinkling of an eye" does not seem to allow for such opportunity. Remember that this is a parable. Parables are always like this. In reality there is no time, yet there may appear to be time in the parable. In Matthew 20:11-12, in the beginning there is work; then comes the reward and the argument with the Lord. In reality the latter surely will not happen. The same is also true of Matthew 22:1-14. For this reason, in our study of the parables we pay our attention mainly to the teachings.</P><P>Why are not the dead ones caught up into the air immediately after resurrection? As revealed in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, the dead will rise first, then those who are living and left remaining. Since there is an order, there can be a period of time between the two. "The twinkling of an eye" in 1 Corinthians 15 refers to the resurrection and not to the rapture. Thus, it is neither surprising nor unlikely for the virgins to be able to trim their lamps after their resurrection. (A dying person in his last five minutes can also recall the things he did in his whole lifetime. It is thus quite natural for the resurrected ones to do the same immediately after they resurrected.)</P><P>Verses 8-9:"And the foolish said to the prudent, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out. But the prudent answered, saying, Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves." This shows the discovery of the lack. When the bridegroom tarried, the foolish ones found that they were lacking oil. The bridegroom's tarrying was a test to expose their prudence or foolishness. The foolish virgins might have thought that the five prudent virgins were over-cautious by taking oil with their vessels. Now they discover their need. "Give us some of your oil." This means, "Give us of the gift of the Holy Spirit." One should know that the gift of the Holy Spirit can be given, but not the fullness of the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:17; 19:6; 2 Tim. 1:6). To ask only for the gift of the Holy Spirit is useless. One must have both the gift and the fullness. We cannot borrow oil from others, whether they are our parents, brothers, sisters, or close relatives. Our spiritual fullness requires that we pay the price. Pretending to be spiritual can get us by today, but it will not be sufficient for that day. Obtaining the Holy Spirit requires fellowshipping with the Lord and paying the price to pursue Him. No matter how long you stay with other spiritual ones, it will not help you. Do not think we can borrow oil from others. To borrow light, yes; but to borrow oil, no.</P><P>"Perhaps there will not be enough." In other words, we cannot help you; it is not possible to help others in this matter. There are times when the Lord will permit certain kinds of "holy selfishness." Just because some are foolish, we should not allow ourselves also to become foolish for sympathy's sake. Although we should express our concern for others, we must reserve for ourselves a certain "sacred selfishness"; otherwise, there will not be enough. That is, both will suffer loss. The other party will not receive any help, and your effort will not improve the situation.</P><P>"Buy for yourselves" touches many points:</P><P>(1) At that time there is still the possibility and opportunity to buy oil. Note that this does not mean that dead people still have the opportunity to be saved after their resurrection. Furthermore, the unsaved are not resurrected at this time.</P><P>(2) This implies that the oil of the five prudent virgins was also bought originally. They paid a price for their oil. From this we know that slothful ones cannot be filled by the Holy Spirit.</P><P>(3) For the infilling of the Holy Spirit, there is a price to be paid. It cannot be obtained by begging. When one goes to buy, he must know what he wants to buy. Often when we meet friends in a department store and ask them what they want to buy, they say they do not know. Many Christians are like this. They do not see the need to buy oil, or they know the price but cannot pay it. Most believers today do not know the importance of the infilling of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>The amount of oil in the lamp is not sufficient to last past midnight. Only the oil in the vessel is sufficient. The new covenant in the heart can only produce new desires; it cannot supply the strength. Having only the desires causes frustration because there is not the power to fulfill them. Hence, the infilling is crucial. Since man needs it, he should pay the price for it. Do not think that as long as one is saved, he is all right. One must first consider the price. Consider the Lord's word about the building of the tower and the king going to war (Luke 14:28-32). When many hear of the high price, they turn away. They do not realize the need for the oil.</P><P>The price differs for each person. Some may have to clear up matters, while others may need to get rid of certain things in their lives. In short, oil requires that a price be paid; it cannot be obtained for free. Even when the oil is obtained, it is not for the interest of the individual but rather for the glory of God. In working for God, many love to use their gift and power as a kind of ornament. But God never exalts Christians by gifts and power. The price may not always be known; nevertheless, it is there.</P><P>The most important thing here is the dealing with sin; it is the prerequisite. Before sin is dealt with, one cannot consider paying the price. The confession of sins is not the paying of the price; it is our undisputed duty. Even the five foolish virgins did that.</P><P>(4) Paying the price. A penny of price will buy a penny of goods. Whatever price one pays, that much oil he will get. The cross cannot be separated from the Holy Spirit. The killing (which comes before death) of the Lord should be magnified in our body (2 Cor. 4:9-11). The cross opens up room for the new covenant to move in. The infilling of the new covenant is not necessarily sensed or felt; it is a fact. It is not necessary for us to be able to sense our heartbeat. It is enough that the reality of the heartbeat is there. The only begotten Son has been given, but the oil cannot be given; it must be bought.</P><P>There are four items in the Bible the obtaining of which demands that a price be paid. (a) Proverbs 23:23 says, "Buy the truth." To know the truth, we must have a determination to practice the truth, then seek and pursue it. (b) Revelation 3:18 says, "gold refined by fire," (c) "white garments," and (d) "eyesalve."</P><P>Buying here is not for the unbelievers. God cannot ask the unbelievers to buy. Furthermore, the church in Laodicea is still the church. Gold refined by fire signifies the faith that can go through testing without suffering defeat. This is the faith in dealing with the environment (1 Pet. 1:7). For God to allow a believer to pass through trials is an honor. When a believer passes through trials, God is glorified before Satan, as He was with Job.</P><P>In Revelation there are two kinds of white garments: (a) The white garment obtained before God is the Lord Jesus. This is our being cleansed when we put on Christ. Those without this white garment are not saved. (b) The white garment before the Lord is the righteousness that comes from the moving of the Lord's Spirit in us. Those without such a white garment are naked before the Lord and cannot receive a reward.</P><P>(5) This section gives us the hint that the oil must be bought anyway. The infilling of the Holy Spirit is not something that is up to you. Sooner or later all believers will have to be filled by the Holy Spirit. Do not think that the five prudent virgins went to extremes. When the time comes, God will force you to go to extremes too. Ephesians 5:18 is a command. If you do not keep it today, you will have to keep it someday.</P><P>(6) Where do the foolish virgins go to buy the oil? At that time, the end of the tribulation, who will be on earth to sell the oil? There will be two: Enoch and Elijah (Rev. 11:2-4). They are the "olive trees," which bear oil-producing fruit. Zechariah 4:11-12 also speaks of them as the oil-producing plants. Enoch and Elijah were both prophets who had the gift of the Holy Spirit. They were the sons of oil, supplying others with oil. But note, Enoch and Elijah can supply only part of the oil. To be full of the Holy Spirit still requires our own pursuit.</P><P>(7) How can there be suffering after resurrection? The Bible does not consider this a problem. You may have the prejudice that there will be no suffering after the resurrection. But one must realize that everyone who is suffering in hell is resurrected. After resurrection, some will have joy, while others will have suffering. If a Christian's temper is not dealt with when he is alive, it will not be dealt with after his death either. The greed, pride, and selfishness of the rich man were still there after he died. Death cannot make a person holy. Otherwise, every man would be made holy, since every man dies once.</P><P>For this reason, after resurrection there is the need to trim the lamps. In verse 8 the lamp is going out, which means that the lamp can never actually go out. The life that God gives us will forever remain. Yet many Christians' experience of the Holy Spirit is in a situation of "going out." Many times it seems as if it has "gone out," but actually the Holy Spirit never leaves. Although the Holy Spirit cannot leave because of man's unfaithfulness, there are many Christians who are at the point of "going out."</P><P>Verse 10:"And as they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast. And the door was shut." Eventually, the five foolish virgins needed the oil, and so they had to go and buy. Unfortunately, when they went to buy, the Lord came. Those who were ready were caught up into the clouds to join Him in the air. The Lord did not call these the "true" virgins. The question is one of being ready or not being ready. It does not mean that the five raptured ones are the true virgins, while the others are not. There are many true Christians, but not many are prepared.</P><P>"The wedding feast" here is the marriage feast (Rev. 19:7, 9; 21:9-10). The bride is the New Jerusalem, including all who are joined to God in the Old Testament age and the New Testament age. Revelation 19 precedes the kingdom, whereas Revelation 21 is after the kingdom. Between the two there is a period of one thousand years. To be a bride is a one-time thing. From this we know that the time of the marriage feast will be a thousand years. This thousand years is the millennial kingdom. Since after the kingdom there is still the bride, the feast lasts the same length of time as the kingdom.</P><P>The marriage feast is the sharing of joy with the Bridegroom. No one else can have this joy. That is why Revelation 19:9 says, "Blessed are they." This blessedness refers to this joy. The blessedness in Revelation 20:6 refers to authority, which is similar to that found in Revelation 3:20-21. The word "blessed" is used seven times in Revelation (1:3; 14:13; 16:15; 19:9; 20:6; 22:7, 14). Why does Matthew 25 not use the word "bride"? It is because the bride is corporate, whereas the virgin is individual. There cannot be five brides. The "door" here refers to the door of the kingdom, that is, the door to eating, drinking, and rejoicing. "The door was shut." Not the door of salvation, heaven, and eternal life, but the door to the enjoyment of the marriage feast, was shut. They lost the enjoyment of the marriage feast. Whoever is prepared can go in, but those who are not prepared cannot go in. Not being able to go in is in itself a punishment.</P><P>Verse 11:"And later the rest of the virgins came also, saying, Lord, lord, open to us!" In verse 11 we have the pleadings of the foolish virgins. By now they have bought the oil. The five prudent and the five foolish were all virgins; they all had lamps, oil, and light. They all went forth to meet the bridegroom. They all slept, heard the cry, and arose. They all trimmed their lamps, and by now they all have oil in their vessels. The only difference is time; some are faster than others in discerning the time. On the road to Emmaus the Lord rebuked the two disciples saying, "O foolish and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!" (Luke 24:25). In like manner, the Lord rebuked Thomas in John 20:29. The question of time is crucial. Those who suffer in hell all believe in the Lord, but they believe too late. The foolish do not redeem the time, but the wise redeem the time. They are the ones who are filled with the Holy Spirit (Eph. 5:17-18). Brothers and sisters, since we have to be filled by the Holy Spirit anyway, why not let it be today? Why choose to wait until that time when the rapture takes place?</P><P>Here we see at least two raptures. Those who are not yet saved will not even have the opportunity to go to the Lord to knock on the door. Only those who are saved will have the possibility of being raptured to the Lord. The difference, however, is in the time. As soon as we mature, we will be raptured. Therefore, in a sense, we determine our own time of rapture. We decide for ourselves whether we will be wise or foolish.</P><P>Verse 12:"But he answered and said, Truly I say to you, I do not know you." Here they are still virgins. To the bridegroom their relationship is still that toward the "lord." He opens the door to us, and we enter into the enjoyment of the bliss of the kingdom.</P><P>"I do not know you." Many use this, together with the fact that the foolish do not have oil, as a basis to say that those five are unsaved ones. How can the Lord say that He does not know the saved ones? Let us consider this carefully.</P><P>(1) "But He answered." "But" means contrary to the ordinary, unexpected. In Luke 15:22 the word "but" points out the father of the prodigal son's intention, hope, and expectation. Therefore, the word "but" here proves that the "do not know" is not a common "do not know."</P><P>(2) The Lord knows all those who are saved (2 Tim. 2:19; Gal. 4:9; John 10:14). There are two words in the Greek language that mean "to know": ginosko and oida. The former is objective, whereas the latter is subjective. In Timothy and Galatians it is ginosko, and in Matthew 25 it is oida.</P><P>(3) Oida in the Bible has these uses: to command, to praise, to approve, and to like. John 1:26 says, "You do not know (oida)." The Jews did ginosko the Lord, but they did not oida the Lord; they did not love the Lord. John 1:31 says, "Did not know (oida) Him." John and the Lord were cousins; hence, naturally, they ginoskoed each other, but there was not the deeper knowing. John 8:19 says, "Know (oida) neither Me." The Jews, on the surface, ginosko the Lord very well. The meaning here is that the Jews do not approve or accept the Lord. Luke 13:22-30 depicts the situation in the kingdom. They ginosko the Lord the most, for they drank and ate in His presence. They also heard His teachings. Yet the Lord said that they were workers of unrighteousness. "Unrighteousness" should be translated "lawlessness." The knowing in 1 Corinthians 16:15 is oida, a knowing even of the household matters. In 1 Thessalonians 1:5 the word is oida. In that verse there is the meaning of trusting; hence, it is subjective knowing.</P><P>(4) Matthew 10:32 and Luke 12:9 refer to matters that take place before the kingdom. The same is true of Matthew 12. The Christian who believes in secret is not lost, but in the kingdom he will not be commended by the Lord. In Matthew 26:70 the Greek word for "know" is oida, while that for "deny" is arneomai. Arneomai also means "reject, overthrow" (v. 72). I do not oida the man; hence, I arneomai him. I do not oida; therefore, I deny (that is, I overthrow, I reject). Hence, "I do not know." Matthew 10:33 speaks of the disciples. It does not refer to salvation. Those who do not testify will also be arneomaied by the Lord.</P><P>(5) The Old Testament also speaks of oida (1 Sam. 3:7). Samuel already objectively ginoskoed Jehovah, but he did not subjectively oida Him.</P><P>(6) The reward of the kingdom is altogether righteous. For the Lord not to acknowledge them is also an aspect of righteousness. The tone is like that of a judge judging his son; he must ask for his son's name. "I do not know you" here carries the sense of honoring only the subpoena but not the person. There is also the sense of not caring and not accepting.</P><P>Verse 13:"Watch therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour." The lesson here is still to be watchful. The Lord told them to watch, showing that all the virgins had life. The Lord did not say to the virgins that they needed to be born again to obtain salvation. In verse 10 those who were ready went in with Him to the feast. To be ready is to be watchful; hence, the two are together. To be ready is to have no unfinished business. Every day a ready person is prepared to hand over his business. A watchful person is one who sees His coming and is therefore always ready. We believers should be those who can hand over everything every day. For us, the Lord can come any day.</P><P>The five foolish virgins were ready and watchful in the beginning, but they did not persevere. Readiness is related to the unfinished business in our lives. Watchfulness is related to the imminent coming of the Lord. To be ready, to be watchful, and to wait requires the strength that comes from the infilling of the Holy Spirit, the second kind of oil. One cannot trust in his self. The self quickly becomes weak and confused. In order for our watchfulness to last, we must depend on the Holy Spirit. The filling of the Holy Spirit will automatically issue forth in good works, the fruits that glorify God.</P><P>Those who are truly watchful always feel that they are not fully ready; they do not trust in themselves and are willing to follow humbly. Brothers and sisters, it is of no benefit to equip ourselves with prophecy if we are not watchful and ready. Would it not be a great loss if we have the knowledge of prophecy today yet suffer loss in the future? Get ready! The Lord wants to see our lamps and our light. Watch! No one knows the day or the hour. If the day and the hour were known, there would be no need to watch. In chapters twenty-four and twenty-five there are five instances where it is said that no one knows the day of the Lord's coming. This repetition is to stress its importance. Do not rely on being caught up after the tribulation. The Lord does not reveal the day of His coming because He wants us to be watchful.</P><P>Verses 14-30:The parable of the talents, from verse 14 through verse 30, can be divided into four sections: (a) the distribution of the Lord's talents (vv. 14-15); (b) the ways the slaves used their talents (vv. 16-18); (c) the judgment of the first and second slaves (vv. 19-23); and (d) the judgment of the third slave (vv. 24-30).</P><P>In order to understand this parable, we must first understand the difference between our relationship (1) with God and (2) with the Lord. Otherwise, it will be difficult to understand the Bible clearly, and we will encounter many difficulties and contradictions. Before God we are children, and before the Lord we are servants, or slaves. We are children by faith, and we are servants by works. In grace we are children and in responsibility we are slaves. We are children because of the Son and we are slaves because of the Spirit.</P><P>This passage concerns the relationship between the slaves and the Lord, not the relationship between the children and the Father. From 25:14 on, the Gospel of Matthew no longer deals with the relationship between the children and the Father, which is eternal. Rather, it deals with the relationship between the Lord and His slaves, which lasts until the end of the millennium. The relationship with the Father has to do with salvation and eternity. The relationship with the Son has to do with victory and reward. The parable of the talents concerns the reward, not eternity. The question of eternity has already been resolved.</P><P>There are basic differences between the New Testament and the Old Testament. In the Old Testament we must labor before we can gain life. That is, we must first be slaves; then we can be children. However, in the New Testament we must first possess life, and then we work. This means that we must be regenerated first; then we become slaves. God does not desire the fleshly service of His believers.</P><P>Verse 14:"For the kingdom of the heavens is just like a man about to go abroad, who called his own slaves and delivered to them his possessions." The phrase "the kingdom of the heavens" is not in the original text. The original text reads, "It is like a man." This "man" is the Lord. The term "abroad" refers to a foreign country, one that is not in this world and is different from any country on earth. Our citizenship is of that country (Phil. 3:20). "About to go abroad" refers to the Lord's ascension (Heb. 9:24; 1 Pet. 3:22). "Called his own slaves." From this we know that this cannot refer to the Jews, because the Jews are not slaves. Neither can it refer to the unsaved, for they are not the Lord's own purchased slaves. Formerly, Abraham circumcised his son and his purchased slaves according to God's covenant. Today our position is both as children reborn and as slaves purchased by the blood. The Lord wants us to serve Him as His slaves. There are two extreme views today in the church: one emphasizes works instead of faith; the other emphasizes faith instead of works.</P><P>"Delivered to them his possessions." Because the man was going to travel abroad, he delivered his possessions to his slaves that he might test them. A servant may be faithful while in the presence of his lord, but his faithfulness is genuine only when it is maintained in the absence of his lord. The man's delivering of his possessions to them indicated that he expected them to manage his possessions for him. The situation is the same today. We serve an invisible Lord who has delivered His possessions to us.</P><P>This parable is different from that in Luke 19:13, where it says, "Do business until I come." Here the Lord did not tell us specifically what to do. Rather, He wants us to seek His will and to accomplish it. Only those who are able to discern and accomplish His will are qualified for the reward. The real test lies in the fact that the slaves are not told what to do.</P><P>Verse 15:"To one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability. And he went abroad." What is a talent? It is usually said that a talent is property, position, power, time, life, personal attributes, a good mind, good health, position in the church, etc. However, a talent is a gift, not a natural ability. This is because (1) only Christians have talents; unbelievers do not. The Lord gave talents only to His slaves, and not to the slaves of others. (2) The talents were given according to ability and were not given carelessly. (3) The talents can be increased, or earned. (4) The talents can be taken away. (5) God did not give them to man in an ordinary way; the talents were given after the Lord's ascension. According to the above five points, we know that the talent is not, as one usually interprets, property or position. If it referred to position, then unbelievers would have talents also. If a talent meant an eldership, how then could an eldership be increased?</P><P>A talent refers to the gifts of the Holy Spirit. For (1) the gifts of the Holy Spirit are possessed only by the Lord (Acts 2:38); (2) they can be dispensed (Acts 19:6); (3) they can be increased (1 Cor. 14:12-13); and (4) they are given according to one's ability. Peter, for example, was a fisherman. He was therefore most gifted in "fishing." John's ability, on the other hand, lay in his net mending. (5) The gifts were given after the ascension, on the day of Pentecost (John 7:39; 16:7), and (6) the gift can be laid aside by us. This is why Paul charged Timothy, "for which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands" (2 Tim. 1:6). There is no doubt that talents are the gifts of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>"To one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one." The Lord mentioned only three slaves. "Three" represents all the believers, just as "seven" in "the seven churches" represents all the churches. (The church in Colossae also was in Asia, but it was not mentioned because it was already included in the seven.) These three slaves refer to three kinds of servants. They cannot denote three individual servants because the Lord would then have only three servants. Since this is a parable, we cannot interpret it in such a literal way. The believers, or slaves, are always given the gift of the Holy Spirit. No one can excuse himself by saying that he has no gift, because we all have at least one talent. Do not excuse yourself by saying that you have no gift. If you have no gift, you are not a child of God. Since all believers do have the gifts of the Holy Spirit, each will have to give an account of himself before the Lord in that day.</P><P>The Lord gives talents to His servants mainly according to their ability. Today too much attention is given to ability. Ability is not talent. We cannot do anything by ability alone. However, we should not take ability lightly. Ability determines the talents given. It is God who gives the ability, which in turn determines the talents. We ourselves cannot control how much ability we have. Therefore, the ones who received five and two talents should not feel proud and self-satisfied. Neither should the one who received one talent feel ashamed, disappointed, or envious. Their abilities and their gifts are all ordained by God. Today the tendency is for believers to prefer the greater ability over the smaller ability. This is fleshly activity. We must remember that grace is given by God for us to do His business. We need only to do His business according to the measure of God's gift. This will reduce division and strife in the church, for we understand that gifts vary according to ability.</P><P>It is important to notice that the Lord delivered His possessions to the slaves by Himself. He did not appoint someone else to do this on His behalf. Hence, the church should not ordain a pastor or trust in any theology, for pastors and theology cannot give gifts. A man has a gift only because he has received it from God, and not because he has received it from man. In these days people like to deliver possessions on behalf of the Lord (through the ordination). Rewards are not given because one has more talents, for the rewards were the same for the one who was given two talents as for the one who was given five talents. The one who received only one talent would have received the same reward if he had gained another talent. The phrase "and he went abroad" refers to ascension.</P><P>Verses 15-18:"To one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability. And he went abroad. Immediately he who had received the five talents went and traded with them and gained another five. Similarly, he who had received the two gained another two. But he who had received the one went off and dug in the earth and hid his master's money." This passage concerns the slaves' trading. They knew that the Lord's desire was that their talents should not lie idle. They knew that the Lord's desire was to see the increase of their talents, and that they should not hoard them in one place. If they would share the same heart as the Lord's, they would enjoy the Lord's happiness in the future. However, it is not easy to engage in trading. There are troubles, worries, risks, and hardships involved. The purpose of this parable is to direct our attention to the third slave. Most Christians are in this category. Receiving one talent is dangerous because those who receive one talent have the greatest tendency to become lazy or slothful and bury their talent. They often feel ashamed of having little, and they often bury their talent. However, the one-talented ones should try to gain another rather than bury the one talent. Some feel that it is better to have nothing than to have only a little. Yet the Lord says that a little is better than nothing at all. Actually knowing how to use your talent is more important than the number of talents you possess. The one who was given five talents was responsible for the five talents. The one who was given two talents was responsible for the two talents. Today believers are always dissatisfied with God's gifts. If you are willing to work only when you have the same gift as a certain brother or sister, God will never give you that gift. This parable focuses on the one who receives only one talent. One who cannot give a great message and save hundreds of people can still do a little for the Lord. It is cowardly to bury our talent. May we have such a heart that as He is willing to give a little, we will be willing to use a little.</P><P>The one talent was not put in a box or in the attic but was buried in the ground. The ground is a likely place to bury God's gift. When we are close to the ground, or the earthly things, it becomes easy to bury God's gift. We cannot magnify God's gift if we bury God's talent. It is impossible for a believer to preach the truth if he has just told crude jokes or spoken lewd words. He has lost his testimony. Therefore, let us stand firm in our position and make the best possible use of the gift we have received. We must not make friends with the world, lest our gift be buried. Bear in mind that the flesh always causes us to look down on the gift of God, and the world always causes us to fail to be a testimony of God.</P><P>"Immediately he who had received the five talents went and traded with them." Trade indicates flow and communication. It means to contact the unbelievers. We need to pray that God will make us one who flows and communicates with unbelievers. If we do not learn how to use our gift today, we will not be able to submit a good account to the Lord in the future. Eventually, we will not be able to use the gift in the kingdom.</P><P>Let us compare the parable of the talents with the parable of the ten virgins. The parable of the talents indicates the importance of using the gifts of the Holy Spirit, whereas the parable of the ten virgins shows the importance of being full of the Holy Spirit. Oil is for ourselves, and talents are for the Lord. Those who have talents should use them to serve God in building up the church; they should not use them for themselves. God will never give you a gift just for your own benefit. Therefore, the one who buries his gift will cause the Lord to suffer a loss. The oil is for life, and the talent is for work. Having the oil means to be filled with the Holy Spirit. You can make the best use of your gift only when you are full of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>Ability alone is of no use, because one who has ability cannot trade without capital. Therefore, believers need only God's gift, not theology or the laying on of hands.</P><P>The gifted one needs to be filled with the Spirit. It is most dangerous to have only talents but no oil. Therefore, the parable of the ten virgins is mentioned first. The Corinthians had many talents but no oil, and this led to much confusion. If there is only oil but no talents, there will be a proper living but not an effective work. Similarly, if there are only talents but no oil, there will be an effective work but not a proper living. Hence, we need to have both the oil and the talent, so that we can have an effective work as well as a proper living.</P><P>The parable of the ten virgins refers to the rapture, whereas the parable of the talents refers to the judgment seat of Christ and the kingdom. In order for the virgins to be raptured, they were required to be full of oil, the living of the Holy Spirit. In order for the slaves to share in the joy of the kingdom, they were required to work, which is to serve the Lord faithfully. These two parables are connected. To be filled with the Holy Spirit is similar to a balloon rising up yet being held by a rope. One day the rope will break, and then the balloon will be raptured.</P><P>If we serve faithfully, we will receive the reward in the kingdom. Today's work is to prepare us for our position in the kingdom. Comparatively, we are now working in a kindergarten. We will be much busier in our future work. All that we learn today will be applied in that day.</P><P>The Lord did not specifically tell his servants that they had to trade. However, they knew the desire of the Lord and therefore invested their talents. Unfortunately, our tendency is to expect someone to ask us, plead with us, pay us, or lay hands on us to ordain us. Otherwise, we prefer to bury our talents rather than invest them.</P><P>Verse 19:"Now after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them." Being tried takes time. "A long time" refers to the duration of the church age, which has been about two thousand years. It is very easy to forget the Lord's commission as the period of time is prolonged. It is easy to be zealous in the beginning, but as time goes by, we may gradually grow cold and lose our first love. Yet "after a long time" comes the time of judgment. This judgment will soon take place when we become cold. "The master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them." The Lord's second coming is a certainty. One can say that the Lord delayed His coming, but he cannot say that He will not come. Although the slave in Matthew 24:48 was evil, the most he could say was, "My master delays."</P><P>The failure of today's churches is that they do not realize that the Lord will come and reckon with them. Since the time we have believed in the Lord, whatever we have done or whatever we have not done will be reckoned with. However, this reckoning is not concerning our salvation. Our works (1 Cor. 3:10-15), our conversation, and our thoughts will all be displayed before the judgment seat of Christ. This is different from the great white throne of judgment, at which the scrolls will be read. At the judgment seat of Christ we ourselves will have to give the account (Rom. 14:12). We can pass through this judgment if our trespasses have been judged under the blood. Suppose we do not repent and our trespasses are not covered by the blood. Then these will be counted against us. May we learn to judge ourselves. If we are not judged by the blood today, we, the believers, will have to give account of everything. God will reckon with us concerning everything we do in this life. God is full of grace and love, as manifested in the redeeming blood. On the other hand, He is also holy and righteous, as will be manifested before the judgment seat. He cannot overlook our unholiness.</P><P>Before the judgment seat of Christ not only the things we have done, but also the things we have not done, will be judged. The things done in a blind way, as well as our quenching of the Holy Spirit, will be judged. "Now after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them. And he who had received the five talents came" (Matt. 25:19-20a). Both the Lord and the slaves came. The two met in the air, indicating the time when the believers will be raptured after the great tribulation (1 Thes. 4:17). The "came" in verse 19 refers to the Lord's descending from the heavens, and the "came" in verse 20 refers to the believers' being raptured into the air.</P><P>Verse 20:"And he who had received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, Master, you delivered to me five talents; behold, I have gained another five talents." He who brought another five talents came first. The "another five talents" indicates five other talents besides the five originally received in verse 16. At that time one will begin to sense the preciousness of gaining an extra "five talents" and will become anxious about not having brought another five talents. However, we do not need to wait until we are before the judgment seat to know if we will be receiving a reward or not. The reward is being decided right now. It all depends on how we deal with the gift that God delivers to us. Therefore, believers should not look down on the gift of the Holy Spirit, no matter how small the gift is. We do not gain our extra portion when we go before the judgment seat; we gain it while we are on earth. We have heard the Holy Spirit's speaking, so we must not harden our hearts (Heb. 3:7-8). We have to bring the original five talents together with the other five talents to the Lord. This shows that our work is for the Lord and not for ourselves. He who steals his master's possessions is certainly not a good slave. We should give glory only to God Himself.</P><P>Verse 21:"His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master." If we read only verse 20, it would seem that the reward depends solely on the gaining of other talents. However, we can see clearly in verse 21 that the reward is based primarily on being good and faithful. Therefore, we can all be good and faithful, whether we have received five talents, two talents, or only one talent. To be "good and faithful" does not refer to being a good Christian. It refers to being a good and faithful slave. The "other five talents" does not indicate success. It indicates the goodness and the faithfulness of the slave. Superficially, Stephen failed; but according to the spiritual fact, he accomplished a good and faithful work. That is why offering only a cup of cold water in the name of the Lord (Matt. 10:42) will be rewarded for faithfulness. To be faithful is simply to be wholly for the Lord. Those who are faithful will receive the reward. Even though we are working, we need to ask ourselves, "For whom are we working?" Many times our desire for success is merely to gain the other five talents, not knowing that all successes that are not according to the Lord are still wood, hay, and stubble. The Lord desires that we be faithful. "Well done" is the Lord's praise. We want only to hear the Lord say, "Well done." We endure and suffer because we look forward to this "well done." The Lord's "well done" is priceless. Actually, it is impossible to place a value on it, for our own estimation of our goodness may be faulty.</P><P>"You were faithful over a few things" (v. 21). "A few things" refers to the work of this age. This means that even with the five-talented one, there is not as much work for him today as there will be for him in the kingdom. The "many things" in verse 21 refers to the things of the kingdom. However, we often misunderstand and wrongly consider the Lord's work today to be too vast. The church can be compared to a school, and the believers, to the students who are learning in it. The believers will be dispatched after graduation into the future kingdom to apply what they have learned. Therefore, we can have a foretaste today of the authority of the coming age.</P><P>"Enter into the joy of your master" (v. 21). Compare this verse with Hebrews 12:2. Why is joy mentioned here, but not the kingdom? This is because the reward for faithfulness is inward satisfaction, not outward position. To rejoice with the Lord is the greatest reward, even better than the glory and position in the kingdom, for both we and the Lord are satisfied.</P><P>"I will set you over many things" (v. 21). The word "over" refers to authority. Today is the time to be faithful, and the future will be the time to take authority. Those who are eager to take authority today are just like the evil slave mentioned in chapter twenty-four. God cannot give authority to those who love authority; instead, God gives authority to those who desire to obey. To rule is a matter of the kingdom. On the one hand, we are joyful, and one the other hand, we have authority. The Lord will give us joy to fill up our suffering while yet on this earth. He will give us authority to fill up our losses while living in this world. One who is faithful will definitely bear losses. We cannot be the rich man while living and be Lazarus after our death (see Luke 16:19-26).</P><P>Verse 22-23:"And he who had received the two talents also came and said, Master, you delivered to me two talents; behold, I have gained another two talents. His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master." The words spoken to the one who received two talents are exactly the same as those spoken to the one who received five talents. Not even one word is different. Why the repetition? It is to show us that the Lord pays attention not to success and quantity but to faithfulness. Because of this, the reward given to the one who had received five talents is the same as the reward to the one who had received two talents, for they showed the same faithfulness. What the Lord requires is five talents from the one who received five talents, and two from the one who received two. The reward bears no relationship with the amount of the gift as long as one is faithful in service. One who invests his gift will never suffer loss. Our only responsibility to the Lord is to be faithful. Do not admire those who have more gifts, and do not spend time considering that you have lesser gifts. The amount of one's gift is determined by the Lord. The Lord requires more from those who receive more, and less from those who receive less. The Lord rewarded the one who had five talents not because he had five talents, but because he had been faithful. In the eyes of the worldly people, the difference between the first and the second servant is six talents. However, the spiritual mathematics is the same, 5/5 and 2/2. Any believer can receive the same reward. Even though we do not have a gift such as Paul had (our gift can never match his), our reward can be the same as his because we have the same opportunity to serve faithfully. Our hearts can receive the most comfort from the one who received the two talents, for our gift may be less than what others receive, yet our faithfulness should equal theirs.</P><P>Verse 24:"Then he who had received the one talent also came and said, Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow." Was the one who received the one talent saved or not? Surely he was saved. The reasons are: (1) If he were not saved, then everyone (including the unsaved) could receive a reward. (2) If he were not saved, the Lord would be telling us that there is no punishment for a Christian's failure. (3) This one was called the Lord's own slave and therefore had been redeemed by the blood. The Lord cannot choose an unsaved one to be His slave. The Holy Spirit could not use the wrong words. (4) How could the Lord deliver His possessions to the unsaved? (5) When this one received punishment, the Lord still called him a slave, albeit a useless one. Useless does not mean false. (6) He received judgment for his work, not for his believing or not believing. If he were not saved, how could the Lord judge his work? The Lord should then judge his contempt for the precious blood. If he could be counted as saved only after he gained an extra talent, then salvation would not be based on faith. (7) Who were those who were judged with him at the same time? They were the saved who received the reward. Can an unsaved one be judged at the same time as a saved one? No, all those who are judged at the judgment seat of Christ must be saved. (8) If he were not a saved one, the Lord could not rebuke him concerning his unfaithfulness, or for not taking his talent to do the Lord's business, or for not using his gift. The Lord cannot rebuke the unsaved ones for not preaching the gospel. The Lord prefers that they not preach. The deeper they bury their service, the better. (9) The Lord's coming refers to His descending. The slave's coming refers to his being raptured to the air. Can the raptured ones be unsaved? (10) The Lord's judgment is based on the matter of faithfulness, not on the matter of believing. Can the Lord ask the unsaved to be faithful? (11) The Lord did not send anyone to bring him. It was he himself who came forth. He was not afraid to show up before the Lord. An unbeliever will not dare to see the Lord. He would rather have the rocks fall on him. He did not lose even one dollar of the Lord's money. He made his own living and considered that he deserved merit and was without fault. (12) This parable is identical with the one in Luke 19. In Luke the unfaithful slave is clearly distinct from the unbelievers, and there is no confusion.</P><P>Someone may ask why he was cast into outer darkness. Is this not hell? If it means hell, the "darkness" should be changed to the "lake of fire," which will come after the millennium, whereas this event takes place before the millennium.</P><P>Verses 24-25:"Then he who had received the one talent also came and said, Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow. And I was afraid and went off and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what is yours." This does not mean that anyone dares to speak in this way. Here, the Lord was trying to reveal man's hidden intentions. "Hard" means strict. Therefore, he was afraid. He failed because he did not know the Lord and His grace. He thought that the Lord was too strict, and he himself was still under Mount Sinai. Hence, we should not be afraid in the age of grace. The Lord is responsible for success or failure, but we are responsible for being faithful.</P><P>Verse 26:"And his master answered and said to him, Evil and slothful slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not winnow." If our Lord reaps where He has not sown and gathers where he has not winnowed, then what about that which has already been sowed and winnowed? The Lord surely would require of us. We have no ground for argument before His judgment seat. This was wholly due to the slave's laziness. Moody said that no lazy person can be saved. It is certain that no lazy person can receive a reward. A believer will probably receive judgment not only for wrongdoing, but also for not doing. Do not think that because your gift is so small, you would rather not use it. Do not wait until you have time to serve. The same principle applies when we persuade a person to believe in the Lord. We ask him to believe at once and not to wait until he has more time.</P><P>Verse 27:"Therefore you should have deposited my money with the money changers; and when I came, I would have recovered what is mine with interest." The phrase "deposited my money with the money changers" indicates that the gift can be distributed to others. To trade means nothing other than contacting more people. To deposit "with the money changers" means to have communication with a few or even only one. He should not have buried his gift and refrained from passing it along to at least one other person. Although he received a lesser gift than the others, he should have at least tried to use it a little bit. Why did he not save even one person, help even one person, or comfort even one person? We are not responsible for the success of our work, but it is a pity if we have not helped even one person to be saved. At the least we should save one person.</P><P>Verse 28:"Take away therefore the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents." The third slave received two punishments: the talent being taken away and him being cast out. The faithful slaves received two rewards: joy and authority. "Give it to him who has the ten talents." This proves that our Lord is not a hard man, for He did not reserve the one talent for Himself, but gave it to the one who had ten talents.</P><P>Verse 29:"For to every one who has, more shall be given, and he shall abound; but from him who does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away from him." This is the principle. "Has" and "does not have" both refer to having and not having today. The one who has today will experience increase and even abundance in the future, for he may be promoted to take care of even more things. There is more opportunity to exercise gifts in the kingdom. But for the one who does not pay serious attention to using his gift, the gift that he has will be taken away.</P><P>Verse 30:"And cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth." To be "cast...into the outer darkness" is the second punishment given to the third slave. The outer darkness is not absolute but relative. If we want to know what "the outer darkness" indicates, we need to understand at what time the Lord will say this. The Lord will say this when He descends and the saints are caught up to the air to be judged before the judgment seat of Christ. Therefore, "the outer darkness" refers to the outer part of the air. The New Testament never mentions that hell is the outer darkness. Hell has no darkness, but rather fire. However, there will be darkness around the Lord when He comes down, yet glory inside, as depicted by Psalm 18:9-11, which refers to His coming down (parousia). "Weeping" refers to the slave's regretting that he missed the opportunity to use his one talent wisely. "Gnashing" refers to grieving over the loss suffered, especially through his neglect in preaching the gospel. He will not pass through the punishment of fire, but he will not receive authority and joy.</P><P>There are three things here that are interrelated. They are the blood, the cross, and the judgment seat of Christ. Even though there are no apparent verses dealing with this relationship, it is a fact borne out in our life and experience that cannot be denied. Among the three, the cross of Christ is the center. The judgment seat of Christ is in the future, while the blood and the cross are in the past. However, the blood is on the side opposite the judgment seat. Those who miss the blood and the cross-those who have not been dealt with by the blood and the cross-will not miss the judgment seat of Christ. If one misses the cross, he must at least pass through the blood. The believer must pass through both the blood and the cross in order to have peace before the judgment seat of Christ. The blood is objective, for cleansing, redemption, and remission of sins, whereas the cross is subjective, to crucify sin, the old man, the world, and the old creation.</P><P>Our failure affects two parties: God and ourselves. Man can be washed clean and recover his fellowship with God by the blood alone if he has committed sins and broken his fellowship with God. The blood deals with sins, and the cross deals with the power of sin, which can never be washed away. The blood can forgive the sins but cannot keep one from committing the sins again. The soul, the world, and the flesh all need the dealing of the cross. The blood brings in forgiveness, but the cross brings in deliverance.</P><P>We can come forward boldly to the judgment seat only if we have passed under the blood and if we have been placed upon the cross. Before His judgment seat, the Lord will judge our gossip, our intentions, our work, and the works we have left undone. However, the failures that have become facts have to be put under the blood. Although the light is severe at the judgment seat, it cannot reveal the sins that are under the blood. How can we deal with a gossiping tongue? This requires the cross. We must receive the cross by faith and must acknowledge that the old man has been crucified on the cross. The judgment seat cannot search the cross for things to judge. After being washed by the blood, we must still come back to the cross. Otherwise, there is the possibility of repeating the offense, and we still could be rebuked before the judgment seat of Christ.</P><P>Verses 31-46 give the parable of the sheep and the goats. This parable refers to the Gentiles. According to the Scriptures there are three categories of people: the Jews, the church, and the Gentiles. Since in chapters twenty-four and twenty-five the Jews and the church have been covered, this portion describes the prophecy concerning the Gentiles at the end of time.</P><P>However, presently there are two interpretations regarding this parable: (1) that it refers to the future universal judgment at the end time, and (2) that it refers to the judgment of Christians. Both interpretations are wrong.</P><P>(1) This judgment does not refer to a future universal judgment at the end time.</P><P>(a) Suppose this refers to a universal judgment in the future. Such a judgment would necessitate the inclusion of the Jews, the church, and the Gentiles, regardless of whether they are dead or living. Today there is a great fallacy in the church which asserts that there is to be a universal judgment. Actually, no such thing is mentioned in the Scriptures at all. Instead, the Scriptures distinctly separate the judgment on the church from that on the Jews and that on the Gentiles. Based on this parable, many say that salvation can be ascertained only at the judgment seat. They hope that after they die or sometime in the future they will be saved. In this way, the church today is made merely a place where salvation is hoped for. If indeed there is a universal judgment, we will not possibly know whether or not we are now saved.</P><P>(b) Let us see who those are who are under the judgment. "And all the nations" in verse 32 should be rendered "the people of all the nations, the Gentiles," or "the aliens of all the nations." Therefore, those who will be judged are clearly the Gentiles. The same word was used in Matthew 4:15; 6:32; 10:5, 18; 12:18; 20:19, 25. In the Greek language, this word includes all the Gentiles. See also Romans 15:11 and Acts 15:17.</P><P>(c) Again consider the time of the judgment. It is before the millennium (v. 34). In Revelation 20:11-15 there is yet another judgment, at the white throne. Therefore, we are certain that there cannot be one universal judgment.</P><P>(d) Then, consider the place of the judgment. The Lord is sitting upon the throne of glory. In Revelation 3:21 there are two thrones, one of the Son and the other of the Father. Today the Lord is sitting on the throne of the Father. In the future He will be sitting on His own throne. Matthew 25:31 refers to His own throne, the throne of the kingdom; it is on earth. Suppose the people of all the nations in verse 32 were not on the earth but in the air. How then can these people be divided into nations? Where are the boundaries for all the nations? The nations' boundaries exist only on earth. If the judgment is not on earth, those who are to be judged must have been raptured. This will mean that a portion of those who are raptured are the unsaved ones.</P><P>(e) All the judged are living persons, and there is no dead person. In the Scriptures there are only two occasions of resurrection, and they are separated by a span of a thousand years. In the first resurrection there are no unsaved ones. Here, the goats are those set for perdition. They, therefore, cannot be in the first resurrection. Thus, this judgment does not concern Christians.</P><P>(f) Satan has not yet been cast into the lake of fire. The words "prepared for the devil" in verse 41 are a proof of this. Prepared means that it has not happened yet. If the judgment spoken of here is the judgment at the white throne, then Satan should have been cast into the lake of fire long before.</P><P>(g) The Son of Man is the Lord's name in the kingdom. After a thousand years this kingdom will become the kingdom of God (1 Cor. 15:24).</P><P>(h) The prophecy needs to coincide with other portions of the Scriptures. Elsewhere the Scriptures clearly describe that there are several judgments.</P><P>(2) This judgment does not pertain to the church. Some consider sheep as referring always to Christians (John 10). However, the same is not true here, for the following reasons:</P><P>(a) The people of "all the nations," who are the Gentiles, would then be participating in the judgment of the people in the church. According to John 12:48, these people have never received the word of the Lord, and they do not know the Lord.</P><P>(b) This judgment will not be according to the laws of Moses nor according to faith, but according to their deeds. Hence, they are neither the Jews nor the church.</P><P>(c) The church was chosen before the foundation of the world, but they were chosen from the foundation of the world.</P><P>(d) They do not even know when they serve a little brother. Suppose these are Christians. How can they not know the Lord? A Christian clearly serves the little brother for the Lord's sake. The Jews give alms, knowing that it is for Jehovah's sake. But these people here simply do not know what they are doing. Even the slothful servant knows, as does the evil servant (Matt. 25:24; 24:48). John 14:19-20 says that the church knows the Lord.</P><P>(e) The judgment for us Christians is not on the earth but rather in the air.</P><P>(f) This judgment is not the first resurrection, because there are unsaved ones here.</P><P>(g) This judgment is for eternal life and eternal death. This kind of judgment has long been resolved for the Christians.</P><P>(h) The saved ones and the unsaved ones cannot be put together in one place.</P><P>(i) Whoever the little brother is, he must be different from the sheep and the goats. The little brother is a believer of the Lord-one who has already been judged. Undoubtedly, he is a Christian. (He is not a Jew, since the relationship of brotherhood between the Lord and the Jews has already been severed-Matt. 12:46-50; see also the text below.) If the sheep are the Christians, there will not be a clear distinction between them and the goats.</P><P>(j) Christians know clearly who are the children who love God; but these people do not.</P><P>(k) If they are Christians, then the salvation of a Christian is not by faith but by the good treatment of a little brother.</P><P>(l) If a man is saved by giving food, providing shelter, supplying medicine, and visiting prisoners, then there will be no opportunity for the little brother to be saved, for while he is in prison, he has no possibility of carrying out these good deeds.</P><P>The parable of the sheep and the goats can be divided into four main sections: (1) the gathering of the sheep and the goats (vv. 31-33), (2) the dialogue with the sheep (vv. 34-40), (3) the dialogue with the goats (vv. 41-45) and (4) the conclusion (v. 46).</P><P>The first section: the gathering of the sheep and the goats.</P><P>Verse 31:"But when the Son of Man comes in His glory and all the angels with Him, at that time He will sit on the throne of His glory." The names of the Lord in chapter twenty-five are all meaningful. The Bridegroom is in relation to the virgins, the Lord is in relation to His slaves, and the Son of Man is in relation to the Gentiles; all of these describe a relationship with man. Strictly, verses 31-46 cannot be regarded as a parable, since the phrase "like unto" is not used here. These verses are real facts. For this reason "the Son of Man" is used. This name has the meaning of judgment. In John 5:25 and 27 the Son of God gives resurrection, indicating a relationship with the church, but the Son of Man executes judgment, indicating a relationship with the Gentiles. The Son of Man is also related to the kingdom. In Daniel 7:13-14, when the Lord comes to establish the kingdom, He must first judge the world. Those who pass the judgment will be the citizens in the kingdom. If we are to be kings, we must have citizens. Without citizens, there can be no kingdom.</P><P>"Comes in His glory and all the angels with Him." The glory of the Lord includes the glory of His divine person, the glory of His morality, the glory of His humanity, and the glory that was given to Him by God (Phil. 2:6-11). Here the glory refers to the exaltation given to Him by man. This glory was attained by the Lord in His obedience unto death. The kingdom is a reward from God. The glory here is not the eternal glory, which every Christian has. The glory of the kingdom is attained only by those who have gone through suffering (Heb. 2:9).</P><P>The scene described here is the same as that mentioned in Matthew 24:30. Therefore, the judgment here should follow immediately that in Matthew 24:30. "All the angels with Him" is for the gathering of all peoples. These Gentiles have not followed Antichrist, for those who followed him will have been slaughtered by the Lord with the sword of His mouth already. They are not believers in the Lord, nor are they followers of Antichrist (cf. Matt. 13:41).</P><P>"The throne of His glory." Today there is the throne of grace. Before this throne of grace we can receive timely help (Heb. 4:16). In that day it will be a throne of glory, of holiness, and of immediate judgment. Glory leads to holiness, holiness leads to righteousness, and righteousness leads to judgment.</P><P>The throne is on the earth, even in Jerusalem. The throne of God is in heaven (Matt. 5:34). Today the Son is sitting on the Father's throne (Rev. 3:21). That the throne is in Jerusalem is evident from Luke 1:32-33. The throne of David is in Jerusalem. The throne of the Lord is simply the throne of David. The throne of the Lord's glory is described in Matthew 19:28.</P><P>In verse 31 the first "glory" is initial at the time of His coming, whereas the second "glory" is perpetual.</P><P>Verse 32:"And all the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats." "All the nations" refers to all Gentile people. "Gathered" should be rendered "summoned." Who are these Gentile people? There will be two judgments for all the Gentiles who will be alive. The first will be for the group who follow Antichrist. They will be slaughtered at Jerusalem by the sword in the Lord's mouth. Those referred to here have not followed Antichrist. They constitute the majority. The judgment for the Gentiles who follow Antichrist is seen in Micah 4:11-13; Zephaniah 3:8; Zechariah 12:9; Revelation 16:14, 19; and Joel 3:12. They will be instigated by Antichrist to destroy Israel, and in turn will be destroyed by the Lord at His coming.</P><P>"He will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats." This is a small parable within this passage in verses 31-46. In the Scriptures there are three kinds of sheep: (1) the believers in the church (John 10:1-18), (2) the Jews (Psa. 80:1; Jer. 23:1-4; 31:10), and (3) the Gentiles (Ezek. 34:11-16 refers to the Jews; vv. 17-19, to the Gentiles; vv. 20-22, to the Gentiles again. In Psalm 100:1-3 "all ye lands" refers to the Gentiles. Furthermore, we have the parable of the lost sheep.) Hence, sheep do not necessarily refer to Christians. It will not be possible for any separation to occur in heaven or in hell. Separation is needed only on earth. First there is separation; then comes the judgment. The verdict is first announced, and then the judgment executed. This judgment is not based on works (as is the case of the white throne), but is based on nature. Sheep are by nature sheep, and goats are by nature goats.</P><P>Verse 33:"And He will set the sheep on His right hand and the goats on the left." The "right hand" refers to a position of glory. After the Lord was glorified, He ascended to the right hand of the Father.</P><P>The second section: the dialogue with the sheep.</P><P>Verse 34:"Then the King will say to those on His right hand, Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." The Lord is the King of the Gentiles, and the Head and the Bridegroom to the church. But the Lord is also the King of the Gentiles and of the Jews. This implies that He will exercise the Jewish authority in dealing with the Gentiles. When the Lord becomes the King of the Gentiles, the age of the Gentiles will be over. Today, the Jews are lowly among the nations; but a time will come when the Jews will be raised up and the Gentiles will be subdued by them.</P><P>"You who are blessed of My Father." Here it says, "My Father" and not "our Father." The Scripture seldom uses the term "our Father." John 20 is an exception. "My Father" implies that they, having no relationship with the Lord, are not Christians. Obviously, the Lord cannot speak of "our Father," because these people do not know the Lord.</P><P>"Blessed." This is the blessing on earth. The blessing for the church is heavenly. Hence, verse 31 does not have the expression "the kingdom of the heavens is like" because this takes place on earth.</P><P>The future kingdom of the heavens has three different realms: (1) The earthly kingdom; this is simply the original blessing given to Adam for ruling over all things-the earth then worked for men to replenish and multiply. After man's fall, such a blessing was lost. For this reason the Lord said, "From the foundation of the world." Today we are afraid of being hurt by animals, but in that day there will be no need for such fear. (2) The kingdom of the Jews; its sphere is the land of Canaan, which extends from the Nile to the river Euphrates (Gen. 17:6-8). Although the sphere is in the land of Canaan, the sovereignty extends beyond the kingdom (cf. Gen. 17:16, a mother of nations, kings (plural) of people shall be of her; Isa. 60:12; and Deut. 15:6, the Gentile nations shall be subdued by the Jews). (3) The heavenly kingdom (1 Cor. 15:50-52); all will be changed to inherit the kingdom of God. This implies that this is a kingdom in the spiritual realm. Both the heirs of God in Romans 8:17 and the kingdom in Matthew 25:34 refer to the first kind. In that kingdom, the snake and the lion hurt no more.</P><P>Verses 35-36: "For I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me a drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in, naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me." The difference between the sheep and the goats lies here. The reason that the sheep can receive the kingdom is because they gave food, gave hospitality, provided clothes, and visited the sick and those in prison, or performed similar good deeds. At the judgment seat the believers will be judged by their faithfulness, and the Jews by whether they worship the beast or not. The Gentiles will be judged at the white throne according to the book of life and the scrolls. Therefore, the Gentiles described here are different from the Gentiles in general because these are still living at the time of the Lord's coming. The judgment for them is based on the way they treat the Lord, that is, the way they treat the little brothers of the Lord. However, this does not include all the Gentiles who treat the Lord's little brothers well.</P><P>Verses 37-40: "Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, Lord, when have we seen You hungry and have fed You, or thirsty and have given You a drink? And when have we seen You a stranger and have taken You in, or naked and have clothed You? And when have we seen You sick or in prison and have come to You? And the King will answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you have done it to one of these, the least of My brothers, you have done it to Me." "One of these, the least of My brothers" should be rendered "the last of the brothers." Who are they? The Lord has three kinds of brothers: (1) the Jews (Acts 7:23-26; Rom. 9:3; Deut. 17:15); (2) His brothers in the flesh (Matt. 12:46-48; 13:55); and (3) the believers (Matt. 12:48-50). The little brothers referred to in Matthew 25:40 do not belong to categories (1) and (2), for the Lord clearly annulled those relationships in Matthew 12. Therefore, "the last...brothers" mentioned here refer to believers who have passed through the tribulation. How then are they called the last of the brothers? They are called such because they became so after their resurrection. A little brother is most blessed. Benjamin received a double portion. The Lord is one with these little brothers because to do anything to them is to do it "unto Me." Today by believing in the Lord, we become one with Him. This is why when Saul persecuted the saints, it was said that he was persecuting the Lord (Acts 9:5).</P><P>The overcomers will be caught up first. Those remaining, the majority of the believers, will pass through the tribulation and will be persecuted everywhere. The sheep will hear the eternal gospel preached to them by the angels (Rev. 14:6-7), a gospel that will exhort them to fear God and not to worship the idols. Consequently, they will not follow the current of their age in persecuting the Christians and in worshipping idols; rather, they will fear God. The Christians will then be sojourners, and these people will treat them well. All of their deeds will be done during the tribulation and will be different from those done at ordinary times. To do those deeds then will not be easy. This judgment will be based on their deeds in their bodies and not according to matters related to their spirit. Therefore, it is evident that they are not Christians. These people must be those living within the realm of material things.</P><P>The righteous are astonished. The Lord recognizes their astonishment. This shows that their good works are not done for the Lord's sake. Hence, it is clear that they are not Christians. When we treat a brother well, we are aware of it (Mark 9:41). Likewise, the Jews know that the Lord is the Lord, for after the tribulation they will all look upon the One whom they have pierced (Zech. 12:10).</P><P>The third section: the dialogue with the goats.</P><P>Verses 41-45:"Then He will say also to those on the left, Go away from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you did not give Me anything to eat; I was thirsty and you did not give Me a drink; I was a stranger and you did not take Me in; naked and you did not clothe Me; sick and in prison, and you did not visit Me. Then they also will answer, saying, Lord, when have we seen You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to You? Then He will answer them, saying, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, neither have you done it to Me." The evil ones are punished solely on the ground that they did not treat the Christians well. To treat the Christians well during the time of tribulation is not an easy matter. Therefore, the Lord will reward the sheep for their good work.</P><P>The fourth section: the conclusion.</P><P>Verse 46:"And these shall go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life." That the evil shall go into eternal punishment is unquestionable. However, are the righteous saved? Yes. However, they do not receive eternal life but rather shall "go...into" eternal life. Eternal life enters into the believers, whereas the righteous here will enter into eternal life. These two are different: one enters into the kingdom; the other receives the kingdom. God gave the kingdom to Adam, whereas the believers are given by the Father to Christ. No one can pluck these ones that are chosen by the Father out of His hand.</P><P>The "cursed" in verse 41 are not cursed by God, for God never predestinates man to perdition.</P><P>The righteous are declared such by the Lord. They are not justified by man or by themselves. As such, they are saved. "Eternal punishment" here is in contrast to "eternal life." From this we know that these are saved.</P><P>These are recovered to the standing of Adam. In the Old Testament there are evidences to show that men inherited land because of righteousness (Psa. 37:10-11, 22-23, 26-29, 34; Gen. 12:2; 27:28; Num. 24:5, 9).</P><P>The most comforting fact is that even though the believers may pass through the great tribulation, the Lord will still remember them and send angels to preach the eternal gospel. The lesson we must learn here is that we need to be careful in dealing with a brother who is suffering. Although the Lord allows him to suffer, we need to help him. We should not be like the friends of Job. The Lord is one with His believers. Even when they are in prison, the Lord is still with them.</P></body></html>
