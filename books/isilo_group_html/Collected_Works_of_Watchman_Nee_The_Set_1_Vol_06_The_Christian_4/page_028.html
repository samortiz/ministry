This verse is the word of Jesus Christ Himself. "Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it" (Matt. 7:13). Here, this seems to show us a place called "destruction." There is a wide gate to enter this place. Beyond the gate, there is a broad way. On the way, countless people are running toward that place. They behave as though they are on an express train. Since the way is broad, it is easy to walk on it. Since the gate is wide, everything can be brought through it. But this way and gate lead to the place of destruction!</P><P>The meaning of destruction is perdition. The place of destruction is the place of perdition. The place of perdition is hell. The Lord Jesus states that the gate of hell is wide and the way to hell is broad, and many are those who go down to hell. It is possible that you are one of them! Listen! Do not think that hell has no gate. There is a gate to hell. Do not think that there is no way to hell. The way to hell is broader than any highway or street in the world. There are many ways to hell; there is not just one way. If a man wants to go to hell, there are many ways that he can take. Although there are many ways, there is only one destination. Although the starting point may be different, the destination of each way is the same. Although the ways may come from different directions, they all merge in one direction. Although the people taking a way may be different, their end, hell, is the same. Although the way you take may be different from that of another, the place you and the others are going to is the same! No matter which way you take, it is dangerous if the way leads toward hell.</P><P>Today there are at least a thousand people sitting here. [Editor's note: This message was a sermon given at a gospel meeting.] I do not know what you are thinking about. I could never guess the thoughts in your minds. But in observing your daily walk and your attitude towards the Lord Jesus Christ, I reckon that all of you want to go to hell, want to perish, and want to go into perdition. You want to go into eternal pain and darkness, with the gnashing of teeth and with Satan in the lake of fire. If this were not true, your conduct would not be so unseemly, and you would not be so cold toward the Lord Jesus and toward His grace. This is why I believe you want to go to hell! Perhaps you have already made up your mind to go to hell! Do you realize that the Bible mentions quite a number of ways to go to hell? Today I will tell you about five ways to go to hell. Those who want to go to hell can practice accordingly. I can guarantee them that they will surely end up in hell! This will serve to tell those who do not want to go to hell about the way to escape. Oh, how I wish that you would not have to go to hell. But if you really do want to go to hell, who can change you?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The First Way to Hell:<br>Suicide</H2><P>Suicide is a quick way to hell. There is no way to hell faster than suicide. Let us read a verse: "Judas turned aside to go to his own place" (Acts 1:25). Judas never believed in Jesus Christ. Although he pretended to be the Lord's disciple outwardly, he was in fact a son of perdition; he had never received salvation. When he died, he went to his own place. What is his own place? It is the place of perdition and destruction, hell. When Judas died, he went to hell. In what way did he go to hell? He committed suicide. He hung himself.</P><P>If you want to go to hell, suicide is a convenient way. A razor blade, a rope, or a glass of poison can send your soul to the place of eternal suffering quickly! Hell should be far away from you. You may have to spend a few years or decades before you can go to hell. Yet if you commit suicide, you will shorten your life on earth and hasten your approach to the place of eternal perdition. Once an unbelieving master asked a believing chauffeur what was the fastest way to go to hell. At that time the car was cruising along the highway. The chauffeur opened the door of the car and told his master, "If you jump out now, you will be there right away." If you have not believed in the Lord, your fall and death will bring you right to hell! Indeed, the easiest way for a man to go to hell is to kill himself. If you want to go to hell in a few hours, just buy a big dose of opium and swallow it, and you will surely arrive at your destination. If you want to go to hell in a few minutes, just take a dose of arsenic, and you will arrive at your destination also. If you think that this is too slow, and you want to go to hell in one minute, you can take a pistol and shoot yourself in the head. You will surely go to hell this way. There are other ways. You can starve yourself to death. You can jump into the ocean. You can lie on the railroad tracks and let a train cut you in half. Those who commit suicide will go to hell. Therefore, those who want to go to hell can commit suicide.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 06: The Christian (4) &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
