Lord, we confess that our eyes are blind; we do not see clearly enough. We know about things, but we do not know Christ. Our Lord seems so far away from us. The things seem so real to us, while Christ does not seem real to us. Lord, we pray that You would open our eyes so that Christ would become real to us, so that the things will pass away and life will fill us. Lord, we pray for deliverance from the many things, so that we can know the Lord as a person. May the Lord who is our person become our things so that everything in us becomes living and full of life, and so that others would see Christ when they see the things. Lord, we know that these two ways are entirely different. How different is the sinner's way from the way of the righteous. In the same manner, how different is the way of a genuine Christian from that of a false Christian. Many things need to be broken. You have to break us. Do not allow us to deceive ourselves, to think that we have seen it when we have not seen it, to think that we have touched the right way when we really have not touched it, to think that we are full of life when we are full of behavior, and to think that we are full of Christ when we are full of things. Lord, touch us. Lord, build up Yourself in us in a powerful way so that everything within and without us is just Christ, just Yourself.</p><p>Lord, bless these words so that they would bear fruit and would bring men back to Yourself in a rich way. May You utter what man cannot utter. May You cover man's weakness and forgive man's foolishness. May You gain something among us. We need to be laid bare. May tonight be the night when many are laid bare, when they see themselves as You see them. May a little light enter us, and may it shine through all falsehood and all performance so that we would see the replacements and everything that is not You. Bless Your own word, and glorify Your name. In the name of the Lord Jesus, amen.</p><p>Watchman Nee</p><h2 class="head1">THE FILLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />AND THE COUNTERFEIT OF EVIL SPIRITS</h2><p>"Abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all intelligence, that ye may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent, in order that ye may be pure" (Phil. 1:9-10, Darby).</p><h2 class="head2">The Baptism or Filling of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>God's Spirit enters into man's spirit so that man's spirit might be released and freed from the soul (Heb. 4:12). The human spirit becomes a submissive organ or the channel from which the Holy Spirit flows forth. When we testify for Christ or pray to attack the authority of darkness, the Spirit is manifested.</p><p>This is the true baptism into the Body of Christ and the oneness of the members of the Body. The particular result of such baptism is the power to testify for Christ and to cause people to know their sins and turn to God.</p><p>The highest expression of the filling of the Holy Spirit is the ability to use all the functions of the soul while simultaneously controlling oneself.</p><p>We only receive the Holy Spirit once, but by renewing our faith or recognizing the truth, we can experience the filling several times. Sometimes it is in growth, at other times it is in a new turn. Since conditions among the believers are different, the same filling of the Holy Spirit can be in different degrees of fullness. After being filled, we receive power for the work, and it is truly our experience.</p><h2 class="head2">The Counterfeit of Satan</h2><p>If a believer is loose in his mind to the point of being "blank" or if he allows his body to come under the sway of supernatural forces, the counterfeit work of evil spirits may accompany the genuine filling of the Holy Spirit. A "blank mind" and "passive body" contradict the requirements necessary for the work of the Holy Spirit. On the contrary, they are the principal requirements necessary for the work of evil spirits. The Holy Spirit fills man's spirit by the law of faith, while the supernatural power of the evil spirits enter man by the law of an empty mind and a passive body. Just like when the Holy Spirit enters the human spirit, the evil spirits can produce all kinds of manifestations to human senses.</p><p>The result of the counterfeit differs according to the condition of the person receiving it. The outward expression is always great, but there is no real fruit. The degree to which the evil spirits possess a person's mind and body differs as well. Some people like to cause divisions and are not willing to be one because of being possessed by evil spirits.
