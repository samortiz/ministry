   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ Being Magnified</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>in Our Body</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ should also be magnified in our body Phil 1:20b .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This should even affect the way that we dress and comb our hair.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Does the way that we dress and comb our hair magnify Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ needs to be magnified, exalted, and extolled in us in every way and in every circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ Being Formed in Us</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ has to be formed in us Gal 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that we have to let Christ occupy every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ should occupy our mind, our thinking, our consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ should occupy our emotion, our love, our hatred, our happiness, our sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ has to occupy our will.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He should be in all the decisions that we make.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He also needs to fully occupy our conscience in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For Christ to occupy us in this way means that He is making His home in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Ephesians Paul prayed that Christ might make His home in our hearts 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then in Galatians 4:19 he expressed his desire for Christ to be formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ grown in us in full.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is invading our mind, our emotion, our will, and our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is invading our entire inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, through our soul, He will even invade our body, saturating us with Himself and dispensing Himself into our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His invading is His saturating, and His saturating is His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, we will be fully and thoroughly permeated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He will be formed in us, and we will be conformed to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Growing Up into Christ, the Head,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>in All Things with the Growth of God</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We also need to grow up into Christ, the Head, in all things with the growth of God Eph 4:15b; Col 2:19b .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Maybe the way that we cut or style our hair is still outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that we have to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we grow further, we will grow up into Christ in the way that we cut our hair.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To grow we need some element added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to grow up into Christ in all things with the growth of God, which is the increase of God, the addition of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is revealed in Colossians 2:19.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is spreading Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When He is spreading in us, He grows in us, and He is adding Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With this element of God, we grow.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is not a matter of following ethical teachings in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is altogether something organic.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have the organic God within us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is growing in us, adding Himself to us, and invading us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to grow up into Christ in everything, we must be very careful and considerate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since we realize that we have Christ living in us as our life, we have to walk carefully with much consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before some of us were married, we lived in whatever way we pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But now that we are married, we have to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to walk carefully with much consideration of the one with whom we live.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to apply this principle to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Before we were saved, we may have been wild or quick.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now that we have Christ living in us, we should not be that wild or that quick.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because we fail so much by not living Christ, I am so thankful that Christ is our washing, cleansing fountain Zech 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is why we need to confess our sins throughout the day to enjoy the cleansing of the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should confess that we are still in the flesh, still in the old creation, and still in the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because we are so rough, we do not consider Christ much of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We do not walk carefully and slowly, with much consideration of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must learn to walk and have our being in Christ slowly, carefully, and with much consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to live Christ in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to live carefully all the time, with much consideration of Christ.</S>
