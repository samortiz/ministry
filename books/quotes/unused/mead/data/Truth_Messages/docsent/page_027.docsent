   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE ONE IN THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND IN HIS EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed that we would be one in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This concept is deep and profound, far beyond our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 23 the Lord said, I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a word surpasses our comprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, if we consider the type of the tabernacle in Exodus 26, we shall find it much easier to grasp the meaning of the Lord s prayer for oneness in John 17.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A PICTURE OF OUR ONENESS IN THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nearly all the spiritual realities in the New Testament are abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, for most of the spiritual realities there are types or pictures in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Exodus 26 we have a picture of the oneness in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The standing boards of the tabernacle make up a corporate structure.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The ark inside the tabernacle was an individual item, but the tabernacle was a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The ark typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, the same materials used in making the ark were also used for the standing boards.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Both the ark and the boards were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There was a total of forty-eight boards.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When these boards were put together, they composed God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be sure, God s dwelling place is a corporate matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, in the tabernacle with the forty-eight standing boards we see a picture of real oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to become one entity as God s dwelling place, the forty-eight boards had to be brought into oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They were one, not in the acacia wood, but in the gold that overlaid the wood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The ark is a type of Christ with His two natures: the human nature typified by the acacia wood and the divine nature signified by the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have pointed out that these materials were also used in making the boards for the building of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the gold had been taken away from the standing boards, leaving only the acacia wood, the boards would immediately have fallen down.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even if they had remained upright, standing side by side, they would still not have been one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, they would have been forty-eight separate, individual boards.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Their oneness was not in the acacia wood; it was in the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This clearly portrays the fact that our oneness is not in humanity, but in divinity, in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the divine nature were taken away from us, we would immediately become detached from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although we might still love one another and even embrace one another, we nevertheless would not be one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The oneness of the standing boards of the tabernacle, or this oneness in the gold, symbolizes our oneness in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>ONE IN THE GLORY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The gold was not only the oneness of the standing boards; it was also their glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By being overlaid with gold, the standing boards bore the glory of the gold, for the shining of the gold was their glory, their expression.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Anyone who entered into the tabernacle could see on every hand the shining of the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, the oneness of the forty-eight boards was not only in the gold, signifying God, but also in the shining of the gold, signifying the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the same principle, our oneness today is in the Triune God and in His glory, His shining.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE WOOD AND THE GOLD</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all have been saved, washed in the Lord s precious blood, forgiven of our sins, reconciled to God, and regenerated with the life of God by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that we are genuine Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let me now ask you this question: As one who has both the human nature and the divine nature, are you wood with gold in it, or are you wood overlaid with gold?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In other words, with you, is the gold in the wood, or is the wood in the gold?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you simply have gold in the wood, you are finished with the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you say that you are wood in the gold, I would then ask you another question: What do others see when they come in contact with you, wood or gold?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And if others see gold upon you, how much gold do they see?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How much have you been overlaid with gold?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yes, we are wooden boards in the gold, but how much gold do we have upon us?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a crucial question.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE NEED FOR A WEIGHTY LAYER OF GOLD</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Each standing board of the tabernacle was ten cubits high and one and a half cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means its dimensions were fifteen feet in length by twenty-seven inches in width.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Certainly a large amount of gold was required to overlay a board of this size.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the layer of gold were too thin, it would not have been able to bear the weight of the board.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To prepare the wooden boards was not too difficult; however, to overlay these large boards was quite a difficult task.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although we all are boards, we may be overlaid with a very thin layer of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yes, we may be in the Triune God, but we may not be deeply in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Instead of being overlaid with gold, we may merely be gilded with gold, like Babylon the Great in Revelation 17.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the standing boards had been only gilded with gold, there would have been no gold for the rings that supported the weight of the boards.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In order for the forty-eight heavy boards to be held together, they each had to be overlaid with a heavy layer of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although gold is glorious and shiny, it is somewhat soft.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In like manner, the uniting God is also rather soft.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we have just a little of Him, we shall not have a sufficient amount of gold for the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our experience proves this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Suppose you contact the Lord early in the morning and gain some gold.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But when you see an unpleasant expression on the face of your husband or wife at the breakfast table, you are immediately offended.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The thin layer of gold that was covering you seems to have disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, if you have been overlaid with a heavy layer of gold, you will not be offended, no matter how much unpleasantness you may have to face.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Nothing can damage such a thick layer of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Although you may have a certain amount of gold, the amount you have may not be enough to keep you in the genuine oneness.</S>
