   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We knew that God wanted us to go, and we went.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Originally, we intended to go only for a day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But after we arrived, the Lord had sovereignly arranged everything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Her oldest son was the district chief of the town, and her third son was the principal of the elementary school.</S>
