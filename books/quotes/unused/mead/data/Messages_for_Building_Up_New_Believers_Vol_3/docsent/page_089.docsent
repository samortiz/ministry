   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>G. The Seventh Church Laodicea</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Five of the seven churches were rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One did not receive a rebuke, and one received only praise.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The one which received only praise was Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Catholicism, Protestantism, and Philadelphia will all remain until the Lord Jesus comes again.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The last church, the seventh one, Laodicea, also will continue until the Lord Jesus comes again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since Sardis came out of Thyatira and Philadelphia came out of Sardis, Laodicea naturally has to come out of Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One begets the other.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Laodicea Being the Result of</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Philadelphia s Degradation</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is where the issue lies today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once Philadelphia fails, it becomes Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not think that Protestantism is Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is altogether wrong to think this way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Protestantism is Sardis, not Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Protestantism can only be Sardis today; it cannot be Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No Bible reader should be so foolish as to think that Protestantism is Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No, Protestantism is Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After Philadelphia has fallen, it becomes Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sardis came out of Thyatira, and it was one step beyond Thyatira.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Philadelphia came out of Sardis, and it was one step beyond Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Laodicea, however, comes out of Philadelphia, but it is one step behind Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These four churches will remain until the Lord Jesus comes again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Laodicea is a distorted Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When brotherly love is gone, Philadelphia immediately turns into the opinions of many.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the meaning of the word Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Laodicea was a city whose name came from a Roman prince, Entiochus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He had a wife whose name was Laodios.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He took his wife s name, dropped the os and added kea or cea to become Laodikea or Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Lao in Greek means many people and dikea or dicea means opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As soon as Philadelphia becomes degraded, the brothers become the many people, and its brotherly love becomes the opinions of the many.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Love has degenerated into opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brotherly love is something living, but the opinion of many people is something dead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When brotherly love is lost, the Body relationship is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The fellowship of life is cut off as well, leaving only the opinion of men.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The opinion of the Lord is lost, and the only things left are the vote of the majority, ballots, and the show of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once Philadelphia falls, it becomes Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Lukewarmness and Spiritual Pride</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Revelation 3:15 says, I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the characteristic of Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 17 says, Because you say, I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing, and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These are the characteristics of Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the eyes of the Lord, the characteristics of Laodicea are lukewarmness and spiritual pride.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is bad enough for it to say, I am wealthy, but it continues, saying, and have become rich.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The two statements are evil enough, yet it goes on to say that it has need of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the eyes of the Lord it is wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Where does spiritual pride come from?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It comes from history.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some were once rich and they think that they are still rich.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord was once merciful to them, and they remember their history.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But now they have lost that reality.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Life That Was Present Being Lost Today</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is hardly any person in Protestantism today who boasts of his own spiritual riches.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I have met many Protestant leaders overseas as well as Protestant pastors in China.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They all say, We are poor!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are poor!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is hard to find a proud person in Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is only one group of proud people those who were Philadelphia and who had once kept God s word and not denied His name.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Yet the life which they once had is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They still remember their history, but they have lost their former life!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They remember that they were once wealthy and had become rich and had need of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But they are now poor and blind!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is only one group of people who can boast of their riches fallen Philadelphia, the Philadelphia which has lost its power and life.</S>
