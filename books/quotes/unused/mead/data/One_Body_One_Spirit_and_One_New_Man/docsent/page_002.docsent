   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE SPIRIT AND THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4a; 1:23; 1 Cor 12:13, 12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In these messages we will consider the one Body and the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all know that in Ephesians 4 there are two great matters: One is the Body, and the other is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because in the church many of you have received much help and have had many experiences, you know what I am talking about when I speak of one Body and one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, if someone in today's Christianity were here and heard these terms, one Body and one Spirit, he may ask, "There are thousands of bodies here.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How can there be only one Body'?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And what kind of spirit is the one Spirit'?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Does this refer to man as the spirit of all creation' or perhaps to a kind of cure-all?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If such a one thinks in this way and begins to roll his eyes, the speaker on the platform is not able to continue his message.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is truly the case.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, the Lord is always with the spirit of the speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While I am speaking, in my spirit I can understand your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even though you have no outward expression to tell me whether you are opposing my words or receiving them joyfully, I know your considerations.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The spirit of the speaker is very sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I do understand that you need some foundation in order to understand what the Body and the Spirit are, of which we are speaking here.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On your side, your heart should be pure, your spirit open, and your entire being ready to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If this is the case, then there will be a deep calling unto deep between you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The things within me will be able to flow out, and also the things within you will be able to flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way what should be released will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ephesians 4:4a speaks of "one Body and one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Is it correct to say "one Spirit and one Body?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Absolutely not, because in this verse Body is mentioned first.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to our understanding, we may ask, "Is the Spirit not greater and higher than the Body?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yes, the Spirit is higher.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then why is the Body mentioned first and the Spirit second?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is because the topic of Ephesians 4 is not the Spirit but the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, the entire book of Ephesians with all its six chapters is particularly on the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Body is the subject, and the Spirit is the content of the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why chapter four speaks first of the Body and then of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Body and the Spirit are two great matters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>JESUS' RESURRECTION AND GLORIFICATION BRINGING THE SPIRIT INTO BEING</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before the day of Pentecost recorded in Acts 2, and before the resurrection and ascension of the Lord Jesus, did the Body exist in the universe?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No, because at that time the church was not yet there.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Body is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before the day of Pentecost there was no church, so there was no Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We speak of one Body and one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is very clear that the Body was not there before Pentecost, but before Pentecost and before the resurrection and ascension of the Lord Jesus, was the Spirit there?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No, for John 7:39 says, "But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Spirit of God was there, but the Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To explain this we can use the illustration of making tea.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If I have only a cup of plain water without any tea in it, I can say, "At this time the tea is not yet."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is water, but there is no tea yet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If I put tea leaves into the water, and after a minute or two the element of the tea has dissolved into the water, then there is tea.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Five minutes ago there was water but no tea; now there is not only water but also tea.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before the Lord Jesus resurrected and ascended, the Spirit of God was there, but we may compare Him to plain water.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then what is the "tea"?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Figuratively speaking, the tea is the Lord Jesus in His humanity passing through death, entering into resurrection, being glorified, and being exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At this juncture, the whole process of the Lord Jesus being mingled with the Spirit of God was completed, just as tea is mingled with plain water.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, before the Lord Jesus was resurrected, the Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not my view; this is what John 7:39 says.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, this verse explains why the Spirit at that time was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It was because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
