<h1 class="title">THE LIVING GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Dan. 6:26, 19-22; 3:14-18; Jer. 10:10; Psa. 42:2-3, 10-11; Heb. 3:12; 10:31; 1 Tim. 4:10; 2 Cor. 3:3; Matt. 16:16; Isa. 49:4</h1>
<p>In 1941 and in 1948 I gave messages entitled &ldquo;The Living God.&rdquo; Recently, I have been considering the term <em>the living God;</em> hence, I believe that this title is of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING A LIVING GOD</h2>
<p>The Bible uses many words to describe God. He is the holy God, the righteous God, the loving God, and the mighty God (cf. Heb. 2:11; 1 Pet. 1:15-16; Acts 3:14; 2 Tim. 4:8; 1 John 1:9; 4:8, 16; Matt. 26:64). These different words refer to God&rsquo;s characteristics, His attributes. God&rsquo;s being righteous speaks of His ways, for righteousness is His procedure in doing things. God&rsquo;s being holy speaks of His nature being distinct from everything else; hence, only He is holy. God&rsquo;s being mighty speaks of His power, and God&rsquo;s being love speaks of His heart.</p>
<p>The Bible also calls God the living God (Dan. 6:26; Psa. 42:2; Matt. 16:16; 1 Tim. 4:10; Heb. 10:31). We may understand this to mean that God is living, not dead. However, <em>the living God</em> has a much deeper significance. Our lifetime would not be long enough for us to fully understand and experience the living God.</p>
<p>Even though Christians are persecuted, afflicted, and martyred, the gospel continues to spread, and more believers are gained because Christians believe in and worship a living God. Many people think that being a Christian is mainly a matter of believing doctrines, but according to the Bible, being a Christian is not a matter of joining a religion or believing doctrines. Being a Christian is a matter of knowing and contacting the living God. God made us Christians in order for us to experience Him, testify concerning Him, and express Him as the living God.</p>
<p>Some may say that they already know and believe in the living God, but it is one thing to have knowledge and yet another to have practical experience. It is not easy to experience the living God, testify of the living God, or express the living God. A Christian might be zealous concerning dogma and yet not touch the living God. God does not want us to be Christians who are zealous concerning doctrine; He wants us to experience and express Him as the living God in our daily life. God is pleased when we testify concerning Him as the living God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A LIVING RELATIONSHIP<br />
WITH THE LIVING GOD</h2>
<p>Every genuine Christian should have a living relationship with the living God. We may consider a person to be a good Christian if he reads the Bible, prays, and attends meetings, but in God&rsquo;s view he may merely be a religious Christian. A genuine Christian interacts with the living God every day and has a living relationship with God because he lives in God and lets God live in him.</p>
<p>There is a sister who loves the Lord and is zealous in her service, but for many years she felt that she was a sinner and that she had not fully given herself to the Lord. She testified that before she was saved, she was her own boss, but now that the living Lord is in her, she must let Him rule in every matter. This testimony shows that she has touched the living God and that He has touched her. It is not a matter of her praying in herself but of the living God leading her in prayer and causing her to sense her sins, to love Him, and to realize that He is ruling within her. This is not a matter of teaching, which gives only knowledge. This sister has touched the living God.</p>
<p>In order to have a living relationship with the living God, we must fellowship with Him in our spirit. We need to communicate with the living God every day and fellowship with Him every moment. When we draw near to Him, He draws near to us (James 4:8), lives in us, and speaks to us. Then He can get involved with our thoughts and actions, and He can touch both our daily walk and our service. He can rule over every item in our living. Although others may be loose in certain matters, we cannot be loose, because the living God does not allow us to be loose.</p>
<p>If we have a living relationship with the living God, we will be able to experience Him in our daily living. A brother may think that he will fall because he has encountered a situation that is beyond what he can bear. However, he discovers that within him there is a surpassing power that enables him to stand. This transcending power is connected to a person, the living God, and it supports the brother, causing him to stand. This power is the living God. We often marvel at and are puzzled by our ability to stand in difficult situations, even though we are so weak. We are able to stand because we are in the living God, and the living God is in us. We have experienced the support of the living God.</p>
