   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PICTURES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Evil spirits are not only able to inject thoughts into the believer's mind, but they can also form different kinds of pictures in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some of these pictures are very clean and good, which the believer likes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But some are very filthy and sinful and are abhorred by the believer's conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whether it is something good or bad, something the believer likes or abhors, he has no power to stop these pictures from coming into his own mind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Past experiences, future predictions, and many other things are always lingering before his eyes in spite of the opposition of his will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The believer's imagination has fallen into passivity; he can no longer control his own imagination and has yielded to evil spirits who are now using his imagination at will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A believer should realize that everything that is not produced by his own mind is given to him by supernatural spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>DREAMS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some dreams are natural, but some are supernatural.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some belong to God, and some belong to the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Except for the dreams that are caused by man's own physiology or mind, the rest are supernatural.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a believer's mind is open to evil spirits, many of his dreams at night are probably the "pictures" he obtained during the day in disguise.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Evil spirits make him see the pictures during the day and dream about them at night.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a believer wants to check if his dream is from evil spirits, he only needs to ask, "Has my mind been passive during the day?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If so, the dream which he receives is not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Dreams from God always make people normal, peaceful, stable, reasonable, and sensible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But dreams that come from evil spirits are all strange, vain, false, foolish, and cause people to become elated, stupefied, confused, and irrational.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The evil spirits can give a believer many strange dreams, some of which are very good, because his mind is passive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a believer's mind has fallen into passivity, all of his dreams will not be from God, neither will they be natural; instead, they will be from evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At night the mind is naturally not as active as during the day, and it becomes more passive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then evil spirits will seize the opportunity to accomplish their goal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These kinds of dreams at night make the believer dizzy and dampen his spirit when he wakes up in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sleep does not seem to increase his vigor, because while he is sleeping, evil spirits are affecting his whole being through the passive mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All who frequently suffer from dreams at night have evil spirits working in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a believer single-mindedly rejects the evil spirits' work both during the day and night, he will soon be free.</S>
