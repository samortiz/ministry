   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO KINDS OF FRUIT OUT OF THE DIVINE LIFE Scripture Reading: Gal 5:16-26; 2 Pet 1:3-11; John 15:16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we want to see the truth of the two kinds of fruit out of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the revelation of the Scriptures, there is a divine principle set up by God as His design, as His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This design is that God wants to dispense Himself into us human beings to live in us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This divine life is a producing life, producing two kinds of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's intention for man is revealed in the first two chapters of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God created man according to His image with the intention that man could be His vessel to contain and express Him 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God Himself wanted to be man's contents.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He brought man to the tree of life in Genesis 2 because He had the desire to be within man as man's life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This unique tree of life, which was seen at the beginning of the Bible, is also seen at its conclusion in Revelation 22.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It signifies God Himself as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The human life created by God is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No one can completely understand our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How much more mysterious the divine life is!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because the life of God is so mysterious, God gave us a picture of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A picture is better than a thousand words.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Immediately after God created man, He brought him to a tree called the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>An apple tree or a peach tree may seemingly be easy to understand, but what about the tree of life?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One Bible teacher said that the tree of life was something in the past that has nothing to do with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the tree of life is not something merely in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the tree of life did not have anything to do with us today, we would be altogether in a miserable situation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thank the Lord that we can enjoy Him as the tree of life today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Gospel of John shows us the tree of life, illustrating Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are going to understand the tree of life in Genesis 2, we have to come to the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This book has twenty-one chapters that give a full, detailed explanation of the tree of life being the very embodiment of God, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In John 15 Christ told us that He is the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus also told us in the Gospel of John, "I am the life" 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is the vine tree and the life the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I believe that the tree of life in Genesis 2 was a vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was not like a pine tree growing upward and high toward the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If Jesus were such a high and tall tree, His fruit would not be available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But Jesus is a vine tree who is so available for man to eat and to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Revelation 22 the one tree of life growing on the two sides of the river signifies that the tree of life is a vine tree spreading and proceeding along the flow of the water of life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Revelation 2:7 the Lord said, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the entire book of Revelation, the paradise of God in 2:7 is the New Jerusalem 3:12; 21:2, 10; 22:1-2, 14, 19 , of which the church is a foretaste today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The paradise of God is today's church and tomorrow's New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today we are the church, and in the future the church will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today's church life is God's paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the church life, we have some taste that we are in the paradise of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At times we may be arguing or speaking corrupt things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But while we are meeting together, singing, praising, and praying, we have the feeling that we are in paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes in the church meetings we are in a kind of ecstasy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I look at the faces of the saints in a meeting, nearly every face is smiling.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is because we are happy in the paradise of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This world is a terrible place.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even many of the unbelievers agree with this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In today's human society, one does not have the taste of paradise; instead, one may have the taste of hell.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But when we are in the church life, we are in paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The paradise of God is located in the local churches!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be in the church life is to live a life in paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Eventually the consummation of the church life in the age to come and in eternity will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the New Jerusalem is the tree of life growing in the river of water of life for our eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That will be our enjoyment in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even today we have the privilege of eating the tree of life and of "drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry" see Hymns, #322 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the church life, we are in the paradise of God enjoying Christ as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today Christ as the embodiment of God is our tree of life, and this tree of life is growing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord Jesus told a parable of a sower going out to sow the seed Mark 4:1-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is both the sower and the seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He sows Himself as the seed of life into us, the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are the earth that grows Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the day we were regenerated, Christ was sown into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our very being is the earth that contains Christ and grows Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have received the divine life, and this very productive divine life is growing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to grow Christ.</S>
