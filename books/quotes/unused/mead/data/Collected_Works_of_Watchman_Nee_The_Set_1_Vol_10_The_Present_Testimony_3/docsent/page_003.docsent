   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A SOUL AT REST Issue No. 24</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Man's psychological faculty is very sensitive and most easily affected by outward stimulations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Words, attitudes, circumstances, human affections that come from the outside are able to affect us emotionally.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Formerly our mind was filled with thoughts, plans, and ideals and always buzzing with activities.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our will was filled with opinions and suggestions and loved to act according to its preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every faculty of our soul-life afforded us no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whether we were alone or with others, the soul-life within us was constantly swaying, changing, causing turbulence, disorganization, and unrest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But when our soul comes under the control of the spirit, we are delivered from these kinds of turbulence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus says, "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls" Matt 11:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we are willing to submit to the Lord, take His yoke, and walk according to His will, our soul will not be disturbed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are willing to follow the Lord, willing to consider how He was despised by men and did not give in to His self-will, but rather followed God's will, and willing to learn from Him, all the turbulence in our soul will be calmed down.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The reason sorrow and grief come upon us is that we are not content with receiving the same treatment as the Lord; we are not willing to submit to God's will and His arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we put the soul-life to death and submit fully to the Lord, our sensitive soul will rest in the Lord, and we will no longer misunderstand the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A soul that is under the control of the Holy Spirit is a soul that is at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Formerly we were busy planning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we are serenely trusting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Formerly there were constant sorrow and frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we are like a weaned child, who rests in his mother's bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Formerly we were filled with our own thoughts and had many cravings and ambitions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we consider God's will as the best and rest in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Indeed, "Perfect submission, perfect delight," and "Perfect submission, all is at rest" Hymns, #308 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ephesians 6:6 says more or less the same thing: "As slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No longer do we do God's will by the soul, which is self-assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we are doing God's will from the soul, which means carrying out His will practically and wholeheartedly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The soul-life which once rebelled against God's will is now brought into full submission to His will through the work of the cross and is willing to do His will wholeheartedly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Formerly everything was outward; we either walked according to our self-will, or we tried to do God's will according to our self-will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But now, in everything, we have become one mind with God.</S>
