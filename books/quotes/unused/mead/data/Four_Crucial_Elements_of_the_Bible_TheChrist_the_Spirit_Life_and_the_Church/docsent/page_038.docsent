   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Ephesians 3:16-17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second passage in the New Testament that speaks of the Triune God is Ephesians 3:16-17, which says, "That He the Father would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ the Son may make His home in your hearts through faith."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the apostle Paul's prayer that the believers may experience the fullness of God according to the riches of the Father's glory that they may be filled unto all the fullness of God v. 19b . The Father hears Paul's prayer and grants the believers to be strengthened through the Spirit into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then, Christ can make His home in the believers' hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is truly marvelous that Paul prays to the Father, but when the Father answers his prayer, He comes through the Spirit; yet the One who makes His home in the believers' hearts is the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The result is that the believers are filled unto all the fullness of God not merely the fullness of the Son or of the Father or of the Spirit but the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we probe into this matter, we can see that it is truly mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, we must ask why Paul prayed to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since the Father, Son, and Spirit are just one, why could he not pray directly to the Son asking Him to make His home in our hearts?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Charles Wesley wrote the hymn that begins, "Hark! the herald angels sing" Hymns, #84 , and in its fourth stanza he said, "Come, Desire of nations, come!/Fix in us Thy humble home."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The second line was written according to Ephesians 3:17.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, Paul did not pray directly to the Son; he prayed to the Father that we would be strengthened through the Spirit that Christ might make His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we understand the scriptural principle, we will see that whatever goes from us to God begins with Christ, and whatever comes from God to us begins with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In several passages, when referring to the Divine Trinity, the Bible does not speak of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, but instead it speaks of the Son, the Spirit, and the Father, or the Father, the Spirit, and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The three parables in Luke 15 speak of the Son, the Spirit, and the Father; God comes in the Son as the Shepherd, then the Spirit comes as the woman to illuminate and to seek, and eventually the Father receives.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians 2:18 also refers to the Son, the Spirit, and the Father having access through the Son, in the Spirit, unto the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Luke 15 and Ephesians 2 both speak of our going to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ephesians 3:16-17, however, speaks of God coming to us to make His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the direction is reversed; it begins with the Father, it is through the Spirit, and finally the Son comes to make His home.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am afraid that very few people in Christianity are able to obtain such light in their reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christianity has made a careful study of biblical geography and history and has thoroughly researched the original meanings of the words in the biblical languages, both in Hebrew and Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, much energy has been expended studying the wrong areas, and they have not obtained much light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must research the geography, history, and original word meanings, but these are only to help us to study more deeply to know the central truths of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must have the proper study if we are to receive light.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we want to enter into God to enjoy and experience Him, we must begin with the Son and have access in the Spirit unto the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then, if we want to let the Triune God enter into us, we cannot begin with the Son but must begin with the Father and pass through the Spirit that the Son may come and make His home in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The result of His making His home in this way is that we are filled with God, that is, the Triune God, so that we become the fullness of the Triune God to be the expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the truth concerning the Divine Trinity in Ephesians 3:16-17 for the believers' experience.</S>
