<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN INTRODUCTORY WORD</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Jer. 1:1-3</H1><P>In our life-study of the Word, we now come to the book of Jeremiah. Although many of us may not be familiar with Jeremiah, I hope that the Lord will stir up our interest in this book and show us its intrinsic purpose.</P><P>The book of Jeremiah has as its particular nature and standing God's tenderheartedness plus God's righteousness. Our God is a tenderhearted God, and He is absolutely righteous. He is full of compassion, sympathy, and tender care, yet He is righteous. As the righteous God, He cannot spare those who have sinned against Him; He has to judge them. He is such a God.</P><P>This book is also an autobiography in which Jeremiah tells us of his situation, his person, and his feeling, revealing his tender heart. Jehovah is the tenderhearted God, and in being tenderhearted Jeremiah is absolutely one with God. Because Jeremiah often wept, even wailed, he is called the weeping prophet. In his weeping Jeremiah represented God. Thus, God could use a prophet like Jeremiah to express Him, speak for Him, and represent Him on earth.</P><P>This book also deals with Israel. Israel is stubborn, evil, wicked, and stiff-necked, knowing nothing of repentance or of returning to God. Israel is altogether not one with God.</P><P>Jeremiah also speaks much concerning the nations. According to this book, in the sight of God, all the nations, all the Gentiles, are animals, acting as if they do not have a human spirit. They do not bear any kind of image or likeness of God nor understand anything of God.</P><P>In the book of Jeremiah four parties are revealed. The first party is God, who is tender, loving, compassionate, and righteous. The second party is Jeremiah, a timid young man raised up by God to be His mouthpiece to speak for Him and express Him. As God's mouthpiece, Jeremiah is one with God in being tenderhearted, loving, and righteous. In contrast, Israel, the third party, is evil and stubborn, and the fourth party, consisting of the nations, is even worse.</P><P>Let us now go on to consider, in an introductory way, certain important aspects of the book of Jeremiah.</P>
