   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>VERSUS KEEPING THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Christian life there are two things that are very different from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One is keeping the law; the other is being conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of these two things, only the latter is the eternal purpose of God Eph 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The eternal purpose of God His mind, His eternal thought is not that we would keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even if we were able to keep the law perfectly, keeping the law would still not be the eternal purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The law is at best something that is only alongside God s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God s eternal purpose is that we would be conformed to the image of His Son so that His only begotten Son would become the firstborn Son among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Originally, God had only one Son, the only begotten Son John 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But His intention, His eternal purpose, is to produce many sons so that His only begotten Son would become the Firstborn among many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Perhaps you have been a Christian for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is your general idea of what it means to be a Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Is it your idea that the meaning of being a Christian is to be a person who keeps the law and does good in order to please God?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Or is a Christian a person who needs to be conformed to the image of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to typical Christian thought, a good Christian is actually a Christian who keeps the law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, if you are trying to be a good Christian, in actuality you are not trying to be a man of Christ but a good man of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If this is your case, in regard to your living you are a Christian in name only, for in reality you are trying to be something else.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before we came into the recovery, very few among us would have been able to declare the following: I have been regenerated by God for the purpose of being conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, I have nothing to do with the law and desire instead to stay in line with the Holy Spirit, for it is only in this way that I will be conformed day by day into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Most of us could have said only that as those who had been saved by God, our duty was to be good Christians who did good and kept the law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May the Lord open our eyes to see that the eternal purpose of God is not that we would do our best to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must give up this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The eternal purpose of God is that we be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I wish that in the course of this chapter I could remind you thousands of times to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But I am afraid that even after so many reminders, you will forget everything after you put down this book.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I fear that even after I contrast keeping the law and being conformed to Christ s image, tomorrow morning you will kneel down to pray, Lord, this is a new day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not want to be wrong anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I wish to do right.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I wish to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I wish to be humble and nice to my spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Lord, help me do all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you pray in such a way, it shows that instead of being conformed to Christ s image, you are trying to be a good man of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Years ago I prayed similar prayers day after day because I had not received the vision of conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even today I am sometimes drawn back to the old deceit by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must cease praying in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To pray in this way is to live according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil instead of by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather than trying to keep the law, we need to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>BEING CONFORMED TO CHRIST S IMAGE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>BY KNOWING THE INDWELLING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How then can we be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The way is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit of the Son of God is now in us Rom 8:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to stop trying to keep the law and stop trying to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Be simple.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Simply keep yourself in contact with the Spirit who indwells you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Simplify the whole situation by realizing that the Spirit of the Son of God dwells, works, and acts within you all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Simplify the situation by no longer trying to do good and trying to be a good Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Simplify yourself to just one item: knowing the indwelling Spirit of Christ and keeping in contact with Him moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To take this way is to take the tree of life cf.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil is complicated, for with it there are many things, including good, evil, death, and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The tree of life, however, is simple, for with it there is only one thing life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The tree of life is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself as the Spirit John 14:6; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more we simplify things, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We even need to forget about all the teachings we have heard in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It would be good if we could simplify our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Instead of praying that the Lord would help us keep the law and do good, it would be good if every night, we were to pray, Lord, I praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You are my life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You are my all.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now You are in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How great this is, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Spirit, who is Your reality, now dwells within me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now I am going to bed, and I know that You are going with me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then the next morning, it would be wonderful to offer some praises and thanks to the Lord: Lord, here I am.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I know that You are in my heart and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I appreciate Your presence, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I am in You and You are in me.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>O Lord, how wonderful this is.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What a joy and blessing!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Lord, I worship You.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Thank You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the best way to pray in the evening and in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I am not giving you another law or a different law.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Rather, I am telling you to make the Christian life simpler.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Simply know the indwelling Spirit of Christ and remain in contact with Him moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Rather than doing a lot of things to complicate ourselves, let us pay attention to the working of the Holy Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Aspects of this work can be seen in a number of verses in Romans 8.</S>
