   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God Coming into Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What do we call this flow when it comes down into man?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By incarnation God has been brought into man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a child was born in Bethlehem to the human race, something very extraordinary happened.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Isaiah 9:6 says For a child is born to us, / A son is given to us; / And the government / Is upon His shoulder; / And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, / Mighty God, / Eternal Father, / Prince of Peace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A child was born in a manger, yet His name is called Mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is by this incarnation that God has been brought into man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the four Gospels there was a man working on this earth having God in Him as His very content.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a wonder and a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time this wonder was a secret to the people, because apparently this was simply a man, Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, there was something within Him that was different from men, that is, God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By His incarnation God brought Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man Being Brought into God</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later Christ resurrected and ascended, and by the resurrection and ascension man was brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, after the ascension there is a man in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the time Stephen was stoned to death, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Son of Man at the right hand of God Acts 7:55-56 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That man in the heavens was not only in heaven but also in God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Stephen saw a man in God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By the incarnation there was a man on this earth with God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God came into man and walked on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that time someone could point to Him and say that there is God in a man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By His resurrection and ascension, however, there is now a man in God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God has been brought into man, and man has been brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Psalm 68:18 first says, You have ascended on high, and then it says, You have led captive those taken captive.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When did Christ defeat all His foes?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hebrews 2:14 tells us that through death He destroyed him the devil who has the power of death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By His death Christ defeated all the foes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then by His resurrection He disarmed them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After this, while He was ascending to the heavens, He was leading a train of defeated foes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do you realize this?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ has disarmed and captured all the capturing power, and He has defeated all the foes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He has solved all the problems in the heavens and on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>CHRIST GOING TO THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>IN RESURRECTION AND ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>TO RECEIVE MEN AS GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ went not only to the heavens but to the Father Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Gospel of John tells us that Jesus came from the Father and was going to the Father 13:1, 3; 14:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He came from the Father to bring God into man, and then He went to the Father to bring man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Psalm 68:18 says that Christ received gifts among, in, or as, man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this man, as man, representing man, for man, and on behalf of man He went back to the Father to receive the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These gifts are all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not merely take my word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You must read the clear word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Ephesians 4:8 says, Therefore the Scripture says, Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verses 9 and 10 are a parenthesis, so verse 8 is followed by verse 11, which says, And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Here Christ did not give speaking in tongues, healing, wonders, power, and miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rather, He gave persons as gifts for the perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The gifts are not only the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Not only are the arm and the shoulder gifts to the body; even the little finger is a gift to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The gifts are the members.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to Psalm 68, Christ ascended on high, having defeated and disarmed the foes by His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By His incarnation, death, resurrection, and ascension, Christ accomplished everything both negatively and positively.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the negative side, He solved all the problems, defeated all the foes, and led them as a train of defeated foes to show His victory to the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the positive side, He brought God into man and man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Everything is now accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At the time of His ascension, He was ready as a man, in man, and on behalf of man to receive the gifts back from the Father, the source.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These gifts are the members of His Body.</S>
