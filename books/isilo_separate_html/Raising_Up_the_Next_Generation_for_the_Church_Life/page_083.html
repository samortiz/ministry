<h1 class="title">THE YOUNG PEOPLE NEEDING<br />
THE HUMANITY OF JESUS<br />
FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 25:10-11; 26:15, 19; 1 Tim. 3:15-16; 1 Thes. 4:3-4; Phil. 4:8; 2:5-8; 2 Tim. 2:22; 3:16; 1:7; 4:22</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>From the types in the Scriptures we can see the need of a proper humanity for the church life&mdash;Exo. 25:10-11; 26:15, 19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We have seen that the Ark and the tabernacle signify Christ and the church&mdash;the Ark is Christ and the tabernacle is the enlargement of the Ark; just as the tabernacle is the enlargement of the Ark, so the church is the increase and enlargement of Christ&mdash;25:10-11:</li>
	<li>The boards of the tabernacle were also made with the same material and in the same way as the Ark&mdash;acacia wood overlaid with gold&mdash;26:15, 29:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The boards are to be standing up; gold is valuable, weighty, and shining, but gold is not capable of standing by itself; in order for the boards of the tabernacle to stand up, there is the need for the acacia wood&mdash;v. 15.</li>
		<li>We need humanity, and we also need divinity, but it is the humanity in the church that causes the church to stand up&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15-16.</li>
		<li>The church is the church of the living God; the church must have God living in it, and this church of the living God is the pillar and base of the reality.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Satan&rsquo;s main target today is the young people; he injects all his evil, satanic, devilish concepts and ideas into the young and fresh mentality of the young generation&mdash;Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 10:4-5; Eph. 4:17-24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The young brothers and sisters in the church life must be clear that the source of all the damage in the mentality is Satan; the young people in the church must repudiate the concepts that they have held in the past.</li>
	<li>The first issue of this kind of mental damage is fornication&mdash;1 Cor. 6:9-11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Nothing damages our humanity like fornication; any act we commit is outside our body, but fornication damages our body&mdash;v. 18.</li>
		<li>Because the church life is a meeting life, a communal life, we have considerable contact with one another&mdash;1 Thes. 4:3-5, 7; Heb. 13:4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We must possess our vessel in sanctification and honor, not in the passion of lust; this is to be safeguarded against committing fornication&mdash;1 Thes. 4:3-5.</li>
			<li>God&rsquo;s will is that His redeemed people, the believers in Christ, should live a life of holiness according to His holy nature, a life wholly separated unto Him from anything other than Him; for this He is sanctifying us thoroughly&mdash;5:23.</li>
			<li>For the Lord&rsquo;s name, for the church&rsquo;s testimony, for your protection, and for the honor of your physical body, you must follow this principle of not being alone with a member of the opposite sex&mdash;Gen. 49:3-4; Heb. 12:16, footnote 1.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The second issue of the devilish concepts indoctrinated into the minds of the young people is to commit suicide:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Satan has indoctrinated the mentality of the young people with the concept of suicide; we all must pray and stand against such subtlety of the enemy.</li>
		<li>Satan&rsquo;s whole purpose is to damage humanity so that man cannot be used for God&rsquo;s purpose.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The third issue of the indoctrination of devilish concepts is mental illness:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul says that God has given us a spirit of sobermindedness; we must be exceedingly healthy in our thinking, concepts, and ideas, and we need to have a sound mind&mdash;2 Tim. 1:7.</li>
		<li>Problems in the heart are often the cause of mental problems; if a person&rsquo;s mind is under attack by the enemy, this is an indication that his heart is wrong in some way&mdash;Col. 2:1-2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We are in exactly the same kind of situation today as was the early church; at that time the church was degraded and society was ruined; it is clear that it is the same today&mdash;1 Thes. 4:3-4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We must all realize that we are in a situation that requires the Lord&rsquo;s humanity for His recovery; there must be a group of people to stand against the tide of this age&mdash;2 Tim. 3:1-5.</li>
	<li>The proper cure for this age, the proper dose for this generation, is the humanity that comes from the man Jesus; the proper humanity is the only healing power for today&rsquo;s generation&mdash;Matt. 5:13-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord will use the church as a remedy for today&rsquo;s crooked and perverse generation; the remedy for such a generation is a church with the proper humanity&mdash;Acts 2:40; Phil. 2:15.</li>
		<li>If the young people in the church take the humanity of Jesus, they will be the proper remedy for this generation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Today in the church life the Lord is going to recover His humanity; we not only need His power; we need His humanity; we not only need what He can do; we need what He is.</li>
	<li>The proper humanity shining forth through the young brothers and sisters will be a strong testimony and remedy to this present age; this humanity will also cause us to have the strongest church life.</li>
	<li>It is abundantly clear that we need a strong, adequate, and proper humanity in order to have the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in such a degraded time&mdash;Phil. 4:8-9; 2:5-8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We do not need divine power as much as we need the humanity of Jesus to stand up in such a degraded age; this is the standing power of the acacia wood.</li>
		<li>If we follow the course of today&rsquo;s age, we are like the jellyfish, without any backbone; whatever way the tide goes, the jellyfish follow.</li>
		<li>We need a strong backbone to stand against the current of today&rsquo;s age for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and this backbone can issue only from the humanity of Jesus.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In 2 Timothy we are able to see the apostle Paul&rsquo;s concept concerning five ways to take the humanity of Jesus&mdash;2 Tim. 2:22; 3:16; 1:7; 4:22:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The first was to call on the name of the Lord from a pure heart; when we call on the name of the Lord, we are really taking His humanity into us&mdash;2:22.</li>
	<li>We not only need to call on the Lord, but we must also breathe in every word of the Scriptures; this is simply to pray-read the Word&mdash;3:16.</li>
	<li>The third item is the Body life; Paul did not say simply to call on the Lord by yourself but with &ldquo;those&rdquo;&mdash;this is a corporate life; we enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s humanity by being with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart&mdash;2:22.</li>
	<li>Fourth, Paul tells us that we have a spirit to exercise&mdash;1:7.</li>
	<li>Fifth, we have a wonderful person in our spirit: &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit&rdquo;&mdash;4:22.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;We must pray for the entire situation of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, that all the brothers and sisters in the local churches may have a full enjoyment of the humanity of Jesus. Then we will be the acacia boards, standing steadfastly against the current of this evil age. This will be our strong testimony, and this will bring the recovery of the local church life to all the leading cities&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Christ as the Reality,</em> p. 151.</li>
