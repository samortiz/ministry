   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SAVED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:8 Paul tells us that by grace you have been saved through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we were saved, we could enjoy certain worldly entertainments.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But after we were saved, our tastes spontaneously changed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you go back to those things you enjoyed before you were saved, you will find them very different.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What a tremendous difference God s salvation makes!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>GRACED</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Using a verbal form of the Greek word for grace, in 1:6 Paul says that God has graced us in the Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He has put us into the position of grace that we may be the object of His grace and favor, that we may enjoy all that God is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some versions say that God has favored us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have been graced, favored, in the Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>MADE ALIVE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 2:5 we see that God has made us alive together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As those who were God s enemies, we needed to be reconciled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As those who were lost, we needed to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, as those who were dead in trespasses and sins, we needed to be made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we called on the name of the Lord Jesus, we were enlivened by receiving the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Christ came into us, He came with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way, He made us alive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He enlivens us by being the life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The life with which we are enlivened includes the law of life, the sense of life, the fellowship of life, and every other aspect of the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>RAISED UP</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 2:6 we see that we have been raised up together in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We were not only dead, but also buried.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, God not only made us alive; He also raised us up from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Praise Him, we have been raised up from the grave!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>SEATED</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 2:6 we also see that God has seated us together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many Christians are waiting to go to heaven, but we are already in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Christ God has seated us all together, once for all, in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was accomplished when Christ ascended to the heavens, and it is applied to us by the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today we realize in experience this reality in our spirit through faith in the accomplished fact.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we exercise our spirit in a genuine way, we shall have the sense that we are sitting in the heavenlies looking down at the situation on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, if we exercise our natural reason instead of our spirit, we shall have the sense that we are on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nevertheless, according to the revelation of the Scriptures, we are seated with Christ in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>PURCHASED</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 1:14 Paul speaks of the redemption of the acquired or purchased possession.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The New Testament reveals that God has purchased us with a great price, the precious blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to acquire us, God had to pay such a high price.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>SEALED</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ephesians 1:13 says that we were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This verse indicates that God has sealed us; He has put His seal upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This seal is the Holy Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After we were purchased with the blood of Christ, God sealed us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because we have been sealed, we bear a mark, the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although we may fail and become unclean, this seal, this mark, cannot he removed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>POSSESSED</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In 1:14 Paul says that we have become God s possession, His acquired possession.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God possesses us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should have the realization that we belong to Him.</S>
