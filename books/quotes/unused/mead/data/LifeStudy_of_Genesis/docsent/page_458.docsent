   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>e God Promising Jacob 1 To Be Fruitful and Multiply</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 11 God said to Jacob, "I am God, all-sufficient: be fruitful and multiply" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the first item of God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At Bethel, God promised Jacob that he would be fruitful and multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All of us in the church life, including the least and the youngest, need to believe this promise and claim its fulfillment, saying, "Lord, I do not agree with being a solitary believer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I stand on Your promise to be fruitful and multiply."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you do this, after a certain time, there will be thirtyfold, then sixtyfold, and then a hundredfold.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was young, I prayed this way many times, and the Lord has surely answered my prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all must pray to be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord will answer our prayer and honor His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The way of the Lord's recovery is narrow and will never become a mass movement.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No mass movement can be of the Lord's recovery, because the Lord's recovery is a matter of a multiplying life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Look at the plants: they have life and multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are living with a divine life, and this life is a multiplying life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have the confidence that we shall multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Pray for this and stand on His promise, taking hold to His word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some may say that this was only a promise given to Jacob and that none of the Old Testament promises are for us today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Literally speaking, this is true.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But all the promises made to Israel are types.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since we are in the reality today, the promises in type are also for us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Stand on the Lord's word and say, "Lord, what You promised Jacob was a shadow, but it must be a reality to me."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2 To Be a Nation with Kings</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God also promised Jacob, saying, "A company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Firstly, we have "a company of nations," indicating multiplication, and then we have kings, indicating the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Following Jacob, there was the nation of his descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then there was the kingdom of his descendants under David and Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In New Testament times there was the kingdom under his descendant, Jesus Christ; in the next age there will be the millennial kingdom; and after that, the eternal kingdom in the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This one matter of the kings requires all the subsequent books of the Old Testament and the New Testament for its fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Revelation 11:15 is a part of this promise made to Jacob: "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even the church today as God's kingdom on earth is included in this promise.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am aware that when some hear this they will argue with me, saying that by mixing the church with Israel I am teaching wrongly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Literally speaking, this may be correct, but remember that everything in Jacob's life was a type to be fulfilled by us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not be satisfied to have one or two people saved through you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, you should say, "Lord, I am not happy with this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I want to see the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I need the multiplication that will issue in the kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do you have the faith for it?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all must say, "Lord, I would have the faith to be multiplied, not for my empire, but for Your kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>3 To Inherit the Land with His Seed</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Still another aspect of God's promise to Jacob is mentioned in verse 12: "And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here, Jacob is given the promise of inheriting the land with the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This promise is like a huge mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do not think that the land mentioned here is simply the narrow strip of the land of Palestine.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That narrow strip of land was a type of Christ as the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ as the good land for our possession eventually will be the stone that falls from heaven in Daniel 2.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This stone will become a mountain filling the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do you believe that the entire earth will be a great mountain and that there will be no plain, only a holy mountain?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This great mountain is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>f Jacob's Reaction to God's Promise</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In verses 14 and 15 we see Jacob's reaction to God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every time the Lord speaks to us, we must react.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not be dull, dumb, or dead.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because I am living, I react to whatever people say.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a brother had no reaction whatever to anything I said to him, I would conclude that he was either dumb or dead.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When I speak to my grandchildren, they are very active and aggressive because they are living.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When God spoke to Jacob, he reacted immediately.</S>
