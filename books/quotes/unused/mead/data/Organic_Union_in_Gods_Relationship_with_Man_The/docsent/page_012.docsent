   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S ETERNAL GOOD PLEASURE OF HIS WILL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before God created anything, He had a good pleasure within Him Eph 1:5, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This pleasure became His will, which eventually became His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This purpose then became His economy through His counsel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>9-11; 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through a council held among the three of the Trinity Gen 1:26 , God made a counsel to create man and even to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, God created man according to His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After creating everything, He looked on what He had made, including man, and said that it was very good Gen 1:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God created man with a body and with a spirit and placed him before the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was the first step.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But man still did not have God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, God had to take a further step, the step of becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>GOD'S PROMISE TO COME TO BE THE SEED OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not think that it was easy for God to enter into man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He first created man, and then He waited.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God is a God who is patience; therefore, He can be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After creating man, He waited four thousand years before He came to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first promise that He would come was given to Adam Gen 3:15 , and the second promise, two thousand years later, was given to Abraham 22:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Still, He did not come; rather, He waited another two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then one day, two thousand years ago, He came, not in the way of coming down from the third heaven and appearing suddenly as a man on the earth, but by entering into the womb of a human virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was born there and remained in that womb for nine months Matt 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then He was delivered out of the womb of that virgin, and He became a child in the manger at Bethlehem Luke 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This child was called the Mighty God and the Eternal Father Isa 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was also called Emmanuel God with us Matt 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is God with man, and He is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To Be the Seed of Woman</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After the first step of God's creation of man, man became fallen Gen 3:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then God came in, not to condemn man or to curse man, but to give man a promise that the seed of the woman would come to bruise the head of the damaging serpent v. 15; Isa 7:14; Gal 4:4; Matt 1:20, 16 . That promise indicated that God Himself would come to be the seed of woman.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To Be the Seed of Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After the promise given to Adam, God waited two thousand years until the time of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He then made a further promise to Abraham, saying, "And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed" Gen 22:18; Gal 3:16; Matt 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to Galatians 3:14, the promise given to Abraham was that God Himself would come to be the seed of Abraham, and this seed would be a blessing to all the nations by becoming the all-inclusive Spirit for mankind to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD'S</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>GOOD PLEASURE AND PROMISE The Word as the Defined and</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Explained God Becoming Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After His promise to Abraham, God waited another two thousand years before coming to be a man named Jesus Christ, who was also called Emmanuel God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Through His incarnation He as the Word, the defined and explained God, became flesh John 1:1, 14a; Rom 8:3m .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since that time two thousand years have passed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A total of six thousand years have passed since the creation of Adam: two thousand years from Adam to Abraham, two thousand years from Abraham until the day God became incarnated to be a man, and two thousand years from that day until today.</S>
