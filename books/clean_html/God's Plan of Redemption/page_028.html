<h2 class=head1>Inward Results of Abandonment to the Holy Spirit</h2><p>We now need to note the inward results of the Abandonment to the Holy Spirit. First: Christ is more real. The Holy Spirit does not speak of Himself. He does not call attention to Himself. He always glorifies Christ (John 16:14). Notice that the striking feature of the work of the Holy Spirit in the early apostolic church was this: He caused the believers of that time to realize their identification with a crucified, risen, ascended, glorified Lord. All else—signs and wonders, miracles and gifts, were but incidental to such identification. Indeed, without the realization of their identification with their Lord, all these outward incidentals would have proven exceedingly harmful to the early church.<p>Second: There is a new light upon God’s Written Word. The Bible indeed becomes a new Book. It is regarded as the very Spirit- breathed Word of God and to be treated with as much respect and reverence as if uttered by the audible voice of the Lord, and is to be perfectly obeyed. The veil seems lifted from obscure passages and Christ stands revealed in new beauty and glory. Especially is the work of Christ as the Redeemer illumined and glorified. (See John 16:15.)<p>Third: There begins to be realized experimental victory over sin. The Christian perceives that the death that Christ died as our Representative was a “death unto sin” (Rom. 6:10), and that he is identified with Christ in this death; also that as Christ arose to a sphere wherein sin does not exist, but where Righteousness reigns, even so he is identified with Christ in this new life; and as a result of his “reckoning” (or acting) upon this truth, he realizes victory in his daily life, through the indwelling Holy Spirit who corroborates what God says, as he reckons upon it.<p>Fourth: The Love of God is manifested in the daily life in self- sacrifice for others. Service for God now proceeds from love, rather than from duty. The language of the heart is, “I want to do this” instead of “I must do it.”<p>Fifth: Increasing light upon God’s dispensational plan, especially the prophecies concerning the Coming of Christ for His saints, and His coming with them in the outward manifestation of His kingdom in this world. The Christian begins to live in the light of Christ’s Return. It is more than theory with him. It is a constant, bright anticipation and expectation. “He shall show you things to come” (John 16:13).<p>Sixth: The Christian perceives that as a result of his identification with Christ in His risen, glorified Life, he may realize a foretaste of the Resurrection power which will eventually change his body in the “twinkling of an eye” at translation. This foretaste, or “earnest” (see 2 Cor. 5:4-5), is indicated in Romans 8:11 as the quickening of the mortal body by the indwelling Holy Spirit moment by moment, enabling the believer to finish the work given him to do. Notice that it is the mortal body, not a dead body, that is to be thus quickened. This quickening of the mortal body does not refer to the final act of translation. At translation the mortal body is changed (see 1 Cor. 15:52), but this quickening is an every day experience.<p>Seventh: There is power in prayer and service because the believer is reckoning upon his identification with Christ who has “all power.”<h2 class=head1>Revelation of the Soulish Life</h2><p>The teacher must lead the class to see that this new experience is not the ultimate as many seem to think. It is rather the beginning of practical transformation, which will proceed from stage to stage as the Holy Spirit takes the believer down into an ever deepening realization of his identification with Christ in His death, not to sin alone, but to the natural or soulish life as well. So much of the activity of Christians is of a soulish nature, that a truly spiritual person is rarely seen, and when seen is not understood. All Christians are in Christ, and many desire to live for Christ; but it is quite another matter to have the daily life, a manifestation of Christ. Paul could truly say, “to me to live is Christ,” but how many Christians are able to say the same?<p>The God-Man in His earthly life had no sin in Him, yet He constantly refused to let His human emotions or affections shape His ministry; nor would He be led by His own unsullied intellect apart from the revealed will of God. He was the most dependent Being ever born into this world; therefore everything in His life was of God.<p>He permitted Lazarus to die and the loving, trusting faith of Mary and Martha to be sorely tried, rather than to let His tender, compassionate heart cause Him to go to Bethany before His Father’s time.<p>One of the secondary evidences of the Holy Spirit’s control of the believer is this illumination concerning the soulish life. If the members of the class are shown that this perception of soulishness is a mark of normal Christian growth, they will not be overwhelmed when the depths of the self-life are revealed; nor will they be inclined to boast of their “holiness” or “absolute perfection.” Remember that the ripest saint is the one who is most dependent.
