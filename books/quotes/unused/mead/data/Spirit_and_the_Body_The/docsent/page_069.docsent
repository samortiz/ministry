   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE COMING FORTH OF THE BODY-CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 12 says, "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is the Christ" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>. In this verse Paul brings in the concept that Christ is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You may be familiar with the fact that in verse 12 we see the Body-Christ, the corporate Christ, not the individual Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yes, we are the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, if we are dumb when we gather together in the meetings, Christ has no way to come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He cannot come forth when we are silent.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But when we are spiritual, speaking and functioning in the meetings, Christ comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When you speak for Christ, Christ comes forth in your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we all speak forth Christ, then the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ, will come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is Christ as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to have the Body-Christ, we all need to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>POSITIONED TO DRINK OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we proceed to verse 13: "For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>. The Body has been formed by the baptism in the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In one Spirit we all have been baptized into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So many spiritual terms have been ruined by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we speak of the baptism in the Spirit, some immediately associate this with speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But it is not necessary to speak in tongues in order to be in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have not spoken in tongues since 1937.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But I can strongly testify that I have the deep sense that at this very moment I am in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Are you bold enough to say that you are in the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have the assurance that we are in the Spirit because one day, more than nineteen hundred years ago, we were all put, baptized, into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moreover, we have been made to drink of the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have been positioned to drink of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As long as we are in the Spirit, we are positioned to drink of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, everyone who is in the water has been positioned to drink the water.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Praise the Lord that we are all in the Spirit and have been positioned to drink of the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The way to drink of the Spirit is found in verse 3: "No man can say Lord Jesus, but in the Holy Spirit" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>. Whenever you say, "Lord Jesus," you are drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more you say this, the more you drink.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we come together, we must call on the name of the Lord so that we may drink of the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we shall be bubbling, speaking, uttering something for the Lord, and making a joyful noise to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do this, the Body will be among us in a practical way through our practice of being spiritual.</S>
