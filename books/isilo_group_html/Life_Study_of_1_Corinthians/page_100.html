FAITHFUL SERVANTS OF CHRIST</h2><p>In 4:1 Paul says, &ldquo;In this way let a man account of us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.&rdquo; By &ldquo;this way&rdquo; Paul means the way described in 3:21-23. In these verses Paul charges us not to boast in men, for all things are ours, we are Christ&rsquo;s, and Christ is God&rsquo;s.</p><p>In this way, Paul says, he was to be accounted as a servant of Christ. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;account&rdquo; here also means reckon, measure, or classify. Paul is saying that he was to be evaluated, or estimated, in this way as a servant of Christ.</p><p>The word servant in this verse means an attendant or appointed servant, an official servant appointed specifically for a certain purpose (Acts 26:16).</p><p>In verse 2 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Here, furthermore, it is sought in stewards that one be found faithful.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;here&rdquo; means in the stewardship, in the dispensing ministry. In this dispensing ministry it is most important that stewards be found faithful.</p><p>Here Paul seems to be talking about himself. Today many so-called spiritual people think that it is always wrong for Christians to talk about themselves. When I was with the Brethren, we were taught never to refer to ourselves in a positive way. But here Paul seems to indicate that he was faithful as a steward.</p><p>In verse 3 Paul continues, &ldquo;But to me it is a very small thing that I should be examined by you or by man&rsquo;s day; nor do I even examine myself.&rdquo; The word examined means examined for judgment or in judgment. It also means to be criticized. Paul is saying that he regarded it as a small thing to be criticized by the saints or by man&rsquo;s day. Man&rsquo;s day is the present age in which man judges. This is in contrast to the Lord&rsquo;s day (3:13), which will be the coming age, the kingdom age, in which the Lord will judge.</p><p>In this verse Paul also tells us that he did not even examine himself. He regarded it as a very small matter to be examined by the Corinthians or by man&rsquo;s day, and he would not examine himself.</p><p>In this verse there are two basic matters we all need to learn. First, we should not care about being criticized or judged by others. Most Christians find it unbearable to be judged or criticized. Certain sisters, if they learn that others have criticized them, may not be able to sleep well for a long period of time. This is true of brothers also. Suppose a certain brother who is an elder learns that someone has spoken critically of him. He may not be able to rest well that night, for he may say to himself, &ldquo;I am one of the elders in the church, but certain ones are criticizing me.&rdquo; If we are bothered by criticism, it indicates that it is a great thing, not a small thing, for us to be examined by others. We cannot yet say with Paul, &ldquo;To me it is a very small thing that I should be examined by you.&rdquo;</p><p>Forty years ago, I used to be quite bothered whenever I was criticized. Sometimes it affected my sleeping or eating. But after many years of experience, I am hardly ever bothered by criticism. I do not say that criticism never bothers me. However, I can testify that it disturbs me very little, if at all. In fact, to be judged and criticized has become rather common, rather ordinary. If I am not criticized, I would wonder if I am faithful to the Lord&rsquo;s commission. Anyone who is living and active will eventually be criticized. The best way to avoid criticism is to do nothing. As long as we are active in caring for the church, we must be prepared for criticism.</p><p>I would advise all the elders in the churches to ask for the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to increase their capacity to withstand criticism. A brother who is new to the eldership may find it very difficult at first to bear the criticism of the saints. The elders are criticized not mainly by those outside the church, but primarily by the brothers and sisters in the church. However, after a period of time, an elder should become accustomed to criticism.</p><p>We may compare criticism to hot peppers: hot peppers are difficult to eat at first, but eventually one may become accustomed to them. Many elders have become quite good at eating and digesting the hot peppers of the saints&rsquo; criticism. They have learned, with Paul, that it is a very small thing to be criticized by others.</p><p>The second matter we need to learn from these verses is not to criticize ourselves or examine ourselves. Early in my ministry I examined myself after every message. I spent much time to consider how others reacted to the message. Often, it would take days before I could be fully at rest concerning a message I had given. Then the time would come to give another message. Today I do not examine myself like this. I have learned that it is not a healthy practice to engage in this kind of self-examination. Actually, we are not worthy of such examination. Furthermore, if we do not examine ourselves, we may seem to be all right. But if we engage in self-examination, we may become very disappointed. If the elders all examine themselves in this way, they will feel that they are not qualified to be elders and will certainly try to resign. Paul could say that he did not examine himself, and we need to learn of him in this matter.</p><p>In verse 4 Paul says, &ldquo;For I am conscious of nothing against myself; but I am not justified by this; but He Who examines me is the Lord.&rdquo; Although Paul felt that he was right, he did not think that he was therefore justified. Knowing that the One who examines him is the Lord, he was willing to leave the matter of judgment with Him. Paul seems to be saying, &ldquo;Let the Lord examine me. He will judge me in the day of His appearing.&rdquo;</p><p>In verse 5 Paul concludes, &ldquo;Therefore do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord comes, who shall both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then there will be praise to each one from God.&rdquo; The phrase &ldquo;before the time&rdquo; means before the Lord&rsquo;s day.</p><p>Paul&rsquo;s words in verses 2 through 5 indicate that he was a faithful steward. He did not care for the criticism of others, and he did not criticize himself. He left the entire situation with the Lord. This indicates his faithfulness.</p><p>If we care for others&rsquo; criticism of us or if we examine ourselves, we are not faithful. On the contrary, we may be rather political and try to avoid criticism in order to feel better. We need to turn from this and leave judgment to the Lord. Then we shall be faithful.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_099.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_101.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 Corinthians &nbsp; pg 100</div><br></body></html>
