His two sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah (vv. 9-10), which he had obtained for Sarah in chapter twenty-three. It must be that his sons buried him according to his desire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. Needing Jacob and Isaac<br>for His Completion</H2><P>Although Abraham was good, he was not complete. He had to be completed and perfected by the lives of Jacob and Isaac. According to the implication of the divine record, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not three separate individuals. In like manner, their God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, is not three gods but the one Triune God. In Abraham, we see God the Father; in Isaac, we see God the Son; and in Jacob, we see God the Spirit. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the three-in-one, are the unique Triune God. In the same principle, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are a triune person. Being three-in-one, they are a complete person in the experience of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) Jacob's Being Chosen</H2><P>In Abraham's record we see the matter of calling. According to the divine revelation, however, calling is not the first item. God's selection comes before God's calling. When Abraham was in Chaldea worshipping idols, that was the time of God's calling, not the time of His selection. The time of God's selection was before the foundation of the world. In eternity past Abraham was chosen, and in Chaldea he was called. But where is the record of Abraham's selection? It is in Genesis 25 in the record of Jacob's selection. In himself, Abraham had no selection; his selection was in Jacob's selection. Abraham's life had neither a full beginning nor a complete ending, for he had neither selection nor maturity in life, both of which are with Jacob. In other words, as far as the experience of life is concerned, by himself Abraham cannot stand as a complete person in the eyes of God. He needs Jacob and Isaac. These three persons, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, represent the spiritual experience of a complete man. In the record of Jacob's life, there is no mention of being called. Where and when was Jacob called? He was called with Abraham in Genesis 11, just as Abraham was selected in Jacob. In Abraham we clearly see God's calling, but we do not see selection nor the maturity in life.</P><P>In Genesis 25 we have three genealogies: the genealogy of the children of Keturah (vv. 2-4), the genealogy of the sons of Ishmael (vv. 13-16), and the genealogy of Isaac (vv. 19-26). In the first two genealogies no one is selected by God. None of the sons of Keturah nor the sons of Ishmael were chosen by Him. Even Esau, one born of Isaac, was not chosen. Of all those named in this chapter, only one is chosen&#151;Jacob. These three genealogies are put together in one chapter for a definite purpose&#151;to show the kind of person God rejects and the kind of person He chooses. God chose the most naughty one, Jacob, whose name means a supplanter, a heel holder. If we were God, we would never have chosen such a naughty, supplanting one. Nevertheless, Jacob was God's choice. We see in this chapter that what Abraham produced was not what God wanted. None of his six sons was God's choice. In producing them, all he did was in vain. Likewise, none of Ishmael's descendants were chosen by God. After Isaac had been married for twenty years, he "entreated the Lord for his wife, because she was barren: and the Lord was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived" (v. 21). Rebekah gave birth to twins, the second of whom was God's choice. Of the more than twenty births recorded in this chapter, all were in vain except one. In this chapter God seemed to be saying to Abraham, "You have brought forth many children by your flesh, but all is in vain. Not one who is the result of your flesh is My choice."</P><P>This chapter reveals that the life which lacks maturity will always labor in vain. If we are not matured in life, although we may be quite active, doing many things, all our labor will be in vain. None of it is according to God's selection. Abraham was a dear saint with a very good life, but his life was not mature and he did much which was in vain. Nothing that came out of his flesh was God's choice. Do you want to have a life like this? By the record of Abraham's life we see that he was not complete. He needed Jacob and Isaac to complete and perfect him. As this chapter reveals, for his completion and perfection he needed Jacob's being chosen.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_374.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_376.html">Next</a> </body></html>
