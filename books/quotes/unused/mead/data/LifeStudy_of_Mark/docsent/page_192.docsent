   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Growth and Transfiguration</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For years I was familiar with the story of the Lord s transfiguration without realizing that this transfiguration should be something experiential and practical to us in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all have the Lord Jesus within us, but He has not yet been transfigured in us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, we need Him to grow in us until by transfiguration He blossoms into the expression of the kingdom of God in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Seed Transfigured</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1:15 the Lord Jesus said, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then in the parable of the seed the Lord said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth 4:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later, in 9:1, the Lord told His disciples that some standing there would not taste death until they saw the kingdom of God come in power.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Immediately after speaking this word concerning the kingdom, the Lord Jesus was transfigured on the mountaintop before Peter, James, and John.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His transfiguration was the coming of the kingdom of God in power.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a strong indication that the kingdom of God is actually the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In chapter four of Mark we have the seed of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now in chapter nine this seed is transfigured, and this transfiguration of the seed is the coming of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you know why among many genuine Christians there is the lack of the kingdom of God today?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The reason is that among these Christians there is the lack of the transfiguration of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Christ who lives in so many believers is still a seed; He has not yet been transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This may also be our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yes, we have the Lord Jesus living within us, but we may not have given Him the opportunity to be transfigured in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, with us there may be only the seed of the kingdom, but not the appearing of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Appearing of the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the day of the Lord s transfiguration on the mountaintop there was the coming, the appearing, of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From this we see that in order to have the appearing of the kingdom from within us, we need to experience the Lord s being transfigured within us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Producing the Church Life</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Mark 9:1-3 proves that the kingdom of God is not a material realm.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have emphasized the fact that the kingdom of God is the transfiguration of the Person of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today such a transfiguration produces the church life, which is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This understanding of the church as the kingdom corresponds to Paul s word in Romans 14:17: The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the context, the kingdom of God in this verse refers to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>LIVING A LIFE OF GOD FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all need to see that God s eternal plan, which is His New Testament economy, is to dispense Himself as the Triune God into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to accomplish His plan, He was incarnated, becoming a man named Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When this man came out to preach, He began to sow Himself into God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, as the soil for the Lord s sowing, His chosen people had become fallen, damaged, and corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus brought this soil to the cross and crucified it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then He brought God s chosen people as the soil with Him into His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Through His death and resurrection, the Lord not only healed the soil, but also became the replacement for God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By replacing them with Himself, He made them His reproduction; that is, He made them the same as He.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He lived a life of God for the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He did not live a life of culture, religion, or ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now His followers should live the same kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that His followers should live a life of God for the development of God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is crucial for us to see that as God s people, as those who have been replaced by Christ and with Christ, we need to live a life that is absolutely of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not live a life that is of something other than the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Day by day we need to put this vision into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that instead of living a life of culture, religion, ethics, morality, philosophy, improvement of character, and of trying to be spiritual, scriptural, holy, and victorious, we need to live a life that is absolutely of God and for the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, a married brother should not try in himself to love his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Neither should he endeavor to be a pattern to others of what a good husband should be.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To have this thought is to miss the mark of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, it is to miss the vision of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to the vision of God s economy presented in the New Testament, as God s chosen people, those who have been replaced by and with Christ, we should live only a life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that if a married brother has the thought of trying to be a good husband, he should drop that thought and simply live a life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Such a brother needs to realize that he has been chosen by God and replaced by Christ, not that he should try in himself to be a good husband, but that he should live a life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He has not been destined to live a life of loving his wife; rather, he has been destined to live a life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, he should not live a life of culture, religion, or ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Instead of seeing these things, he should see Jesus only.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Eventually, he will live in a way that is much higher than culture, religion, ethics, or morality.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He will have a love for his wife that is much higher than his natural human love.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should not be occupied even with good things such as ethics and improvement of character or be frustrated by these things.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Instead, we should be occupied, thoroughly filled, with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The One who lived a life fully according to and for God s New Testament economy, the One who has replaced us with Himself, is now the Spirit living through us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should not allow anything other than this One to fill us and occupy us.</S>
