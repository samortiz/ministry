   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Fruit of a Good Tree</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second ground of the children of the kingdom for their walk and work is the fruit brought forth of a good tree Matt 7:15-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these verses there are grapes and figs and also thorns and thistles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These are from two sources.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have already seen that thorns and thistles come from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Genesis 3:18 Satan is revealed as the source of thorns and thistles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the New Testament we see that Christ as the very expression of God is the source of grapes and figs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These two sources are two lives.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Satan is the source of the life which brings forth thorns and thistles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ as God's expression is the source of the life which brings forth grapes and figs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Never be deceived by teachings and practices.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Check the fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fundamentalists may say that they are right, the Pentecostals may say that they are right, and the formal believers may say that they are right.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not be influenced by their claims, but consider their fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even if some of the local churches claim to be right, we should nevertheless check their fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is absolutely not a matter of teachings or claims; it is a matter of fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fruit is the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to know any person, group, or activity among today's Christians, we must check the fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Appreciation must be based upon the ground of the fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not be impressed by how much people talk and teach and claim.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should consider the fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus Himself told us clearly that there are two categories of fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The false persons would never admit that they are false; instead they would claim to be right.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we should not be affected by what people say, but consider the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even as we know a tree by its fruit, we should also know a work by its fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only care for the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the local church in a certain place is proper, we will surely see the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is the fruit?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That is something of life which expresses itself as grapes and figs, not as thorns and thistles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to know a church, an individual, and a work by their fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The fruit is the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Will of God</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The third ground is the will of God, not any works Matt 7:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The day is coming when many will appear before the Lord and say, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name do many works of power?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But the Lord will declare to them, "I never knew you; depart from Me, workers of lawlessness."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The same Greek word translated "knew" in Matthew 7:23 is rendered "allow" in Romans 7:15 by the King James Version.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Romans 7:15 Paul says, "For that which I do, I allow not."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This does not mean that he did not know, but that he did not allow it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here in Matthew 7:23, it is not that the Lord did not know them, but that the Lord did not allow them to do those works.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They prophesied, but the Lord never allowed them to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They cast out demons, but the Lord never allowed them to cast out demons in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They performed miracles, but the Lord never allowed them to do miracles in such a manner.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What the Lord wanted them to do was the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What is the will of God?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is the coming of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"Let Your kingdom come; let Your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth" Matt 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Epistles we are told that the will of God is the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Romans 12:2 says that we should not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds, that we may discern and know what the will of God is.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The will of God is unique to have the church, the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not a matter of prophesying, casting out demons, or performing miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is a matter of having the church life and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It may not seem logical to say that a person who is not in the will of God could perform miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How could a person who is outside of God's will work miracles?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Years ago I had the same thought.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, by experience I learned that people can do some miracles outside of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Recently, I learned of a man who performed many miracles in the name of the Lord, yet whose personal life was base and immoral.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now we can understand why the Lord will not deny the claims of people who will come to Him saying that they have done miracles in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord will not deny their claims, but He will tell them that He never allowed them to do those things.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Be careful!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not think that as long as your prophesy is fulfilled you are right.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do not think that the miracles you perform will justify you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even the casting out of demons, in itself, will not be your justification.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The only justification available to us is to seek the kingdom, because the unique will of God is to have the kingdom.</S>
