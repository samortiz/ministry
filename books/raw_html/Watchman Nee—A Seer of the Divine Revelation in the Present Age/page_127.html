Notes on Scriptural Messages</H2><P>After Watchman Nee discontinued The Christian and resumed The Present Testimony in 1928, the need for messages for young believers still remained. To fulfill this need he published his third paper, entitled Notes on Scriptural Messages. The following announcement appeared on the back cover of the collected volume for December 1933:</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>1) This paper was first issued in April 1930. By the end of 1933, forty-four issues have been published. The Lord willing, we hope to publish one issue per month.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>2) This paper is somewhat elementary. At times it covers the gospel, at other times the work and person of the Lord, and at still other times messages for edifying young believers.</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>The messages published in this paper, of which some titles are listed in chapter twenty-seven under the subtitle, "Books for the Edification of New Believers" (second group), were mainly for the edification of young believers.</P><P>This paper was eventually merged with The Christian, resumed in 1934, and became the first column of that paper.1</P>
