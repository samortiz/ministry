   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This word tells us that He is the creator of mankind and also is the source of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man is not only from Him, but is also taken care of and fed by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The human life is given by Him, and human existence is sustained by Him.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is the source of all mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without Him man could never have come into being, neither could there be any human living.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For we are also His offspring.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord s ruling of man This passage of the Scripture says that man came out of God and depends upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man is ruled and controlled by God.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whether you are born in China or in the United States, in a wealthy family or in a poor family, none of this is up to you.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God can be found Man always thinks that God is too mysterious, too far away from us, and that He cannot be found or apprehended.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the contrary, God can be found.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are able to realize something of God by the creation of this universe, the existence of all the things, and even by the existence of human life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore the Scripture says, For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world, being apprehended by the things made, are clearly seen...</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since we can apprehend God, then knowing God is not only a matter of outward perceiving, but also of inward reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To apprehend is to think and to reason within ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It involves psychological functioning.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we turn to our heart within, we know clearly that God exists.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, God can be found!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What should you do with God?</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the idols of gold, silver, wood, or stone are made by man, so how can we worship these idols?</S>
