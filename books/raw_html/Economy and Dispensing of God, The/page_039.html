<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY<br>IN PRODUCING THE MATERIALS<br>FOR THE DIVINE BUILDING</H2><P>God's dispensing is to dispense the Divine Trinity&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;into us. He is not dispensing to us blessings such as a good house, a good car, or a good daughter-in-law. Paul considered all such things as refuse (Phil. 3:8). They are not God's dispensing. God's dispensing is simply to dispense Himself in His three persons into us.</P><P>Our God is rich in His three persons. He is rich in the person of the Father, He is rich in the person of the Son, and He is rich in the person of the Spirit. The Divine Trinity is God's unsearchable riches. It is true that God is rich in light, power, life, love, holiness, righteousness, and thousands of other items. But in totality, God is rich in His Divine Trinity.</P><P>The divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity is for the producing of the materials for the divine building. The divine building is just the church of God as the Body of Christ. God has only one work today, that is, to build up the church as the Body of Christ. For any building, there is the need of material. In the divine building, we are the material. In order for us to be the proper material for God's building, we must be processed; we must pass through a number of steps.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God the Father So Loving<br>the World (Fallen Mankind)<br>That He Gave the Son to Mankind</H2><P>First, God the Father so loved the world that He gave the Son to mankind (John 3:16). This is the Father's dispensing. When the Father gave His Son to us, He gave Himself to us in the Son. If I give you a purse that contains twelve checks, it seems that you receive only a purse. Actually, you receive the twelve checks with the purse. Jesus Christ is the "purse." He is the embodiment of the riches of God. By Himself, Jesus seems to be merely a small purse. But in this "purse" there are many "checks." This is the Father's giving, and this giving is His dispensing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God the Son Redeeming Fallen Men That Everyone Who Believes in Him<br>May Have Eternal Life</H2><P>God the Son redeemed fallen men so that everyone who believes in the Son may have eternal life (John 3:14-15). The Son is the eternal life (John 11:25; 14:6). He is given by God the Father for His dispensing. Now the Son has accomplished redemption so that we may receive Him. When we receive Him, He becomes eternal life to us. The Father's giving is the Son, and the Son's giving is the eternal life.</P>
