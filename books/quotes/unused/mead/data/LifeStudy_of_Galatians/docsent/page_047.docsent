   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE SEVENTEEN THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO ABRAHAM Scripture Reading: Gal 3:6-11, 14, 16-17; Gen 12:7; Col 1:12b; Eph 3:6, 9, 11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When I first learned that long before Christ came the gospel was preached to Abraham, I was greatly surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Galatians 3:8 says, And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham: In you all the nations shall be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to Genesis 12:3, in Abraham all the nations would be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Genesis 12:7 the Lord went on to say to Abraham, Unto thy seed will I give this land.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are two main aspects of God s word to Abraham in Genesis 12: the first is that in him all nations would be blessed; the second is that the land would be given to Abraham s seed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Christ, Abraham s unique seed, the nations would be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, to this unique seed the land would be given.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was God s word to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Galatians 3:16 Paul refers to God s word to Abraham as a promise: To Abraham were the promises spoken and to his seed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then in verse 17 Paul goes on to speak of a covenant ratified beforehand by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that the promise God gave to Abraham became a covenant, which is more firm than a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word, the promise, and the covenant are the gospel which was preached to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The gospel is the covenant, the covenant is the promise, and the promise is the word spoken by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is important to see the difference between these four terms.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A word is common or ordinary, whereas a promise is much more specific.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you give a promise to someone, your word is not common; it is specific.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You promise to do certain things for that person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word God spoke to Abraham in Genesis 12 was not common; it was a specific word in which God promised Abraham that in him and in his seed the nations would be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have pointed out that in this chapter God also promised Abraham that his seed would possess the land.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because the word spoken to Abraham in Genesis 12 is very specific, it is a word of promise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Genesis 15 this promise became a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here God appeared to Abraham, and Abraham offered a sacrifice to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The sacrifice was divided, and God passed through it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was a custom in ancient times by which two parties ratified a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By walking through the sacrifice, these parties ratified a covenant in an official and proper manner.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this way the promise given in Genesis 12 was ratified as a covenant in Genesis 15.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then in Genesis 17 the covenant was confirmed by the sign of circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Galatians 3 Paul says that the word spoken to Abraham, the word which became a covenant confirmed by circumcision, was the gospel preached to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Galatians 3 we are given Paul s understanding and interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Perhaps this interpretation came as a revelation to Paul during the years he was alone with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul came to see that what God had spoken to Abraham was not just a promise or merely a covenant ratified and confirmed, but that it was the very gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this covenant, Paul learned, the main items of the new testament gospel were included.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, the covenant ratified with Abraham was a forerunner of the new covenant, of the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The new testament is a new covenant ratified by the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord offered Himself up as a sacrifice to God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In a sense, God walked through the sacrifice offered to Him on the cross by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This new covenant may be considered as either a repetition or a continuation of the covenant ratified with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The gospel we are preaching today is not merely a promise; it is also a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In message forty-one of the Life-study of Hebrews, we pointed out the difference between a covenant and a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A covenant refers to an agreement concerning things promised, but not yet accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A testament denotes an agreement in which the promised items have been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When all the items of the promise are accomplished, the covenant becomes a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The modern term for testament is will.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The new testament is the new will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A will is not an agreement in which the testator promises to do certain things for others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No, a will is a testament which says that the testator has already done certain things or given certain things to particular people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The gospel we preach is first a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Ultimately, however, it is a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the time of Abraham this gospel could not have been a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It could only have been a covenant in which God promised to bless all the nations in Abraham and to give the good land to Abraham s seed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Later, in Genesis 15, this promise became a ratified covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But for us the new covenant is a new testament because all the promised things have been accomplished by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All the nations have been blessed in Christ, and the good land has been given to Abraham s seed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, what we receive today is not a new covenant; it is a new testament, a new will.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This will is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul received a marvelous understanding of spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Without the revelation given to him, we would not have the confidence to say that the covenant ratified with Abraham was the gospel preached to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But Paul boldly declares that the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Apart from Paul s word in Galatians 3, we would not realize that God s word to Abraham was the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although the gospel is a matter of the new testament, it is important for us to realize that the new testament is a continuation or repetition of God s promise to Abraham.</S>
