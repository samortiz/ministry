   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Stirring Up an Atmosphere to Pursue the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we first started the work in Taiwan, we had only a few hundred brothers and sisters, but we very quickly increased to tens of thousands.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This increase would not have been possible without stirring up an atmosphere of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the same time, we also stirred up an atmosphere of pursuing the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once a person is saved, he desires to know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During this initial stage, we would share from Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, and eventually we began to release life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Note: These messages are different from the messages that currently constitute The Life-study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I will never forget that a certain brother would travel a long distance by car just to come to hear these messages because an atmosphere of pursuing the growth in life, of consecration, and of loving the Lord had been stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Stirring Up an Atmosphere</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>to Seek Out Our Brothers and Sisters</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hymns, #471 uses an 8.8.6.8.8.6. metrical form; that is, the words in each stanza are in two lines of eight syllables and one line of six syllables, which are repeated twice.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The sound is very regular and rhythmic.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I mention this hymn because I want to stir up an atmosphere of seeking out our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Stanza 1 says, How can I ever stay away / And grieve Thy Spirit all the day / While Thou dost wait for me?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>/ I now am willing to return, / And wait no longer, for I yearn / Henceforth to follow Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The last line of the first stanza says, Henceforth to follow Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we sing, our spirit will be stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we sing another verse, our spirit will go forth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we continue singing, we will desire to seek out people, just as the Lord Jesus did, who after being incarnated in the flesh, was willing to go to the cross because of His deep desire to gain man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have more than fifty thousand information cards with the names of our dear brothers and sisters in the Lord, but we do not know where many of them are currently living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These are our family members, but our care for them is so lacking that we do not even know where they are living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A PRAYER FOR THOSE WHO</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>HAVE NOT BEEN MEETING FOR A LONG TIME</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Lord, we are here before You.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Stir up an atmosphere among us so that we would receive a burden to take Your heart as our heart and to take Your love as our love.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are here before Your throne; may You especially remember these fifty thousand brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are touching Your throne of grace; we are praying for them and looking to You concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>O Lord, revive them and operate in them even as we are praying for them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May the indwelling Spirit cause them to have a renewed feeling; light the lamp within them, sweep them, and seek them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>O Lord, hear our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Cause us to truly receive a burden to bow our knees before You and pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>May each brother and sister receive ten, twenty, or thirty information cards, and seek out and visit these saints, one by one, until they find them and bring them back to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We pray that You would do this work not only in the hearts of a small number of saints but also in all who meet regularly so that everyone will have a sense of responsibility and a burden, realizing that we are members one of another.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many of the saints, who are wandering and lost, are still on this island.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We call on You, Lord, for mercy and grace; manifest Your works; use the outward environment and the inward sense to touch these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Stir not only in us but also in them, just as You worked in Peter and in Cornelius so that there would be a response on both sides.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Lord, recover these saints, one by one and household by household.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May You gain the glory, and may Your enemy be shamed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May blessing and grace be unto these brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Bless them, bless their family, bless their physical health, and bless their children.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Bless them in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Bless this country, this society, and especially the city of Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Lord, we thank You that You have caused this country to be prosperous, to be peaceful, and to have such a high standard of education so that we can all live and work in peace with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thank You for a situation that is so suitable for the work of the gospel and for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Lord, bless the authorities over us; visit our senior officials, and give them wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May their hearts be pure, and may they revere and fear You.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Lord, bless every country, city, and town that reveres You.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thank You for listening to our prayer and accepting our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Glory be to You.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>RECOVERING THE DORMANT SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The first move of the church must be to recover the saints who have not been meeting and those with whom we have lost contact.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to our records, this is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The church in Taipei has more than fifty thousand information cards.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we subtract the ones who meet regularly, the ones who have gone abroad, and the small number who have passed away, there are still at least forty-five thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Since the church in Taipei typically accounts for about half of the saints on Taiwan, there should be more than ninety thousand dormant saints on the whole island.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These saints are the harvest from our past labor and hard work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They were baptized, and they filled out information cards.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They are our family members, but they have all disappeared; therefore, we must take this matter seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now is the time to put the affairs of our household in order, and the first matter we should address is to find these saints in order to bring them back.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we would do this thoroughly by the Lord s grace, we could recover two-thirds of them within two to three years.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It would not be surprising to recover three to five thousand during the first half of this year, but recovering the majority will require a long-term effort by the saints who regularly meet in small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is something that requires labor, but at least two-thirds will be recovered if we do it well.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If thirty thousand saints are recovered, this will greatly strengthen the testimony and service of the church in Taipei.</S>
