        <h2 class="head1">THE SERVING ONES<br />
NEEDING TO INTENSIFY THE EXERCISE<br />
OF THE SPIRIT BY PRAYER</h2>
<p>We need to have a change of concept. We cannot merely read the Word, listen to messages, attend meetings, and read spiritual publications; we must also pray. We have paid much more attention to the aspect of the Word. It is true that our spiritual knowledge has increased, but we must consider the condition of our spirit. We have to confess that our spirit is not strong. Our spiritual knowledge surpasses the condition of our spirit. We understand spiritual principles, and we are able to express them, but we do not exercise our spirit; hence, it is not strong. Our concept has not yet turned from the Word to the Spirit. When we meet, we still depend on the ministry of the word, but we do not pay adequate attention to the supply of the Spirit.</p>
<p>We must have the Word and the Spirit. Without the Spirit, the Word is empty. If we have merely the Word without the element of the Spirit, the Word will become dead letter (2 Cor. 3:6). It is possible for us to have an increase in spiritual principles, spiritual doctrines, and spiritual knowledge and at the same time become weaker in our spirit. We must rise up and make up for our lack in the Spirit. This is not a matter of listening to messages, understanding messages, or reading the Bible. It is a matter of our spirit being strong. We must exercise our spirit more.</p>
<p>In order to experience the Lord, it is necessary to have spiritual knowledge, but it is even more necessary to exercise the spirit. Our touching and experiencing the Lord and our enjoying His riches depend on our exercising and using our spirit. There is a strong burden within me that we would have a change in concept so that we would depend more on the Spirit than on the Word; in the meetings we should supply the saints with the Spirit more than with the Word. This requires all the serving ones, including elders, co-workers, and responsible ones, to regularly exercise their spirit. We should not excuse ourselves. We must rise up to exercise our spirit. We must learn to exercise our spirit by prayer. We should pray not only in the meetings but also in private.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING TO PRAY IN THE MIDST<br />
OF A BUSY SCHEDULE</h2>
<p>Some responsible ones may say that they are too busy to pray. We will always be entangled with numerous trivial things because we live in the world. However, the Lord has arranged our environment for us so that we may learn to pray even when we are very busy. Such prayers are weighty and valuable.</p>
<p>Many Christians are idealistic; they think that they should be able to drop everything and find a very quiet place in order to draw near to the Lord in prayer and fellowship. Even if there were such an environment for us to pray, that kind of prayer may not be very valuable. We offer genuine prayers when we are in the battlefield; genuine prayers are spiritual battles. In the battlefield there is no extravagance. Soldiers are always in a rush. Even when they eat, they eat with one hand and hold their weapon with the other (cf. Neh. 4:17). This is the situation in the battlefield. Those with spiritual knowledge realize that this is also the environment for genuine prayers. When we are entangled with our children and domestic affairs, when our businesses are not doing well, or when we need to hurry to work every day, we do not have time to pray. Yet our prayers under such circumstances are genuine.</p>
<p>We should not think that we can pray only when we are in an undisturbed environment in which we can kneel down and pray for an hour without any interruptions. We do not despise such prayers, but according to our experience, many good prayers are in fragments: &ldquo;Here a little, there a little&rdquo; (Isa. 28:10). While we are praying, the doorbell might ring, the phone might ring, or our children might need urgent care. While we are praying, many things happen. It seems as though we do not even have the time to say, &ldquo;I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus, Amen!&rdquo; We need to be trained to pray in fragments; we need to be able to exercise our spirit in prayer in the midst of a busy schedule.</p>
<p>In this age many things compete for our time. We need to strive at school and strive at work; otherwise, we will be eliminated. Likewise, we need to be aggressive to seize the time for spiritual things. We should not imagine that we will be able to accomplish anything if we are loose or lax. This is especially true in the matter of prayer. On the one hand, such busy circumstances are Satan&rsquo;s subtle strategy to steal our time, but on the other hand, we must worship God because He has sovereignly arranged these circumstances for us to be trained.</p>
<p>We must see through Satan&rsquo;s subtlety. He is a subtle schemer who causes us to be busy and at the same time tells us that we do not have time to pray. As a result, we never have time to pray. We should not excuse ourselves and say that we are too busy to pray. Nor should we expect the Lord to deliver us from our busy affairs so that we can pray in a leisurely way. Such a concept is wrong, and it is Satan&rsquo;s subtle scheme. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we must exercise to watch and pray in the midst of our busy schedules.</p>
<p>In the mornings the sisters are busy preparing breakfast and sending their children to school. Even with such a busy schedule, the sisters still need to exercise to pray in spirit. If they cannot pray long prayers, they can still pray in fragments. This also applies to the brothers. While they are on their way to work, they should stir up their spirit in prayer. If we do not try to fight and seize the time, Satan will eat up our time every day. We must be awakened and must exercise to seize the opportunity to pray with our spirit in every kind of busy situation.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
