The sheepgate, one of the gates of the city of Jerusalem, signifies the door to traditional religion&#8217;s sheepfold (John 10:1). This was the gate for the people of God, who are His sheep, to enter into the fold for protection. The city of Jerusalem was a sheepfold to protect God&#8217;s people. Jerusalem with the sheepgate is also a sign. Only Christ, the living Son of God, can be the reality of what this sign depicts. Christ is our gate and also our city. In John 10:7 the Lord Jesus says clearly, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.&#8221; Then in verse 9 He again says, &#8220;I am the door.&#8221; Christ is the door not for the sheep to go into the fold, but for them to come out of the fold. Because we have Christ as our Shepherd, we do not need the fold. Christ is the gate, the door, for us to come out of the fold and enjoy Him as our pasture.<h2 class=head1>THE POOL OF BETHESDA</h2><p>The pool of Bethesda in 5:2 is also a sign. Bethesda means house of mercy, and the pool of Bethesda was the traditional place to receive mercy. The pool of Bethesda signifies that the religious people, who tried their best to keep their religion, realized their need for God&#8217;s mercy. This pool signifies that the real house of God&#8217;s mercy is the living Son of God.<h2 class=head1>FIVE PORCHES</h2><p>John 5:2 says that the pool of Bethesda had five porches. These porches were shelters to cover the needy ones. Under these shelters were those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered. The number five denotes responsibility, and the five porches here signify traditional religion&#8217;s shelter depending on man&#8217;s responsibility.<p>We have seen that these five porches sheltered the needy ones. Under the law, we are those who are sick, blind, lame, and withered. Now that Christ has come, we are no longer under the law, and we do not need the porches to shelter us. The man who was sick for thirty-eight years needed the porches to cover him. But after the Lord healed and enlivened him, he could carry his bed, and he no longer needed to lie under the cover of the porch.<h2 class=head1>THE MULTITUDE</h2><p>Verse 3 says, &#8220;In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, withered, waiting for the stirring of the water.&#8221; This multitude signifies that under the shelter of traditional religion there are many needy people who lack the life supply.<h2 class=head1>AN ANGEL OF THE LORD</h2><p>Verse 4 speaks of an angel of the Lord: &#8220;For an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool and stirred up the water. Whoever then stepped in first after the stirring up of the water was made well of whatever disease he was held by.&#8221; Here the angel signifies the agent through which the law was given (Gal. 3:19, 21), but which could not give life. Angels occupied an important position in the Jewish religion.<p>Here in John 5:4 we are told that the angel went down into the pool at certain seasons and stirred up the water. But this stirring up by the angel was not any help to the impotent man, for he could never be the first one to step into the pool after the stirring up of the water. He could not fulfill the requirement to be healed. This indicates the inadequacy of trying to keep the law. The law is complete and perfect, but it cannot give life to the impotent. In the sight of God the impotent man was dead. The law can do things for us under certain conditions and as long as certain requirements are fulfilled. But how can a dead person fulfill the requirements of the law? No matter how often the angel came and stirred up the water, this stirring up would not be effective for a dead person. A dead man cannot be helped by the stirring up of the water by an angel. He can be helped only by the Son of God who enlivens us and gives us life. The Son of God does not come to stir up the water; He comes to give life.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 64</div><br></body></html>
