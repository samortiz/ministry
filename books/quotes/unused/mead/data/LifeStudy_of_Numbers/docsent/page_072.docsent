   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Miriam Being Punished</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verses 10 through 12 we see that Miriam was punished.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why is it that although two rebelled, only one was punished?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why did God punish the female but not the male?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may think that the male had borne more responsibility and that he should have been punished instead of the female.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There were, I believe, two reasons why God punished Miriam but not Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, it is likely that Miriam took the lead in this rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She was the instigator, the initiator, who stirred up Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Miriam, not Aaron, was the main source.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, it is not at all seemly for a female to rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning rebellion, some allowance may be given to a male, but none should be given to a female.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God punished Miriam to warn and alarm all the females among the children of Israel so that they would not follow Miriam.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>a. Being Made Sick of Leprosy</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Miriam was punished by being made sick of leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"The cloud removed from over the tent; and behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And Aaron turned towards Miriam, and she was leprous" v. 10 . This was God's governmental dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Aaron Begging Moses for Her</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Aaron begged Moses for Miriam vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Aaron had been instigated by his sister, and now he became her mediator, her intercessor.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should learn from this not to follow an instigator.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we follow such a one, we may eventually have to beg on his behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In begging for Miriam, Aaron confessed their folly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my lord, do not lay upon us the sin in which we have done foolishly and have sinned" v. 11 . Then he went on to plead that she would not be as one dead.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Let her not be as one dead, the flesh of whom is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb" v. 12 . Aaron begged that Miriam would not die in such a pitiful way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moses Praying for Miriam's Healing</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moses prayed for Miriam's healing, saying, "Heal her, O God, I beg You" v. 13 . This is a further indication of Moses' meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If he had not been meek, he would not have prayed for her but instead would have let her die in her leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If someone rebelled against you, would you pray for the healing of that one?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Have you ever prayed in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God heard Moses' prayer and judged her by shutting her up outside the camp for seven days vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>14-15a .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The people were delayed on the march until Miriam was brought in again v. 15b . "After that, the people set out from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran" v. 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The principle in the case of Miriam and Aaron is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I hope that the Lord will speak more to you than I have spoken so that we all may learn the lesson.</S>
