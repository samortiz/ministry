   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FINE PEARL OF GREAT VALUE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church is also the fine pearl of great value.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The pearl is not hidden in the sea; instead, it comes out of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is another aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both precious stones and pearls are transformed items.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Precious stones are formed from a created substance that is subjected to high pressure and heat, and a pearl is formed from an oyster that is wounded by a small piece of sand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the grain of sand stays in the wound, the oyster secretes its life-juice around it, causing it to become a pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a picture of Christ as the living oyster coming into the world, the sea, being wounded by us, the sinners, and secreting His life over us in His resurrection to make us precious pearls for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church comes into being through regeneration as the issue of Christ s death and resurrection 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church has been regenerated, and it has also been transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the one hand, it is a pearl formed by regeneration in the Gentile world, and on the other hand, it is a transformed precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>CHRIST GIVING HIMSELF UP FOR THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>IN ORDER TO SANCTIFY HER,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>CLEANSING HER BY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE WASHING OF THE WATER IN THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order for the church to be produced as the treasure and the pearl for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose, Christ undertook four steps: He was crucified to pass through death, He resurrected, He ascended to the throne, and now He dwells within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, Christ today is the crucified Christ, the resurrected Christ, the ascended Christ, and the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may consider that Christ was crucified in order to take away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This thought is true, but it is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Ephesians 5:25-27 says, Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This corresponds with Matthew 13, in which Christ found a fine pearl and went to the cross to pay the price for it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ died on the cross to purchase the church because He loved the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moreover, Christ died on the cross in order to sanctify and cleanse the church to make her holy and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 4 of Ephesians 1 tells us that we were chosen to be holy and without blemish, but this verse does not show us the way to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The way is through the cross of Christ in chapter 5.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her in order to sanctify and cleanse the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To sanctify the church is to make it holy, and to cleanse the church is to make it without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is accomplished by the washing of the water in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is very profound.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we mean business with the Lord, we will be in the church and under the washing of the water in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even now as we are dealing with the word, the word is washing us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because He loved the church, Christ died on the cross so that the church may be sanctified to be holy and cleansed to be perfect by the washing of the water in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to have the church as a perfect pearl, Christ had to die on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Through His death we have been redeemed, and through His blood we have been forgiven v. 7 . This brings us back to the position where He can work on us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Consequently, we are now under the washing of the living water in the word to wash away our spots and wrinkles.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Wrinkles are due to oldness, and spots come from scars or wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Spiritually speaking, we are all old.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even the young people are old and full of wrinkles, and often they express this in their speaking, indicating that they have already passed through many things that have caused them to be old and full of wrinkles, spots, hurts, and wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Spots and wrinkles do not signify sins or worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They signify something of the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to have the church as the perfect pearl, Christ needed to die on the cross so that we might be redeemed back to a situation in which we can participate in the washing of the living water in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>CHRIST HAVING ABOLISHED</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE ORDINANCES ON THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>FOR THE PRODUCING AND LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>OF THE ONE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Ephesians 2:15 and 16 say, Abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace, and might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity by it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ has abolished not only sins, the world, wrinkles, and spots but also ordinances, regulations, rules, rituals, manners, and forms of living.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Different peoples all have their various ways of living.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The strongest ordinances are those that distinguish between the Jews and the Gentiles, but even the Japanese, Chinese, Germans, British, and Americans all have their own ways.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The American way is close to the British way, but there are still great differences that cause the two to be sometimes at enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All these ways are ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Through my traveling in America, I discovered that there are differing ordinances even among the Texans, New Yorkers, Californians, and New Englanders.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In some places white Christians do not meet together with black Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>None of these different peoples are able in themselves to come together in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nevertheless, God has chosen some from all these peoples with the intention to build them together as one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A certain ballad begins, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today, however, we say that East is no longer East, and West is no longer West; East and West now fit together by the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the cross Christ not only took away our sins, crucified our natural man, dealt with Satan, and destroyed the world, but He also slew the ordinances and rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All the hindrances, different ways of life, and different rituals, customs, manners, and ordinances have been abolished on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Not many Christians have paid adequate attention to Ephesians 2:15.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we asked what Christ accomplished on the cross, many would say that He took away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Certain Christians who are deeper in the Lord may say that Christ defeated Satan and destroyed the world.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some who are even deeper may say that Christ not only took away our sins and destroyed Satan and the world but also crucified our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, not many would say anything further.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For the sake of the church life, we must all see that on the cross another item was dealt with not only sins, the world, Satan, our flesh, and our old man but also our way of living.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must all forget our particular customs; otherwise, we cannot be the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Christ abolished, slew, all the ordinances on the cross so that He might create of two peoples, the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers, one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Naturally speaking, in certain places I do not like to eat the food people serve, but by the Lord s mercy I have learned to pass through the death of the cross and eat any kind of food.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>According to their ordinances, the Jews do not like to eat pork, but the Chinese often eat pork.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>How then can Jewish and Chinese believers come together at one table?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The wisdom of man is to form a Jewish church and a Chinese church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is what has happened today.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In New York there is a Chinese church, and in China there is the Church of England.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is impossible to have the new man in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The church has fallen from the proper situation into many divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, we thank the Lord that we have the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The cross has crossed out not only sins, the world, Satan, our flesh, our old man, and our old nature but also the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Some may say that the living of the new man is too difficult to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is why we need the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The church is produced and built up through the all-inclusive death of Christ on the cross, on which He crossed out every difference between the various peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Christ s death is basic for the producing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We may think that our sins, the world, our old man, and our old nature all need to be dealt with, but we may never have realized that there is another category of negative things our ordinances and manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>All these also have been dealt with.</S>
