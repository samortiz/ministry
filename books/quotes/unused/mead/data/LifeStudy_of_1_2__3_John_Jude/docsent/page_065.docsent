   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Vainglory of Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 16 John also mentions the vainglory of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that the vainglory of life is the empty pride, boast, confidence, assurance, and display of material things of the present life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here the Greek word rendered life is bios, a word that refers to physical life, and also to the present life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It differs from the Greek word zoe used in 1:1-2, a word that refers to the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the New Testament three Greek words are used for life: zoe, which refers to the divine life, the life of God; psuche, which refers to our human life, our soulish or psychological life; and bios, which refers to physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Greek word bios also denotes the present life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the vainglory of life means the vainglory of the present life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whatever takes place in human society is the present life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With this present, earthly life there is vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This vainglory includes empty pride, boast, confidence, assurance, and display of material things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE CONTENTS OF THE SATANIC SYSTEM</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have seen that the world in 2:15 denotes an evil, satanic, anti-God system that is constituted of the things created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Satan has used these things to form his system.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, these things are not the contents of the satanic world system.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This system comprises the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of the present life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, God has created different kinds of food.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without food we cannot survive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, Satan uses food to form a satanic system.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This does not mean, however, that food is part of the contents of Satan s evil system.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Farming and industry are also necessary for human life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It would be impossible for us to survive without farming and industry.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Satan has utilized farming and industry in forming his evil system.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But these things in themselves are not the contents of the world system formed by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What, then are the contents of the satanic system?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The contents of this system are the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not easy to differentiate between the things, matters, and persons used by Satan to constitute his evil system and the actual contents of this world system.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Your car and house may be used by Satan to constitute the anti-God world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But neither your car nor your house is part of the contents of Satan s evil system.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I would emphasize again that the contents of Satan s system is the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of this present life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may use owning a car as an illustration of the difference between something used by Satan to form his system and the actual contents of this system.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How can a car be utilized by the enemy of God to form his evil system?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The car itself is not a problem and is not the content of Satan s system.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The problem is with the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and, in particular, with the vainglory of the present life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If it were not for man s vainglory, a car would not become a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, many people like to buy an expensive car in order to make a display.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In their case, the car they drive is used for vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this country a car is a necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The problem, therefore, is not with the car itself; the problem is with the lust of the eyes and the pride of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When you consider a certain kind of car, you may desire to have it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some may think about a certain car day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The car is not wrong the persons are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The problem is not with the car they need; the problem is with the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As further illustrations, we may also refer to our need for clothing and housing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A dwelling place is a necessity, and clothing also is a necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once again, the problem is not with the house or the clothes; these are not the actual contents of the world system.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The problem is with the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life, for these are the contents of Satan s evil system.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>TWO TRINITIES</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to the Bible, the world is against the Father v. 15 , the Devil is against the Son 3:8 , and the flesh is against the Spirit Gal 5:17 . On the one hand, we have the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the other hand, we have an evil trinity the world, Satan, and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we enjoy the Divine Trinity, we shall have nothing to do with the evil trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE FATHER AND HIS WILL</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In verse 17 John goes on to say, And the world is passing away, and its lust, but he who practices the will of God abides forever.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As the world is against God the Father, so the things in the world v. 15 , which are its lust, are against the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the positive side, we have the Father and His will.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the negative side, we have the world and all the things in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The world is against the Father, and the things in the world are against the will of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to John s word in verse 17, the world is passing away and its lust, but he who practices the will of God abides forever.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To practice the will of God is to do the will of God habitually and continually, not merely occasionally.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The world, its lust, and those who love the world are passing away.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But God, His will, and those who do His will abide forever.</S>
