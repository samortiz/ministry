        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LORD&rsquo;S SERVING ONES<br />
NEEDING A NEW BEGINNING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S. S. 1:2-3; 3:1-4; 5:2</h1>
<p>Of the sixty-six books of the Bible, only Song of Songs describes the path for pursuing the Lord. No other book in the Bible shows the stages of pursuing the Lord as clearly as Song of Songs. In this chapter we will consider our pursuit of the Lord based on Song of Songs.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR CHARACTERISTICS OF PURSUING THE LORD</h2>
<p>Song of Songs presents at least four characteristics concerning our pursuing the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Many Beginnings, Many Processes,<br />
and Many Endings</h2>
<p>According to Song of Songs, a seeker does not have only one beginning, one course, and one ending in his pursuit of the Lord. On the contrary, our pursuit of the Lord has many beginnings, many courses, and many endings. There is an initial beginning, followed by a course and an ending. Then there is a pause, which lasts for a period of time. After the pause there is another beginning in our pursuit, another course, and another ending, after which there is another pause. This book has at least six beginnings with six courses and six endings (1:2&mdash;2:7; 2:8&mdash;3:5; 3:6&mdash;5:1; 5:2&mdash;6:13; 7:1-13; 8:1-14). Each section with its beginning, course, and ending is a song. Hence, this book has six songs, and each song has a beginning, a course, and an ending.</p>
<p>This is the reason that verses are repeated two or three times in Song of Songs. For example, verse 4 of chapter 8 says, &ldquo;I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, / Do not rouse up or awaken my love / Until she pleases.&rdquo; This verse, which is spoken after the seeker has gone through one course and reached an ending, is also in verse 7 of chapter 2 and verse 5 of chapter 3. This shows that in our experience of pursuing the Lord, there are many beginnings, many courses, and many endings.</p>
<p>On the one hand, a seeking Christian who stumbles in the midst of a course will be able to rise up. On the other hand, even if a seeking Christian does not stumble, his pursuit of the Lord in a particular course will come to an end. We must be clear that according to what is portrayed in Song of Songs, our pursuit of the Lord does not have only one beginning that involves one course and one ending. We must also be clear that it is erroneous to think that stumbling or coming to a pause means that we have fallen. Stumbling or coming to a pause does not mean that we have fallen.</p>
<p>There are many brothers and sisters, however, whose spiritual condition is not normal. They begin to pursue the Lord, but after a period of time they stumble because they have a problem with the Lord; that is, their pursuit is interrupted in the midst of a course. It is only after a period of time that these believers are revived and begin to pursue the Lord again. We must not confuse such experiences with that of a normal Christian, who needs new beginnings even though he does not have any problems with the Lord. The Shulammite in Song of Songs has many beginnings and many pauses while she seeks her beloved. Hence, our spiritual experience is in stages, consisting of a beginning, a course, an ending, and then a pause. This is a special characteristic in Song of Songs.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Beginning of Our Pursuit<br />
Having Two Aspects</h2>
<p>According to Song of Songs, the beginning of one stage of our pursuit can differ from the beginning of another stage. Some stages begin because the Lord draws us, but other stages begin because we are hungry for the Lord. For example, in the first stage it is hard to determine whether the seeker pursues her beloved because he draws her or because of her desire. Her pursuit in the first stage is probably the result of both. In the beginning of this stage she says, &ldquo;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!&rdquo; (1:2a). It seems that she is taking the initiative to pursue her beloved. However, immediately following this she says, &ldquo;For your love is better than wine. / Your anointing oils have a pleasant fragrance; / Your name is like ointment poured forth; / Therefore the virgins love you&rdquo; (vv. 2b-3). This shows that she is drawn by her beloved. Therefore, in the initial stage of our pursuit it is hard to determine whether we are pursuing the Lord, or He is drawing us.</p>
<p>In some of the later stages the seeker pursues her beloved without his drawing her. For example, in verses 1 and 2 of chapter 3 the seeker is not being drawn, but she still pursues her beloved. She says, &ldquo;On my bed night after night / I sought him whom my soul loves; / I sought him, but found him not. / I will rise now and go about in the city; / In the streets and in the squares / I will seek him whom my soul loves.&rdquo; These verses begin with her seeking, not with her being drawn. In verse 2 of chapter 5 she says, &ldquo;I sleep, but my heart is awake. / A sound! My beloved is knocking. / Open to me, my sister, my love, / My dove, my perfect one; / For my head is drenched with dew, / My locks with the drops of night.&rdquo; This is the beloved drawing the Shulammite. This is not her initiating the seeking. Thus, there are two aspects to the beginning of our seeking of the Lord. One aspect is that the Lord comes and draws us. The emphasis of this aspect is His appearing. When the Lord appears to us and draws us, we rise up to seek Him. The other aspect is that we take the initiative to pursue the Lord. Although we taste the Lord&rsquo;s sweetness in our fellowship with Him, after a period of time we feel unsatisfied and therefore have a desire to pursue Him again.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Reaching a State of Fullness in Every Stage</h2>
<p>In terms of the Lord&rsquo;s presence, we can reach a state of fullness in every stage of our spiritual pursuit. For example, in the first stage the seeker feasted with her beloved at his table (1:12). Poetic expressions, such as &ldquo;Our couch is green,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The beams of our house are cedars&rdquo; (vv. 16-17), show that she fully enjoys her beloved&rsquo;s presence. After seeking and eventually finding her beloved in chapter 3, the Shulammite brings him into the chamber of the one who conceived her (v. 4). This portrays our being brought into the grace of God to fully enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence. This shows our reaching the fullness of the Lord&rsquo;s presence yet again. Hence, the course in each stage of our spiritual pursuit issues in a fullness of the Lord&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The State of Fullness in Every Stage<br />
Coming to an End</h2>
<p>Song of Songs reveals that at the end of every stage, a seeker of the Lord will always feel unsatisfied. Hence, there is an end to the sense of satisfaction reached in the fullness. This end enables us to begin a new pursuit.</p>
<p>These four characteristics enable us to understand our experience of pursuing the Lord. We will now apply these characteristics to our experience.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
