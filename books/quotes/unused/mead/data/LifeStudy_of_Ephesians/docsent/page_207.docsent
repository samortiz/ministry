   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ROOTED AND GROUNDED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Christ makes His home in us, we shall enjoy Him as unlimited love.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the words of 3:17, we shall be rooted and grounded in love.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are rooted in Christ for growth, and we are grounded in Him for building.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>FILLED</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we are strengthened into our inner man, when Christ makes His home in our hearts, and when we are rooted and grounded in love, we are filled unto all the fullness of God 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is in our spirit that we are filled unto all the fullness of the Triune God to become His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>GIFTED</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 4:7 Paul says, But to each one of us was given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because every member has received grace, every member is a gift to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No matter how insignificant we may be, we all are gifted.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not think that Peter, James, John, and Paul were gifted and that you are not.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since we all are gifted, we should all function in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many times it is not as helpful for an elder to say a certain thing as it is for one of the other saints to say the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God has accomplished a complete work for us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In view of such a work, we should learn to function.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the points we have covered thus far leave us without any excuse for not functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Is it not true that all these wonderful things have been accomplished for us?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have been chosen, predestinated, loved, called, redeemed, reconciled, saved, graced, made alive, raised up, seated, purchased, sealed, possessed, guaranteed, created, made near, enlightened, strengthened, indwelt, rooted, grounded, and filled.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Is it possible to have all this without being gifted?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Surely it is not possible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Praise the Lord, we all are gifted!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have pointed out a number of times that the Lord hates the deeds of the Nicolaitans Rev 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that He hates the clergy-laity system, which is an abomination in His sight.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nevertheless, because of the influence of degraded Christianity, many still do not function in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to cast off this influence, we all must learn to function.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>PERFECTED</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 4:12 Paul goes on to speak of the perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Greek word translated perfecting may also be rendered equipping.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As those who are gifted, we perfect and equip one another with our gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some may argue that only the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers can perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 16, however, speaks of every joint of supply and of the operation in the measure of each part.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all are parts of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we function, we shall help others to be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In addition, as we function, we are the first to be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every time I minister the Word, I am the first to receive the benefit of my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all need to perfect others and to be perfected by functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you have the sense that you have been perfected through functioning, that is an indication that others have been perfected also.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>May we all perfect one another.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>GROWING UP</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The result of being perfected is that we grow up into Christ 4:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We perfect one another by helping one another grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To perfect the saints is to nourish them by feeding them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I can testify that I have received much nourishment from the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This nourishment has helped me to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>FITTED TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to 4:16, the Body is fitted together.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is for building.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How much we have been fitted together with others depends on our perfection and growth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Through nourishment we grow, and through growth we are fitted together with the saints.</S>
