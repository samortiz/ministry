 <h2 class="head1">THE TRUTH BEING THE URGENT NEED TODAY</h2>
<p>Today the truth is needed everywhere. Not only the non-Christians do not know the truth; even many Christians do not know the truth. However, the Lord has given us many rich truths. Even our gospel hymns are full of precious truths. For example, the first stanza of <em>Hymns,</em> #1058 says, &ldquo;Rock of Ages, cleft for me, / Let me hide myself in Thee; / Let the water and the blood, / From Thy riven side which flowed, / Be of sin the double cure, / Save me from its guilt and power.&rdquo; Here it mentions <em>the water and the blood, the double cure,</em> and <em>guilt and power.</em> Even many saints among us may not know the meanings of these phrases. Here the double cure refers to the cure of our outward sinful acts and our inward sinful nature. The blood refers to the precious blood shed by the Lord to deal with our outward sinful acts (John 1:29; Heb. 9:22), and the water refers to the life imparted by the Lord to deal with our inward sinful nature (John 19:34). The precious blood of the Lord redeems us from the eternal punishment we deserve due to our sinful acts, and His life saves us from the power of our sinful nature.</p>
<p>If we have a thorough understanding of this hymn, we will be able to preach the high gospel to people. We may invite someone to sing this hymn with us and then explain it to him. This would be a very good gospel message. After hearing this, he will be surprised and will respect the excellence and mysteriousness of the content of the gospel. When we speak to him, the Holy Spirit will work in him. Then we could sing this hymn with him again. In this way, he would probably be saved in less than half an hour. We should not say anything about perdition and &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; or even prosperity and peace. Instead, we should speak only about Christ Jesus, the Rock of Ages, who was crucified for us, and out from whose riven side came blood for redeeming us from the eternal punishment that we deserved due to our sins, and water for saving us out of the power of sin. This kind of simple but excellent singing and speaking, matched by the working of the Holy Spirit, will lead people to salvation. This is the proper way to preach the gospel today.</p>
<p>First Timothy 3:15b says, &ldquo;The church...the pillar and base of the truth.&rdquo; This indicates that without the truth, there would be no church. The truth brings in life, and once we have life, we become the church. In addition, the unique commission of the church today is to preach the gospel, the content of which is the truth. The truth tells us one central point: the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is dispensing Himself into us&mdash;sinful, tripartite men&mdash;that our sins may be forgiven and that we may receive God&rsquo;s life and have God Himself in us for our transformation into the sons of God. This is the truth and the gospel. We must learn the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR COOPERATION BY PRAYER</h2>
<p>Once we have learned the truth, we have to go out to preach. However, before we go out to speak, we must pray. The proper sequence is first to pray and then to preach. Merely having the truth without the Spirit does not work. Once we have the truth, we also have to pray that we may be filled with the Spirit inwardly. Otherwise, we will be like a flat tire, without the strength to move. In Acts 6:4 Peter said, &ldquo;We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.&rdquo; This indicates that prayer precedes preaching. We must continually pray for those who are in our hearts&mdash;our relatives, friends, and neighbors who are surrounding us. Once we pray, we will be filled and saturated with the Spirit. With the truth and the infilling of the Holy Spirit, we will be equipped to go out to preach the gospel to others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPECIFIC PRACTICAL STEPS<br />
FOR THE SPREADING OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Opening Our Homes<br />
for the Preaching of the Gospel</h2>
<p>We have to encourage all the saints, no matter what their situation, to open their homes for the gospel. We even have to motivate the saints who are weak and the saints who have not been meeting for a long time to open their homes. This is a tremendous task, and it requires the responsible brothers and full-timers to put in all their effort. If a church has over one hundred open homes, and every home preaches the gospel at least once a week, the number of people will be doubled in just half a year. This will not only recover those saints who have not been meeting for a long time but will also cause their unsaved family members, friends, neighbors, classmates, and colleagues to be saved through hearing and believing the gospel.</p>
<p>In the Bible the best pattern of home gospel preaching is seen in the house of Cornelius. Not only he himself was saved, but he also brought his whole household to be saved. When the angel told him, &ldquo;And now send men to Joppa and send for a certain Simon, who is surnamed Peter,&rdquo; he immediately sent people to Joppa and called together his relatives and intimate friends to his house (Acts 10:5-8, 24-27). This is why when Peter entered his house, not only was his family there but also his relatives and intimate friends. This is a good pattern showing that while we are the mouthpieces for preaching the gospel, our homes are the outlets for preaching the gospel.</p>
<p>We must preach the gospel through our homes. The best way to invite people to your home is to invite them for meals or to prepare the best refreshments for them. When the best refreshments get into their stomachs, their hearts will be opened. As long as the best refreshments can get into their stomachs, the Lord Jesus will gain an excellent opportunity to come into their spirits. How worthwhile and meaningful this is!</p>
<p>The first stanza and chorus of <em>Hymns,</em> #921 say, &ldquo;Rescue the perishing, / Care for the dying, / Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave; / Weep o&rsquo;er the erring one, / Lift up the fallen, / Tell them of Jesus the mighty to save. / Rescue the perishing, / Care for the dying; / Jesus is merciful, / Jesus will save.&rdquo; As long as we are willing to open our homes, prepare the best refreshments, and invite our relatives and friends to come, they surely will be saved. This is the best way to preach the gospel. I hope that from now on, every saint would open his home for the preaching of the gospel, and every saint&rsquo;s home would be a gospel station for the preaching of the gospel once a week or at least once every two weeks.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching the Gospel on the Campuses</h2>
<p>Moreover, owing to the universality of education, there are many schools in many different places. The campuses are like fishponds, and the students are like the fish. All the &ldquo;fish&rdquo; have been gathered in the &ldquo;fishponds,&rdquo; so we must go to every college, high school, and elementary school to preach the gospel. This requires some specific ones in every church to receive the burden to serve in the gospel on the campuses and seek all kinds of opportunities to go to the campuses to preach the gospel. On the other hand, this also requires a large number of full-timers to be raised up, especially the full-timers who have just graduated from college, because it is easy for them to go to the college campuses to preach the gospel to the college students. This is why we encourage the saints who are in school to consecrate two years after college to serve the Lord full-time. If the full-timers really have the burden to continue to preach the gospel at the colleges, this would be another profitable way to preach the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching the Gospel to the Children</h2>
<p>The third way of gospel preaching is to preach the gospel to the children. This requires the sisters to pick up the burden. It is not necessary to use the meeting hall as the place for the gospel meeting. Rather, it is best to meet at the saints&rsquo; homes. Use the weekends to gather the children from your neighborhood and to invite the children of your relatives and friends to your home. Many times parents are saved through their children, so do not overlook the children&rsquo;s work. If, starting from now, we use our effort to work on the gospel for children whose ages range from six to twelve, then after ten or twelve years, they will be those who will rise up to bear the responsibility of the church service. This way may seem slow, but it is actually very fast. This way is also profitable.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching the Gospel to People of All Levels</h2>
<p>The fourth way is to preach the gospel to people of all levels. Most of our brothers and sisters work in different professions, trades, and circles; they may be in schools, hospitals, factories, corporations, government bureaus, or private organizations. Wherever we are, we should exercise our influence by preaching the gospel to everyone whom we contact.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOSPEL BEING<br />
THE WAY FOR THE LORD TO GO FORTH</h2>
<p>If we preach the gospel in these four ways simultaneously, it will not be difficult to double the number of the people in the churches in a year. If all of us would rise up to learn the truth, pursue the growth in life, live the normal church life, and preach the truth as the gospel, one year later every brother and sister will be strong, and the churches will also be enriched and fruitful. Not only will the number be doubled, but the meeting also will not be short of flavor and riches. May we all receive this burden and practice accordingly in every place, leading the saints to learn the truth in a serious way and encouraging them to pursue the growth in life, to go out to preach the gospel, and to bring people to the Lord and into the church. This will allow the Lord to have a way to go forth and will also bring Him back.</p>
