   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is a very precious thought in the Bible: God treasures man's aspiration for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The story of Moses shows us that he had an aspiration to save the Israelites on God's behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although he was not used by God until he was eighty years old, his aspiration did not begin at the age of eighty; it was there when he was forty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God did not forget his aspiration during the next forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He came back to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not only do we see this in Moses, we see this in the story of Samuel as well.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hannah prayed to the Lord and vowed, "If thou wilt...give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life" 1 Sam 1:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God gained Samuel and accomplished His purpose through him in that age because Samuel's mother had an aspiration toward God concerning her son.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God cares for man's aspiration toward Him; He treasures such an aspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we read God's Word carefully, we will find that God only gives spiritual life and light to one kind of people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Who are these people?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are the ones who have an aspiration to be used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The same is true in the case of spiritual power.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No spiritual power is outward.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All spiritual power comes as a result of man's aspiration for God and his consecration to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Genuine power is based on man's heart toward God and his love for God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the Old Testament Samson was very powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His enemy, the Philistines, did not know the source of his power; through Delilah they found out that his strength was with his hair.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once his hair was cut, he lost his power Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>16:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What was his hair?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was the hair of a Nazarite.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A Nazarite is one who is fully consecrated to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All genuine spiritual power comes from one's consecration to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a person is not thorough with his consecration, he is still crippled and powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if a person has a thorough consecration before the Lord, he will become powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No matter how seeking we have been, we must always remember that power comes from consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose God puts His hand on a sister, and she struggles with the Lord for a long time without yielding to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although she is willing to pray with others, her condition is not healthy because she has not satisfied God's demand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No matter how much she tries to help others, she cannot have a breakthrough.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One day when God's love constrains her, she decides tearfully to yield to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once she answers God's demand, the help she renders to others will begin to touch others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is why we say that power comes from consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more consecration we have, the more power God will give to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some may ask: "Why is it that others can have the light, but I do not have the light?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the story of Samson, whenever his hair was shaved, his power was gone, and he lost his eyes Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>16:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not have the light and we are blind because we do not have a thorough consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord said, "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The lamp of the body is the eye....But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Matt 6:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The degree to which our heart is turned to the Lord determines the degree to which our spiritual eyes are opened within.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God's children do not have light because they do not have a heart for God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They do not have power because their consecration is too little.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When our heart is not turned to God sufficiently, when our consecration is inadequate, and when we do not answer God's demand completely, God cannot get through in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If our consecration is thorough, it will bring in spiritual riches and heavenly blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I believe that when all the brothers and sisters are for the Lord and are thoroughly consecrated, the gospel will be preached everywhere and heavenly blessings will pour down everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Brothers and sisters, there is no other way to genuine power, light, and heavenly riches except through answering God's demand.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The amount of consecration we have to God determines the amount of power we have from God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>May we not hinder Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order for God to have a way, our heart must be turned toward Him; we must answer His demand and allow Him to flow through us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Otherwise, we will only hinder our God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God desires that we turn our heart to Him and answer His demand.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In His work God needs man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we do not answer His demand, He will have to find someone else to answer Him and carry out His will.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May God strengthen our aspiration toward Him, and may His will be carried out through us.</S>
