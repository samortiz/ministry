	 <h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE IN TAIPEI</h2>
<p>More than thirty years ago we began the service in Taipei. Our first meeting hall was on Ren Ai Road. In 1949 the number of people in the church increased thirtyfold. We went from a little over thirty saints to nine hundred. This made it impossible to continue meeting in one hall, so we split into districts. Every district met in a separate hall, and we called these meetings district meetings. Later the number of saints continued to increase. It was truly the Lord&rsquo;s leading that in six to seven years we had an increase of one hundred percent; our numbers reached fifty thousand. Regrettably, when Brother Sparks came, he diluted this situation. Our original intention in inviting Brother Sparks was for spiritual help. We never expected that he did not care for the ground of the church and for the practice of the church; he did not even care if there was a church.</p>
<p>A person must take care of his health because his body supports his soul. Then his spirit can be enlivened. The work of Brother Sparks did not take care of this principle; it only cared for being spiritual. This can be compared to caring for a person by educating him but not feeding him. Eventually the person will die. It is better not to risk one&rsquo;s health and posterity merely for the sake of education. Otherwise, a person has no real glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DISTRACTED BY BROTHER SPARKS</h2>
<p>Brother Sparks&rsquo;s mistake was that he did not have a second generation. The brothers among us who were influenced by Brother Sparks have experienced this same end. They said that they saw the vision, but after more than twenty years, we do not see the issue of their vision. They do not have a second generation. Due to the influence of Brother Sparks, we stopped increasing. From 1957 to 1958 our numbers reached fifty thousand. Today there are less than fifty thousand brothers and sisters on the entire island. For the past twenty years our work has been able only to fill in the gaps left by people becoming old and dying or becoming cold and backslidden or emigrating. Our numbers are not even at fifty thousand, because we gave up our initial practice of meeting in districts and groups.</p>
<p>We must see that meeting in homes by districts and in groups is not organization. It is to meet a practical need, and can be compared to the Lord Jesus&rsquo; feeding the five thousand. Groups and homes are referred to in the Bible. Groups are in Mark 6:39-40 where the Lord Jesus told the people to sit down in groups; homes are referred to in Acts 2:46 when the early saints broke bread and met from house to house.</p>
<p>In the church life there is the need for arrangements with respect to service. For example, when we have a conference for more than ten thousand people, we make many arrangements for the needs of the meetings; however, this is not organization but, rather, coordination. We should not say that coordination is not important. It is like a person who eats three meals a day to meet the needs of his body so that he can continue to live. Furthermore, he cannot fail to take a shower and wash his face every day, since these are related to human life. Otherwise, he will have problems. Any arrangement that we make for our existence is not a matter of organization but of necessity. Philip&rsquo;s true ministry was that of an evangelist, but when a temporary need arose, he helped with serving tables. Even if you arrange the meeting place or help with the electrical equipment, you can still function as an apostle, as a prophet, or as an evangelist, just like Stephen and Philip.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING THE SECRET FROM THE LORD</h2>
<p>On the one hand, we must understand that we do not have organization and that we make arrangements to meet the needs in the church. On the other hand, we must be clear that these practical arrangements are not necessarily related to our gift. For example, after a mother arranges all the meals for her children in the home, she still has to work in her profession; and after the children finish eating their meal, they still must go to school to obtain an education. Some things are done out of necessity, and others are done as our profession. The things that we need to do should not be considered as matters of organization. At the same time, these things cannot really be considered as service. For service, we must learn to function in life, not just out of necessity.</p>
<p>Most Christians do not understand this. They think that our conferences are a matter of organization. Some people even say that I am the best organizer. They say that the main reason our work flourishes and we have large numbers is that I am able to organize people.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost, Peter and the apostles baptized three thousand people. At that time there were one hundred and twenty serving ones, including the sisters. We believe that the sisters did not baptize anyone and that only the brothers baptized. How did they baptize three thousand people? We need to learn the secret from the Lord.</p>
<p>In 1950 I went to Manila and lived there for three to four months to lead the saints to preach the gospel. By the spring of the next year more than two hundred young people wanted to be baptized. The elders were worried because they had never baptized so many people on the same day. They wondered how this would be accomplished. Since it took them about fifteen minutes to baptize one person, they felt that they would be able to baptize only about four people in an hour. I trained them to arrange the people into groups, and then while one group went into the water, another group would be changing their clothes. There were also saints who were mopping the floor. In this way we baptized all the young people in less than two hours. This was an example of arranging the people to sit down in groups and giving them bread to eat.</p>
<p>We are here to experience life; however, in the process of experiencing life, we must coordinate practical matters. We thank the Lord that from the early days in mainland China and in Taiwan our practice has been for the saints to serve without organization. Even if a brother is an evangelist, when there is a need, he can serve in the meeting hall and work with electrical equipment. In addition, he can still carry out his spiritual ministry. We all should have such an understanding.</p>
