Becoming a Complete Failure</H2><P>Peter was absolutely defeated and became a complete failure (Matt. 26:69-75). He did have a heart to love the Lord, but he was too confident in his own strength, his natural strength. His love for the Lord was precious, but his natural strength had to be denied and dealt with. The Lord allowed Peter to fail utterly in denying the Lord to His face three times, so that his natural strength and self-confidence could be dealt with.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Learning to Serve the Brothers<br>by Faith in the Lord and with Humility</H2><P>Through his failure, Peter learned to serve the brothers by faith in the Lord and with humility (Luke 22:32; 1 Pet. 5:5-6). Peter was really broken and was turned from the natural ability to something in resurrection.</P><P>We surely have to impress the brothers and sisters with this message. They all must learn this one lesson: to reject the natural strength and ability. Our natural strength and ability must be dealt with and put on the cross. Then they will be in resurrection and full of the divine element. Then whatever we do in the church service will be a ministry of the divine element to others. If our natural strength and ability are not dealt with, we will minister something natural to people by our church service.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_102.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Basic Lessons on Service &nbsp; pg 103</div><br></body></html>
