[1]  One of the most important and practical things in the life of a Christian is to live in fellowship with the Lord.
[2]  The fellowship which is ours is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.
[3]  When we believed into the Son of God, He entered into us, and we received the divine life.
[4]  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
[5]  Hence, our fellowship with the Lord is according to the Holy Spirit in our spirit in the flow of the divine life, that we may have a direct, intimate contact with God.
[6]  But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.
[7]  God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
[8]  The more we enter into fellowship with the Lord, the more we enjoy Him as our portion from God, and the more we are filled and occupied by Him.
[9]  After a person is saved, if he desires to grow in life and to allow God to do a thorough work on him, he must consecrate himself to God.
[10]  I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service.
[11]  When we consecrate ourselves to God we are saying that we consent to His working on us, in order that He may work Himself with all His riches into our being.
[12]  After a saved person has consecrated himself, he should learn to live in the spirit and walk according to the spirit.
[13]  May your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[14]  Through such a process, the Spirit of God, who formerly possessed only divinity, is now compounded with the elements of Christ s humanity, His human living, the effectiveness and fragrance of His death, and the power and effectiveness of His resurrection, to become an all-inclusive Spirit.
[15]  As such a Spirit, He comes with all His riches into our regenerated spirit to join Himself to us to be our life and everything.
[16]  As therefore you received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.
[17]  In the previous lessons we saw that the Christ who passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, and ultimately became the Spirit, has now entered into us to be our life.
[18]  In this lesson we will help you to know more concerning this living person, that you may enjoy Him more and apply Him to your daily life in a practical way.
[19]  God has made Him both Lord and Christ this Jesus whom you crucified.
[20]  If we drink of the Spirit by calling on His name and pray-reading His Word often, we will receive a continual supply to experience Christ.
[21]  Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.
[22]  If we daily pray His word and sing His word, and let His word dwell in us richly, we will be nourished and strengthened to experience Christ.
[23]  If we continually experience Christ and receive Him as our life and everything, we will become the expression of Christ.
[24]  After we are saved and have come to know the Lord Jesus Christ, we still need to go on to know the church.
[25]  THE CHURCH IS THE CONGREGATION OF THE CALLED ONES
[26]  THE CHURCH IS THE HOUSE OF THE LIVING GOD
[27]  Having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His God s will.
[28]  The meaning of sonship through Jesus Christ is that through Him we are redeemed and regenerated to become the children of God, possessing the life and position of God s children.
[29]  Since the church is the Body of Christ, she is the same as Christ in life and nature.
