   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A FEW REMINDERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In dealing with the brothers and sisters, you have to act in the principle of "two or three."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the feeling of the whole church is to deal with a certain brother, it will be easy to touch such a person's conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The responsible brothers must learn to be bold on the one hand and to be in fear on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They must not be loose with themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the Holy Spirit is in control and He wants you to be bold, you can be bold.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the Holy Spirit is in control, no one will dare be loose even if you allow him to be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some brothers make mistakes all the time, but when they come to the meeting, they do not make any mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The difference lies in the control of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Holy Spirit is in control, even wrong things can be turned right.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those with little faith often hold the meetings tightly in their hands and do not let go.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But you have to learn to allow the Holy Spirit to have the full authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not keep everything in your own hand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>CONCERNING SANITATION</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Concerning the cup that is passed around during the table meeting, some have asked if we should disinfect it a little before passing it on to the next person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even if the air is disinfected, it will contain many germs after an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From the hygienic point of view, this matter is a hard call.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have three doctors here; they are the director of the Health Department, the director of the Army Medical Department, and the principal of a medical school.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I believe they can give us a clear understanding of the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, Dr. Mei said that he is not afraid of drinking from the same cup because he believes that God is sovereign to keep germs away from us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even if we touch the germs, we will not be infected.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In His divine arrangement, God has not ordained that man isolate himself from germs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have germs around us everywhere, and those who are healthy are not harmed by them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should fear not, but only believe Mark 5:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But we should allow those who are weak in faith to do what they want to do.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not condemn or stop them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a person is sick, we can ask him to sit in the last row.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is for the sake of practicing brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to take care of those who are weak in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not a legal requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If any outsider who smokes comes, we can ask him to sit in the last row in order that the weak brothers and sisters will not be affected.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is like a family with a son who has tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When he speaks, others have to cover their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Of course, the parents love the children and want to be close to them, but neither do they want the whole family to get tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our brothers and sisters have to learn from the Lord Jesus, who in His compassion touched the leper with His hand Mark 1:40-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to believe in the power of the Lord's protection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not be afraid of infection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we do not have faith, we can be infected anytime, not just through drinking from the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Men living near the North Pole can die from the cold, but no one dies of a cold.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Cold viruses are everywhere, but not everyone who comes in contact with them catches a cold.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to believe and trust in the Lord's protection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A QUESTION OF CHURCH SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Witness Lee:The responsible brothers have to pay attention to the standard of the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If they set the standard too high, they may create a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some problems arising in the service must be dealt with according to general spiritual principles.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When a problem arises, it cannot be dealt with as an isolated case.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are, of course, exceptions when things that do not edify the saints occur in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But if such things happen again and again, something must be wrong within the church or with the leading brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If something happens only occasionally, there is no need to pay too much attention to it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But if it happens again and again, something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, this is not a matter of dealing with isolated cases.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not a matter of dealing with things case by case.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The elders have to make confessions before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They have to be dealt with, to receive enlightenment, and to follow the spiritual principles.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the immune system of the church is strong, it will not worry about germs.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hong Kong is a civilized country.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the service in the church is strong, many problems associated with modern civilization can be overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The responsible brothers should turn the saints' attention to the big things.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not pay too much attention to the small and secondary things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we can show the saints something more important than hygiene in the church, their attention will be turned.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once a man is enlightened by the heavenly light, he will not be bound by earthly worries.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In Shanghai we have a lady who grew up in a very protected environment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>She is like a bulb in a little pot; no one can touch her.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Such kind of people get sick very easily.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Those who are used to a rough and rugged life, however, can overcome many sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Sickness is a tool of Satan; he applies it especially to those who are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are not talking about hygiene.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If the church is heavenly and strong, it will transcend earthly hygiene and human weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Brother Chien's concern is mostly a psychological fear.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>His inward spiritual capacity is not big enough.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the reason he is worried about physical hygiene.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those who are spiritually strong judge things according to the science of spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Those who are spiritually strong can sleep with the dead, put their mouth upon his mouth, their eyes upon his eyes, and their hands upon his hands 2 Kings 4:32-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But those who are spiritually weak can only weep before the dead Mark 5:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have to learn to be strong in our spirit and learn to transcend all physical and fleshly limitations.</S>
