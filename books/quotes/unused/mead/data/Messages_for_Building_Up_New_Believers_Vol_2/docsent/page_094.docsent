   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Need to Walk with God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second, parents must not only realize their responsibility and sanctify themselves for the sake of their children; they must also walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One sanctifies himself for the sake of his children.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But this does not mean that he can be loose and careless when he is by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He should not exercise self-control merely for the sake of his children.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus was not short of holiness in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He did not sanctify Himself just for the sake of His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the Lord Jesus sanctified Himself merely for the sake of His disciples, but was not holy in Himself, He would have been a total failure.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the same way, parents must sanctify themselves for their children, but they themselves must also walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No matter how much zeal you show in your children s presence, they can easily see through you if you are not genuinely zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are very clear, but you may not be that clear.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may be a very loose person yet act carefully in their presence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In reality you are not the person you pretend to be.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Please remember that your children can see through you easily.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you are a careless person and you try to act in a discreet way before your children, they will easily detect your carelessness and pretension.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You must not only sanctify yourself before them for their sake, but you must also be genuinely holy in yourself, walking with God as Enoch did.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I would like to draw your attention to the example of Enoch.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Genesis 5:21-22 says, Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: and Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before Enoch was sixty-five years old, we do not know his condition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After he begat Methuselah, we know that he walked with God three hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then he was taken up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a special case in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before Enoch begat children, we do not know anything about his condition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But after Enoch begat Methuselah, the Bible says that he walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the burden of the family was upon him, he started to feel his weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He felt that his responsibility was too great and that he could not manage it by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>So he began to walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He did not walk with God just in the presence of his son; he walked with God even when he was by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He felt that if he did not walk with God, he would not know how to raise his children.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Enoch begat not only Methuselah but also many other children; nevertheless, he walked with God for three hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His responsibility as a parent did not hinder him from walking with God; rather, it caused him to walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, he was raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Please remember that the first person who was raptured was a father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first person to be raptured was one who had many children and yet who still walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The way one bears his responsibility in a family is a reflection of his spiritual condition before God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must see that in order for us to bring our children to the Lord in a genuine way, we need to be a person who walks with God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We cannot send our children to heaven merely by pointing our fingers to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to walk in front of them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only then can we ask our children to follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even though Christian parents want their children to be better than they are in the hope that their children will not love the world and will go on in a positive way, there are many bad families because the parents themselves draw back.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If this is the case, they will never realize their goal no matter how hard they try.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must remember that the standard of the children cannot be higher than the standard of their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This does not mean that we should set a false standard.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should have a standard that is genuine and spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we have this, our children will come up to our standard.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Please forgive me for saying something that sounds simple and elementary.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I once went to visit a family and saw the mother beating her child because the child lied.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, both the father and the mother in this family also lied.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I learned that they lied on many occasions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But when their child lied, he was beaten.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Honestly speaking, the child s real mistake was only a deficiency in his technique of lying; he was caught lying.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The only difference between the child and the parents was that one was caught lying while the others were not.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It was not a matter of whether one lied, but a matter of skill.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One lied, and he was caught and punished.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you have a double standard, how can you raise your children?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How can you tell your children not to lie when you are a liar yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You must not have one standard for your life and another standard for your child s life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This will never work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Suppose your children see and receive nothing but lies and dishonesty from you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The more you punish them, the more problems you will have.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some fathers tell their sons, Wait until you are eighteen, and I will let you smoke.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many children say in their heart, When I am eighteen, my father will let me lie.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I am not yet eighteen, so I cannot lie.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But when I am eighteen, I will lie.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This pushes your children into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You must walk with God as Enoch did, in order to raise your children as Enoch did.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you do not walk with God, you cannot expect to raise your children the way Enoch did.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Please remember that your children will learn to love what you love, and hate what you hate.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They will learn to treasure what you treasure, and condemn what you condemn.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You must set a moral standard for yourself and your children.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Whatever your moral standard is, that will be their standard as well.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Your standard of loving the Lord will be their standard of loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There can be only one standard in a family, not two.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I know of a family whose father is a nominal Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He never goes to church, but he wants his children to go every Sunday.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Every Sunday morning, he gives a little money to each of his children and tells them to go to church.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The money is for the children to make offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Later in the day, he plays a game of mahjong with his three friends.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>His children, however, spend the money on snack food.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They play until the pastor is almost through with his sermon, and then they sneak into the building to hear a verse or two.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When they go home, they give their father a nice report.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They have snacks, they get to play, and they make a report.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This, of course, is an extreme case.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I hope we can see that God has committed our children to us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There can be only one standard in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Whatever we forbid our children to do, we should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There must never be two standards in a family, one for the children and another for us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We must keep the same standard for our children s sake.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must sanctify ourselves to maintain a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Once the standard is set, we must maintain it.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I hope we will all take good care of our children.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They are constantly watching us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Whether or not they behave well depends on whether we behave well.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>They are not merely listening to us; they are watching us as well.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>They seem to know everything.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>They know if we are pushing them around, and they know if we are acting in front of them.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We should not think that we can deceive our children.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>They cannot be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>They know how we feel, and they are clear about the true picture.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Whatever we demand of our children, we must take the same position in that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>After Enoch begat Methuselah, he walked with God three hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>What a beautiful picture this is!</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He begat many children, yet he could walk with God three hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>He was a genuine father without any pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Such a walk is altogether proper in the eyes of God.</S>
