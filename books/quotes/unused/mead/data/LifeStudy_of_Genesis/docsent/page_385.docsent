   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 Living in Beer-lahai-roi</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although enjoyment is our destiny, we must still take care of the place where we have the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us consider the names of the places where Isaac had enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Firstly, we have Beer-lahai-roi, which means "the well of the living One who sees me" or "the One who reveals Himself" 24:62; 25:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At Beer-lahai-roi God visits us and reveals Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Secondly, Isaac had some enjoyment at the well named Esek, which means contention.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Esek was a place of contention, fighting, and quarreling.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The third place was Sitnah 26:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sitnah means enmity, hatred, or opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fourth place was called Rehoboth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rehoboth has a positive meaning "broad places" or "broad ways."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The last place was called Sheba, which means an oath 26:22-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, Beer-sheba means the well of an oath.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Isaac enjoyed grace at each of these five places.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before we consider the significance of these places, we must see where Isaac was grown up.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was grown up in Beer-sheba beside the well and the tamarisk tree.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before he was married, he left Beer-sheba and went to the south country 24:62 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we have seen, in the Bible to go southward means to go downward.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I do not believe that Abraham left Beer-sheba or Hebron when Isaac did.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He remained either in Beer-sheba or in Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After his mother had died and his servant had left, Isaac went downward to the south country.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then he returned.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The King James Version says, he "came from the way of Lahai-roi."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Hebrew, it says he "came from going to Lahai-roi," meaning that he returned from Lahai-roi.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As he returned from going to Lahai-roi, he gained a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If he had stayed in Lahai-roi, not returning to Beer-sheba or Hebron, he would have missed that meeting with Rebekah.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When he came back from going to Lahai-roi, Rebekah came.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Abraham's servant did not know that Isaac had left the place where Abraham was.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was of the Lord that Isaac return from his downward way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He returned because he was destined for the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all have had similar experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After going downward, we suddenly said, "Oh, I must go back."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The time of our return was the exact time that Rebekah came.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have experienced this a number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have gone downward and then suddenly said to myself, "I must go back."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As soon as I returned, the enjoyment came.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As soon as Isaac had returned from going away, the enjoyment came.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By coming back to the proper standing, he obtained a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, after his marriage, he and his wife journeyed southward again.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Genesis 25:11 says that after the death of Abraham, Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As a result of going downward, he found himself at enmity with the Philistines.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to see a clear picture of Isaac's record.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He did not go downward as far as Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He went southward to Philistia, to the land of the Philistines.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the record in Genesis, God's people have difficulties whenever they go southward.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Abraham had trouble in Egypt and in the land of the Philistines.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His son Isaac also had trouble when he went to Philistia, for he had contention and enmity with the Philistines.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although he enjoyed the broad ways, the widening, at Rehoboth, he did not have the Lord's appearing there.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Lahai-roi, Esek, Sitnah, and Rehoboth there was no appearing of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord did not appear to Isaac until he went up to Beer-sheba.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The very night that Isaac went up from Rehoboth to Beer-sheba the Lord appeared unto him 26:23-24 .</S>
