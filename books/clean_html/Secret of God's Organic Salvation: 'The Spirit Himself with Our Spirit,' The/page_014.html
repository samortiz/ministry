<p>Prayer: Lord, we extol You with our full acknowledgment. We acknowledge that You are the Lord of all, that You are the speaking God, and that You are the Spirit who dispenses Your life into our being. Lord, we praise You that we can acknowledge so many things concerning You. Lord, in speaking Your word, we pray that You will be one spirit with us and that You will speak in our speaking, making our speaking Your speaking. Lord, we want to be one spirit with You. We do not want to do anything or to speak anything without being one spirit with You. Lord, in these days, You are teaching us to speak the things of a new culture in a new language. Lord, we ask You to give us the new language for the new culture. Amen.</p><p>In this message we come to the next two sections of God&rsquo;s organic salvation&mdash;renewing and transformation.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE SECRET OF RENEWING</h2><p>Renewing is the fourth section of God&rsquo;s organic salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">A. One New Man</h2><p>All the regenerated believers have been created into one new man in Christ (Eph. 2:15; Col. 3:10); hence, they are God&rsquo;s new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15). In Christ we, both the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers, have been created into the new man.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The New Creation</h2><p>This new creation is out of God&rsquo;s old creation, of which so many old things should be renewed to become new. We may regard ourselves as quite good, but whether we are good or bad, we are of the old creation, and thus we need to be renewed.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Creation of the New Man</h2><p>In fact, the creation of the new man has been completed by Christ on the cross (Eph. 2:15); but in practicality, the believers, who are the members of the new man, should apply to themselves what Christ has completed by being practically renewed in their living. We need to apply to ourselves what Christ has accomplished.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Renewing Implied in Sanctification</h2><p>Renewing is implied in sanctification, which makes the believers new while it is going on within them. The more we are sanctified, the more we are renewed. To be renewed, therefore, is based on the ongoing sanctification.</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Continuation of the Washing of Regeneration</h2><p>Titus 3:5 says that God &ldquo;saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This tells us that renewing is the continuation of the washing of regeneration. God first regenerates us and then continues to renew us. Regeneration lays the foundation of the divine life upon which the renewing continues to build up the divine life within a believer. Regeneration is accomplished once for all, but renewing is an ongoing process through the whole life of a believer until he becomes matured to be a full-grown man.</p><p>In regeneration a new life, the divine life, is added to our natural life, causing these two lives to become one. In sanctification our distorted, crooked, and perverted nature is adjusted by God&rsquo;s holy nature. In renewing the mingled spirit penetrates our troublesome mind, causing it to be changed and even to become the mind of Christ (Phil. 2:5; 1 Cor. 2:16). Our mind is the source of all kinds of trouble and surely needs to be renewed.</p>
