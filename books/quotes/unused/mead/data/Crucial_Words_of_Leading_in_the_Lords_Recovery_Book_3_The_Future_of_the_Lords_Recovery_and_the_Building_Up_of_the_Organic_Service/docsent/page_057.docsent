   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING EQUIPPED WITH THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must equip ourselves with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This will cause us to gradually be cultivated in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the past we went to meetings and listened to messages, and we also read spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But we were not cultivated in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The full-timers and all the saints in all the churches in the Lord s recovery need to give themselves to be equipped with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Recovery Version of the New Testament in Chinese with footnotes and cross references will soon be ready for publication.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Life-study of all twenty-seven books of the New Testament will also be ready for publication.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We want the Recovery Version of the New Testament to be printed in different sizes so that the Bible and the Life-studies can be in every corner of the saints homes: on their coffee tables, in their kitchens, and even in the bathrooms.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must use the Recovery Version of the New Testament and the Life-studies to equip ourselves with the truth so that we are in spirit with a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should have a Life-study and the Recovery Version of the New Testament in our hands at all times and in all places.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must encourage the saints in this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have spent eleven years speaking on all twenty-seven books of the New Testament in the summer and winter trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After these trainings we spoke on the conclusion to the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our Life-study messages now have at least twelve hundred messages.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the average, every message is approximately ten pages long.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means there are a total of at least twelve thousand pages.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we could spend four hours every day to study the Recovery Version of the New Testament with the footnotes and the cross references and also study the Life-studies, we would complete the New Testament in two years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we can spend only two hours a day to study, it will take us four years to complete the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we can spend one hour a day, it will take us eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we can spend only half an hour a day, it will take us sixteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Regardless of our situation, we can all spend at least half an hour every day to study the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the two years that the college graduates give to the Lord, they will spend four hours every morning to read the Recovery Version of the New Testament and the Life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If they can complete this study in two years, it will be a tremendous gain.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The rest of us must do our best to spend two hours a day and complete the New Testament in four years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we cannot find two hours during the day, then we should spend one hour a day and complete the New Testament in eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>May we all be diligent to equip ourselves with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Truth Being the Gospel,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>and the Gospel Being the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some people think that the truth is separate from the gospel, but this is not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Bible says that the truth is the gospel and that the gospel is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Ephesians 1:13 Paul says, In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This verse shows that the word of the truth is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are a total of sixteen chapters in Paul s Epistle to the Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the first verse of chapter 1 Paul says that he was separated unto the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then in verses 14 and 15 he says that he owed the gospel as a debt to all people and was endeavoring to announce the gospel to those who were in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The gospel in these verses refers to the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The entire book of Romans, from chapter 1 to chapter 16, consists only of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At the end of this book, in chapter 16, the main subject is the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we carefully read the book of Romans, we will see that Romans 1 speaks of sinners, who are wicked, dark, defiled, and vicious.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, by Romans 16 these people have become believers in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The subject of Romans 16 is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But this does not refer to the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It refers to the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this book of the gospel, Paul speaks of the church in Cenchrea and highly recommends a sister named Phoebe, who was a deaconess there.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then he recommends Prisca and Aquila, a couple.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When they were in Rome, the church that was there met in their home, and when they were in Ephesus, the church that was there met in their home.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul says that this couple risked their necks for his life, and that he and all the churches of the Gentiles give thanks to them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul also greets the church in their home vv.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then he speaks of all the churches of Christ v. 16 . Thus, in Romans 16 we see the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Romans 4 we see justification, and in Romans 8 we see sanctification and the deeper, mysterious truth of the Triune God dispensing Himself into the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the central point of chapter 8, and it is also the center of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The gospel we preach must attain to this height.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even though the entire book of Romans is the gospel, it does not speak of going to hell or of going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we compare the book of Romans to the gospel preached by most believers in Christianity, we see that there is a great contrast.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The gospel preached by Christians today is either concerning escaping hell and going to heaven or concerning material blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is difficult to gain people who have been taught such a gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>An educated person has his own way of thinking and his own philosophy, which are usually based on his inward condition, that is, the condition of his human life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Most young people graduate from junior high school by the time they are fifteen years old, and they then begin to consider the meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What is human life?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What is the purpose of human life?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Where will they go in the future?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What is the goal of their human life?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>These questions indicate the beginning of their personal philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The thirst to find out the depths of human existence cannot be satisfied with the gospel of escaping hell to go to heaven or the gospel of material prosperity.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Such gospels are looked upon as superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we speak the truths of Bible to the young people, just as Paul spoke the truth, and tell them that the Triune God desires to dispense Himself into the tripartite man, I believe that their eyes will be opened.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we can speak logically and clearly, we will bring the heavens to the earth and the earth into the heavens, and they will be moved.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>For example, when we go to contact the students on the campuses, we should preach the truths in Romans 8 to them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Whether or not they understand these truths depends entirely on our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When people do not understand our preaching, the problem is that we did not speak logically.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is not that they are unable to understand but that we are unable to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In every nationality children learn to speak by listening to what they do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After hearing the same words many times, they begin to understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the way elementary students are educated in America, where elementary school students are taught to use computers.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Children who are eight and nine years old understand the language of computers.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They play games on the computer so frequently that they can often figure things out without a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This proves that we must change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When we preached the gospel in the past, we told people that if they believed in Jesus, they would go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It was very good for them to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When they were sick, we told them to pray to the Lord and He would heal them.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When a person s business was not going well, we would tell his entire family to believe in Jesus so that his business would do better.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We would also tell a family that if they believed in Jesus and prayed to Him daily, their children would get into the best university.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>What kind of gospel was this?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It was a gospel of superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The divine truths in the Bible are higher than any philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>However, most Christians have not equipped themselves with this book of truths.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Even saints among us, including some who have been co-workers for many years, have never studied the Bible or the New Testament, much less the fourteen Epistles of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Some of the co-workers have been serving full-time for more than thirty years, preaching the gospel and teaching the truth, but they are inadequately equipped with the truth, because they have never adequately gotten into the fourteen Epistles of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Such a situation of not being equipped with the truth is a shame to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Lord left us with His Word, and printing has made the Bible available and widespread.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Moreover, the Bible has been translated into every language.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But we still have not spent much time to get into the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is a shame to us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When believers in Christianity preach the gospel, they frequently use John 3:16: God so loved the world.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>They say that all persons in the world have committed sin and are going to hell, but because God loves us, He sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This, to some believers, is the gospel according to John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The Gospel of John, however, begins by introducing the Word, saying, In the beginning was the Word 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Suppose I hold a large gospel meeting to which everyone has invited their friends and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Then I say, Friends, in the beginning was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I believe that everyone would shake their heads in disapproval because that would be teaching people to research the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>How could their friends and relatives understand in the beginning ?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Eighty or ninety percent of the saints would not agree with my preaching the gospel in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>But if I say, Dear friends, I want to tell you that God so loved the world, and we are all sinners..., everyone would nod their heads in approval and compliment me for being a good gospel preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The disapproval and approval are our natural concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>John did not preach like this.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>John began by saying, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God...In Him was life, and the life was the light of men...And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father , full of grace and reality...For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace...No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him 1:1, 4, 14, 16, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This gospel is the high gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Who among Christians today speaks such a high gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The gospel of God s economy is very high, but when we preach, we make the gospel something low because we ourselves do not understand what in the beginning means.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>How can we complain that others do not understand if we do not understand?</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>People do not receive what we speak, because we, the speakers, have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>God created man with a mind that is able to understand and with a spirit that is able to apprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If we speak clearly to people and speak to their spirit, they will be able to understand.</S>
