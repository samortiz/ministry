   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>23 LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD THE DEATH AND BURIAL OF SARAH Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Genesis 23:2-4 By faith Abraham dwelt as a foreigner in the land of promise as in a foreign land, making his home in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the fellow heirs of the same promise; for he eagerly waited for the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But as it is, they long after a better country, that is, a heavenly one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hebrews 11:8-10, 16</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this message we come to Genesis 23, a chapter which records the death and burial of Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was young, I did not see why this chapter was included in the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I could not understand why, when Abraham must have done many great things which are not recorded, twenty verses were used to describe how he spent his time, energy, money, and even his politeness to acquire a burying place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the Bible does not waste any words.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since every word of the Bible is God's breath, Genesis 23 must be very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we consider Genesis 1 and 2 as being important, we must also consider Genesis 23 as being important.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every Christian appreciates Genesis 1 because it gives a record of God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We appreciate Genesis 1 not merely as a record of creation but also as a record of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It speaks of God's image and dominion as related to the man created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We also appreciate Genesis 2 because it tells us of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, few of us appreciate a sepulcher.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But Genesis 23 is focused on the matter of a burying place and gives us a detailed account of the purchase of a sepulcher.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>More details are included in this story than in any other record in the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>While every other record is quite brief, this one gives a full and clear account of where the tomb was located, who owned it, how it was purchased, and the amount Abraham paid for it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This sepulcher is mentioned in a very significant way, for we are told that not only was Sarah buried there, but that Abraham, Isaac, Rebekah, Jacob, and Leah were buried there also.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is very significant that the names of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are the components of the divine title of God who is the God of resurrection Matt 22:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Genesis 23 is a window through which we can see the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Jerusalem is not found in this chapter, but it can be seen through it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This chapter is like a telescope: through it we can see the eternal tabernacle that is far off in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Genesis 21 gives us the record of the birth of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was certainly worth mentioning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Following this, in the same chapter we are told that Abraham redeemed a well, planted a tamarisk tree, and called on the name of Jehovah, El Olam.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we have seen, in chapter twenty-two we have the offering of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then, in chapter twenty-three, we have the death and burial of Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These three chapters cover at least thirty-seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although a great many things must have happened with Abraham during these thirty-seven years, only four things are mentioned: the birth of Isaac, the living in Beer-sheba, the offering of Isaac, and the death and burial of Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These three chapters exclude many things which, according to our human concept, are important, but include a detailed record of the death and burial of Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because of this, we must pay close attention to Genesis 23.</S>
