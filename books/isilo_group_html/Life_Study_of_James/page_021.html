Anyone who despises a poor brother in this way will not receive mercy when he appears before the judgment seat of Christ.</p><p>Here James is telling us not to despise our brother. If we despise a brother, this means that we do not have mercy on him. Then when we come before the Lord to be judged, He will not show mercy to us, because we have not shown mercy to our brother. Therefore, we need to show mercy, for, as James says, mercy triumphs over, boasts over, judgment. If we have mercy on our brother today, we shall receive mercy from the Lord at His judgment seat.</p><p>I appreciate James&rsquo; word in verse 13. What he says here may be likened to gold. However, in his Epistle he mixes gold with clay. Therefore, the readers of his Epistle need to distinguish between the gold and the clay.</p><h2 class="head1">JUSTIFIED BY WORKS<br />IN RELATION TO THE BELIEVERS</h2><p>Let us come now to 2:14-16, a section that speaks of being justified by works in relation to the believers. Many talk about this portion without realizing that it concerns our relationship with other believers. If we say that we have faith, we should love the brothers and sisters. This means that we are justified by deeds of love in relation to the believers.</p><p>Verse 14 says, &ldquo;What is the profit, my brothers, if anyone says he has faith, but does not have works? Can that faith save him?&rdquo; Here James is not talking about being saved from perdition, but is speaking about being saved from judgment at the judgment seat of Christ. The context indicates this.</p><p>However, when many Christians read the Bible, they think that &ldquo;saved&rdquo; means to go to heaven. They may not realize that the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ is not a matter of heaven or hell. As we have seen, that judgment concerns reward or the suffering of dispensational punishment. If someone says he has faith but does not have any works of love, this means that he does not love the brothers and sisters. Therefore, when such a one stands before the judgment seat of Christ, he will be judged without mercy. We need works of mercy and love in order to be saved from merciless judgment. Hence, to be saved in verse 14 is to be saved from merciless judgment at the judgment seat of Christ. But if we do not show mercy toward fellow believers, we shall not receive mercy from the Lord at His judgment seat.</p><p>Verses 15 and 16 prove that this understanding of &ldquo;saved&rdquo; in verse 14 is correct: &ldquo;If a brother or sister is without clothing and lacks daily food, and anyone of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, yet you do not give them the necessities of the body, what is the profit?&rdquo; In verse 14 James is concerned for us; in verses 15 and 16 his concern is for those who are not properly cared for by us. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;is&rdquo; indicates that the brother or sister has been in this condition for some time. If we do not care for the necessities of the saints, we are caring neither for them nor for ourselves.</p><p>One day we shall be judged by Christ. If we care for the needs of the saints, exercising mercy on them, at the same time we are taking care of ourselves in relation to the Lord&rsquo;s judgment of us. Because of our merciful and loving work toward the saints, we shall be saved from merciless judgment at the Lord&rsquo;s judgment seat.</p><p>It is shameful for the necessities of the poor saints not to be cared for in the church life. However, James&rsquo; word in verse 16, for the strengthening of his view of practical Christian perfection, carries the flavor of the Old Testament concern for needy people (Deut. 15:7-8).</p><p>In verses 17 through 19 James goes on to say, &ldquo;Even so faith, if it does not have works, is dead in itself. But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe and shudder.&rdquo; Faith is of life; it is living and works through love (Gal. 5:6). Otherwise, it is a dead faith, not genuine (James 2:20, 26).</p><p>In verse 20 James says, &ldquo;But are you willing to know, O vain man, that faith without works is useless?&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;useless&rdquo; also means barren. Some manuscripts read &ldquo;dead.&rdquo;</p><p>In verse 20 James uses the expression &ldquo;vain man.&rdquo; According to James, a person is vain if he only believes but does not have love. Anyone who believes in the Lord Jesus but does not love the brothers is vain. In this sense, a vain man is one who has faith without love. As James says, faith without works is useless.</p><p>In verse 21 James asks, &ldquo;Was not Abraham our father justified by works in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?&rdquo; Immediately James continues in verse 22, &ldquo;You see that faith worked together with his works, and by works faith was completed.&rdquo; It was in Genesis 15 that Abraham believed in God, and in Genesis 22 that he offered Isaac his son. This indicates that there was a period of time wherein Abraham&rsquo;s faith was completed. It was necessary to have his faith testified. Abraham first believed in God, and later his believing was testified by offering up Isaac to God. Likewise, our believing in the Lord Jesus also needs to be testified or vindicated. For example, I hope that a young person who believes in the Lord will have his faith testified or vindicated to his parents by a change of attitude and behavior. This means that an outward work of love testifies, vindicates, the faith that is within us.</p><p>In verses 23 and 24 James says, &ldquo;And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, And Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness, and he was called a friend of God. You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith only.&rdquo; In verse 23 James again mixes things. The first part of this verse refers to Genesis 15:6, when Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness; the second part of the verse refers to a later time when Abraham was called a friend of God (2 Chron. 20:7; Isa. 41:8).</p><p>In verse 24 James continues, &ldquo;You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith only.&rdquo; To be justified by faith is for receiving the divine life (Rom. 5:18); to be justified by works is through living the divine life. Since the living is the issue of life, to be justified by works is the issue of being justified by faith. Abraham&rsquo;s offering of Isaac and Rahab&rsquo;s receiving the messengers and thrusting them out (Josh. 2:1-21; 6:23) are both works which issued from their living faith. A living tree surely brings forth fruit. To be justified by works does not contradict being justified by faith. The latter is the cause, bringing forth the first, and the first is the effect, the outcome and proof of the latter.</p><p>In verses 25 and 26 James concludes, &ldquo;And in like manner was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works in that she received the messengers as guests and thrust them out by a different way? For as the body without a spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.&rdquo; The spirit gives life to the body (Gen. 2:7); the works indicate and express the life that is in the faith.</p><p>This chapter begins with having no respect of persons (vv. 1-13), and arrives at the practical care for the necessities of the poor saints, which is the justifying work of faith (vv. 14-26). According to James&rsquo; view, these virtues may be considered characteristics of practical Christian perfection.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of James &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
