   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This verse mentions the words Architect and Builder.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 16 says, They long after a better country, that is, a heavenly one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The phrase to be called their God means that God belongs to those who are spoken of in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The meaning of this phrase in Greek is very weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It means that God is their sole possession.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not just a title by which God is addressed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, it is a fact indicating that God has become their possession.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, God has become the God of those who long after a heavenly country.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The end of verse 16 says, For He has prepared a city for them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This preparation can be done only when there is building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hebrews 11 says that He has prepared a city, but Revelation 21 says that the city is prepared as a bride adorned for her husband v. 2 . The New Jerusalem is a city, yet it is also a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 3 continues, And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The New Jerusalem is a city and a bride, but ultimately, it is the tabernacle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The tabernacle of God, according to the Old Testament type, is God s habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then verse 3 continues, saying that God will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They possess God and own God; thus, God is their God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This very God, whom they possess and own, tabernacles among them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 9 says, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb, indicating that the bride is the wife of the Lamb, but verse 10 says that this bride is a city, the holy city Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then verse 11 says, Having the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that God tabernacles within His people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 11 also says, Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible has a continuous line of thought.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Revelation 21 repeatedly mentions the matter of stones in describing the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It says that the light that the city expresses is like a most precious stone v. 11 . It also says that the twelve foundations of the wall of the city are twelve precious stones and that the building work of its wall is jasper, which is also a precious stone vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Peter matches this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 4 of chapter two says, Coming to Him, a living stone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord as a living stone is precious to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 5 says, You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we come to Him, we ourselves also, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The word built in this verse is related to the word Builder in Hebrews 11:10.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Ephesians 2:20-22 says that we are being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone; in whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These verses also contain the words stone and built.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These verses indicate that the dwelling place of God in spirit, which is God s habitation, is being produced.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First Corinthians 3:9 says, You are God s cultivated land, God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The cultivated land and the building are connected in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On one hand, the Bible says that we are God s temple, God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the other hand, it says that we are God s harvest, God s land.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>While the building is something that is built up, the harvest on the land is something that grows up.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this verse the work of God is connected with these two matters of the building and the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In other words, God comes to build the building so that the harvest may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said to Peter, You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who understand Greek know that the name Peter means a little stone.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In revealing the church, this verse also mentions the matters of building and stones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ is a big stone, the rock upon which the church is built, while Peter is a little stone.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Peter, the little stone, had to be built on Christ, the big stone, so that they could become the church, God s habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>John 14:1-12 is the word that the Lord Jesus spoke to the disciples before He was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord told the disciples that He was going to leave them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The disciples were troubled upon hearing this, but the Lord comforted them by saying, Do not let your heart be troubled; believe into God, believe also into Me v. 1 . The Greek phrase translated believe into God, believealso into Me also has the meaning believe into the inside of God, believe into the inside of Me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord continued, saying, In My Father s house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>2-3 .</S>
