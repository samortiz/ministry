   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTY GOD S FARM AND GOD S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:1-17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After referring to feeding, drinking, eating, planting, watering, and growing, Paul says in 3:9, You are God s farm, God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul could say that he planted, Apollos watered, and God gave the growth because the believers are God s farm.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Literally the Greek word rendered farm means cultivated land.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The believers who have been regenerated in Christ with God s life are God s cultivated land, a farm in God s new creation to grow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As those who have believed in Christ and received Him, we are no longer like land that is uncultivated or wild.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are not people whom God has not touched.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, God has sown something into us, and we have been touched and cultivated by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we are God s farm growing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The concept of sowing, cultivating, and growing is strongly emphasized in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus Himself used the figure of a sower.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Matthew 13:3 He says, Behold, the sower went out to sow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We know from Matthew 13:37 that the Lord is the Sower: He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The seed sown by Him is also Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is the Lord in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This seed is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus came as a Sower to sow God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are the earth, the ground, the cultivated land, the farm, to grow God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that the church is a restaurant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we are saying that the church is a farm.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is, of course, no contradiction here, for the church has many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the place for growing produce, the church is a farm.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But as a place where the produce is prepared and served as our food, the church is a restaurant.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>GROWING AND BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 9 Paul says that we are both God s farm and God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There seems to be no logical connection between the farm and the building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What does the farm have to do with the building?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one has ever seen a building constructed of fruit and vegetables grown on a farm.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nevertheless, the church as God s farm produces the material for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As Christians, we are growing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now we must ask ourselves whether or not we have been built.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many of us may hesitate to say that we have been truly built up to become God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the saints were asked about this, most of them may reply that they have been built to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, this is the right answer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>With a spiritual building, a building in life, the true building is the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The extent to which we have been built is the extent to which we have grown.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Growing here refers to growing foodstuffs.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To grow is also to increase.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, a certain brother may have weighed only seven pounds at birth, but now he weighs one hundred seventy pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is growth in the second meaning of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To be built up in the church is to grow in the sense of increasing with Christ to have a certain stature.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The increase of Christ is our stature.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be built into the spiritual building does not first mean to be connected with others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It means to have our natural life reduced and to have Christ increased within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The more our natural life is reduced and the more Christ increases within us, the easier it will be for us to coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In fact, we shall be able to coordinate with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, some saints have told me that they cannot move from their locality because they have been built with certain saints in the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to their concept, because they have been built together with these ones, it is not possible for them to leave that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not real building.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the contrary, it is friendship or some kind of social relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you have truly been built into the church, you have been reduced, and Christ has been increased in you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then, wherever you may be, you can be one with the saints and coordinate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once you have been built into God s spiritual building, you can never be taken out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As the church, we are God s farm and God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The farm is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whatever is produced on the farm and by the farm is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>THE UNIQUE FOUNDATION</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A building requires a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, in 3:10 and 11 Paul speaks of the foundation of God s building: According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, but another builds upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But let each one take heed how he builds upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ, the unique foundation, has already been laid.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This foundation has been established not only for the time of the apostles, but for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, during the past nineteen centuries, many Christian workers have tried to lay other foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Every denomination and group has its own particular foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Among Christians today there are thousands of foundations.</S>
