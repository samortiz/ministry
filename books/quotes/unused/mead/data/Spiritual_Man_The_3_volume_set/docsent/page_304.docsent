   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When a believer reaches this state, unconsciously he relies upon evil spirits to help him!</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have already seen how the believer does not have the strength within himself to make decisions and that he has to rely on external forces to support him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many times, because of torment by evil spirits without realizing that the torment is from evil spirits , a believer longs for the external force which has been helping him all along to come to his aid!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is why evil spirits want a believer to become passive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the unused faculties of the believer have fallen into the evil spirits' hand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the believer tries to use his faculties in this condition, it only gives evil spirits an opportunity to express themselves through him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Evil spirits are very happy to make proposals for man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since man has looked to them for help, they will not refuse the request.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They will often inject preconceived thoughts into the believer's mind, giving him all kinds of visions, dreams, voices, lights, fires, and Scriptures out of context.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through these things, they render ideas and decisions on behalf of the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The believer does not realize the real situation; he considers these to be truly God's revelations and in accord with God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, these things do not require him to make any painful decisions or exercise any determination.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a result, he blindly follows along.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Evil spirits gladly help man not to think or use his will but to walk foolishly according to outward revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Consequently, they very frequently bestow miraculous things on the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is very pitiful that in the midst of his ignorance of God's principle of work, a believer can be deceived to think that he is actually submitting to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At such times, he can 1 believe in evil spirits, 2 rely on them, 3 obey them, 4 consecrate himself to them, 5 listen to them, 6 pray to them, 7 be led and guided by them, 8 accept their message, 9 accept the Scriptures given by them, 10 work with them, 11 work for them, 12 assist them in accomplishing their heart's desires and work, while still thinking that he is turning to God and that he is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One thing should be noted: "To whom you present yourselves as slaves for obedience, his slaves you are whom you obey" Rom 6:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In name we may be consecrating ourselves to God, but if we are consecrating ourselves to evil spirits in actuality, we will inevitably become their slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even though we are deceived, we have clearly offered ourselves to a counterfeit god.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we have no way to escape being responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The believer should know that if he does not communicate with God according to the condition of fellowship, but rather communicates according to the condition of demon-possession, his prayer will be a prayer to evil spirits, his consecration will be a consecration to evil spirits, and his trust will be a trust in evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In his heart he thinks that he is communicating with God and that what he has gained has come from God; actually he is communicating with evil spirits and accepting their "gift."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should realize the steps of this process.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because the believer looks for the presence of God in his feeling and in other experiences as we have mentioned in Sections Three and Seven , evil spirits deceive him and give him a counterfeit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because of his ignorance, he blindly accepts it, thinking that it is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Consequently, he brings himself into passivity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the believer falls into passivity, he thinks that he does not need to move and that God will move for him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As such, he does not move.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, God will not move him because He wants man to actively cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God does not want man to become a senseless machine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because the believer fulfills the condition for the working of evil spirits, they move in on him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When man does not move and God does not move, evil spirits will move in. The believer should know that after he clearly understands God's will in the intuition of his spirit, his entire being has to rise up to carry out God's will in an active way; he must not be passive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After the believer is possessed by demons, he may be ignorant of his true condition and consider himself very spiritual, having many wonderful experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But those who are trained in the Lord and who possess spiritual discernment know that even though this kind of believer experiences wonderful things, he has a "double personality."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A double personality is a clear sign of demon-possession.</S>
