   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Characteristic of Those Who Have</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>a Gospel Spirit Not Being Ashamed</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we have a gospel spirit, the first thing we will have is "thick skin."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that we are not ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not only is the spirit within us strong, but our skin is thick.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means we have no sense of self-consciousness or shame.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose our house was on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We would run to the street and shout.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We would not be ashamed and would not be self-conscious.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we have a gospel spirit and see men walking away from salvation, how can we shut up and be ashamed of shouting when their soul is going to hell?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot be ashamed of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whether or not others like to hear us, we have to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Church history shows that all those who are good at saving souls are "thick-skinned."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They seem to be oblivious to everything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are like fools to others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who are polite cannot save too many people, but those who have a strong gospel spirit and whose faces are thick will lead many to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not Being Conscious of One's Own Status</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those with a strong gospel spirit do not care too much about their own position or status.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They can walk away from their own "throne."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some people are bank managers, college professors, gentlewomen, college students, and ladies, and their status is their throne.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are not willing to walk away from their throne to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But once the spirit of the gospel rises up in us, we will immediately forget about our status and position.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We will forget about our throne and will care only to bring people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are beside ourselves for the Lord in this way, we will bring many to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The kind of persons we are will be the kind of person we beget; it will determine the kind of person we bring to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are lukewarm, those whom we bring to the Lord will also be lukewarm.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not have these two traits, that is, if we will not give up our "face" and status, we will not have a strong gospel spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order for us to have a gospel spirit, we must go to God and pray to Him to remove any hindrances.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must forget about our "face" and ignore our status and standing for the gospel's sake and for the sake of man's soul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>HOW TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to be effective in preaching the gospel, we must do two things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, we must have strong, thorough, and powerful prayer before preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to carry men's souls to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Next, we have to invite people in. We must not only carry men's names to God but also bring them in to listen to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the reason we must prepare a list and write the names of all the people we know on the list.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who live around us should be invited to listen to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who live elsewhere should receive the gospel through the mail.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have a somber feeling that the church in Hong Kong is very much behind in the gospel spirit, in the matter of gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If fifty brothers and sisters have the gospel spirit, we will fill our meeting hall with two hundred to three hundred people the minute we call a gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The effectiveness of the gospel is based on two things: much prayer and a serious effort to bring in our friends and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those whom we drag in from the street are not very reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Friends and relatives are different.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They are related to us already, and it is easy to touch them.</S>
