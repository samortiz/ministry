   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN RESURRECTION,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE HOLY SPIRIT, AND THE CHURCH 1 Date:June 13, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Customs Lane, Foochow</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading:Acts 2:24-28, 31-34; 1 Cor 12:12-13; Eph 1:19-23 THREE SUBJECTS OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible mainly speaks of three subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first is resurrection, the second is the Holy Spirit, and the third is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The human mind cannot comprehend these three things because they are beyond human imagination and description.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All three things are revealed to us by the Spirit of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>MAN'S CREATION BEING INCOMPLETE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to understand these things, we have to go back to Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When man was created by God, he was created perfect, but not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Other forms of creatures were both perfect and complete, but man was perfect yet not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After God created man, He placed him in front of the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man was free to choose between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This proves that God's creation of man was not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In God's eyes man was not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even though man did not have the knowledge of good and evil, he needed God's life, as typified by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When man was created, he was living, but he did not have God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He needed to take one more step.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Man is not complete until he has God's life typified by the tree of life .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, before man ate of the tree of life, he first ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He made the wrong choice and delayed his completion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, man has not reached the peak of his potential.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In God's eyes man is still short of something.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today, even at his loftiest height, man is still short of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man is limited, and even at his best he is still short.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can say that the whole Old Testament, from the first chapter of Genesis to the last chapter of Malachi, is a development of the creation story; it is a continuation of God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, etc., were good, they were still short in God's eyes; they were not able to reach God's original goal in His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although they had God's image, they did not have His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Image refers to the outward shape while likeness refers to inward character and disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During the past six thousand years, God's work of creation in man has not stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God has made no advance as far as the creation of other species is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He has not created more kinds of flowers, birds, horses, etc. These things were complete and perfect from the day they were created; there was no room for improvement, but man has never been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Genesis 1:26 God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man is created according to God's image and likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The word image signifies outward appearance; it does not refer to the inward nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Adam was created a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He did not have God's Spirit in him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, he was not complete; he was an unfinished piece.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Adam needed God Himself, typified by the tree of life, to be his very nature.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Man did not reach God's standard at the time of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This went on until the time of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Adam had God's outward appearance, but he was not like God in his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When he fell, he came short of the glory of God Rom 3:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He lost God's likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before the Lord Jesus was incarnated, there was not a single man on earth up to the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sages of past centuries have tried to reach the standard through their asceticism and stoic practices, but they are still short of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is a distinction between the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Old Testament man did not reach God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the New Testament one man was after God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is the complete man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE LORD JESUS BEING THE ONLY COMPLETED MAN</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What God longed for in ages past, but did not find, is finally here in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That man is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the Lord Jesus God found the man whom He was after.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord Jesus is the model man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ is not merely a representative of man; He is a representative man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is the man whom God is after.</S>
