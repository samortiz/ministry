   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE TEN A SKY AS CLEAR AS THE TERRIBLE CRYSTAL Scripture Reading: Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1:22-25</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ezekiel 1:22-25 is very profound and deep.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These verses tell us that upon the heads of the four living creatures there is the firmament, or the expanse, which we call the sky.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The appearance of the sky is like terrible crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is so clear that it looks terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This sky stretches forth over the heads of all the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Under this sky the living creatures stretch their two wings straight.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In a previous message we saw that two of the wings of each of the living creatures are stretched forth and joined to the wings of others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The living creatures use their other two wings to cover their body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever they move and whenever they act, a voice, or a sound, comes from their wings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This voice is like the noise of great waters and also like the voice of the Almighty v. 24 , that is, the Almighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is also like the voice of tumult, the voice of a host or army.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word host in verse 24 means an army.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, when the living creatures stop and stand still, they lower their wings v. 25 . We need to consider the spiritual significance and application of all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do not understand this spiritual significance and application, then to us these points may appear either nonsensical or meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>BASED ON ALL THE PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These verses are based on the preceding verses.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that we first need to experience the blowing wind, which brings in the cloud of the Lord s presence to overshadow us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we enjoy the Lord s presence, the cloud brings in the burning fire, and we experience the burning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Out of the burning fire, we gain the electrum, and then we become living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As living creatures, we move in coordination with others to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have four faces to express the all-inclusive Christ in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to have these four faces, we need to be dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Following this, we need to experience and enjoy the eagle s wings; that is, we move by the divine power and strength and by the grace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We also cover ourselves, hiding ourselves under His overshadowing wings, hiding ourselves under the grace and power of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, we need to learn to work as a man by using the man s hands and also learn to walk on the calf s straight feet, having a walk that is straight, frank, honest, sincere, and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This will qualify us to be in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Within the coordination we will have the fire up and down, the burning coals, and the enlightening torches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we reach this point, the holy God as a consuming fire will be among us in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then there will be a high and dreadful wheel beside us, indicating that we have God s move on earth by us and with us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Within this wheel is a wheel, signifying that within our move is the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By having such a wheel, such a move, we will be full of eyes and have insight and foresight.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now we need to see that when we have all these matters in our experience, we will have a clear sky and a very particular sound the sound of great waters, a sound that is the voice of the Almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A CLEAR SKY, EXPANDING AND STABLE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Ezekiel 1:22 says, The likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the color of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This reveals that after we have experienced all the things in the first twenty-one verses, the sky over our heads will be crystal clear.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It will be like a great expanse of crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We will have a wide, clear expanse above us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that above us is an open, clear heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The sky is not only clear; it is also expanding.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not just a matter of having a clear sky vertically, from heaven to earth, but also a matter of having a clear sky horizontally.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that the clear sky is expanding.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our sky, therefore, should be clear and expanding.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before we were saved, our sky was dark and cloudy, even foggy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It was also narrow, without any expanse.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>With us there was hardly any heaven, hardly any sky.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But one day we repented, confessed our sins, and received the Lord Jesus as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The more we confessed our sins, the more clear our sky became.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After we made a thorough confession, we had the sense, for the first time, that the sky above us was clear.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We sensed that the day was dawning, that the clouds were leaving, and that the fog was lifting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we were saved, we received not only a clear sky but also an expanding sky.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We had the sense that our sky was expanding.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Later, however, some problems might have arisen with ourselves personally, with our relatives, with the church, or with some of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Immediately our sky became somewhat cloudy again.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It was not as cloudy and dark as before we were saved, but still it was no longer clear.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Clouds and fog reappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all have had this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Eventually, we confessed our failures, condemned such things as our attitudes, motives, intentions, and goals, and received God s forgiveness and the cleansing of the blood of Jesus 1 John 1:9, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The sky above us became clear again, and once again we were under a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then the sky began to open and expand above us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In our experience we should always have a clear, open, and expanding heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The kind of sky a Christian has depends upon his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Your conscience is connected to your sky.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If there is no blemish on your conscience, your sky will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If your sky is not clear, this means that there is some offense on your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In order to have a clear sky, we need to deal with any offense and condemnation in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The story of our sky is the story of our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we as living creatures reach the point of having a clear, open, and expanding heaven, there will be nothing between us and God and nothing between us and one another.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There will be nothing cloudy or foggy covering us or separating us from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All the clouds, coverings, separations, and fog will be gone, and we will have a sky that is thoroughly clear and continually expanding.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Our expanse will be as clear as crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When others look upon our clear sky, they will be astonished.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Our sky is terrible because it is crystal clear and expanding.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This clear and expanding sky is also stable.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As a rule, the sky above the earth usually has some kind of movement.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Either the clouds are moving or the wind is blowing.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But the sky above the living creatures is not moving; rather, it is as stable as crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>There is no change.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We need to consider this in light of our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>At the time we were saved, we had a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, we enjoyed such a sky only for a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Like the weather in certain places, our sky fluctuated very much.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Sometimes our sky became cloudy, but after we confessed our sins, it became clear again.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Later we would have another failure, such as losing our temper, and our sky would become cloudy once again.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There were many fluctuations in the sky above our head.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>With the living creatures, however, the situation is altogether different.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The sky above the heads of the living creatures is perfectly stable, like crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>There is no fluctuation.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The heaven above them is clear, expanding, and stable.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They have a thorough fellowship with the Lord vertically and also a clear fellowship among themselves horizontally.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>They have a wide and stable span of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>A proper local church should be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Unfortunately, however, the sky in some local churches seems to be cloudy and narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The sky over that church is very small and narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>There is no expanse, and the situation is dark and touchy, making it difficult for anyone to say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If you say anything in this touchy situation, some of the saints will be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>No matter what you say, certain ones will be unhappy with you.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>However, if a local church is proper, the sky over it will be clear and broad.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>No matter what you say, no one will be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This does not mean that we should try in ourselves to be broad-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If we are like a frog in a well, it matters little whether we are broad-minded or narrow-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We need to jump out of the well and come under a clear sky where the horizon is broad.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Once we are under such a sky, even if we are narrow-minded, we will spontaneously become broad.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It is impossible for the living creatures to be narrow-minded, because there is a wide expanse above their heads.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The sky above them is clear, expanding, and terrible to behold.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Under such a sky we have the proper fellowship with the Lord and with one another.</S>
