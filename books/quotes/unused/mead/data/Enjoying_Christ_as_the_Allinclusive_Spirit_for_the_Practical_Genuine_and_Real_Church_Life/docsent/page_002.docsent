   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE BEING SAVED FROM THE PRESENT EVIL AGE BY GOD REVEALING HIS SON IN US Scripture Reading: Gal 1:1-4, 6-7, 10-16, 22-23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The entire Bible is a revelation from God, breathed out by Him 2 Tim 3:16; 2 Pet 1:20-21 , and the order of the books of the Bible is also sovereignly arranged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We cannot put Genesis at the end of the Bible, put Revelation at the beginning, or rearrange the Gospels and Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, all the books in the Bible are in a proper sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the New Testament we first have the four Gospels, presenting a full picture of a wonderful person, the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Following this is Acts, with the preaching, propagating, ministering, and imparting of this wonderful One into many persons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After Peter s first preaching, about three thousand people were saved, and later another five thousand believed 2:41; 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually, many people believed in Jesus and received Him into them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the four Gospels Christ was an individual person, but after being imparted into many people in Acts, this Christ is now in many thousands of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now what God wants to do with these believers is to bring them together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We Christians can be compared to bees.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Bees do not care to be individualistic; they prefer to be corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is difficult to find a bee altogether by itself, because bees always tend to gather together.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not that they are forced to be together; rather, this is the tendency of their nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, when bees are collected together, they lose their identity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is difficult to identify individual bees in a hive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Butterflies, on the other hand, often behave individually and not in large groups, and their individual beauty stands out for a display.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>People appreciate the beauty of a butterfly, but bees are not recognized for their individual beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a good illustration of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We Christians are like bees, not butterflies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We forget about cultivating individualistic beauty in a peculiar way and simply gather together in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This corporate life and work are revealed in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Following Acts is the first Epistle, the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although many would say that Romans is a book on justification by faith, justification is only the beginning, not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The final subject in Romans is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Chapter 12 begins, I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice...that you may prove what the will of God is vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the will of God not in a general way but in a very specific way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to this chapter, the particular will of God is to have the Body life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the consummating revelation in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now all the believers who have the life of God in them are a corporate people, because the divine life within them is a collective, corporate life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Deep within every Christian is the desire to flock together.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A common proverb says, Birds of a feather flock together.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In actuality, it is not having the same feathers that brings birds together; it is having the same life within them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because we all have Christ as the same life within us Col 3:4 , we gather together as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is difficult to enjoy the Lord by ourselves as much as we do in the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is because we have a corporate life within us, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all have a deep desire to be together with the other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is according to the disposition of the spiritual life within us, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This togetherness is the best communal and social life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have been social in this way for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everywhere I travel, I meet many seekers of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Out of this spiritual disposition that desires to flock together, the Body is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although coming together as the Body is wonderful, sometimes certain problems result.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, after Romans comes 1 Corinthians, which shows us the way to deal with the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These problems come mainly from two sources.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The first source is dead, doctrinal knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more dead knowledge we have, the more problems there are.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The second source of problems is the improper practice of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many problems issued from the knowledge and gifts of the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul tells them, Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The divisions that the Corinthians suffered came from their differing kinds of knowledge and practice of the gifts 1:10-12; 12:18-22, 25, 28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In contrast to this, Paul says that we were all given to drink one Spirit v. 13 . The best way to solve all the problems is to drink Jesus, who is the Spirit today.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>First Corinthians 15:45b says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some say that it is heresy to teach that Jesus is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, if the life-giving Spirit, whom Christ became, is not the Holy Spirit, what Spirit is He?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We do not believe that there is another life-giving Spirit besides the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To say this is a real heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We believe in the Divine Trinity in the way of the Bible, not in the way of tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The traditional teaching of the Trinity gives people the impression that there are three Gods the Father is one God, the Son is another, and the Spirit is yet another.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Rather, there is only one God 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In 1 Corinthians we are told that Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit, and we have been given to drink of this one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The way to solve the problems in the church is not to gain more dead knowledge or to have more practice of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is to drink of Christ as the life-giving Spirit by calling Lord Jesus 12:3b .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This causes us to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Following this Epistle is 2 Corinthians, which tells us that Jesus as the life-giving Spirit is the indwelling and transforming One, whom we must behold and reflect with an unveiled face 3:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, 2 Corinthians does not tell us in detail what the veils are.</S>
