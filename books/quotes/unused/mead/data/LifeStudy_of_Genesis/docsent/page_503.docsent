   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FINDING THE FLOW AND GETTING INTO IT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord is still working and moving to accomplish something on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order for Him to fulfill His purpose there must be a flow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Among the many activities taking place in Christian circles, there must be the flow of the Lord's move.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Surely you believe that the Lord is still living, moving, and working on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the principle, there must be one flow of the Lord on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible reveals that there has always been just one flow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There was one flow with Abel, Noah, and Abraham, and at the end of the Old Testament there was still only one flow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is the same in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because the Lord is still living, moving, and working on earth, there must also be just one flow on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since there is only one flow on earth, we should do everything necessary to find out where the flow is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is certainly worthwhile to travel and study in order to find it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am not a stupid person who follows things blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before I leaped into the flow, I searched and researched thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I had given up my job, my family, and everything I had.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I did not want to waste my sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, I took time to study the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, I was convinced that this is the flow, and for more than forty-five years I have not had a doubt about it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After we have seen that there is one flow and we have discovered where the flow is, we must get into it, forgetting our past learnings, concepts, understandings, and viewpoints.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As far as the flow is concerned, all this means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For many, it is rather late to say that they know nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They should have said this at the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From the very day I told Brother Nee that I would move to Shanghai, work with them, and learn of the brothers, I abandoned everything and followed that unique ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I shall never regret that decision.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hallelujah for that choice!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No one can measure the nourishment and perfection I received as the result of turning this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Certain brothers among us have been the same.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They have no time to care for "dung," "feathers," or "bones."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They only have time to absorb all that is in this flow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the proper way to be perfected as useful pillars for the Lord's move.</S>
