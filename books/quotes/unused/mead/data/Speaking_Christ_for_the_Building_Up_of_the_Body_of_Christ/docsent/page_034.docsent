   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AVOIDING MENTIONING PEOPLE S NAMES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to avoid mentioning people s names as much as possible in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Unless it is necessary for some reason, it is much better not to relate negative stories.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If it is really needed, we may refer to negative stories, but it is altogether wrong to mention people s names.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even in giving a positive story or testimony concerning a certain person or persons, it is also wise not to mention their names, if possible, that we may stay away from exalting people and from making mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>AVOIDING LIBERAL AND WRONG INTERPRETATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>OF THE HOLY WORD</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should also avoid liberal and wrong interpretations of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In our speaking, especially in public meetings, when we interpret any part of the holy Word, either a single word, a phrase, a clause, a sentence, a paragraph, a chapter, or a book, we must not take the liberal way as some of the liberal translations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Also we must do our best to avoid wrong, erroneous, and mistaken definitions and significances.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>AVOIDING SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A NUMBER OF UNRELATED POINTS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>WITHOUT A SUBSTANTIAL EMPHASIS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever we speak in the meetings, we must avoid speaking a number of unrelated points without a substantial emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There was a dear brother among us in the church in Shanghai about fifty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever he spoke, he had many good points.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, one of the elders in the church said, Every sentence that this brother speaks is a treasure, but when these sentences are put together, they mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must always try to speak with some definite emphasis; otherwise, our speaking will be minimized.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>AVOIDING ANY KIND OF DEBATE, ARGUMENT,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>OR DEPRECIATION OF OTHERS SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should never debate, argue, or depreciate others speaking in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>People do have a tendency to debate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There was one brother among us who was strong in his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the fellowship was to go west, he would go east.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we dealt with this brother, we exercised much wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we intended to go west, we would say we needed to go east.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He would disagree with this and say that we needed to go west.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we would go west.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This brother just liked to go contrary to whatever anyone else felt.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some of us may be in this category of liking to debate or argue.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the opportunity arises in a meeting, some may say, I don t agree with you, brother.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That kills the entire meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To have a living Christian meeting, we must avoid any kind of debate or argument.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should also not belittle anyone or depreciate others speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Question: What is the difference between reading something in the meeting and speaking it?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Too much analysis of this matter does not help.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to endeavor in a simple way not merely to read but to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By our practice we will learn how to speak the hymns or perhaps to speak something from the printed publications of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not analyze what it is to speak, talk, read, or declare something in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All these things are very close.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Speaking the printed material is very close to reading and declaring.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But there is a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Reading is more according to the letter, while speaking is more free, automatic, and spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Often you may not speak exactly what is printed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You can add a few words which do not affect the meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to practice speaking so that we can enter into the full reality of the new way in our meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more that we practice speaking, the more we will learn.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How much better the meetings in the new way are than the old message meetings depends upon our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our practice in the meetings may be compared to a basketball game.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you put a basketball in my hands, I could not play well with it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But if you give the same ball to five trained players, they will play in a skillful way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To play ball we need certain skills; without learning them we can never function skillfully.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The success of the game depends on the players.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christianity, however, has annulled the function of the members of Christ by building up one speaker as the coach to play ball by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To meet together in the biblical way should be easier today than at the apostles time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At the time of the apostles the believers did not yet have the completed New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They only had the Old Testament and some songs and hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today, however, we not only have the Old Testament but also the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may speak directly from the Bible in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To speak from the Bible is more than adequate for a meeting because the Bible was written in such a spiritual, economical, and rich way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No one can speak a message that can compare to any page of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We also have a good hymnal and a number of good books, such as Truth Lessons, Life Lessons, the Life-study Messages, The Experience of Life, The Economy of God, and The All-Inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may bring any of these books to the meeting, and when we open them, something marvelous will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We do not necessarily need to speak starting from the first section of a chapter, but we can use any page.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We may play ball from any section.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In a meeting you may say, Let us read a section of Life Lessons concerning the two aspects of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Or you may say, Let us speak the nine titles of the Spirit as listed in this section.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have spent much time with much consideration preparing our writings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our writings contain many selections prepared to impress people with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Now we may simply come to them, not merely to read them, but to speak them in a living way in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In a meeting in which we speak in this way, people will surely receive the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Recently a co-worker among us testified that in every place that he served, the most difficult thing for him to do was to give a message in the regular meeting on the Lord s Day morning.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As the Lord s Day approached, he began to suffer by preparing his message.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He had to go to many books to try to select some portions and put them together.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All of us, though, have the riches in a condensed form as our rich groceries.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What we need is simply to learn how to cook.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Moreover, these groceries are inexhaustible; they can be used again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>According to 1 Corinthians 14:26, however, we should not need to have any printed material other than psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to use in the meetings to help us speak.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But all of us are used to relying on something in the meetings from our old way of practice.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If I am used to walking with a cane and you suddenly take it away, I will not be able to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Temporarily, I still need a cane to rely on until I am able to walk without it.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I once had tuberculosis, and it took two and a half years for me to be fully healed.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>During my sickness, I could not walk without something or someone to help me.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We have to realize that we have been crippled by the traditional and unscriptural practice of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Many of us cannot walk by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If the speaker is suddenly taken away from our meetings without anything to replace him, that will be hard.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Thus, we may temporarily use the Life Lessons, the Truth Lessons, the Life-study Messages, or some other spiritual books with weight.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We should not use them in the way of one person speaking or some persons reading but in the way of everyone speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We can use these materials by speaking them corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The meeting should be opened up for everyone to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In the long run, we all will get used to speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Eventually, we will not need a cane, that is, the printed material, in our regular church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We may use a cane, such as the Life Lessons, the Truth Lessons, or the Life-study Messages to help us at the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But I warned the church in Taipei that we must avoid something if we use such a cane, this can build up a bad habit.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We may rely on it too much, and then it could never be taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>While we are walking with the cane, we also have to learn how to walk without it.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Sometimes we need to walk without the cane.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we get tired we may use the cane again to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Gradually, we must learn and be fully strengthened to walk without the cane until we no longer need it.</S>
