   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Revelation in the Gospel of John Life Life Being in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From Sinai we move forward for a thousand years to the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The apostle John saw that life is in Christ John 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe the purpose of John's word is to bring us back to Genesis 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It shows us that the life represented by the tree of life in Eden is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The life which God spoke of at the beginning is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Coming for Us to Have Life</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord declared in John 10:10: "I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord's intention in coming to the earth is for man to have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Following this He shows us how we can have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The above points are the most basic yet crucial things in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every point requires seven or eight days to speak about it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some people have said that all denominations do the same thing, which is to exhort men to believe in Jesus, love the Lord, follow Him, preach the gospel, and love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is true that persuading men to believe in the Lord, live a good Christian life, love the Lord, and follow Him are all good things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But I hope that the brothers and sisters would spend time to study the more crucial things in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How God's Life Can Come into Man</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the Lord spoke about His coming for man to have life in John 10, we see in chapter twelve the way His life gets into man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 24 says, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Within a grain of wheat is life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How can this life be released?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It must die.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the grain does not die, it remains a single grain.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if it falls into the ground and dies and then resurrects, the life of this grain will get into many other grains.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that in order for the Lord to enter into man as life, He must pass through the process of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here we would like to point out that John's way of speaking about the Lord's death is different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We think that the Lord's death is for our redemption, but this was not John's thought.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He had no intention of telling us that the Lord's death was for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When he spoke of the Lord's death, his emphasis was not on redemption but on life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The falling of a grain of wheat to the ground has nothing to do with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It has to do with the release of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Of the four Gospels, only the Gospel of John says that blood and water flowed out at the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We know that the Lord shed His blood for the washing of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The issue of water from the Lord's side, however, refers to the dispensing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John 1:18 says that the Lord is the only Begotten in the bosom of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But in chapter twenty, after the Lord resurrected from the dead, He told Mary, "I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" v. 17 . Hallelujah, through the Lord's death and resurrection, life entered into many people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The one grain became many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Father of One has now become the Father of many.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These are the things that a servant of the Lord has to pay attention to in his pathway of service to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How to Receive God's Life</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John also shows us how we can receive God's life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>John 1:12 says that as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the Lord's side He released His life through death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On our side we receive His life through believing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we receive the Lord, His life enters into us, and we become the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These children are begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</S>
