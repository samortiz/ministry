   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Easy to Receive Edification</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The greatest help that we can receive does not come simply from the correction of our mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The greatest help comes as our outer man is broken and our spirit becomes open and free.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When this happens, we will receive supply from others' spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our spirit will not only be released; it also will receive spiritual help wherever we go.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If our outer man is not broken, it will be hard for us to receive any help from anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose a brother is not broken in the outer man because his mind is too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When this brother comes to the meeting, it will be hard for him to receive any edification.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Unless a head-strong person is confronted with another strong mind, he will not receive any help from anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While other brothers are speaking, he will despise various thoughts, finding them too dull and dry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Others will not be able to render him any help.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He may go on in the same way for a month, two months, a year, or two years without receiving any help at all.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He has a shell in his mentality, and he can only receive help in the mental realm; he cannot receive any spiritual edification.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if the Lord steps into his situation and works on him repeatedly for one, two, or a few years, the shell of his mentality will be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He will realize the futility of his mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He will become like a child, and it will be very easy for him to listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He will no longer dare despise others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he listens to another brother, he will no longer try to catch flaws in his pronunciation, mistakes in his teaching, or ambiguities in meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He will instead touch the speaker's spirit with his own spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As soon as the Lord moves a little in the speaker and his spirit is activated, the brother's spirit will be revived, and he will receive the edification.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a person's spirit is broken, whenever others release their spirit, he will receive edification.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He does not receive edification in doctrine only that is altogether a different matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more dealings a man's spirit receives from God, the more thorough will be the breaking of the outer man, and the more help he will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whenever the Spirit of God moves in a brother or sister, he will receive the help.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He will no longer criticize others according to his doctrines or measure others according to the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He will no longer pay attention to the nicety of the sermon, the eloquence of the speech, or the soundness of the interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His entire attitude will change.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The degree to which we can be helped by others depends on the condition of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Men often pass by us, but we cannot touch their spirit and cannot receive any edification from them because our shell is too thick.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is edification?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not the increase of thoughts, ideas, or doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Edification is when our spirit touches God's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit of God can come out of any man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whether in the meeting or in private fellowship, we will experience the feeding and the reviving as soon as God's Spirit is activated in others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our spirit is like a mirror.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every time we are edified, it is as if someone has polished our spirit a little and made it shine more.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The meaning of edification is nothing less than our spirit being touched by others' spirits or by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Holy Spirit touches our spirit through others' spirits, we receive edification.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What comes out of the spirit ignites us as soon as we touch it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are like an electric lamp that shines as soon as electricity passes through it, without regard to whether the lamp shade is red or green or whether the wires are white or black.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not care what the "lamp shade" is like; our attention is on the release of "electricity" and the fact that we have been revived, that we have been fed before God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we can do this, we will become persons who can receive help easily.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is very hard for many people to receive help.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we want to help them, we have to exert much energy to pray and work on them before they will allow us to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A hard person does not receive help easily.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only those who are pliable will receive help easily.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are two entirely different approaches to edification.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One way is outward, involving thoughts, doctrines, and expositions of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some can claim that they have received help in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The other way is entirely different, involving the touching of spirit with spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When spirits touch, spiritual help is found.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We only touch true Christianity as we touch the second way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is true edification.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If all we know is to listen to sermons, we may hear a good message today.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we happen to hear the same brother preaching on the same message the next Sunday, we will be bored and will want to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We think we need to listen to a message only once.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As far as we are concerned, Christianity involves doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We keep doctrines in our head.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, we must realize that edification has nothing to do with doctrines; it has to do with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If a brother preaches the first time with the release of his spirit, he will touch and change our entire being; we will be washed and revived.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we listen to him a second time and he releases his spirit again, we will receive help once again.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The subject may be old and the doctrines may be the same, but we will receive a cleansing and washing every time his spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have to remember that edification is a contact of spirit with spirit; it is not the increase of thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Edification is an exchange between spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It has nothing to do with receiving some doctrines and teachings from the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The best that can be said of doctrines and teachings that are not vitally linked with the spirit is that they are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After our outer man is broken, it will become easy for us to receive edification; in fact, we will receive much edification.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When others ask us a question, we will receive edification from their asking.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When a sinner comes to us seeking the Lord, we will receive edification as we pray with him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A brother may be in gross error, and the Lord may want us to speak a strong word to him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we touch his spirit, we will be edified once again.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We can receive edification and supply from many directions.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We will feel that the whole Body is supplying us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Any member, whoever he may be, can render us supply.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We will always receive help, and we will become persons who are good at receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The whole church will become our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What riches we will find!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We truly will be able to say that God's riches have now become the riches of the Body, and the riches of the Body have now become our riches.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>How different is this from the increase of thoughts and doctrines!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The difference is too great.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The more help a person can receive and the broader the scope of supply he draws, the more we can say that he is a broken man.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Those who hardly receive any help from anyone are not wiser than others.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It only proves that their outer shell is harder than others' and that nothing can arouse them.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If the Lord grants them mercy and deals with them in strong and multifarious ways, they will receive supply from the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We have to check with ourselves: Can we receive help from others?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we have a hard shell around us, we will not sense the spirit even when the Holy Spirit is released through other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we are broken by God, however, we will receive help whenever others' spirits move.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Even though the move may be very small, what matters is not whether the move is big or small but whether or not we have touched the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>As soon as we touch the spirit, we are revived and edified.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Brothers and sisters, may we all realize that the breaking of the outer man has a great deal to do with receiving help and edification from God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It is the fundamental qualification for working for God.</S>
