   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The precious stones represent the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we were saved we obtained God's nature, but from that time, day after day, the Holy Spirit has been working the nature of God into us so that we may bear the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is not just one fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, and many others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Holy Spirit must continually work in us to cause us to bear all these different kinds of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we were saved, God imparted His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the fruit of the Spirit is not something imparted to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We bear these fruits when the Holy Spirit works within us to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even so, precious stone is something formed in us through the Holy Spirit by means of many different circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not only has God shared His nature with us, but day by day He is making us a certain kind of people who can bring glory to His name.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When you were saved, you obtained God's nature, and when I was saved, I obtained His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this regard, all Christians are the same; they all have obtained God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But in the ensuing days, God may have put you into certain circumstances in order to give you certain kinds of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He may have let you go through certain trials, certain difficulties, and certain sufferings so that you will become a Christian like chrysolite, chalcedony, sardius, or some other precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is working in every Christian so that each one may become a certain kind of precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all have gold in common before God, but after we become precious stones before Him, we will each be a certain form.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What the Holy Spirit forms in us by means of the environment will abide forever.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When a Christian receives more dealings in a certain way, he will learn more lessons in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This will produce an outstanding character in him, a character which will not come to an end after several years, but which will abide for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What he has obtained will forever be a precious stone in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In many of God's children who have walked with Him for ten or twenty years, there is something which God has wrought through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not just that God has imparted something to them, but they themselves have become that something; it is their very constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They have been disciplined by the Holy Spirit for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By passing through many trials and experiences, the Holy Spirit has formed a certain kind of life in them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who are acquainted with them acknowledge that something has indeed been accomplished in them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They not only possess the life that is given to them by God, but they also have a transformed life which the Holy Spirit has wrought within them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not only do they live an exchanged life but also a transformed life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Precious stone is that which has been formed in us by the burning work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The New Jerusalem will be filled with these precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At this point we must realize how useless it is to put our emphasis merely on doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must never think that we will benefit if we only know a little more theology or scriptural teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These are not of much use.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only that which is burned into us by the Holy Spirit is of value.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If something has not been burned into an article, a little rubbing will remove it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What spiritual value is there in something which can be wiped away from us with a little rubbing?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This does not mean that we should not read our Bible, but it does mean that what we read is of value only when the Holy Spirit burns it into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All precious stones have come out of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To have precious stones, we need the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without fire, there will never be any precious stone.</S>
