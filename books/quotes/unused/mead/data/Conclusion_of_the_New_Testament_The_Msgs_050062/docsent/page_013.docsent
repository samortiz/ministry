   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Rock Flowing with the Spiritual Drink</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul's word in 1 Corinthians 10:4 indicates that Christ is the rock flowing with the spiritual drink: "All drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The spiritual drink here refers to the living water that flowed out of the cleft rock Exo 17:6 , which typifies the Spirit as our all-inclusive drink John 7:37-39; 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should all drink the same spiritual drink, not drinking anything other than the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through incarnation Christ came to earth as the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At Calvary He was crucified, smitten by God's law with its power and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His side was cleft John 19:34 , and living water flowed forth for us to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This living water is the Spirit, the ultimate issue of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This spiritual drink quenches our thirst and fully satisfies our being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Literally, the Greek words rendered "a spiritual rock which followed" are "a spiritual following rock."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The rock that was smitten and cleft to flow out the living water for God's chosen people was a physical rock.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet Paul calls it a spiritual rock because it typifies Christ smitten and cleft by God to flow out the water of life to satisfy the thirst of His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, Paul says that the rock was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because it was a spiritual rock signifying Christ, it was able to follow the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that Christ as the real rock is following the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not regard the eating and drinking of Christ as mere parables or metaphors.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These are facts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Daily, even hourly, we should eat and drink of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In John 6 the Lord says that He came from heaven to be our food.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is not a parable or a metaphoric utterance; it is a divine fact.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In John 7:37 and 38 He goes on to say that whoever thirsts may come to Him and drink and that out of his inner being will flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This also is a heavenly fact.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although eating and drinking are very common in our daily living, in the Bible they are matters of crucial significance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is by our eating and drinking of Christ that God works Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By eating and drinking we take the Lord in, and He becomes one with us organically.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we eat and drink certain elements, those elements are taken into us and become one with us in substance and essence.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we eat and drink, our food becomes one with us organically, and, when it has been digested and assimilated, it actually becomes part of our being, our very fiber and tissue.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Realizing this will help us to see the importance of eating and drinking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all need to eat Him and drink Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the biblical record, drinking is more important than eating.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Scriptures more is said about spiritual water, or the water of life, than about spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are enlightened by the Lord, we shall realize that we need drinking even more than eating.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For this reason, in 1 Corinthians Paul emphasizes drinking more than eating.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1 Corinthians 12:13 he says that we have been given to drink of one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, drinking includes eating.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that the spiritual food is included in the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without the water of life, we cannot have spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, if we fail to drink, we shall not be able to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to Revelation 22:1 and 2, the tree of life grows in the river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This reveals that wherever the water of life flows, there the tree of life grows.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The fact that the river flows from the throne and that the tree grows in the river indicates that the spiritual drink is even more crucial than the spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To the believers Christ is both spiritual food and the rock flowing with the spiritual drink.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>22.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Light</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In His person to the believers Christ is also light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>John 1:4 says, "In Him was life, and the life was the light of men."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is absolutely true that the life is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we called on the name of the Lord Jesus, receiving Him into us, the divine light came into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Immediately we had the sense of something shining within, but perhaps, at the time, we did not have the language or the utterance to describe it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That shining was the shining of Christ as light.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because this light shines, the life is the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The shining of the light within us is a strong confirmation that we have been born of God to be His children.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the Word is heard and life is received, the life becomes the light shining within to enlighten us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When Christ, as the divine life, shines within us as the light of life, we are under His enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Having been born of God by receiving the Word, we have the divine life, eternal life, and this life becomes the light shining within us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ is the Word of God, the expression of God by which we may know God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we receive Him as the expression of God, He becomes our life, and this life becomes the light that shines within us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Ephesians 5:14 also indicates that Christ is light to the believers: "Wherefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from among the dead, and Christ shall shine on you."</S>
