   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE DESTINY OF BELSHAZZAR</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 30 and 31 speak of the destiny of Belshazzar.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. Belshazzar Being Slain That Very Night</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 30 says, "In that very night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was slain."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is no indication in the record that Belshazzar repented or had some kind of change.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Probably there was no time for him to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>B. Darius the Mede</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Receiving the Kingdom of Babylon</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I believe that while Belshazzar and his lords were engaging in debauchery, the Median army was approaching the city.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Soon after Daniel interpreted the writing, the Median army entered the city and the palace and killed Belshazzar.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, verse 31 concludes, "Darius the Mede received the kingdom at about the age of sixty-two."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That ended the Babylonian Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the first five chapters of Daniel, there are a number of lessons for us to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For instance, the lesson in chapter one is that we should not care for the worldly choice and the worldly taste but set our heart on God and have a taste only for vegetables, that is, for simple food.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should receive only simple things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do this, we will be one with God and will become wise.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In chapter five concerning the case of Belshazzar, we see the importance of being serious with God and not disregarding any spiritual lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Belshazzar did not benefit from the lesson learned by his forefather Nebuchadnezzar in chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The case of Nebuchadnezzar teaches us that we need to be careful and not consider what we have achieved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The palace built by Nebuchadnezzar was vast.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he took a walk on the roof of that palace, he became proud and said, "Is this not Babylon the great, which I have built up as a royal house by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>4:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This should warn us that our achievement may make us proud, and this may usher in God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's judgment upon Nebuchadnezzar reduced him to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was the reason he could say of the Lord, "All the inhabitants of earth are considered as nothing, / But He does according to His will in the army of heaven / And among the inhabitants of the earth; / And there is no one who can resist His hand / Or say to Him, What are You doing?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>4:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 4:37 concerning the Lord, Nebuchadnezzar went on to say, "He is able to abase those who walk in pride."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Belshazzar should have learned the lesson from Nebuchadnezzar's experience; however, he did not learn the lesson and suffered as a result.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Belshazzar's situation should make a deep impression on us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all need to see that if we have received some lesson from God, we must regard that very seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we disregard any lesson, we will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Among all the events in chapter five, or going along with all these events, God's economy was being carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God knew how to manage the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not think that Darius the Mede came to kill Belshazzar by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No, that was God carrying out His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If He had left the empire in the hand of the Babylonians, there could never have been a return of the captives to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, the empire had to be changed from gold to silver.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was God's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This was God's tempering, His balance in His economy, to fulfill His plan.</S>
