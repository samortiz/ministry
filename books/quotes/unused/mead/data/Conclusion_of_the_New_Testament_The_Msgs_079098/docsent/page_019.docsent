   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE EIGHTY-THREE THE SPIRIT HIS ATTRIBUTES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall cover the attributes of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We use the word "attributes" to denote the virtues of God's being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God has a nature, and this nature is for His being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In God's being there are many excellencies, and these excellencies are the virtues of the divine being.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may consider these virtues the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, when we speak of the attributes of God, we mean the excellencies of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Likewise, the attributes of the Spirit are the excellencies, the virtues, of what the Spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first attribute of the Spirit is life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This life, of course, is the divine, eternal, uncreated life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the New Testament physical life and psychological life are indicated by the Greek words bias and psuche respectively.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Paul speaks of life in Romans 8:2, however, he uses another Greek word, the word zoe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Bible zoe denotes God's life, the divine, infinite, uncreated, eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the life we receive by believing in the Lord Jesus: "He who believes in the Son has eternal life" John 3:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul uses this Greek word for life in Romans 8 to indicate the dispensing of the divine life into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God desires to dispense Himself as life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This dispensing began when we were regenerated, for at that time we received eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The life which is an attribute of the Spirit is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word "eternal" denotes not only the duration of time, which is everlasting, without end, but also the quality, which is absolutely perfect and complete, without any shortage or defect.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moreover, the life which is eternal is eternal with respect to its sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the word eternal denotes three things: time, space, and quality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As to the element of time, this life will last forever.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As to space, to sphere, this life is vast, unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As to quality, eternal life is perfect and complete, without defect or shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The sphere of eternal life encompasses the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eternal life is neither temporary nor limited; rather it is everlasting with respect to time and unlimited with respect to space.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, eternal life has no defects or shortages.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Spirit is the Spirit of such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit and life are one and cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is of life, and life is of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Life is His content, and He is the reality of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Speaking more accurately, the Spirit is not only the reality of life but also life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Life is of the Spirit and issues from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit is the source, whereas life is the current, or flow, that comes from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit is the Spirit of life because God and Christ being life hinges on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Father is the source of life, the very life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because the Son is the manifestation of the Father 1 Tim 3:16 , He is the manifestation of life 1 John 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And because the Spirit is the entering of the Son, He is the entering in of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Life originally is in the Father, in the Son it is manifested among man, and as the Spirit it enters into man for man to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, the Spirit becomes the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because the Spirit is the Spirit of life, we can receive life through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because the Spirit is the Spirit of life, when we exercise our spirit to touch the Spirit, we touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we contact the Spirit, we contact life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The book of Romans speaks of having life 1:17 , of being saved in life 5:10 , of reigning in life 5:17 , of walking in newness of life 6:4 , and of being sanctified in life 6:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because the Spirit is of life, the way to have life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The way to be saved in life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The way to reign in life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The way to walk in newness of life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The way to be sanctified in life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Life belongs to the Spirit, and the Spirit is of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we have the Spirit, we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we do not have the Spirit, we do not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we walk in the Spirit, we walk in life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we do not walk in the Spirit, we do not walk in the newness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, the way to experience the divine, eternal, uncreated life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because the Spirit has the attribute of life, the divine life is being dispensed into us in a threefold way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>First, our spirit becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"If Christ is in you...the spirit is life because of righteousness" Rom 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ is the Triune God who has become the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As the life-giving Spirit, Christ dwells in our spirit, and His indwelling makes our spirit life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Second, "the mind set on the spirit is life" Rom 8:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The mind is the leading part of our soul and represents the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thus, when the mind becomes life, our soul becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Finally, life is imparted to our mortal bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>According to Romans 8:11, He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead gives life to our mortal bodies through the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, life is imparted into us in a threefold way: our spirit becomes life, our mind becomes life, and life is imparted to our mortal bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All this is through the Spirit of life.</S>
