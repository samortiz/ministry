   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE TWO THE SUBJECT OF THE BOOK Scripture Reading: Luke 24:44-49; Mark 16:15-16, 19-20; Matt 28:18-20; Acts 1:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that the book of Acts may be considered the dividing line, or the backbone, of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This book divides the four Gospels from the Epistles, which include the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Gospels present a completed Redeemer and His accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Acts we have the propagation of the completed Redeemer and His accomplished redemption for the producing of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then in the Epistles we have the edifying of the believers and the building up of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE PROPAGATION OF THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Having seen the position of the book of Acts, let us now go on to see the subject of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The subject of Acts is the propagation of the resurrected Christ in His ascension, by the Spirit, through the disciples, for the producing of the churches the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Acts is concerned with the propagation of the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is carrying out this propagation in His ascension, by the Spirit, and through the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The purpose of Christ s propagation is the producing of the churches the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Acts there is not a single verse that can be taken as a summary of the entire book.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The best way to present a summary, or extract, of Acts is to describe its subject.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, once again I would point out that the subject of the book of Acts concerns the propagation of the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is of great value for us to have such a phrase as the propagation of the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I do not know of any book on Acts that uses the word propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, the subject of Acts is the propagation of the resurrected Christ in His ascension, by the Spirit, through the disciples, for the producing of the churches the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The propagation in Acts is not the propagation of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Acts we do not have the propagation merely of the One who lived in the home of a carpenter in Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, in Acts we see the propagation of the resurrected One, the propagation of the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>CHRIST S ACTIVITY IN HIS ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The propagation of the resurrected Christ is carried out by Christ in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, but now He is in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In His ascension the Lord is very active.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should never think that the ascended Christ is sitting passively on the throne, observing the pitiful situation on earth and feeling disappointed about it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No, in His ascension Christ is active in a very positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the ascended One, He is now doing many things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The case of the stoning of Stephen is an illustration of Christ s activity in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Speaking of Stephen, Acts 7:55 and 56 say, Being full of the Holy Spirit, looking intently into heaven, he saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; and he said, Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the Lord was looking at the situation on earth in His ascension, He stood up.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Perhaps He was saying, You persecutors may stone Stephen and put him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But I will gain one of you Saul of Tarsus and make him much stronger than Stephen.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What can you do about this?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You do your stoning, and I do My observing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Wait for a period of time, and you will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Stephen s case illustrates that the resurrected Christ is very active in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The fact that Christ is now in ascension means not only that He is in the heavens; it also means that He has power and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In His ascension Christ has all the power and all the authority in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to Matthew 28:18, the resurrected Christ said to His disciples, All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, with such authority and power in His ascension the Lord is very active.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What is He doing?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord, as the ascended One, is carrying out His universal and eternal propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Who can explain why the earth today is filled with Christians?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why are there so many believers in the world?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Great men have tried to gain control of the earth, but they have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hitler, for example, tried to do this, but eventually he lost everything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Napoleon, after he had been defeated, reportedly looked up to the heavens and confessed that Jesus had beaten him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Napoleon admitted that even though the Lord Jesus did not fight, He gained everything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The point here is that the whole earth is in the hands of the undefeatable One, and this One is carrying out His propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As the ascended Christ is carrying out His propagation, His main work is not fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead of fighting, the ascended Lord s work is mainly propagating Himself throughout the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Lord s recovery we have people of different colors: black, white, brown, yellow, and red.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We all are part of Christ s propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have been produced by the resurrected Christ in His ascension.</S>
