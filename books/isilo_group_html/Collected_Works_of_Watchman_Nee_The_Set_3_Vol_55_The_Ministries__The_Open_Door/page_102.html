There were seventeen brothers and sisters who were baptized into the Lord's church. God had mercy on me, one who is lazy, weak, and fearful, and who has unprofitably occupied a place in Jiaxing for many years. For this reason, I marvel and grieve all the more. I can only praise God with all my strength in tears. Thank God. On that day the whole church praised God with joy such as they had never experienced before!</p><p>We look to God to have mercy on us and to guide these newly baptized, fresh, and living brothers and sisters that they would go on in the way before them. We are young and weak, and we are prone to ruin things. We hope the elderly brothers can come to teach us often.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Wang Wen-jiang<br />August 28, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: 40 Xian Chang Street, Jiaxing, Chekiang province</p><h2 class="head2">Edified First</h2><p>I received the book you gave me for the edification of the new believers. Thank the Lord! The new brothers were not the only ones edified; I was edified first. Although I have believed in the Lord for many years, I am inwardly weak, poor, and pitiful! I lack basic training. I could never find this kind of light if I spent my entire life studying by myself. Thank the Lord for having mercy on me, even though I am so unworthy! I look forward to the beginning of the third training session at Kuling. I often kneel in prayer to ask for God's mercy! I will return to Shanba on the twenty-sixth. Brother Yu and Brother Chu left Sian on the twenty-fifth for Linjin, Zhengzhou, and Hsuzhou before returning to Shanghai.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chao Xu-dong<br />September 25, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: 29 Jie-Fang Road, Shaba, Suiyuan province</p><p>(Brother Yu and Brother Chu received a desperate invitation from the church in Tsinan after they had arrived in Hsuzhou, so they went to Tsinan. On October 21 they returned safely to Shanghai from Tsinan. We hope these two brothers will fellowship more with us about their visit in the past two months to the churches in the Northwest and to the churches along the road between Tientsin and Shanghai.&mdash;Editor)</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_101.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_103.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 55: The Ministries & The Open Door &nbsp; pg 102</div><br></body></html>
