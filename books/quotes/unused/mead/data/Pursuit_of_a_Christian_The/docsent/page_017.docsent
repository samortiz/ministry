   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Giving Cheerfully</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let me illustrate this matter further.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before a person is saved, he is always happy whenever he receives something, regardless of whether he has received it as a gift, he has earned it, or he has obtained it by some unrighteous means.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Have you ever experienced, however, that the joy of giving is much greater than the joy of receiving?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of course, we are joyful when someone gives us a sum of money or any material thing that delights us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This, however, is not our greatest joy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We experience the greatest joy when we give to others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I have had many such experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have some amount of joy when someone has given me a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, that joy is outward and not inward.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the other hand, when I offer help to the needy brothers and sisters by sending them gifts, that joy is beyond description.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many brothers and sisters have no joy because they are unwilling to give.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The life received by Christians has a special nature and character cheerful giving.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus told a young man to sell all his possessions and follow Him Matt 19:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John the Baptist also said, "He who has two tunics, let him share with the one who has none" Luke 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the life of Christ came into us, the nature of cheerful giving also came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can see how great our joy will be if we are willing to give some of our possessions to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Honestly speaking, as Christians, we should voluntarily set aside some of our possessions and share them with the poor and the needy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we practice this, we will definitely have the inner joy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose some brothers and sisters are in financial difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When other brothers and sisters find out about this matter, they remember these needy ones before the Lord and provide some financial assistance to them in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You can just imagine what a joy it will be to the needy ones when they receive the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then one day when these ones who received the supply find out that other brothers and sisters are having financial difficulties, they too will contribute a portion of their resources according to the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Their joy then will be far sweeter than their former joy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>May we all have a taste of such sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not Resisting</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, a Christian also has a nature that delights in yielding instead of resisting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Matthew 5 the Lord Jesus tells us, "Whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And to him who wishes to sue you and take your tunic, yield to him your cloak also; and whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>39-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is not merely a teaching; it is the nature of a Christian's life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, you may be engaged in a business with another brother, and when it comes time to settle accounts, you may get into an argument concerning some of the profits and dividends.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Consider this: Are you happier when you are fighting for your share or when you willingly receive less?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose you and I are engaged in business.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the year-end settlement of accounts, you want to take fifty percent of the profits, and I want sixty percent because I believe that I put in more effort.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Who has the joy in such a situation you or I?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the end, neither of us has any joy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If, having enjoyed grace, you say to me, "Brother, you may have one hundred percent," then you will be joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And if I also say to you, "Brother, you may take all the profits," then I will also be filled with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once two brothers came to me because they had a dispute about some business dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brother A said that Brother B was asking for too much money, while Brother B said it was Brother A who broke his promise because that was the sum agreed upon originally.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They asked me to represent the church to settle the matter fairly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, I had some fellowship with the leading brothers and they all said, "This is totally unreasonable!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How could a brother ask for more than his share from another brother?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And how could a brother refuse to give what is due another brother?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They all agreed that the matter should be settled equitably but did not know how to proceed, so they consulted me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I said, "We should tell Brother A to give everything to Brother B, and we should also ask Brother B to give everything to Brother A."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the teaching and the principle shown in the Bible, resisting one another does not issue in peace and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, when Brother A came to me, I said, "You have asked me to settle this matter fairly, and I feel that the best way of settlement is to go beyond fairness."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He asked, "What do you mean by going beyond fairness?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I told him that it simply meant that he had to give everything to Brother B. Then he asked, "How could this be?" I said, "According to what you said, it is fair to give him thirty percent.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If I instruct you according to your word, apparently I am helping you, but in reality I am doing you harm because you will lose your joy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the other hand, if you give him all, you will have joy and your joy will be full."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Upon hearing this, Brother A began to shed tears, though not tears of sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then he knelt down to pray and left rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When Brother B came, I also said to him, "We have to go beyond fairness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Bible rightly says that when brothers contend with one another, what they gain is dung, and they will not have joy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As Christians, we should yield to others willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whoever slaps us on our right cheek, we turn to him the other also.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To be a Christian is to be able to turn the other cheek to be slapped.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you give him all, then you will overflow with joy."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Upon hearing this, Brother B also knelt down to pray because he truly had the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Consider this: Who has joy the one who strikes or the one who is struck?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Christians are very peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They rejoice in being struck but do not rejoice in striking others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is why I told those two brothers that if we insist on being treated fairly, surely we will lose our joy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The life of Christians is a life of peace and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whenever we contend with others, we have neither peace nor joy.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we are not like this, there may be two problems: either we are not saved or the life within us is not adequately manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Bible tells us that it is more blessed to give than to receive Acts 20:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have the inner joy when we delight in giving, more than in receiving.</S>
