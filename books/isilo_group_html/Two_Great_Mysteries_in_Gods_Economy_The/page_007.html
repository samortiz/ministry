After He took the two steps of incarnation and resurrection, He had the full position to tell His disciples to baptize people into this Triune God. How could we baptize people into the Triune God except by putting them into the very life-giving Spirit? The very life-giving Spirit is the issue of the Son who is the embodiment of the Father. The Father is in the Son, and the Son becomes the Spirit. Now we baptize people into the Spirit. This means that we put people into the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Is this not marvelous! Now we all can see that the Father in the Son becoming the Spirit has come into us, and we all have been put into the very Triune God. Now the very God and we, we and the very God, are just one spirit. It is in this way that the Triune God has been dispensed into our being. This is the first aspect of God&#8217;s economy. In God&#8217;s economy the first step that He has taken is to become a man. The second is to become the life-giving Spirit that we may call on Him, that the Spirit may get into us, and that we may be put into Him. We must realize that today He is right within us and that we are all in Him. He is in us, and we are in Him. This is neither a tradition nor a superstition. This is a fact. Who can deny that this very God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-is right now within us, and we are right now in Him? This is the very mystery carried out by the first aspect of His economy.<p>Paul prayed to the Father that we might be strengthened by the Spirit into our inner man that Christ may make His home in us (Eph. 3:14,16-17). Here we have the Father, the Spirit, and Christ. Could we see the Trinity here? The Apostle Paul prayed to the Father that He might strengthen us into our inner man by His Spirit that Christ may make His home in us to take full possession of our being. He prayed that eventually, we may be able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth. In other words, with all the saints, we can apprehend the dimension of the whole universe, which is just the capacity of the Triune God in His Christ. Could anyone tell us what is the breadth of the whole universe? Could we tell what are the depths and the heights? No one can tell. This is the dimension of the whole universe, and this is just the capacity of our God in Christ &#8220;that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God&#8221; (Eph. 3:19). I just cannot explain this to you. This is not a moral teaching. This is not an ethical teaching. This is not anything philosophical. This is just to pray to the Father that He might strengthen our inner man by His Spirit that Christ might make His home in us. Then eventually we will be filled unto all the fullness of God. We all have to shout that we are one with God in a mysterious way! This is not evolution into God, but this is immersion, that is, all of the redeemed human beings are immersed into God. We all have been immersed into God. We are all filled with God, possessed by God, permeated, soaked, saturated, immersed, and mingled with God. God and we, we and God, all become one. Do not think that this is too much. How wonderful! We all are soaked, permeated, immersed, infused, and mingled with God. God is in us, and we are in God. Hallelujah! God is one with us, and we are one with Him. This is the mystery, the mystery carried out by God&#8217;s economy.<p>Most Christians today only know the Bible on the surface; they do not know things under the surface. They know the Bible in black and white, but they do not know the mystery. What we are touching now is the mystery hidden underneath the black and white. Hallelujah! We do have the subjective, personal experience to confirm that the more we call on His name, the more we are immersed, saturated, permeated, and infused with Him. Our whole being will be soaked in His Being. The more we pray to Him, the more we call on His name, the more we feel that He becomes one with us, and we become one with Him! What is this? This is the dispensing of the Triune God into our being. This is not a Christian religion. This is the reality of the Triune God dispensing Himself into our being. Then we will be so nice, so good, and so loving yet without any realization. People may say that we are so nice, yet we do not feel that we are nice. People may say that we are so loving, yet we do not feel that we have any love. This is not the human love. This is not the human niceness. This is just the issue of the divine dispensing. This is absolutely different from ethical teachings or any kind of philosophy. This is a divine fact, a divine reality, wrought into our very being by the dispensing power, the dispensing operation, of the Triune God.<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&#8221; This is just the dispensing. It is the immersion of our being in all the attributes of the Godhead. The love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Spirit be with you all. We all are soaking ourselves in such a &#8220;big ocean.&#8221; We are soaking in the divine ocean. Day after day all the divine attributes will be soaked up by our being.<h2 class=head2>The New Jerusalem</h2><p>The Bible is more than consistent. In the first chapter you have the Triune God. In the last chapter the Triune God is also revealed. The last chapter mentions God, the Lamb, and a river of living water (Rev. 22:1-2). No doubt God is the Father, the Lamb is the Son, and the river of living water signifies the flowing Spirit. Here we see the Triune God again, but very much developed. In chapter one of Genesis the Triune God was just called God. In the last chapter of the Bible this God is the fountain on the throne; the Son is the redeeming Lamb, and the Spirit is the flowing river of the water of life to reach every part of the whole city of humanity. The New Jerusalem represents the whole body of humanity which is watered by the flowing river. The flowing river issues out of the redeeming God, who is the Son with the Father. Now the created man not only bears the image of the processed and dispensing Triune God, but this humanity is fully saturated and permeated with the flowing river, the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God.<h2 class=head1>IMMERSED IN THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>Do not listen to all the inaccurate teachings concerning the Triune God. In the Vatican in Rome there is a big painting on the wall. An old man is sitting there with a long beard, a young man is standing there as the Son, and a dove is soaring above as the Spirit. They call that the painting of the Trinity. There is also another painting there that is very similar to this one. The old father is sitting, the young son is standing, and the dove is soaring. Right in between them there is a lady. They add one into the Trinity-Mary. That is devilish! That is the leaven added into the pure revelation of the divine Trinity.<p>The divine Trinity today is right within us. The Father is here, the Son is here, and the Spirit is here. Right now we all are in the Trinity. Praise Him for such a mystery! This is a mystery, yet it has been carried out by God&#8217;s economy through His way of dispensing. First He became a man to be the Lamb to accomplish redemption and take away our sins. Then in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is the realization of the Son, and the Son is the embodiment of the Father. So, today when we believe in the Son, we have the Father. When we call on the name of the Son, we get the Spirit. Now we are one with Him. Praise Him! This is the divine mystery carried out by the divine economy through the steps of the divine dispensing.<p>In the last chapter of Revelation this Triune God is the One on the throne, the One who redeemed us, and the One who is flowing in a spiral way through us to water us with all that He is. Here we have the quenching of thirst. Here we have the nourishment of the tree of life. Here we have satisfaction, and here we have rest.<p>The most impressive thing is that we become one with God in a mysterious way. Hallelujah! We can shout that God is no more merely God, He is now God with humanity. He is now God wrapped up and mingled with us. And we are no more merely human beings; we are now human beings saturated, immersed, and infused with the Triune God.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Two Great Mysteries in God's Economy &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
