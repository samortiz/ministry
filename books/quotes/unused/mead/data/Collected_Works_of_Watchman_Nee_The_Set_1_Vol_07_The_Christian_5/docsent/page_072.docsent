   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXERCISING THE GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: How can a congregation identify those who have been gifted to oversee it?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to Acts 13:1-3, is the laying on of hands, and an open declaration of such, something condemned by the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the limit of authority of those who oversee the church?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If they do not have any authority at all, how can they settle disputes in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is true that the authority of the church rests with the whole congregation, but does this mean that everyone should exercise his own authority and should not be bound by anything?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Or should a few be elected to execute orders so that things can be accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Kuo</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Answer: The church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can only understand the gifts through the function of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible always puts gifts and the Body together Rom 12, 1 Cor 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have said elsewhere that the laying on of hands in the Bible is not a kind of acknowledgement of gift.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to differentiate between gift and office.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A gift is for the perfecting of the whole Body, whereas an office is for the administration of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Gifts are for the whole Body of Christ, whereas an office is for one individual church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Bible we see such a thing as men being ordained to oversee a church, but we never see anyone ordained to preach the word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Preaching is a gift, whereas administration is an office.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In those meetings that are in His name, a young man can exercise his gift to teach the congregated believers even though some in the congregation may be a few times older than he is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But his age prohibits him from being an elder to settle others' disputes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The present systems in the various denominations do not differentiate between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is due to error and ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who oversee do not necessarily preach: "Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching" 1 Tim 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This verse tells us that some elders only oversee the church, but do not preach or teach.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The office of an elder is for the administration of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, some of them also receive additional gifts of preaching and teaching from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>An elder who preaches or teaches in the church does not do so because he was ordained and was thus qualified to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A young man who does not occupy any office is as qualified to preach and teach as an elder who occupies an office.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In summary, the gifts mentioned in the Bible including preaching, teaching, and shepherding can be exercised by all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who have these gifts are qualified to exercise these gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The office of overseeing the church is the responsibility of the elders together with other serving deacons .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible does not acknowledge the gifts by the way of the laying on of hands, but as to the office, there is the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As to the question of the elders and their relationship to the laying on of hands, we have covered this matter elsewhere and will not repeat it here.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The laying on of hands in Acts 13 is a matter of identification.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Otherwise, you would have the impossible case of a prophet ordaining an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The extent of authority of the overseeing one is a spiritual matter, and not fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One should administer the church by prayer, godliness, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible does not permit any form of imposition 1 Pet 5:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Bible does not have such a thing as the election of overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those whom God has raised up should make themselves approved by their faith, love, and example; the believers will spontaneously recognize them as God's chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church is a Body, not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, we cannot have everyone to be free to exercise his right.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the church were a social club, we could do this, but it is not a social club.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because there are so many unregenerated ones mixed in the church, problems occur when we practice according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Either this is the case, or the majority of the believers are fleshly and have never been taught of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those believers who are mature in the Lord are responsible for rebuking such things when they happen.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is true liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But this is at the same time more bondage than before.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is nothing more binding than the bonds in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If everyone wants to have absolute freedom, we will end up with lawlessness, which is the spirit of Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In short, authority is spiritual, not something that the flesh can approve.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>SCRIPTURAL ORGANIZATION</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Question: What is the scriptural way to meet, to serve God, and to oversee and shepherd the church of God?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How should we be acquainted with each other socially?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How should we collect the offerings, and how should we distribute the offerings?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How should we assign people to preach, and what is the way to take care of the different branch mission halls?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How should we have "all things...done becomingly and in order"?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Please explain to me in detail, for I want to find a church organization and practice that is absolutely according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Kuo</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Answer: I am so happy to read the last few lines of your letter.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There are not very many people in these days who are seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many people are not willing to pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many have their own opinions, and many do not have a willingness to obey, so the church of God becomes what it is today.</S>
