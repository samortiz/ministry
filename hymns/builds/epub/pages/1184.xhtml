<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>1</b> In Revelation chapter one</div>
<div class='line'>God gives a vision of the Son,</div>
<div class='line'>Of Him who was and is to come;</div>
<div class='line'>Oh, let us to this One now come.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> In spirit hear His trumpet voice;</div>
<div class='line'>We must be turned to see His choice -</div>
<div class='line'>The seven lampstands golden fair;</div>
<div class='line'>The Son of Man is walking there.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> The great high priestly robe He wears,</div>
<div class='line'>For every church He fully cares:</div>
<div class='line'>He trims the lamp, the oil supplies;</div>
<div class='line'>He makes them burn, flames in His eyes.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>4</b> A golden girdle on His breast -</div>
<div class='line'>His work is done, and from His rest</div>
<div class='line'>He unto all the churches pours</div>
<div class='line'>Himself in love, the treasure store.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>5</b> His head, His hair is white as wool -</div>
<div class='line'>The ancient One with youth is full.</div>
<div class='line'>His face is shining as the sun</div>
<div class='line'>To burn and lighten every one.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>6</b> Oh, when this living One we see,</div>
<div class='line'>We'll fall as dead, we'll finished be.</div>
<div class='line'>But then the Lord His comfort gives -</div>
<div class='line'>He once was dead, but now He lives.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>7</b> Let every church just love Him more -</div>
<div class='line'>His riches then He will outpour.</div>
<div class='line'>All others loves now lay aside;</div>
<div class='line'>Let's take this Jesus, none beside.</div>
