   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE MEASUREMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The length of each board was ten cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ten is composed of two times five.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since five signifies the number of responsibility, ten is two times responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As standing boards in the church, we need to bear a double responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, the number two stands not only for doubling, but also for testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our double responsibility is a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we all bear responsibility in a double way, we shall have a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The width of each board, one and a half cubits, is the same as the width of the ark and its height.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The length of the ark is two and a half cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that the dimensions of the ark are all in half units.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is also true of the width of each standing board.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One half of three cubits indicates that every believer is a half needing to be matched by another to form three cubits for the building of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the Old Testament, the numbers three and five are the basic numbers of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With the tabernacle there are many instances of the numbers three and five or of multiples of these numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have seen that five is the number of responsibility and that three is the number of the Triune God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the use of the numbers three and five in God s building indicates that the building requires much responsibility in resurrection by the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As boards, none of us is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the church life, as in married life, we all are halves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are one and a half cubits, and we need another board to make a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Throughout the years in the church life I have learned that I cannot be independent, that I cannot be a single board.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I need to be coupled; that is, I need another half, another board, to make a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Married life can be illustrated by a three-legged race.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this race each pair of runners has one leg free and the other tied to one of his partner s legs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Running the race successfully depends on each pair working together in good coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The two must run as if they were one person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, in married life it is not easy for a husband and wife to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The wife may freely express her opinions, and the husband may be difficult and demanding.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, instead of a couple living in true oneness, there is division.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The same problem is often found in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is most damaging to the service of the church is the expression of opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even in the matter of vacuuming the carpets in the meeting hall, saints may have many different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the church life it is very difficult to be coupled, to be matched, with others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can be matched with other boards only when we experience the acacia wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Certain saints are willing to serve in the church, but they want to do things all by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some may even say, If the brothers want me to do a certain thing, they should let me do it alone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Don t let anyone interfere with what I am doing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who serve the church in this way make their area of service their private possession.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, we all must learn to do things in the church in the way of sharing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nothing should be kept in our hands in a private way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A brother may bear the responsibility for a certain matter faithfully and diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nevertheless, he may be too individualistic and keep the matter of service too private.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He may not be willing to allow others to share in this aspect of the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At times I have advised the saints not to take care of church matters in their homes, but to do everything in the meeting hall in a public way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To serve the church privately and individualistically is to serve as a single board which is not joined to another.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The tabernacle, however, was built of many boards which were connected.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to realize that we are just one of many boards, that we are only half a unit, and that we need another board to complete us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We thank the Lord that during the last ten years the situation and condition among us regarding the standing boards has improved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But we still need more improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I hope that everyone who serves in the church will serve in a corporate way, realizing that he is a half unit and needs another to match him.</S>
