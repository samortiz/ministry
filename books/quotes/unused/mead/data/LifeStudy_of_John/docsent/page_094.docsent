   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With Different Functions a. Serving</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the church life there are different functions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are three kinds of functions in the service of the church represented by the three persons in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Firstly is the serving function represented by Martha 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Throughout all the centuries, Martha has been treated unfairly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Throughout history, Christians have looked down on her.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not condemn Martha.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is unfair to condemn her.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not think that Martha is no good, for this chapter says that Martha served.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is very good, for, in the church service, the business affairs of the church must be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How could we have the food taken care of without Martha?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need her to prepare the food.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I appreciate Martha s service.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all must change our concept about her and not look down on her.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should encourage the sisters to be Marthas.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps you sisters are still quite spiritual and religious, but I am rather practical.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I do not want to be that spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suppose all the sisters are Marys sitting there quietly being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Who is going to prepare the meal?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must have some Marthas who are diligent, capable, active, living, and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although we are spiritual, we must still serve practically.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Martha s service was needed in that house.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise, in the church service, the first function needed is to serve by doing certain things, by taking care of certain practical affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Testifying</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The second kind of function in the service of the church is represented by Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It appears as if Lazarus did nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He just sat there at the table with the Lord, enjoying the feast with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But we must remember that Lazarus was the living testimony of the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He did not testify by doing but by living in the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His testimony was not in labor or in works; it was in the enjoyment of the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was a witness to the power of the Lord s resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Wherever he was, the testimony of resurrection life was there.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Martha s service was good, but it did not attract people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was the testimony of Lazarus that attracted them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This does not mean that Martha s service was not good and was not needed, for certain things had to be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even Lazarus had to be served by Martha.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we must realize that even when we have a good testimony of life, we still need the service of Martha.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Otherwise, we will have nothing to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The second kind of function in the church is the testimony of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not by doing but by living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not a kind of work; it is a kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not by laboring; it is by enjoying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It gives people the feeling of resurrection power, the manifestation of resurrection life, and the enjoyment of the Lord as life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a strong testimony that the Lord can make dead persons so living and enable them to feast with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the church there must be such a living testimony, such a function of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There must be not only the service of practical affairs but also the ministry of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Martha s service is necessary, but Lazarus s ministry is even more necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Loving</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Mary represents the third kind of function 12:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>She represents the dear ones who love the Lord very much and who pour out what they hold most precious upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They love the Lord so much that they give the best to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is what Mary did.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>She poured the costly ointment upon the feet of the Lord and wiped His feet with her hair.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In her heart nothing was so dear, so precious, and so costly as the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>She, along with many others like her, loved the Lord with the best she had.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Her estimate of the Lord was that He was more valuable and lovable than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For her, the Lord was the most precious and the most costly One.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Mary s pouring the precious ointment upon the Lord Jesus is a sign of the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although you may realize that Mary anointed the Lord Jesus with the best ointment, perhaps you have not seen that this is a sign of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The main characteristic of the church life is anointing the Lord with our best love.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The main expression, aspect, and characteristic of the church life is that we pour out our ointment upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The church here is likened to a house that is filled with the preciousness, the sweetness, and the pleasantness of the aroma of the ointment poured out upon the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This ought to be the main expression of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When you come into a local church, the first thing that you should smell is the loving ointment poured out upon the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is not simply that Mary loved the Lord, but that she poured out her best upon the Lord, and this becomes a sign of the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the proper church life we all must love the Lord to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, we have three kinds of functions: serving, testifying, and loving.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have the service, the testimony, and the love poured out upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>These three items must be found in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Whenever people come to us, they must realize that among us are the service for the Lord, the testimony of the Lord, and the love poured out upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>These three items are a must.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must have the service, serving all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even more, we must have the testimony, testifying that the Lord is the resurrection life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is no need for us to labor in this aspect of the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We simply need resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>After we have been resurrected with Him, it is unnecessary for us to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We simply sit with Him, go along with Him, and enjoy the feast with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the real, living testimony that the church must have, and this is the very expression of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Moreover, we must also have the absolute love shown to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When people come into our midst, they should say, Oh, these people love the Lord at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They will pay any price in loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In their hearts nothing is so costly, so valuable, so lovable, and so precious as the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We must give people this kind of impression.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We all must be a triangular member of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We must have three corners.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In the past I heard some sisters say to me, Brother, I am not a Martha.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>By the Lord s mercy, I am just a little Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Once a brother who was very living said to me, Brother, in the church some are Marthas and only a very few are a Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>By the Lord s mercy, I am just a Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I just sit here testifying of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I doubt that he was a real Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We all must be Martha, Lazarus, and Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When someone asks you your name, you should reply, My name is Martha-Lazarus-Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is the proper name for us all to have.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Again I say that in the church life there must be at least three items: the diligent service for the Lord, the living testimony of the resurrection life of the Lord, and the absolute love poured out upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we are truly practicing the church life, we must have the service, the testimony, and the love toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We all must be Martha, Lazarus, and Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Such a church is the result and issue of the Lord being life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Chapter twelve is the issue of chapter eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This kind of service, testimony, and love comes out of the Lord being resurrection life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>With these functions, there is the genuine church life.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In the real church life, the service to the Lord is rendered, the testimony of the Lord is seen, and the love toward the Lord is poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Here we can enjoy the Lord with other saints, and the Lord Himself can dwell, rest, and feast in satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is the real expression of the Body of the Lord, which is a vessel to contain the Lord and to express Him.</S>
