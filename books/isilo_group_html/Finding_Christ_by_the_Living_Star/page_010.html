When he was young, he received the greatest help from a sister by the name of Miss M. E. Barber. She was so devoted to the Lord. Brother Nee told me several times, "When I went to see Miss Barber, many times while I was waiting in her living room, I had the sense that I was in the presence of the Lord." What is this? This is the star of the church. Perhaps when you come to such a person, he could not say anything, he could not answer your question. He may say, "I am not clear." But though he says he is not clear, you have the sense that you are under the shining. It is not a matter of teaching or instruction. His word may not be clear, but he himself is transparent, and when you are in his presence, you have the sense not only that he is transparent, but that you are made clear.</P><P>Let me give you another example. Suppose you come to a brother seeking counsel and advice regarding the matter of marriage. This brother may give you a number of points concerning conditions, requirements, considerations, and instructions. But the more he speaks, the more you sense that though he has much knowledge, he is opaque. The more he speaks, the more you are in darkness. Another brother, however, may answer that he simply does not know the answer, but while he is speaking, you sense that he is crystal clear. No word can express it, but while you are with him, you begin to be clear, and you know what to do about your marriage. Though this brother tells you nothing, you are enlightened. What is this? This is the presence of the morning star in this brother, making him also a shining star.</P><P>I hope that we all could be such stars. Though we know little of the teachings, though we cannot give people so many instructions, yet when they come to us, they will be enlightened. There is no need to argue with others: be sure that when you argue, you will keep people away. The enlightening does not depend on how much you can say or reason, but upon what you are. If you are a shining star, who can escape your shining? This is entirely beyond human expression and explanation. It is absolutely a matter of the presence of the Lord. If we take heed to the sure Word, we will have the star rising within us; then if we are faithful simply to follow the inner, rising star, we will be fully in the Spirit and eventually we will be the stars in the local church, not in an objective way, but in a very subjective way. Praise the Lord that by His grace we all can be the stars.</P><P>Matthew 13:43 tells us, "Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father." Today, during the time of the night, we need to function as the star; but in the coming age of the kingdom those who shine now as the stars will shine forth as the sun. Now we are the shining stars, but in that day we will be as the sun.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Finding Christ by the Living Star &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
