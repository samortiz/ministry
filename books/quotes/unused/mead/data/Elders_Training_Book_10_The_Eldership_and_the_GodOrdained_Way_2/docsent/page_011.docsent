   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We can see the difference in capacity with Barnabas and Paul in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Barnabas was used by the Lord to bring Saul, who became Paul, into the ministry Acts 9:26-27; 11:22-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Furthermore, in Acts 13 Barnabas's name was mentioned first when the list of prophets and teachers in Antioch was recorded and when the Spirit set Barnabas and Saul apart for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Shortly after they went out, the matter of capacity arose.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the beginning of the journey, Barnabas was always mentioned first vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2, 7 ; then Paul's name began to be mentioned first vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>9, 13, 16, 46, 50 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul's name was mentioned first because his capacity to meet the need at that time was greater than Barnabas's, and he eventually became the leading speaker 14:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul began to take the lead on their journey because he had a greater capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Barnabas did not have the capacity that Paul had.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Later, Paul wrote fourteen Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Who could speak as much, as deeply, or as high as Paul spoke?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Of all the writers of the New Testament, Paul was the only one to use the term the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The other writers did not use this term or the term economy because they did not have as great a capacity as Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Paul and Barnabas returned from their trip to Antioch, a big problem arose concerning circumcision, and the church in Antioch sent them to Jerusalem to fellowship so that the problem could be solved Acts 15:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After the problem of circumcision was solved and they returned from Jerusalem to Antioch, they wanted to make another journey v. 36 . At this juncture Barnabas wanted to bring his cousin, John Mark v. 37; Col 4:10 , on the journey.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But Paul would not agree to bring Mark along, because Mark had left Barnabas and Paul in a negative way on their first ministry journey Acts 13:13 and note 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Barnabas's desire that Mark go with them was simply according to his own feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a result, Barnabas and Paul separated from each other Acts 15:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From that point on, even though Barnabas might have gone out to visit the churches, his ministry was finished as far as the holy record in Acts is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to my understanding, the problem between Paul and Barnabas consisted mainly of two points.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First, Barnabas might have had some hidden unhappiness within him, because he took the lead at the beginning and later Paul began to take the lead since Barnabas had a smaller capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was not an easy matter to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If Barnabas had been happy about this development, that would have been a great mercy to Barnabas.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Second, according to the record in Acts 15, Barnabas did not keep a proper principle in taking John Mark with him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Apparently, he did this only because of his own personal feeling concerning his cousin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This violated the spiritual principle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Barnabas should have submitted to Paul's way of not taking John Mark in order to allow Mark to learn the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead of submitting to Paul, Barnabas took his own way, and this resulted in a separation between him and Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul had a greater capacity than Barnabas, and because of this he eventually was the one to take the lead in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For more than twenty-five years in this country, I never told people that I was an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in these past few years, some brothers began to talk considerably about apostles and have said that there are not one, but many apostles among us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a shame!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In a meeting of the church in Anaheim on August 28, 1988, one of the sixteen points concerning the standing of the church in Anaheim, a point presented by a certain brother, was that there are many apostles among us today, not just one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He said that he would give a list of these apostles to any of the saints who were interested.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One brother asked for and received such a list from that brother.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The list included seven names, with a question mark beside one of the names, and it did not include the name of the one who gave the list.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Shortly after I received news concerning this list, I went to Taipei, and I gave a message there concerning the three different kinds of apostles see A Timely Trumpeting and the Present Need, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>25-29, published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The seven brothers on that list were all under my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to the truth concerning the kinds of apostles, this would make them apostles like Timothy, Titus, and Silas, who were produced by the Lord's directly appointed apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After this message was published, another word came out saying that there are no apostles today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is similar to what John Nelson Darby taught.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Later, still another word came out saying that there are only twelve apostles the eleven, who were selected by the Lord Jesus, and Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It was said that the selection of Matthias by lot in Acts 1 was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But according to the Bible, when Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost Acts 2:14 , he stood up with the eleven, which included Matthias.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This kind of speaking is based on whatever would be a benefit to the speaker and does not have the standard of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a basic problem.</S>
