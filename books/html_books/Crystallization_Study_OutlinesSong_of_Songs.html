	<li>It could be only by the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection shown in the leaping of the gazelle upon the mountains and the skipping of the young hart upon the hills, not by her natural life.</li>
	<li>This is to &quot;deny&quot; herself as the Lord charges in Matthew 16:24.</li>
	<li>This is also to be conformed to the death of Christ by the power of His resurrection (Phil. 3:10).</li>

<h1 class="title">Becoming the Sanctuary of God</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S.S. 6:4a</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Through her living in Christ&rsquo;s ascension as the new creation in resurrection, the lover of Christ becomes mature in the riches of the life of Christ so that she becomes not only a garden to Christ but also the sanctuary of God, signified by Tirzah, and its safeguard, signified by Jerusalem.</li>
<li>To become a garden to Christ is to be flourishing in the element of Christ&rsquo;s life with its unsearchable riches; to become the sanctuary of God is to be built up (related to the building of the Body of Christ) in the growth with the life of Christ with its unsearchable riches (Eph. 4:15-16):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The sanctuary of God is divided by the veil into two sections: the outer Holy Place and the inner Holy of Holies.</li>
	<li>Although the sanctuary of God is in the heavens, it is divided into two sections by the veil, which signifies our flesh (Heb. 10:19-20).</li>
	<li>With Christ, the veil in the sanctuary of God was split (Matt. 27:51), but with the believers it still remains for the purpose of God&rsquo;s dealing with them.</li>
	<li>The apostle Paul became mature in the life of Christ, living in the ascension of Christ, yet God still let him have a thorn in his flesh through a messenger of Satan to keep him from being exceedingly lifted up (2 Cor. 12:7).</li>
	<li>In God&rsquo;s economy God firstly regenerates us in our spirit with His resurrection life (1 Pet. 1:3) and secondly renews us, transforms us, and conforms us in our soul through His resurrection life to the image of His firstborn Son, Christ as the first God-man (Titus 3:5; Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29), but leaves our body to be redeemed progressively through our whole Christian life (2 Cor. 4:16; Rom. 8:11, 13) and ultimately transfigured to be conformed to the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory at His coming back (Phil. 3:21).</li>
	<li>Hence, there is still the need of the Lord&rsquo;s ultimate calling of us to live within the veil through a stronger experience of the cross in dealing with our flesh after our experience of His resurrection as the new creation of God.</li>
	<li>After the lover of Christ pursued Him for satisfaction and attained it in the first section of the book, the Lord firstly called her to be delivered from her self by experiencing His cross when she was secluded by introspection; then the Lord called her further to live in His ascension as the new creation of God in resurrection; now ultimately the Lord calls her to live within the veil in the Holy of Holies, God Himself, to enjoy the consummated God embodied in Christ.</li>
	<li>It is here that all the seekers of Christ who live in the Holy of Holies, the consummated Triune God, within the veil, enjoy the hidden Christ in His hidden life supply (signified by the manna in the golden pot), the resurrection life (signified by the budding rod), and the inner law of life (signified by the tablets of the covenant), hidden in the ark within the Holy of Holies (Heb. 9:4), to the fullest extent.</li>

<h1 class="title">Becoming the Heavenly Bodies</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S.S. 6:10a</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Through her living in the ascension of Christ and further living within the veil, experiencing the cross of Christ more strongly, the lover of Christ becomes the heavenly bodies:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The overcoming believers can be luminaries as the moon reflecting the light of the sun in the church age (Phil. 2:15).</li>
	<li>The overcoming believers will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom age (Matt. 13:43; Dan. 12:3).</li>
	<li>The people of God who produce the overcomers (the man-child) are clothed with the sun and have the moon underneath their feet (Rev. 12:1, 5).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The lover of Christ becoming the moon and the sun indicates that she has become not only wholly spiritual but also absolutely heavenly and signifies that she has become an overcomer:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Overcoming the attraction of the world by being captivated by Christ in the first stage of this book.</li>
	<li>Overcoming the self which secluded her from the presence of Christ by becoming one with the cross of Christ in the second stage of this book.</li>
	<li>Overcoming the old creation by living in the ascension of Christ in resurrection after her self was dealt with by the cross in the third stage of this book.</li>
	<li>Overcoming the flesh, the natural man, the old man, by living within the veil.</li>

<h1 class="title">Becoming a Terrible Army and the Shulammite</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S.S. 6:4b, 10b, 13</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Becoming a terrible army&mdash;6:4b, 10b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Since the overcoming believers have become the sanctuary of God and the heavenly bodies, they also become a terrible army:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>An army fights the battle for God&rsquo;s kingdom in the degradation of God&rsquo;s people to be the overcomers answering the Lord&rsquo;s call&mdash;Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21.</li>
		<li>A terrible army signifies that these overcomers of the Lord terrify God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan, and become terrible in the eyes of God&rsquo;s people.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&quot;With banners&quot; indicates that the overcomers are ready all the time to fight, and it is also a sign of victory.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Becoming the Shulammite&mdash;6:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Shulammite</em> is the feminine form of <em>Solomon,</em> indicating that now the overcomers have become the same as Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Shulammite was a country girl.</li>
		<li>Now, as a counterpart of Solomon, she has become the same as Solomon in life, in nature, in expression, and in function for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>This signifies that:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The overcomers were sinners.</li>
		<li>Now, in the maturity of Christ&rsquo;s life, they have become the same as Christ in life, in nature, in expression, and in function for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</li>
