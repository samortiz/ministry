   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What can be crueler than Sheol?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A person may be the most lovable one, the most adorable one, or the most precious one, but when Sheol comes to claim a sinner, it will not care if such a one is lovable or adorable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No tears, sorrow, or pleading can move its heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It does not know mercy and compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It has no sympathy or feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is cruel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"Since I have consecrated myself to You as a chaste virgin, if You see anything in me that stirs up Your jealousy, You will surely deal with it at all cost until You completely prevail.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There may be loving friends, close relatives, or dear lovers begging, pleading, and weeping, but You do not care for any of these things; You only care for Your own feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But this is the only way that I will be preserved."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"The coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jehovah is a fire Heb 12:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His love and jealousy are also like fire which burns up everything that can be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Everything that is not eternal, that can pass away, that is of the world, and that is of man will be burned away.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 7 says, "Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Many waters" signify trials that believers go through.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Floods" signify persecutions from the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His love and the fire of His love will not be quenched by trials.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His love and the fire of His love cannot be drowned by persecutions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If He loves us, no trial or persecution can do anything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This love cannot be bought with money.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, it is irreplaceable.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot replace this love with the tongues of men and angels.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We cannot replace this love with the gift of prophecy, the knowledge of mysteries, all knowledge, or all faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even if we doled out all our possessions to feed others and delivered up our body so that we might boast, we would still be despised.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These things are merely part of the treasures of a man's house.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Trying to exchange love for these things will result in being despised.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since this is the case, we will not earn His love with more work, busy times, or toiling services.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can only offer ourselves to Him so that we will become the object of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 8 says, "We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A person who lives in the Lord's love cannot forget that there are others who should have the Lord's love also.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before she goes away to see the Lord, she remembers those who are less mature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She speaks of her little sister, who has life, but whose faith and love have not grown to the point where she can develop an affection for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The maiden's union with the Lord is already complete.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, she can freely express all of her feelings before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"What shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The little sister does not yet know what a life of love is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But when the eternal Lover leads her into a fellowship of love through the Holy Spirit, what will we do with her?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As far as her life is concerned, she is a little sister.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As far as her life of love is concerned, her two breasts have not developed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are concerned for this group of people and are burdened to care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord will not be satisfied with their condition.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A marriage proposal is indispensable in a believer's life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although every believer has full liberty to accept or reject, the Lord's demand for love is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How should we help this little sister of ours?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The maiden brings up those whom she has always cared for and who are younger than she is; she brings them up before the Lord to discuss them with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because she is living so much in the Lord's will, she can say, "We have..."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She knows that her concern is the Lord's concern.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, she says, "We."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>She knows that what she wants is also what the Lord wants.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, she says, "We."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The union is complete; there is no more separation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, prayers are no longer requests, but a speaking forth of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 9 says, "If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"If she be a wall."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If there is anything that is of God, which causes her to build a separation between herself and that which is not of God, like a wall, then "we will build upon her a palace of silver."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We will build upon her everything that is high and noble that comes from redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If she has established a life of separation through the Holy Spirit, we will build upon her the fruit of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If she is a door, others will enter into God's knowledge through her.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"We will inclose her with boards of cedar."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We will add Christ's heavenly humanity to her.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Wood signifies humanity, whereas cedar is tall.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence cedar wood signifies Christ's heavenly humanity, His glorified humanity, and His heavenly human life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>She no longer does the things that she wants to do; she does them together with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although the words are out of her mouth, they represent the Lord's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verse 10 says, "I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favor."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>"I am a wall."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I am already a separated person; the Lord has separated me from everything unclean, common, and ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>"My breasts like towers."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>My faith and love are based on my separation from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord has established me, and my two breasts are no longer undeveloped; they are like towers.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I have come to the point where I am a person who has obtained peace in His eyes "found favor" can be translated "found peace" .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This means that I can be at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, a life of peace is based on a life of separation, which is based on the development of faith and love.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>She gives a short testimony and shows that there is no thought of self-contentment.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>She can say that she is a wall, and she can say that her two breasts are towers, but in the Lord's eyes, she considers herself as one who has obtained peace.</S>
