O. Box 84, Hankow, January 1938)</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS CONCERNING THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Hse Jung-jieh, Yunnan Province</h2><p>Brother X:</p><p>I left Tsinan the day you came to Hankow. I did not receive this news until I arrived in Hong Kong. I had to go to Canton for my passport, and after I returned from Canton to Hong Kong, I was sick for over ten days. This is the reason I did not write to you to relate everything to you sooner. I apologize and regret this very much! After we left Hong Kong, we had a peaceful journey and did not suffer any loss at Haiphong. Thank the Lord! My whole family, together with Sister Chen Hwei-sien and Brother Ma Mu, waited for our visas for five or six days in Ho-Kou. My family and Sister Chen arrived safely in K'un-ming on November 4. The Chou brothers are British subjects and were able to arrive a few days earlier. Brother Ma is still in Ho-Kou. A letter of certification has been sent, and perhaps he will be in K'un-ming by the ninth. Brother Hu Yi-min is still here. He does not want to remain here any longer; he will return home soon. My family wants to go with Brother Hu. I hope that I will see you so that I can be instructed concerning my future and the way I should carry out the work. I wonder when you will come? I hope very much that you will inform me soon.</p><p>I came to Yunnan this time because I need the help from Brother Hu. Moreover, I see clearly that my family should reside at Yeh-Ji where Brother Hu's family is. Brother Hu and I can then go ahead into Sikang and work there. Presently, I think we should establish a base at Yeh-Ji and move out from there. Later, if brothers and sisters come to work at Sikang or Tibet, they will find it less unpleasant, and they can work with peace of heart. Therefore, I shall go into Sikang from Yunnan. Going from Szechuan would mean greater hardship. Going from Ch'eng-tu to Ba-Tang would take more than a month. The trip would be inconvenient, and the expense would be more than what is required to go from Yunnan. Furthermore, both the people and the geography of Sikang are unfamiliar to me. Verbal communication will be difficult, and it will take a while to actually enter in. Therefore, I have to travel with Brother Hu so that I can learn Tibetan before I labor in Sikang. It has been very clear to me that the Lord has given me a great burden to work in Sikang and Tibet. But I am very weak. I feel incapable of bearing so great a burden and am not worthy of such a task. But the Lord has been dealing with me for a year and caused me to count the cost. I am truly a slow obeyer. May the Lord enable me to be more obedient to Him. Now I only know that as He calls, I will go. I do not know anything else and continue to look unto Him. If you come to Yunnan, Brother Hu Yi-min has requested that you purchase and bring two irons (for ironing clothes).</p><p>Everything is fine here, even though the catastrophe inflicted upon the nation has sent many people here. The cost of living has risen three or fourfold, and it is not easy to rent a dwelling. The Lord's more abundant grace is indeed needed so that He may receive the glory. The brothers and sisters and Brother Weigh's whole household are fine. Please do not worry. Please greet Sister Lee and Sister Chang. I shall stop my pen here. Peace be to you.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Jung-jieh<br />November 7, K'un-ming</p><h2 class="head2">Recent Status of the Work in K'un-ming,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><p>Brother X:</p><p>Both of your letters have been received, and I have been well informed of everything. Brother Hsu (with family), Brother Hu, and Brother Ma (who went there for business&mdash;Editor) departed on the fourteenth of this month for their first trip to Yeh-Ji. Yesterday I received their letter from Shakwang (the last bus stop), reporting that they had been safely led by the Lord all the way. Soon they should go on to Yeh-Ji. The Lord has started the good work Himself, and people have been saved into the Lord's name in the church here. Ever since I came to Yunnan, I have separated my personal life and work from the work of the local church. Every Lord's Day afternoon I preach the gospel at the Women's and Children's Hospital. The local church preaches the gospel every Wednesday evening. The director of the hospital has allowed us to use his facility for gospel preaching. Now the assembly has rented an appropriate place for the meetings, involving a monthly rent of twenty-five dollars and a security deposit of one hundred dollars. Every Thursday evening the church here conducts a Bible study meeting on the subject, "Christ and Him Crucified," and I bear much of the responsibility. In order to edify and strengthen the brothers and sisters, I plan to hold a special Bible study meeting soon. Thank the Lord for drawing a group of brothers, sisters, and sinners to hear His gospel. There were about fifty to sixty people in the Bible study and gospel meetings. Brother and Sister X have made much progress, fervently loving the Lord. The elder Brother Chou's wife has accepted Hueichen Hospital's invitation to be a resident physician there. The younger Brother Chou has not yet decided what he will do. The elder Brother Chou is doing some gospel work here for the time being; his wife is especially good in working with individuals. Brother and Sister Lin are also making progress in the grace of the Lord.</p><p>According to my latest observation, there should be a base for the work in K'un-ming. There is the real need for more workers to pioneer the work in the surrounding regions. I plan to go to the towns and villages along the railroad and highway in order to labor there next spring. Thank the Lord, I have met a young man, Mr. Chou Bao-jian, here. He studied two years at X school, and he is very much one with us. He is a native and has a gift for gospel preaching. He is very clear concerning his calling. From my many conversations with him, I know that he is a good brother. Mong-Tze is his hometown, and now he lives in K'un-ming. He often comes to the meetings. May the Lord lay hold of him. I have asked Brother Chen Ho-seng to bring you this letter. Brother Chen works with the radio in the airline company. He is a good brother and is very much acquainted with Mr. Wang Ming-dao. I very much hope that you and Sister Lee can come here to discuss how we should develop the work in the inland. Please cable me when you can come. Without further words, I greet you reverently.</p><p>Your brother,<br />K. H.
