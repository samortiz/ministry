I leave for K'un-ming tomorrow morning. I still do not have a companion, but the Lord's grace is sufficient for me. I see His powerful leading and support in all aspects. I really thank and praise Him! May the Lord's love be with you always!</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Hsi-wen<br />January 15, in Kuei-yang</p><h2 class="head2">From K'un-ming to Yeh-Ji</h2><p>Dear Brother Chih-I in the Lord:</p><p>Last night I received your two airmail letters dated November 15 and December 6. I read them through carefully and was very comforted! Brother Hu, Brother Ma, and I left K'un-ming on November 14 for Yeh-Ji Village in Wei-Si County (Brother Hu's home). On the trip from K'un-ming to Hsia-Guan in Da-Li, we took a three-hour bus ride. In Hsia-Guan we hired pack mules, so we were delayed for four or five days. In Hsia-Guan there is a China Inland Mission chapel, and we preached the gospel there a few times. It took us fourteen or fifteen days to get to Wei-Si from Hsia- Guan and another four days to get from Wei-Si to Yeh-Ji. We arrived in Yeh-Ji Village on December 7. God's grace enabled us to travel safely even though the roads were treacherous. Thank and praise the Lord! This area is in the region of tribal aborigines, so everything is inconvenient. There are no houses for rent. (Fortunately, Brother Hu has a house here.) We must plant our own vegetables to get something to eat. Sometimes an aborigine will bring some eggs or meat on his back to sell. Most of the time it is done by bartering. There is a lack of salt and tea here. The aborigines need them. Sometimes they will not take paper money but insist on silver. It is difficult for us evangelists, who do not have a settled home, to live in a place like this. This is nothing really, but a greater problem lies before us in that my wife will soon have a baby. I believe that God will grace us and bring us through! There is an X denominational church here, which is where Brother Hu used to work. When Brother Ma and I arrived, the X church was not very happy. They were especially jealous of Brother Ma because they thought that he was helping Brother Hu financially and because he also came out of the X denomination. For this reason, one of the X has repeatedly come to speak with Brother Ma to tell him that we should go somewhere else to preach the gospel. Thank the Lord, there is still the opportunity to preach the gospel to them. We must not give up any opportunity to preach the gospel. I am now learning Tibetan. Brother Hu has some family matters which are not settled, so we have not started on our journey. After my wife has her baby (sometime in January 1938), Brother Hu, Brother Ma, and I will go to Tibet. I have decided to go to Ba-Tang to take a look. If the Lord works and allows me to go, I will move my whole family to Ba-Tang and move from there to the outlying areas. If the Lord gives grace again, I will move into Tibet! This is my recent leading. The future is in the Lord's hands, so I can only look to Him!</p><p>I received the money order for X dollars in your airmail letter. Please do not worry about it. However, I must send this money order to K'un-ming before it can be cashed. The post office here can do everything but cash money orders. For this reason, it is not called a post office here but a postal agent. We can receive registered letters, etc., but we must go to the county seat of Wei-Si to receive money. It takes us three weeks to get from here to K'un-ming. Regular letters take two months to get here, and airmail letters take one month. Was Brother Luan's and Sister Miao's trip to Hong Kong and Szechuan interrupted? Did they come to Yunnan also? What has been their most recent move? I think of them often! Where is Brother Nee now? Please tell me. If he is still in Hankow, please greet him for me. I really hope that another inland co-worker can come to this remote region to work. The requirements for a successful co-worker in a remote region are faithfulness, courage, indifference to suffering, and perseverance through hundreds of hardships. God must give the grace to some to get through! If the Lord leads you, it would be wonderful for you to come to Sikang. It takes thirty-seven days to get to Ba-Tang from Ch'eng-tu, Szechuan. If you come from Chungking to K'un-ming and then go on to Sikang, it will take two months. However, the road through Yunnan is less steep. It would not be too much for you to come by way of Ch'eng-tu. May the Lord lead you!</p><p>We have not seen The Open Door and The Shanghai Local Newsletter of last month. We feel frustrated, yet because of the blocking off of communication, there is nothing we can do about it. Greetings to Brother Ju Yao-ju and to all the brothers and sisters in Hankow. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Jung-jieh<br />January 1</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 37</div><br></body></html>
