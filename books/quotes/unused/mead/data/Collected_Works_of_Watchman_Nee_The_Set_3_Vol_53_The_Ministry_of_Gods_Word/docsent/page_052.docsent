   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Today when we minister the word to men, we should not depend on our memory.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should not think that we are free to speak the same things again just because our past experiences and past speakings are still intact in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even though it worked for us the first time, it will not work for us this time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may speak the same thing again, but afterward, we feel that something is wrong, that what we said was not the right thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We feel that we are, in fact, quite far from the thing that we were speaking about; we do not touch that thing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Revelation is distinctly different from teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Man always has a wrong concept that he wants to be a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must see that doctrine and teaching are useless by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should never think that the ability to speak is all that matters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may be able to speak, and others may appreciate our speaking, but we can be our own judge; within we know that something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should bear in mind that many people receive help ignorantly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not congratulate ourselves just because others say that they have received help from us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some may say that they have received help, but in actuality they have not received anything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We know within whether our speaking was on the mark or off the mark, old or new, dead or living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we are speaking, if the Lord's revelation is with us and God's mercy is upon us, we will touch reality; there will not be a feeling of estrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will be in touch, and the things we say will be living to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as we have the assurance that the things in us are living, we are all right.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must forever remember that we need a fresh revelation from God every time we fulfill the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is what it means to have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First Corinthians 14 covers the subject of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the prophets can prophesy and speak.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But "if something is revealed to another sitting by, the first should be silent" v. 30 . Suppose there are some prophets, and one of them has a word to say to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>While he is speaking, another also receives a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He may say, "Brother, let me speak."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The one who is currently speaking should let him speak, because the one who has received the revelation is the freshest; he has the most life and power.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why he should be allowed to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although all are prophets, the one who has received the latest revelation is the living one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is possible that on this particular day, no one else has that word; only this brother knows this word because he has the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the rest should allow the one with revelation to stand up to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our service in the ministry of the word is based on the revelations we continually receive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not have continual revelations, we cannot serve properly as a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should never presume that a message that once contained God's speaking will always contain His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should never presume that a message that once brought about repentance will always bring about repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The same message delivered in the same manner does not guarantee the same result.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only the same anointing will produce the same result.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only the same revelation will produce the same light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The same word may not produce the same light.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How easy it is for a spiritual thing to become dead in us!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It can easily become as dead as stagnant water in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The ability to deliver the same message that was delivered three years ago does not mean that we have the same light that we had three years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today we need to have the same revelation we had three years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only then can we preach the same message we preached three years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ministry of the word does not depend on the words we have spoken in the past, but on the new revelation we have acquired in the present.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The biggest problem with the church today is that many people think that they have many messages to give.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They think that if they repeat the same message again and again, they will have the same result again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But this is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is a fundamental error to pay attention to doctrines rather than revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even if a person spoke Paul's or John's very own messages, it would not work, to say nothing of repeating his own message.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only the same revelation will produce the same result; the same words will not produce the same result.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, the ministry of God's word is not a matter of word but of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not serve on the basis of word but on the basis of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must remember that the ministry of God's word is the ministry of God's revealed word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must differentiate between doctrine and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What God said yesterday and the day before is doctrine; what He says today is revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What we remember is doctrine; what we see is revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We know that the ministry of the prophets involves things for today and the future; it does not involve things of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The ministry of the prophets unveils God's desire today and in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is why the Bible calls such men seers or prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A prophet is a seer; he is one who sees.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the Old Testament many prophets spoke prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But some prophets did not really speak prophetically; rather, they proclaimed God's will for men in their times.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When Nathan went to David, he foretold a little concerning the latter's wife and children.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But Nathan primarily expressed God's thought; he was expressing God's heart concerning certain things that were happening then cf.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>2 Sam 12:7-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the Old Testament the highest expression of the ministry of God's word was the prophesying and preaching of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If anyone wants to be a minister of God's word, if he wants to have the highest degree of ministry, he has to know what God wants today and what He wants for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He must have God's present-day revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He cannot remain in the old words or even words of the recent past.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Many people can only hold on to what they saw in past years or past days.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They do not have the present-day revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>These ones cannot be ministers of the word.</S>
