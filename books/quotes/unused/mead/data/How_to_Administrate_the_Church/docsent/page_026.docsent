   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BUILDING MATERIALS OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1 Corinthians 3:9 Paul uses two illustrations to speak of the church: one is God s cultivated land, and the other is God s building, that is, the dwelling place built by God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul says that we are God s fellow workers, working together with God to build the church, God s dwelling on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 10 he says, As a wise master builder I have laid a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The foundation spoken of here is the same as the rock in Matthew 16; the foundation that has been laid is the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The foundation that was laid by Paul is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the same time, he also charged each man to take heed how he builds upon the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indicates that the building work is very particular; some build upon the foundation with gold, silver, and precious stones, and others build with wood, grass, and stubble vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is spoken of in Matthew 16 is connected with 1 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The stone in Matthew 16 is part of the precious stones in 1 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The foundation is Christ, but the only materials that can be used to build upon it are gold, silver, and precious stones, not wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Wood, Grass, and Stubble</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should understand the words wood, grass, and stubble figuratively because they are figures conveying certain meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Wood, grass, and stubble are all botanical, which implies naturalness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Wood, grass, and stubble all grow naturally, and they are easily burned with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once they are burned, they are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When wood is burned, it is gone; when grass is burned, it is gone; when stubble is burned, it is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that wood, grass, and stubble are natural.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the figures of the Old Testament, wood, grass, and stubble denote the nature of man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, the Ark in the tabernacle was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold Exo 25:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Gold signifies divinity, and wood signifies humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But acacia wood is a high-quality wood, signifying the humanity of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First Peter 1:24, Isaiah 40:6-7, and 51:12 indicate that all flesh is like grass.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All flesh is wood, grass, and stubble because they grow up from the ground, from clay, and are of the earth, the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, these three items denote nothing less than human nature, the flesh, and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All of these things are natural and cannot withstand burning or trial.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we build the church, serve the church, and work in the church with these things, then we are building the church with humanity, the flesh, and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we use wood, grass, and stubble as our materials, they will not remain when they go through the test of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Bible, gold, silver, and precious stones are all positive things; these three items are not natural.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Both gold and silver must pass through the refining of fire, and precious stones are produced through pressure under the earth and through the refining of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, these three things share a common trait, that is, they are not in their natural, original form.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Wood, grass, and stubble are all in their original form; they are natural.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, gold, silver, and precious stones have passed through the refining of fire and pressure in the ground, so they are not in their original forms; they have been transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This can be compared to Simon s name being changed to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is like clay being changed into a stone, and a stone being changed into a precious stone through the refining of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moreover, in the Bible, gold signifies divinity, and silver signifies redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Old Testament speaks of the expiation silver Exo 30:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, figuratively speaking, silver refers to redemption, and redemption refers to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The cross is not only for our redemption but also for the termination of the old creation; the cross is not only for the taking away of sins but also for the taking away of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Revelation 4:3 the One on the throne is like a precious stone in appearance; therefore, precious stones signify God s glory, God s appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we serve and build the church, we cause people to receive God s life and God s nature; this is gold.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We also can lead them to know Christ s redemption and the cross and to experience the cross in terminating their sins and the old creation; this is silver.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a result of the operation of these two aspects in them, they will be like God in appearance; this is the precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, gold signifies God s nature, silver signifies the redemption of the cross, and precious stones signify the glorious image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How can we work in the church and build up the church with gold, silver, and precious stones?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to dispense God s life into others so that they may have God s life and nature; this is gold.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then we need to lead them to experience the cross so that their sins and the old creation can be terminated; this is silver.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After they experience these two points, they will live out God s image; this is the precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we continually serve and work in this way in the church, we will be doing God s work, and we will be building the church of God with gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Otherwise, we will be doing something natural, something of the flesh, and something of the world, which are wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should serve and build the church with gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should dispense God s life into others and lead them to experience the cross so that they may live out the glorious image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Apart from these three things, everything is natural, of the flesh, and of the world, which are wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Peter in Matthew 16 becomes a precious stone, who is shining, bright, and full of the glory in 2 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we experience Matthew 16 by receiving revelation, clay is changed into stone.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Holy Spirit, however, must still do a transforming work in us until we are transformed into the same image from glory to glory; then we will be precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As God s fellow workers, we are building the church of God on the unique foundation that has been laid Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must take heed how we build upon it by building with gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the administration of the church, all of our methods or techniques will be wood, grass, and stubble if we do not see this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>May God open our eyes to see that the building of the church is not a matter of method or technique but a matter of material.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is not a matter of how we work but a matter of what we use in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We can produce the glorious image of Christ in people only if we use Christ, God s life, and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Holy Spirit inspired the writing of the Scriptures, and this inspiration is great and wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Bible does not put precious stones or silver first, but gold first.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The sequence of gold, silver, and precious stones indicates that in our work and service in the church, we must first enable people to receive God s life and be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then we need to lead them to experience and know the cross of Christ so that precious stones will be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In other words, this sequence involves dispensing God s life into others so that they may have the gold of God s life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then we should lead them to know the cross of Christ and show them that all the problems have been dealt with through the redemption of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Sin, the old man, and the world have been terminated by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The more a person has this kind of experience, the more he will have the element of precious stone in him, and the more he will have the glorious image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Peter did not forget the word the Lord spoke in Matthew 16.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In 1 Peter 2:5 he says, You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This shows that he understood the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In Romans 9, Paul likens man to a lump of clay, and in 1 Corinthians 3, he likens the believers to precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Verses 14 and 15 say that all work involving wood, grass, and stubble will be consumed, and only the building that comes from gold, silver, and precious stones will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Then verse 16 continues, Do you not know that you are the temple of God?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This does not refer to an individual but to a corporate entity, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Hence, these precious stones are the pieces of stone in the temple, and these stones are undoubtedly those who have received Christ and who have been transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In Romans 9 Paul says that the natural man is a lump of clay, and in 1 Corinthians 3 he speaks of the believers, who once were natural, as precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Did Paul forget his word in Romans 9 when he wrote 1 Corinthians 3?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Paul did not forget, and neither did Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is the reason Peter said that the believers are living stones, who are being built up as a spiritual house, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Can we build the church with doctrines or methods?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>No, we must build the church with Christ and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We need to lead people to receive God s life and to live according to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This will issue not only in gold and silver but also in the image of God the glorious, precious stones.</S>
