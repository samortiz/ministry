   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 34 the Lord Jesus said, "Do not think that I have come to bring peace on the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The whole earth is under Satan's usurpation 1 John 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because the heavenly King is establishing His kingdom on earth, warfare between these two kingdoms is inevitable.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fighting instigated by the usurping Satan against the heavenly King's called ones is waged even in their own household.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When some are attracted and caught by the heavenly King and decide to follow Him, some in their family may be instigated by Satan to fight against them, even to kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verses 37 through 39 we have the way to follow the heavenly King.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 37 the Lord said, "He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our love for the Lord must be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should love nothing above Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 38 continues, "And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ took the Father's will and was crucified 26:39, 42 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He was baptized, He was counted as crucified, and from that time He bore His cross to do the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He asked His called ones to take their cross and follow after Him, that is, to take the will of God by putting themselves aside.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This demanded that at any cost they first give their love to Him that they might be worthy of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 39 says, "He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To find the soul-life is to allow the soul to have its enjoyment and to escape suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To lose the soul-life is to cause the soul to lose its enjoyment and thereby to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the heavenly King's followers allow their soul to have its enjoyment in this age, they will cause their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If they allow their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in this age for the King's sake, they will enable their soul to have its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age, that is, to share the King's joy in ruling over the earth 25:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 10:40 11:1 we have the matter of the heavenly King's identification with the sent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 40 says, "He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who has sent Me."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The apostles sent by the heavenly King, having been entrusted with His authority v. 1 and peace v. 13 and having been indwelt by the Spirit of the Father v. 20 and identified with the King in His suffering vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>22, 24-25 and death vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>21, 34-39 , were one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, he who received them received Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To participate in such an identification with the heavenly King requires us to love Him above all, at any cost, and to follow Him by taking the narrow way of the cross, as revealed in verses 37 through 39.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not only do the sent ones have the King's authority and peace and the Spirit of the Father, but they are also one with the King and are identified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All this is for the spreading of the King's ministry.</S>
