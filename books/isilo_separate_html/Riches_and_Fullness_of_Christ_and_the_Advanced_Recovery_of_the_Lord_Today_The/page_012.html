The riches of Christ come to us for the producing of the fullness of Christ, which is the Body of Christ. In this message, we shall see how the organic Body of Christ needs to grow. The growth of the organic Body of Christ is the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ.<p>In the New Testament, there are some mysterious points that are easily missed by readers of the Bible. They are points that are difficult to grasp. For example, in the book of Ephesians Paul revealed the thought concerning the fullness of Christ as the Body of Christ, which is the church of Christ. When he spoke of the church, he said that it is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23). This is a very profound term. In chapter four of Ephesians, Paul used another profound word, &#8220;the fullness of Christ&#8217;&#8217; (v. 13). He said that the fullness of Christ is the expression of Christ. This expression is fully a matter of the eternal and divine life of God.<p>In John 10:10 the Lord Jesus said that He came that the sheep may have life and have it more abundantly. Most Christians know that life is for salvation. Christ is our life for the purpose that we would be saved. Of course, there is nothing wrong in this realization. However, this is not enough. When Christ enters into us, not only is He life to us to save us, but He is also making us the church through this saving life.<p>The church is the Body of Christ. It is not an organization, but an organism. It is not a matter of outward things, but a matter of an inward life. The church can be compared to the human body. Outwardly speaking, the human body is composed of all the different organs and members. It may look like an organization. Actually, every part of the human body is a matter of life. Hence, the church is not an organization, but an organism. Look at my ten fingers. Not only is every finger joined to me; each one has an organic relationship with me. All of them have a circulation and a fellowship with the blood of the whole body. The whole body is a living organism that is full of the activities of life. The wooden stand before me is different. It is composed of pieces of wood as an organization; there is no life in them.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
