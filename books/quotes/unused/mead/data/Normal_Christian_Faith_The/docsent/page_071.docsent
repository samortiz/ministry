   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE CRUCIFIXION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF SINNERS WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The highest goal in the salvation of God is the dispensing of His life into man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is God's ultimate desire.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only by partaking of the divine life can we have a divine living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is impossible to have a God-like living with our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The manifestation of our life is nothing but sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this respect God dealt with our sins and iniquities in a way that would maintain His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have seen that the Son of God was judged for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who are in Him have been forgiven of their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE SOURCE OF SIN</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the salvation of God did not stop with the forgiveness of sins; it went deeper to deal with the source of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have said that man's sins are not caused by his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, they originate from the person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The mode of living is merely a natural consequence of the kind of life that is possessed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since man's life is corrupted, his outward behavior cannot help but be evil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, when I knock on the stand before me with my fingers, a certain sound is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You can tell at once that this is a sound produced by wood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If I knock on a piece of metal, it will give a different kind of sound, and you can readily tell the difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The contrast in sound is caused by the difference in constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No matter how I change my manner of knocking, I cannot make a piece of wood sound metallic.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nor can it be done vice versa.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The same is true of the behavior of man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our environment cannot precipitate something that does not exist within us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A slow person is slow under any kind of circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But a quick disposition is readily detected under the slightest stress in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All outward conduct is a direct result of our inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, temptations in the environment are merely catalysts to hasten the exposure of our inner substance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They can never bring forth anything that has not hitherto existed in man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>OUR ENVIRONMENT EXPOSES OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A friend told me once that the human life is programmed by its environment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A good environment will produce fine personalities, and an unhealthy environment is the cause of all vices.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All that one needs to do is control the environment, and proper personalities will automatically follow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I said, "According to what you have proposed, it would mean that salt-water fish have become what they are because of living in the sea, and fresh-water fish are the direct product of the river water.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is surely not true.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The environment can never govern what is not in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The environment only exposes what lies dormant within us!"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Of what does the human life consist?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It consists of all kinds of evil and corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Give it a gentle knock, and everything will fall out into the open.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many moralists say that all we need to do is suppress ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many have tried it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They held themselves tightly by the reins, fearing that their evil nature would break loose once they let go even a little.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This kind of person is most miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Daily they repress their desires.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But we know that they can never succeed for long.</S>
