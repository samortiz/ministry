   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S GOAL BEING WITH THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must be clear about God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's goal is with the flesh because God's life is with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we believe and are saved, we can come to God immediately because we are begotten by Him and share His life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whether or not we will receive glory and reward depends on whether we allow God's life to live within us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 3:23 tells us that all men have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When man sins, he cannot come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is God's glory?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is God Himself, His dwelling and His manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The God of glory dwells in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All men have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a result they cannot dwell with God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Colossians 1:27 says, "Christ in you, the hope of glory."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A sinner cannot come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when we have the Lord inside of us, we have the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ in us is God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hebrews 2:10 says, "For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's goal is to bring many sons into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What do the words "through whom" and "for whom" mean?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All things being through Him means that all things came out of Him, and all things being for Him means that all things belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All things came from God, and all things will return to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The One for whom are all things and through whom are all things is God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is God's goal?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His goal is to bring many sons into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, His goal is first to have many sons and second to bring these many sons into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was fitting for the Author of their salvation to be made perfect through sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This verse is easy to understand, and we need no further explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 11 speaks of the sanctifying One.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Who can sanctify men?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ can.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Who are the sanctified ones?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Christians are.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Both Christ and the church are all of One.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This One is God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ came from God, so does the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church comes from God and receives its life from God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, the church, which is sanctified through Christ and produced through the life of Christ, is from God and of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is why Christ is not ashamed to call the sanctified ones brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ can call us brothers because both Christ and we come from God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's goal is for Christ to call men His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's goal is for Christ to have many brothers and for Him to have many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to see the fullness of His salvation; man's sins are forgiven by His blood, and the old man has been crucified by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, God has put His flesh within man to be man's new life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many people have this life within them, but it has not yet become their life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why they continue to be weak and defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The death of Christ accomplished the aspect of God's work related to the flesh; He has put His life into the flesh so that we can now receive God's life when we eat His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord's blood delivers us from death, while His flesh gives us life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These two things are entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the eyes of God, man should die, but the Lord shed His blood on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As a result man no longer needs to die.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, he is delivered from death through the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But man still does not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Eating the flesh brings life to man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The blood is on the negative side, and the flesh is on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All the works of Christ are ours when we exercise our living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we have a living faith, Christ's life will become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>John 6:47-58 begins with, "He who believes has eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the original language, "eternal life" means a life of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God's life is a life of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who believe will have eternal life, that is, the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The "eternal life" spoken of in the Gospel of John does not refer to the believers' living forever; it refers to the life of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord says that he who believes will have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means that he who believes will have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord also said that if a man eats the bread that comes down out of heaven, he will live forever.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord's flesh is the bread out of heaven, and those who eat His flesh will have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>His flesh is given for the life of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This word is not directed at sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A sinner should die; therefore, his need is deliverance from death.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The world, that is, humankind, is composed of men created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Created men only have the created life; they do not have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord gives created men the bread out of heaven, and those who eat this bread will have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This bread is the Lord's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Hence, we have to pay as much attention to Christ's flesh as we do to His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I hope we will not be as we were before, paying too much attention to the blood while neglecting the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord Himself paid much attention to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He said that His flesh is given to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Jews did not understand this, and they asked, "How can this man give us His flesh to eat?" v. 52 . The Lord said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves" v. 53 . In this verse the Lord spoke of the flesh first and the blood afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hebrews 2:14 says, "Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In this verse, the blood is spoken of before the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But in the original language, the flesh is spoken of before the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God cares very much about the order.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The words in the Bible are not chosen at random.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They show us that God pays a great deal of attention to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Lord said that unless we eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man, we have no life within ourselves John 6:53 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The flesh is related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>A man receives life through eating the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Of course, he cannot receive life unless his sins are first washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If the problem of sin is not settled, no one can have Christ living in him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In verse 53 the Lord spoke of the flesh first in order to show us that we cannot have His life without eating the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He spoke of the blood second in order to show us that we cannot eat the flesh without the remedial redemption of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In verses 51 and 52 only the flesh is spoken of.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Then in verse 53 the flesh is spoken of before the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This shows us that the significance of the flesh is primary, whereas the significance of the blood is secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Why will believers resurrect at the Lord's coming but unbelievers only resurrect at the great white throne?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is because Christians have the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Those who have life will enter into life when the Lord returns.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>As soon as Christians hear the Lord's cry, they will rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Those who have life will enter into God's glory, but those who do not believe will enter into eternal death John 5:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The believers who have died and are buried in the ground will rise up that day and be resurrected into life and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The dead ones in the world will not rise up, because they do not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We have the flesh in us, and we have the blood, and on that day we will rise up to be with our God.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The Lord said that His flesh is true bread.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>How can His flesh be our bread?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>His word cannot be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>When He says that His flesh is our true bread, it means that it is our true bread.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>In John 6 the Lord mentioned the flesh before the blood four times vv.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>53-56 .</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>In the two instances in which the flesh and the blood are not mentioned together, only the flesh is mentioned vv.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>51-52 .</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>These verses show that the flesh is more important than the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>By the blood we are delivered from death, and by eating the flesh we receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Those who have life abide in Him and He in them.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>In this way we become one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>THROUGH A LIVING FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Many people are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>But they do not have any experience of Him, because they do not have a living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>If we receive Him with a living faith, we will see that we are not only in Christ but that Christ is also in us as our power, life, and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>The proper place for a light bulb is on the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>It should be connected to the power plant through the power lines.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>It must be joined to the source of electricity and receive the current of electricity before it will shine.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Only when we are in Christ, will His life, power, light, etc., flow into us.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>While we say that we eat the flesh, we should not say that we eat the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>We cannot eat the blood; we can only drink the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>In verses 51 and 52 the Lord did not speak of drinking at all.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>This shows that His attention was on eating, not on drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Eating the Lord's flesh is eating the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>The flesh represents Him.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>If we eat His flesh, we will live forever; otherwise, we will die.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Christ presents Himself to us in these verses to show us that without receiving Him as life, we cannot satisfy God's demand and cannot reach God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Outwardly speaking, we are living on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>But actually we are like dead persons.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>May the Lord be gracious to us.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>May He open our eyes to see that we have not only the blood, the crucifixion, but also the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>These different aspects of the truth are not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>May the Lord be merciful to us and grant us a clear revelation of these things.</S>
