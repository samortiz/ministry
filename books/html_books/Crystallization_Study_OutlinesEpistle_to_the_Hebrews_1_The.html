<h1 class="title">An Epistle to River Crossers</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 14:13; Exo. 3:18; 9:1, 13;<br />
Heb. 1:1-2a; 11:8-16; 6:19; 13:13</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Epistle to the Hebrews is an epistle to river crossers:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The root of the word <em>Hebrew</em> means &ldquo;to pass over&rdquo;&mdash;Gen. 14:13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Specifically, it can mean &ldquo;to pass over a river,&rdquo; that is, to pass over from one side of the river to another.</li>
		<li>A Hebrew is one who crosses a river, a person from the other side of the river.</li>
		<li>River crossers are a people separated from the world.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Abraham was the first Hebrew, the first river crosser&mdash;Gen. 14:13; Heb. 11:8-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Abraham left Chaldea, crossed the flood, and came into Canaan, the good land of blessing&mdash;Josh. 24:2-3.</li>
		<li>Abraham&rsquo;s crossing the river and entering into the new land signified his entering into an uplifted, new mankind, which would be used by God to be His expression.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Our God is the God of the Hebrews&mdash;Exo. 3:18; 9:1, 13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He is the God of the river crossers, the God of the separated people.</li>
		<li>The God of the Hebrews is the God of the people who have crossed the river for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The God of the Hebrews has written the book of Hebrews to us&mdash;Heb. 1:1-2a; 12:25a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The basic concept of the book of Hebrews is that of crossing the river, of passing over from one side to another.</li>
		<li>The Epistle to the Hebrews is only for river crossers.</li>
		<li>If we have crossed the river, we can understand this wonderful book&mdash;Heb. 5:12; 6:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The purpose of God&rsquo;s speaking in the Epistle to the Hebrews is that all who contact God by faith would be river crossers&mdash;Heb. 11:1, 6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In suffering death, the Lord Jesus crossed the river and entered into the region of God&rsquo;s expression, the region of God&rsquo;s glory&mdash;Heb. 2:9; 6:19-20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The death through which the Lord Jesus passed was a baptism&mdash;Mark 10:38; Luke 12:50.</li>
		<li>As the real Joshua, the Lord Jesus took the lead to cross the Jordan River and enter into glory&mdash;the reality of the expression of the Divine Being&mdash;Luke 24:26; 1 Pet. 1:11.</li>
		<li>As the Captain of our salvation, Christ has gone ahead of us that He might help us pass through the waters of suffering and enter into glory&mdash;Heb. 2:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Baptism has made us river crossers, and now we are true, genuine Hebrews, following the Pioneer, &ldquo;the Forerunner, Jesus,&rdquo; into glory&mdash; Rom. 6:3; Gal. 3:27; Matt. 28:19; Heb. 6:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To cross the river is to wash ourselves from anything old, anything ruined, and anything that does not match God&rsquo;s glory&mdash;Rev. 15:2-3.</li>
		<li>Every time we desire to enter into the temple we need to cross a standing river&mdash; the laver&mdash;Exo. 30:18; 40:30-32; 1 Kings 7:23, 38.</li>
		<li>The crossing of all the rivers brings us into glory, which is God Himself expressed.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we would enter into the New Jerusalem as the full expression of the glorious God (Heb. 11:10, 16; 12:22; Rev. 21:2, 10-11), we need to cross over many rivers:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to leave the law and cross over to grace&mdash;Heb. 4:16; 7:18-19; 12:28; 13:9.</li>
		<li>We need to leave the old covenant and cross over to the new covenant&mdash;Heb. 8:6-7, 13.</li>
		<li>We need to leave the ritualistic service of the Old Testament and cross over to the spiritual reality of the New Testament&mdash; Heb. 8:5; 9:9-14.</li>
		<li>We need to leave Judaism and cross over to the church&mdash;Heb. 13:13; 10:25.</li>
		<li>We need to leave the earthly things and cross over to the heavenly things&mdash;Heb. 12:18-24.</li>
		<li>We need to leave the outer court and cross over to the Holiest of all&mdash;Heb. 13:9-10; 10:19-20.</li>
		<li>We need to leave the soul and cross over to the spirit&mdash;Heb. 4:12.</li>
		<li>We need to leave the beginning of truth and life and cross over to the maturity of life in the truth&mdash;Heb. 5:11&mdash;6:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As today&rsquo;s Hebrews, river crossers, we need to see God&rsquo;s economy (1 Tim. 1:4) and experience the dispensational transfer revealed in the book of Acts&mdash;Acts 1:4-8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The matter of the change of dispensation&mdash;the divine arrangement in God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash; is a strong point in Acts:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To speak of a dispensational change in Acts means that in Acts we see the need of a great transfer, a great turn.</li>
		<li>This change, this transfer, is from the old dispensation to the new.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to be transferred economically from the Old Testament to the New Testament:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Although we are New Testament people, we may still have an Old Testament concept.</li>
		<li>We need a transfer out of the law and into Christ, a transfer from being law-keepers to being Jesus-witnesses.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;In the book of Hebrews Paul presents a clear picture showing us that the Old Testament things are over. What remains now in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is Jesus Christ, the all-inclusive One. Having seen such a view, Paul could not tolerate a mixture of such an all-inclusive Christ with the inferior things of the out-of-date, Old Testament economy&rdquo; (<em>Life-study of Acts,</em> p. 518).</li>

<h1 class="title">God&rsquo;s Speaking in the Son</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 1:1-2a; Acts 6:7; 12:24; 19:20</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Our God is the revealed God because He has revealed Himself in His speaking&mdash;Heb. 1:1-2a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today there is the multiplication and abundance of God&rsquo;s word&mdash;Acts 6:7; 12:24; 19:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God is speaking day after day and meeting after meeting&mdash;Lev. 1:1.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s speaking to us proves that we are under His blessing&mdash;cf. 1 Sam. 3:1, 10, 21.</li>
		<li>The life of the believers hinges totally upon the Lord&rsquo;s speaking&mdash;Heb. 1:3; Matt. 17:5; Rev. 2:7a; S. S. 8:13; Heb. 5:13-14.</li>
		<li>The living God imparts and infuses Himself into us by speaking&mdash;2 Tim. 3:16-17; Ezek. 37:4-6:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>When God speaks, the light shines, bringing us understanding, vision, knowledge, wisdom, and utterance&mdash;Psa. 119:105, 130.</li>
			<li>When God speaks, life is imparted, and this life includes all the divine attributes and human virtues of Christ&mdash;John 6:63; 1:1, 4.</li>
			<li>When God speaks, power is transmitted, and this is the growing and reproducing power of life&mdash;Mark 4:14, 26.</li>
			<li>&ldquo;If the Lord would take me away from this country, I would have the complete assurance that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in this country would still go on because it is not a movement of man&rsquo;s doing. It is a move of the divine life growing. The seed has been sown here, the word has come, and life is here. Hallelujah! Where the word is, there is power in life. Now we can see why God speaks. He speaks to shine, to enliven, and to empower&rdquo; (<em>Life-study of Hebrews,</em> p. 26).</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The whole universe came into being by God&rsquo;s speaking&mdash;Rom. 4:17; Heb. 11:3; Psa. 33:9.</li>
	<li>In the Old Testament, God spoke in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, in men borne by His Spirit&mdash;2 Pet. 1:21.</li>
	<li>In the New Testament, God speaks in the Son, in the person of the Son:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This person was firstly individual and then became corporate.</li>
		<li>God today speaks in a person, and this person has been increased to be a corporate person, including all the apostles and all the members of this person&rsquo;s Body&mdash;1 Cor. 14:4b, 31.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The essence of the Epistle to the Hebrews is God&rsquo;s speaking in the Son:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God speaks in the Son, the Son speaks as the Spirit to the churches, and ultimately the Spirit speaks with the church&mdash;Rev. 2:7a; 22:17.</li>
		<li>It is altogether by this speaking story that God is brought into man and man is brought into God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The apostles&rsquo; teaching, the unique teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, is God&rsquo;s speaking in the Son&mdash;the entire speaking of God in the New Testament concerning the full ministry of Christ in three stages&mdash;Acts 2:42; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; 6:3; Heb. 1:1-2a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>First, God spoke in the Son as a man in the four Gospels, revealing the stage of Christ in incarnation&mdash;John 14:10; 5:24; 16:12; 10:30:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To bring the infinite God into the finite man.</li>
		<li>To unite and mingle the Triune God with the tripartite man.</li>
		<li>To express in His humanity the bountiful God in His rich attributes through His aromatic virtues.</li>
		<li>To accomplish His all-inclusive judicial redemption.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Second, God spoke in the Son as the Spirit through the apostles in Acts and the twenty-one Epistles (Romans through Jude), revealing the stage of Christ in inclusion&mdash;John 16:12-15; Matt. 28:19-20; Heb. 2:3-4; 2 Pet. 3:15-16; Col. 1:25-27:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be begotten as God&rsquo;s firstborn Son.</li>
		<li>To become the life-giving Spirit.</li>
		<li>To regenerate the believers for His Body.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Third, God spoke in the Son as the seven Spirits through the apostle John in Revelation, revealing the stage of Christ in intensification:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To intensify His organic salvation.</li>
		<li>To produce the overcomers.</li>
		<li>To consummate the New Jerusalem.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The proper ministry is the ministry according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching, the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, for the building up of the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Son&mdash;His Divinity</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 1:1-13</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Son is God Himself speaking&mdash;Heb. 1:1-2a, 8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To say that God has spoken to us in the Son means that God speaks in Himself.</li>
	<li>God has spoken in the Son (v. 2a), and the Son is God; this indicates that God speaks in Himself.</li>
	<li>The Son speaks God, declares God, and defines God&mdash;John 1:1, 14, 18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Son is the center, the focus, of the book of Hebrews&mdash;1:2a, 5, 8; 3:6; 4:14; 5:5, 8; 6:6; 7:3, 28; 10:29:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s being the Son of God implies the expression of God, the issue, or the coming out, of God&mdash;John 1:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>There is an important difference between Christ as the embodiment of God and as the issue of God:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ as the embodiment of God is related to God&rsquo;s existence; Christ is the complete God as His embodiment&mdash;Col. 2:9.</li>
			<li>Christ as the issue of God is related to God&rsquo;s expression; Christ is the coming out, the emergence, of God as His expression.</li>
			<li>The Father as the fountain emerges in the Son as the spring&mdash;John 4:14.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In Judaism God is true but hidden, whereas in God&rsquo;s salvation God is expressed; this expressed God is God the Son.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Regarding the Son of God there are two aspects: the aspect of the only begotten Son of God and the aspect of the firstborn Son of God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>From eternity until the time of His resurrection, Christ was the Son of God only in the aspect of the only begotten Son of God&mdash;John 1:18; 3:16.</li>
		<li>Through resurrection Christ became the Son of God in the aspect of the firstborn Son of God&mdash;Heb. 1:5-6; Rom. 1:3-4; Acts 13:33:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>As the only begotten Son of God, Christ is the embodiment of the divine life&mdash;John 1:4; 1 John 5:11-12.</li>
			<li>Through resurrection Christ became the firstborn Son of God as the life-dispenser for the propagation of the life embodied in Him&mdash;Rom. 1:3-4; 8:10, 6, 11, 29.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In His first coming Christ was the only begotten Son; in His second coming He will be the firstborn Son&mdash;Heb. 1:6-8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the Godhead the Son is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the impress of His substance&mdash; Heb. 1:3a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The glory is the outward expression, and the substance is the inward essence.</li>
	<li>With respect to glory as the outward expression of God, the Son is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory is like the shining of the light of the sun.</li>
		<li>The Son is the shining, the brightness, of the Father&rsquo;s glory.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>With respect to substance as the inward essence of God, the Son is the impress of God&rsquo;s substance:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The impress of God&rsquo;s substance is like the impress of a seal.</li>
		<li>The Son is the expression of the Father&rsquo;s substance, the expression of what the Father is.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>For the Son to be the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the impress of God&rsquo;s substance means that the Son is God coming to us:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Son is God reaching us, God coming to be one with us.</li>
		<li>In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, we have a God who reaches us, a God who comes to us to save us and to dispense Himself into us.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In God&rsquo;s creation the Son is the Creator, the Upholder, and the Heir:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the past all things came into existence in Him, through Him, and unto Him&mdash;Heb. 1:2; John 1:3; 1 Cor. 8:6; Col. 1:16.</li>
	<li>In the present the Son upholds all things by the word of His power, and all things cohere in Him&mdash;Heb. 1:3; Col. 1:17.</li>
	<li>In the future the Son will be the Heir to inherit all things&mdash;Heb. 1:2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In redemption the Son has accomplished the purification of sins and is now sitting on the right hand of the Majesty on high, waiting for the subduing of His enemies&mdash;Heb. 1:3, 13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Son has taken away sin and has made purification of sins by offering Himself as a sacrifice for our sins&mdash;John 1:29; Heb. 10:12; 9:26.</li>
	<li>The Son&rsquo;s sitting at the right hand of God in the heavens signifies that His work has been accomplished and that He is resting there&mdash;Heb. 1:13; 8:1; 10:12; 12:2.</li>
	<li>The Son is waiting for the subduing of His enemies, that is, waiting for God to set His enemies as a footstool for His feet&mdash;Heb. 1:13; 10:13.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Hebrews 1 presents a marvelous revelation of the Son in His divinity from eternity past to eternity future:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Son was the Creator of the earth and the heavens&mdash;vv. 10, 2.</li>
	<li>The Son is the Upholder of all things&mdash;v. 3.</li>
	<li>The Son is the Heir of all things&mdash;v. 2.</li>
	<li>The Son, having been incarnated for redemption by crucifixion, made purification of sins&mdash;v. 3.</li>
	<li>The Son was begotten in resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God&mdash;v. 5.</li>
	<li>The Son, in His ascension, sat down on the right hand of God in the heavens&mdash;v. 3.</li>
	<li>The Son will come again as the Firstborn&mdash; vv. 6-8.</li>
	<li>The Son will be the King on the throne with the scepter in the kingdom&mdash;vv. 8-9.</li>
	<li>The Son will remain forever and ever in eternity future&mdash;v. 12.</li>

		<li>God has given the Son the authority to do everything in His purpose and the right to inherit all things in His operation.</li>

	<li>As the Son&rsquo;s joint heirs, we not only inherit salvation but also inherit all things with Him&mdash; 1 Cor. 3:21-22.</li>
	<li>As the Son&rsquo;s joint heirs, we are with Him joint owners of the universe.</li>
	<li>The joint heirs are the partners of the appointed Heir&mdash;Heb. 1:9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Since the firstborn Son is God&rsquo;s appointed Heir and we as the many sons of God are His joint heirs, we are His partners.</li>
		<li>In God&rsquo;s economy the Son is the One appointed by God to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan, and we are the Son&rsquo;s partners in the divine interest&mdash;Heb. 3:14.</li>

			<li>When we enjoy Him, we are His partakers.</li>
			<li>When we follow Him, we are His partners.</li>
			<li>Being a partaker is for the purpose of being a partner.</li>

		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The &ldquo;so great a salvation&rdquo; mentioned in Hebrews 2:3 is able to save us to such an extent that it brings us into partnership with the Son in His appointment; thus, we share in whatever He inherits:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Salvation is nothing less than the wonderful person of Christ Himself&mdash;Luke 2:30; 3:6; 19:9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ Himself, as the most profound, marvelous, unlimited, immeasurable One, is our salvation.</li>
		<li>For us to be heirs of salvation means that we inherit this profound, marvelous, unlimited, and immeasurable Christ.</li>

	<li>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to express Himself in a corporate way through His redeemed people&mdash; Gen. 1:26; Eph. 3:21.</li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem, having the glory of God, is the corporate expression of God:

		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ is the Captain (Author, Originator, Inaugurator, Leader, Pioneer) of our full salvation into glory&mdash;Heb. 2:3, 10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As the Captain of salvation, Jesus was perfected through sufferings&mdash;Heb. 2:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To make Jesus perfect was to make Him perfect in terms of qualification.</li>
		<li>It does not imply that there was any imperfection of virtue or attribute in Jesus, but only that the completing of His experience of human sufferings was needed to make Him fit to become the Captain of our salvation.</li>
		<li>Jesus was the seed of the divine glory, falling into the earth to die and growing up to blossom in glory in resurrection&mdash;John 12:23-24; Luke 24:26; 1 Cor. 15:36, 43a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>By His growing up, His whole being, including His humanity and His human nature, was brought into the glorious expression of God.</li>
			<li>He crossed the death river, the ultimate river, and entered into glory, the reality of the expression of God&rsquo;s divine being.</li>
			<li>He is the man in the glory, the man in God&rsquo;s expression, even the man who is God&rsquo;s expression, God&rsquo;s glory.</li>
			<li>As the Captain, the Pioneer, the Forerunner (Heb. 6:20), He took the lead to enter into glory, and we, His followers are taking the same way to be brought into the same glory, which was ordained by God for us&mdash;1 Cor. 2:7; 1 Thes. 2:12:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) He has gone ahead of us to lead us to cross through the waters of suffering and enter into the region of glory, God Himself expressed.</li>
				<li>2) This is the real goal of crossing the river, the real goal of being a Hebrew&mdash; 1 Kings 8:10-11.</li>

	</ol></li>
	<li>The Captain of salvation, the man in the glory, the man who is God&rsquo;s glory, is the seed of glory within us&mdash;Col. 1:27; 1 John 3:9:

	<li>We are saved into glory, the expression of God, through the process of suffering&mdash;Heb. 10:32-35; 2 Cor. 4:16-18:

	<li>Christ as the Captain of our salvation fulfills His duty to lead us into glory by being our High Priest to minister God into us&mdash;Heb. 2:16-18:

<li>Christ as the Captain of salvation leads God&rsquo;s many sons into glory, the corporate expression of God, by saving them organically through sanctification&mdash;Heb. 2:10-11; Eph. 1:4-5; 1 Thes. 5:23; Rom. 5:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The divine sanctification for the divine sonship is the center of the divine economy and the central thought of the revelation in the New Testament.</li>
	<li>The divine sanctification is the holding line in the carrying out of the divine economy to sonize us divinely, making us sons of God that we may become the same as God in His life and in His nature (but not in His Godhead), so that we may be God&rsquo;s expression:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The seeking sanctification, the initial sanctification, is unto repentance to bring us back to God&mdash;1 Pet. 1:2; Luke 15:8-10, 17-21.</li>
		<li>The redeeming sanctification, the positional sanctification, is by the blood of Christ, to transfer us from Adam to Christ&mdash;Heb. 13:12.</li>

		<li>The renewing sanctification, the continuation of dispositional sanctification, renews our soul from our mind through all the parts of our soul to make our soul a part of God&rsquo;s new creation&mdash;Rom. 12:2b; Eph. 4:23.</li>
		<li>The transforming sanctification, the daily sanctification, reconstitutes us with the element of Christ metabolically to make us a new constitution as a part of the organic Body of Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18; 1 Cor. 3:12.</li>
		<li>The conforming sanctification, the shaping sanctification, shapes us in the image of the glorious Christ to make us the expression of Christ&mdash;Rom. 8:29.</li>
		<li>The glorifying sanctification, the consummating sanctification, redeems our body by transfiguring it to make us Christ&rsquo;s expression in full in glory&mdash;Phil. 3:21; Rom. 8:23.</li>
		</ol></li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The basic significance of a priest in the Bible is not that a priest serves God but that a priest ministers God to man:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The first mention of a priest in the Scriptures establishes the principle of a priest.</li>
	<li>The first time the word <em>priest</em> is used in the Bible is with Melchisedec&mdash;Gen. 14:18-20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The foundational story of the priesthood in the Bible is that of a priest coming from God and ministering something of God to God&rsquo;s people:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Melchisedec came from God and ministered something of God to Abraham.</li>
			<li>The bread and wine signify God being ministered to us to nourish, refresh, sustain, comfort, and strengthen us.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The main point with respect to Christ as the High Priest is that He ministers God into us.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Hebrews is a book on the priesthood in its three aspects&mdash;Heb. 2:17; 5:6; 7:16, 25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The first aspect&mdash;the aspect of the Aaronic priesthood&mdash;is for offering sacrifices to God for our sins&mdash;Heb. 10:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Aaronic priesthood solves the problem of sin&mdash;Heb. 7:27; 9:12, 28.</li>
		<li>Christ put away sin by offering Himself to God as the one sacrifice for sins&mdash;Heb. 9:26; 10:10-12.</li>
		<li>The Aaronic priesthood was not part of God&rsquo;s initial intention but was added later because of the problem of sin&mdash;Heb. 1:3; John 1:29; Rom. 8:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The second aspect&mdash;the aspect of the kingly priesthood&mdash;is for ministering God into us&mdash; Heb. 5:10; 7:1-2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As a High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec, Christ is the King of righteousness and the King of peace&mdash;Isa. 32:17; 9:6.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s purifying of sins is typified by the work of Aaron, whereas His sitting down on the right hand of the Majesty on high is according to the order of Melchisedec&mdash;Psa. 110:1, 4; Heb. 1:3; 8:1.</li>
		<li>As the kingly High Priest, Christ ministers to us whatever we need, dispensing the processed and consummated Triune God into us as our supply to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The third aspect&mdash;the aspect of the divine priesthood&mdash;is for saving us to the uttermost&mdash; Heb. 7:25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>For Christ to be kingly is a matter of status, but for Christ to be divine is a matter of constituent, that is, of having the necessary element that constitutes Him a divine High Priest.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s divinity constitutes Him a High Priest who is living, full of life, and able to continue His priesthood perpetually&mdash;Heb. 7:17, 24.</li>
		<li>The divine priesthood is the saving power of the indestructible life; thus, the divine priesthood is the presence of life and the absence of death&mdash;Heb. 7:16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ is a merciful and faithful High Priest&mdash; Heb. 2:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Hebrews 1 and 2 reveal that Christ is fully qualified to be our High Priest:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He is the Son of God with the divine nature&mdash;1:8.</li>
		<li>He is the Son of man with the human nature&mdash;2:6, 9.</li>
		<li>He was incarnated to be like us&mdash;2:14, 17.</li>
		<li>He was tempted, tried&mdash;2:18.</li>
		<li>He suffered death&mdash;2:9.</li>
		<li>He made propitiation for our sins&mdash;2:17.</li>
		<li>He destroyed the devil&mdash;2:14.</li>
		<li>He released us from the slavery of death&mdash; 2:15.</li>
		<li>He brought forth many brothers in resurrection to form the church&mdash;2:11-12.</li>
		<li>He was crowed with glory and honor in His exaltation&mdash;2:9.</li>
		<li>He is the Captain of our salvation&mdash;2:10.</li>
		<li>He helps us&mdash;2:16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ is able to be a merciful and faithful High Priest because He is both the Son of God with divinity and the Son of man with humanity:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>His being merciful corresponds to His being a man.</li>
		<li>His being faithful corresponds to His being God.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s divinity and humanity are typified by the gold and the linen in the ephod worn by the high priest&mdash;Exo. 28:6-14; 39:2-7:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The weaving together of the gold and the linen in the ephod typifies the mingling of divinity and humanity in Christ.</li>
			<li>&ldquo;There is a fabric in this universe woven with golden and linen thread and containing the five colors of golden yellow, pure white, blue, purple, and scarlet. This is the ephod that the Lord Jesus is wearing today. He is still clad in a garment made of gold and linen and with five beautiful colors expressing His divinity, humanity, heavenliness, kingliness, and redemption&rdquo; (Witness Lee, <em>Life-study of Exodus,</em> p. 1372).</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ is a great High Priest&mdash;Heb. 4:14-15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As our High Priest Christ is great in His person, in His work, and in His attainment&mdash;Heb. 1:5, 8; 2:6; 1:3; 2:9-10, 14-15, 17; 3:5-6; 4:8-9; 6:20; 9:24; 2:9.</li>
	<li>As our great High Priest Christ was tempted in all respects like us, He has passed through the heavens, and He sympathizes with our weaknesses&mdash;Heb. 4:14-15.</li>
	<li>As our great High Priest Christ bears us before God in the Holy of Holies&mdash;Heb. 9:24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the Old Testament the high priest typifies Christ as our High Priest.</li>
		<li>Whenever the high priest went into the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, he bore upon his shoulders and upon his breast the names of the children of Israel before God&mdash; Exo. 28:9-12, 15-30.</li>
		<li>Christ is our merciful, faithful, and great High Priest, and we are on His shoulders (His bearing strength) and on His heart (His love).</li>
		<li>As Christ bears us before God in the Holy of Holies, He ministers the processed and consummated Triune God into our being.</li>
		</ol></li>

	<li>Moses, as a type of the Apostle Jesus (Heb. 3:5; Acts 3:22-23), was God&rsquo;s sent one, the apostle who was to take Israel out of Egypt and lead them through the wilderness with the goal of entering the good land for the purpose that they might be formed and constituted into the house of God&mdash;Exo. 3:8, 16-18; 40:33-34.</li>
	<li>Jesus as the Apostle came to us with God to share God with us that we might partake of His divine life, nature, and fullness so that we might be formed and constituted into His church, the house of the living God&mdash;John 6:46; 8:16, 29; 10:10b; Matt. 16:18; 1 Tim. 3:15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ is the Builder of God&rsquo;s house&mdash;Heb. 3:2-6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ in His humanity is the good material for God&rsquo;s building, and in His divinity He is the Builder:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ in His humanity is the foundation stone (Isa. 28:16), the cornerstone (Matt. 21:42; Acts 4:11), the topstone (Zech. 4:7), and the living stone (1 Pet. 2:4) to produce us as living stones for God&rsquo;s spiritual house (v. 5).</li>
		<li>Christ is not only a part of the building in His humanity but also the Builder in His divinity:

			<li>He builds His divinity into our humanity and builds our humanity into His divinity in order to mingle and blend His divinity with our humanity into one entity.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We are God&rsquo;s living, spiritual, organic house (1 Tim. 3:15; 1 Pet. 2:5; Eph. 2:21-22), and Christ builds God&rsquo;s house, His church, in an organic way:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus prophesied that He would build His church, and the fulfillment of this prophecy in His recovery will bring Him back&mdash;Rev. 19:7.</li>
		<li>The blueprint of God&rsquo;s architectural plan for His organic building (Heb. 11:10) is seen in Genesis 1 and 2:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Genesis 1 reveals that God&rsquo;s intention is to have a corporate man as a building in His image to express Himself, and this man is to be committed with His authority, using His dominion to subdue and recover the earth&mdash;Gen. 1:26; Heb. 2:5-6.</li>
			<li>Genesis 2 reveals the way that God fulfills His purpose:

				<li>3) Along with the tree there was a river (Gen. 2:10), revealing that once we receive Christ as life, He becomes the flow of life within us&mdash;John 7:37-39; Psa. 36:8-9; 46:4.</li>
				<li>4) At the flow of the river were three kinds of precious materials (Gen. 2:11-12), signifying that the divine life flowing within us transforms us into precious materials for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;1 Cor. 3:12; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rev. 21:18-21.</li>
				<li>5) God&rsquo;s building of Eve with Adam&rsquo;s rib is a picture of His building the church in and with Christ as the unique element to consummate the New Jerusalem, which will be the ultimate Eve as God&rsquo;s corporate builded expression&mdash; Gen. 2:22; John 19:34; Rev. 21:2.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 3:5&mdash;4:11</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>If we would have the proper understanding of the Sabbath rest in Hebrews, we need to know the significance of the first mention of the Sabbath rest in the Bible&mdash;Gen. 2:2-3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God rested on the seventh day because He had attained what He desired.</li>
	<li>The desire of God&rsquo;s heart is to have man on earth expressing Him and representing Him&mdash; Gen. 1:26-28; Heb. 2:6-8a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The governing principle of the Bible as a whole is that in eternity past God made a purpose, a plan, to express Himself with His authority.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s desire according to His eternal plan is to have Himself expressed and represented by man.</li>
		<li>When man is on earth expressing and representing God, God&rsquo;s desire is satisfied.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When there is a situation on earth in which man expresses God and represents Him, that situation is a Sabbath rest to God.</li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem will be God&rsquo;s ultimate and eternal Sabbath rest because there God will be fully expressed and represented&mdash;Rev. 21:10-11; 22:1, 4a, 5b.</li>
	<li>The Sabbath rest is simply God&rsquo;s satisfaction in His heart&rsquo;s desire.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the Old Testament, the good land was a rest because the temple could be built there&mdash; Deut. 12:9; 1 Kings 8:1-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God regards the good land, His proper people, and Christ as one:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the Bible the land, or earth, signifies the proper people of God; therefore, according to God&rsquo;s concept man is always related to the land.</li>
		<li>In the Bible the land is a type of the resurrected Christ; Christ is the good land&mdash;Gen. 1:9; Deut. 8:7-10.</li>
		<li>Man&rsquo;s body was made with the dust of the land, but man himself was made in the image of God for the purpose of expressing God and was committed with God&rsquo;s authority to exercise God&rsquo;s dominion and to form God&rsquo;s kingdom on earth&mdash;Gen. 2:7; 1:26.</li>
		<li>The combination of land, Christ, and humanity is the expression of God and the kingdom of God with God&rsquo;s glory and authority.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The temple was the ultimate consummation of the entering into the good land by the children of Israel&mdash;1 Kings 8:1-11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>With the temple God could have His expression and His representation for His kingdom, government, and administration.</li>
		<li>The good land is a combination of the earth and the people of God with God&rsquo;s dwelling place built up to express God and to exercise His authority.</li>
		<li>When God is expressed and represented, there is satisfaction for both God and man; this is true rest.</li>
		<li>The church life today is our good land, for here we have God&rsquo;s dwelling place, expression, authority, kingdom, and rest.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Sabbath rest in Hebrews 4:9 is Christ as our rest, typified by the land of Canaan&mdash; Deut. 12:9; Heb. 4:8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is rest to the saints in three stages:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the church age the heavenly Christ, the One who has expressed, represented, and satisfied God and who rests from His work and sits at the right hand of God in the heavens, is the rest to us in our spirit&mdash;Matt. 11:28-29.</li>
		<li>In the millennial kingdom, after Satan has been removed from the earth (Rev. 20:1-3), God will be expressed, represented, and satisfied by Christ and the overcoming saints; then Christ with the kingdom will be the rest in a fuller way to the overcoming saints, who will be co-kings with Him (vv. 4, 6) and share and enjoy His rest.</li>
		<li>In the new heaven and new earth, after all the enemies, including death, the last enemy, have been made subject to Him (1 Cor. 15:24-27), Christ, as the all-conquering One, will be the rest in the fullest way to all God&rsquo;s redeemed for eternity.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Sabbath rest in Hebrews 4:9, typified by the rest of the good land, covers only the first two stages of Christ being our rest:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The rest in the first two stages is a prize to the Lord&rsquo;s diligent seekers, who enjoy Him in a full way and become the overcomers.</li>
		<li>The rest in the third stage is not a prize but the full portion allotted to all the redeemed ones.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Sabbath rest mentioned in 4:9 refers to Christ as our rest in the first two stages, and especially in the second&mdash;the rest that remains for us to seek after and enter into diligently:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the second stage of His being our rest, Christ will take possession of the whole earth as His inheritance, making it His kingdom for a thousand years&mdash;Psa. 2:8; Heb. 2:5-6.</li>
		<li>In the second stage of Christ&rsquo;s being our rest, all His overcoming believers who seek Him and enjoy Him as their rest in the first stage will participate in His reign in the millennium&mdash;Rev. 20:4, 6; 2 Tim. 2:12:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>They will inherit the earth&mdash;Matt. 5:5; Psa. 37:11; Luke 19:17, 19.</li>
			<li>They will partake of the joy of their Lord&mdash;Matt. 25:21, 23.</li>
			<li>This kingdom rest, typified by the entering into the good land of Canaan, is the goal of the New Testament believers.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>There will be a total of three Sabbaths&mdash;the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The present church is the Sabbath of enjoyment, and the coming kingdom is the Sabbath of reward&mdash;Heb. 10:35; 11:26; Rev. 22:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God is wise to use the coming Sabbath as a reward to encourage us to enjoy the present Sabbath.</li>
		<li>In His wisdom God has ordained the next age with the millennial kingdom to be an age of reward as an incentive for us to seek Him and respond to His work in this age</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The church life is a life in which man is gained by God on earth for His expression and representation&mdash;Heb. 2:10-12; 3:6-8; 4:9.</li>
	<li>The book of Hebrews was written for the purpose of encouraging the saved ones not to forsake the church life but to endeavor, strive, and be diligent to enter into it because it is today&rsquo;s Sabbath rest&mdash;Heb. 10:25; 13:1, 9, 13-15.</li>
	<li>We should be encouraged to be in today&rsquo;s church life, today&rsquo;s Sabbath, for it will feed us, edify us, build us up, and qualify us for and usher us into the Sabbath in the kingdom age.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Dividing of Soul and Spirit</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 3:12-13; 4:1-2, 12-13</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>We need to beware of having an evil heart of unbelief in falling away from the living God:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Unbelief is so evil because it insults the living, faithful, and almighty God, preventing us from entering into Christ as our Sabbath rest&mdash;Heb. 3:10, 19; Psa. 103:7.</li>
	<li>Although God is living and faithful, the evil heart is hardened against Him, and its unbelief causes us to turn away from Him&mdash;Heb. 3:7-8, 12.</li>
	<li>Nothing honors God more than our belief, and nothing dishonors and insults Him more than our unbelief&mdash;Num. 13:31-33; 14:7-9, 24, 30.</li>
	<li>In order to be people of faith who are well pleasing to God, we need to exercise our spirit of faith and keep our hearts turned to the Lord, looking away to Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith&mdash;Heb. 11:6; 12:2; 2 Cor. 4:13.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;The word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. 4:12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The children of Israel are a type of us, the New Testament believers (1 Cor. 10:6a, 11), in our participation in the full salvation of God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the first stage we receive Christ and are redeemed and delivered from the world just as the children of Israel were delivered from Egypt.</li>
		<li>In the second stage we become wanderers in following the Lord, just as the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness; our wandering always takes place in our soul.</li>
		<li>In the third stage we partake of and enjoy Christ in a full way, just as the children of Israel partook of and enjoyed the riches of the good land; this is experienced in our spirit.</li>
		<li>The Hebrew believers were wondering in their mind what to do with their Hebrew religion, and this wondering in their mind was a wandering in their soul, not an experience of Christ in their spirit.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The writer of the book of Hebrews advised the Hebrew believers not to stagger in the wandering of their soul but to press on into their spirit to partake of and to enjoy the heavenly Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The very Christ who is sitting on the throne in heaven (Rom. 8:34) is also now in us (Rom. 8:10), that is, in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), where the habitation of God is (Eph. 2:22).</li>
		<li>At Bethel, the house of God, the habitation of God, which is the gate of heaven, Christ is the ladder that joins earth to heaven and brings heaven to earth&mdash;Gen. 28:12-17; John 1:51.</li>
		<li>Since today our spirit is the place of God&rsquo;s habitation, it is now the gate of heaven, where Christ is the ladder that joins us, the people on earth, to heaven, and brings heaven to us.</li>
		<li>Hence, whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter through the gate of heaven and touch the throne of grace in heaven through Christ as the heavenly ladder&mdash;Heb. 4:16.</li>
		<li>The staggering Hebrew believers were wandering in their soul and had neglected their spirit, but the new testament is absolutely a matter in our spirit, not in our soul&mdash;Rom. 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22; Gal. 6:18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Hebrew believers&rsquo; soul, with its wondering mind, its doubting concerning God&rsquo;s way of salvation, and its considering of its own interests, had to be broken by the living, operative, and piercing word of God that their spirit might be divided from their soul:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the marrow is concealed deep in the joints, so the spirit is deep in the soul&mdash;Psa. 51:6; 1 Pet. 3:4.</li>
		<li>Just as the dividing of the marrow from the joints requires mainly the breaking of the joints, the dividing of the spirit from the soul requires the breaking of the soul.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Whenever we read the Bible, it must be living, energizing, and sharp enough to divide our soul from our spirit and discern our thoughts and intentions, revealing which are of and for the self and which are of and for God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We must mix the word with faith by means of all prayer in spirit in order for it to be living and operative&mdash;Heb. 4:2; Eph. 6:17-18.</li>
		<li>The living word of God must pierce into our being and deliver us from our wondering mind and wandering soul into Christ as the Sabbath rest in our spirit.</li>

and the Word of Righteousness</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 5:11&mdash;6:5</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The word of God is not mainly for knowledge but for nourishment&mdash;Heb. 5:12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Although the Bible is a book of teaching, its teaching is not merely to impart mental knowledge but to minister food to us&mdash;Jer. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:2-3.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus took the word of God in the Scriptures as His bread and lived on it&mdash;Matt. 4:4.</li>
	<li>The words <em>milk</em> and <em>solid food</em> in Hebrews 5:12 indicate that the word of God is for nourishment:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Through regeneration the believers in Christ become babes who can grow in life by being nourished with spiritual milk, the milk of the word&mdash;1 Pet. 2:2-3:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The milk of the word is for the soul, the inner being.</li>
			<li>Milk is conveyed in the word of God to nourish our inner man through the understanding of our rational mind and is assimilated by our mental faculties.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Whereas milk is mainly for infants, solid food is for the mature&mdash;1 Cor. 3:2; Heb. 5:13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Paul&rsquo;s burden in the book of Hebrews was to bring the believers out of the kindergarten stage of the Christian life and to bring them on to maturity&mdash;to the word of righteousness concerning Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry and concerning the way of God&rsquo;s economy, the word which is solid food for them to reach maturity&mdash;Heb. 5:12, 14; 6:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Hebrew believers remained in the initial stage of salvation and were not going on to the heavenly ministry of Christ&mdash;Heb. 4:14-16; 5:11-12.</li>
	<li>The Hebrew believers had been enlightened, they had tasted of the heavenly gift, they had received and were partaking of the Holy Spirit, and they had tasted the good word of God, but they remained in the initial stage of the enjoyment of the New Testament blessings&mdash;Heb. 6:4-5.</li>
	<li>The Hebrew believers had received the gospel to a certain extent, but they did not realize that Christ has a ministry in the heavens&mdash;Heb. 8:1-2.</li>
	<li>The book of Hebrews was written to bring the believers on from the good word concerning Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry to the word of righteousness concerning Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry and thereby bring the childish believers on to maturity&mdash;Heb. 6:1.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The word of the beginning of Christ is the foundation of the Christian life&mdash;Heb. 6:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the Son&rsquo;s speaking God, or in God speaking in the Son, there are two categories of the word&mdash; the word of the beginning of Christ and the word of righteousness&mdash;Heb. 1:1-2; 5:12-14; 6:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The word of the beginning of Christ is milk for infants.</li>
		<li>The word of righteousness is solid food for the mature.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The good word of God in 6:5 refers to the word of the beginning of Christ in 6:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The good word of God is the word of the beginning of Christ in the kindergarten stage.</li>
		<li>The word concerning Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry is a good word because it is the glad tidings, the good news; however, it is a word in the kindergarten stage.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The word of the beginning of Christ refers to six items that constitute the foundation of the Christian life: repentance from dead works, faith in God, the teaching of baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment&mdash;6:1-2.</li>
	<li>The beginning of Christ includes not only the beginning of the believers&rsquo; experience of Christ but also the early ministry of Christ.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The word of righteousness embodies the thought of God&rsquo;s justice and righteousness in His dispensational and governmental dealings with His people&mdash;Heb. 5:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Righteousness is being right with persons, things, and matters before God according to His righteous and strict requirements&mdash;Matt. 5:20; 1 Cor. 15:34.</li>
	<li>Righteousness is a matter of God&rsquo;s kingdom&mdash; Matt. 6:33:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Righteousness issues from God for His administration&mdash;Psa. 89:14; 97:2; Isa. 32:1.</li>
		<li>Righteousness is related to God&rsquo;s government, administration, and rule.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Righteousness is a matter of being right with God in our being:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be right with God in our being is to have an inner being that is transparent and crystal clear&mdash;an inner being in the mind and will of God.</li>
		<li>To be righteous in this way is to become the righteousness of God in Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 5:21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The book of Hebrews is constructed basically with God&rsquo;s righteous government&mdash;10:30-31; 12:29:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Hebrews is a revelation of God&rsquo;s dispensational and governmental dealings with His people.</li>
		<li>All five warnings in this book are based on the fact that God is the God of righteousness, a consuming fire in His governmental dealings with His people&mdash;10:31:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The first warning: Give heed to what is spoken concerning the Son&mdash;2:1-4.</li>
			<li>The second warning: Do not come short of the promised rest&mdash;3:7&mdash;4:13.</li>
			<li>The third warning: Be brought on to maturity&mdash;5:11&mdash;6:20.</li>
			<li>The fourth warning: Come forward to the Holy of Holies and do not shrink back to Judaism&mdash;10:19-39.</li>
			<li>The fifth warning: Run the race and do not fall away from grace&mdash;12:1-29.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we would fully enter into the word of righteousness, we need experience and exercise&mdash; 5:13-14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Inexperienced</em> (v. 13) indicates that we need to experience the word of righteousness.</li>
		<li><em>Exercised</em> (v. 14) is related to exercising our faculties to discern, to discriminate, God&rsquo;s word as we do food, considering whether a particular word is like milk or solid food.</li>

<h1 class="title">Let Us Be Brought On to Maturity</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 6:1-8, 19-20; Phil. 3:12-15</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>To be transformed is to be metabolically changed in our natural life, whereas to be matured is to be filled with the divine life that changes us&mdash;Heb. 6:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The last stage of transformation is maturity, the fullness of life:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose can only be accomplished through our transformation and maturity.</li>
		<li>Maturity is a matter of having the divine life imparted into us again and again until we have the fullness of life&mdash;John 10:10b; 2 Cor. 5:4b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The fullness of life is blessing, which is the overflow of life into others&mdash;Gen. 47:7, 10; 49:28; 1 John 5:16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God will sovereignly use persons, things, and events to empty us of everything that has filled us and to take away every preoccupation so that we may have an increased capacity to be filled with God&mdash;Luke 1:53; Matt. 5:6.</li>
		<li>Everything that happens to us is under God&rsquo;s sovereignty for our transformation and maturity; nothing is accidental:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>A mature believer has learned that God is merciful and all-sufficient to meet his needs in every kind of situation&mdash; Gen. 43:14; 17:1; Phil. 1:19-21a; 4:11-12.</li>
			<li>His trust and rest are altogether in the mercy of his all-sufficient God, no longer in himself or in his ability&mdash;Rom. 9:16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The book of Hebrews is a book on maturity, and in order to be brought on to maturity we need to cross the river:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Just as the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea and the Jordan River, we must cross river after river:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The water of the Red Sea is a type of the aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death which ends the power of the world, whereas the water of the Jordan represents the aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death which brings our old man to an end&mdash;Josh. 4:8-9, 20.</li>
		<li>All of our difficulties are dealt with on the other side of and in the Jordan River.</li>
		<li>When we cross the river out of the wilderness of our soul into Christ as our good land, our Sabbath rest in our spirit, we are one with Him to deal with His difficulty and care for His interests, fighting the spiritual warfare so that we may fully express Him and reign with Him in the church life for the building up of the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>If we are in ourselves or are individualistic, or if we are trying to be holy, spiritual, or victorious, we are immature.</li>
			<li>Real maturity is not only in our spirit but also in the church life&mdash;Eph. 4:11-13.</li>
			<li>A mature believer knows and cares for the Body of Christ, being Body-conscious and Body-centered&mdash;1 Cor. 12:16, 18-19, 21, 24.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to intensively flee (cf. Acts 14:6) for refuge to enter within the veil, to enter into the Holy of Holies, where the Lord as the Forerunner is enthroned in glory&mdash;Heb. 6:18-20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This signifies that we must be in our spirit, where experientially the practical Holy of Holies is today.</li>
		<li>The Lord Jesus as the Forerunner fled everything to enter into the presence of God within the veil.</li>
		<li>We need to follow Him to flee from everything other than Christ and the church life into our spirit.</li>
		<li>This fleeing is a real river crossing.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to go on, to be brought on, to maturity by forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, pursuing toward the fullest enjoyment and gaining of Christ for the uttermost enjoyment of Christ in the millennial kingdom&mdash;Phil. 3:12-15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If believers fall away and turn back, there is no need for them to lay the foundation of their Christian life again (Heb. 6:1); there is only the need to go on, to be brought on, to perfection, to maturity.</li>
	<li>Our Christian life is a building project and a race; if we fall away after we have begun, we do not need to go back to the beginning and start again; we only need to go on from where we fell.</li>
	<li>The believers should be like the earth which drinks the rain which often comes upon it and brings forth proper vegetation, instead of like the earth bringing forth thorns and thistles, which is disapproved and near a curse, whose end is to be burned&mdash;Heb. 6:7-8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The rain refers to the five categories of good things mentioned in Hebrews 6:4-5, and bringing forth vegetation is an illustration of being brought on to maturity.</li>
		<li>The believers, as the earth, are tilled for God&rsquo;s sake that they might bring forth Christ, as the vegetation, to maturity to partake of blessing from God&mdash;cf. S. S. 4:12-15.</li>
		<li>The thorns and thistles refer to the traditional things of the Hebrew believers&rsquo; old religion.</li>
		<li>The earth could never be burned, but what it brings forth could be burned; the believers could never be burned, but all that they bring forth that is not according to God&rsquo;s economy will be burned&mdash;1 Cor. 3:9, 12-13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord wants to bring us on to maturity, but we must willingly cooperate with His gracious work:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We need to share with Christ in His attainments&mdash;Heb. 1:9; 3:14.</li>
	<li>We need to be diligent to enter into the remaining Sabbath rest&mdash;Heb. 4:9, 11.</li>
	<li>We need to come forward to the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace&mdash;Heb. 4:16.</li>
	<li>We need to feed on the solid food to enjoy Christ as our High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec&mdash;Heb. 5:9-10, 14.</li>
	</ol></li>
