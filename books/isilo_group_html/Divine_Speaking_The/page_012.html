WITH THE LIFE-STUDIES<br />
NOT TO REPLACE THE BIBLE<br />

AND TO RELEASE<br />

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 24:27, 31-32, 44-45; Acts 8:30-35</h1>
<p>To pay our full attention to the present move of the Lord among us, the building up of the home meetings, is absolutely scriptural. The more we come back to the New Testament to study the matter of Christian meetings, the more we are convinced that in God&rsquo;s intention, Christians should pay their full attention to the home meetings. It is scriptural to emphasize that we need to come back to the home meetings to set them up, establish them, and build them up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOME MEETINGS<br />
BUILDING UP THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In the 1930s Brother Nee told us repeatedly and insisted strongly that we should give up the Sunday morning service meeting in all the churches. He proposed that we use that time on Sunday mornings to preach the gospel to our relatives, friends, colleagues, and schoolmates. But it is hard to break people of their habit. Today people do not work on Sundays and, as a kind of custom and habit, come together as religious people to give a service to God. We are very much the same. When Brother Nee proposed this strongly, nearly no one among us paid much attention to it. Everyone was used to coming to a big morning meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day to sit and relax and listen to a good message. The good message is a kind of music which becomes people&rsquo;s amusement and their enjoyment. If you stop it and you ask them to preach the gospel, that means you cut off their amusement and you ask them to labor. They do not know how to preach the gospel in their homes. If they could collect their relatives, who would speak for them? Even to collect relatives is not so easy. So no one would do it, and that forced Brother Nee somewhat to let it go.</p>
<p>In the Far East, in the rich Chinese families, none of the family members cook, but rather they hire a professional, trained cook. At every meal time, this professional, trained cook prepares a feast for them. It is not a meal, but a feast. At noon there may be twelve dishes and sometimes at dinner, fifteen to eighteen dishes. They have a feast every day. I lived in Shanghai for years and I saw this. The rich Chinese all got spoiled by this kind of feasting. I use this as an illustration.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is also rich. In every meeting you have a professional cook making a feast for you. Now your feast is stopped and your cook is fired. You are charged to go to the kitchen and stand in front of the hot oven. To cook in this way and to have to eat what you cook is not bad. Consider the society in any country. If the country is going to be strong, the families have to be built up. The building up of the country depends upon the families. If every family needs a professional cook, that spoils the entire country. A feast is rich, but it is not healthy. If for every meal you have a feast, you probably will not live to be sixty. Just because you have been taking in so much rich food, you will die of a heart attack. If you want to avoid getting a heart attack, do not eat rich food. The more I eat plain food with no sugar, little oil, and nearly no salt, the more I feel comfortable all day. But to eat this kind of plain food is really a suffering. Likewise, to take away your big meetings to you is a suffering. That is just a suffering in taste but not the real suffering in fact. To take American desserts away from you rescues you from the upcoming heart attack. My restricted diet rescues me from committing a gradual suicide. Dear saints, do not think I am too much. Your attending the big meetings to sit there listening to a good speaker week after week, year after year, is to commit a gradual suicide.</p>
<p>Look at the situation in today&rsquo;s Christianity. The big speakers and top giants always speak, speak, speak. They gained a great number of people, but where is the real building? There is no building, yet the Lord Jesus said clearly in Matthew 16, &ldquo;I will build my church upon this rock.&rdquo; This was a strong word, yet two thousand years have passed, and today where is the building? Through the centuries in Christianity you could only see activities, schedules, and projects, but no building. No need to say the members of Christianity, even the pastors have not been built together. It is difficult to find two famous pastors who would work together. Everyone carries out his own project. Who would work together with others? Brother Nee said that in Christianity they just shake hands over the fence. Shaking hands cannot last too long. After shaking hands, everybody goes back to their own activity. You could not see Christians who are built together.</p>
<p>I was a member of the Chinese Independent Presbyterian church. I was baptized there and I attended the service there for years, but I rarely talked to anyone other than the pastor. Then I joined the Brethren assembly in my town. I went to their meetings five times a week for seven and a half years but I scarcely talked to anybody. In such a meeting there was little contact with others.</p>
<p>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said that He would build His church upon the rock of the revelation concerning Christ. Then in chapter eighteen the Lord Jesus said that He is in the midst wherever or whenever two or three are gathered into His name (v. 20). In this verse the Greek preposition <em>eis,</em> translated &ldquo;into,&rdquo; indicates that these two or three who are gathered into the name of Christ are gathered out of themselves into His name. The name always denotes a person. These two or three are gathered out of themselves into the Person of Jesus Christ. Here they meet together.</p>
<p>In such a small meeting, how could you avoid the contact with others. When you meet in a gathering of five hundred, it is hard for you to speak and easy for you not to speak. But when you meet with just one other person you cannot avoid speaking. Let me illustrate the speaking that might take place in such a small meeting. Perhaps one brother may say that he does not know how to speak and that he does not have anything to speak. He does not like to read the Life-study message, nor does he like to read the Bible. The other brother may tell him, &ldquo;Years ago I did not like the Bible either, but now I like it very much. I did not like it in the past, because I did not have the appetite. Then one day I regretted and repented of my lack of appetite for the Bible. I had a thorough confession of my sins before the Lord. After that I was so happy that I was filled. I jumped, I laughed, and I exulted. Since that time I have loved the Bible and I have the appetite for the Bible.&rdquo; Then he may help the first brother to receive grace by confessing. This is building up. The first brother will become thankful to the Lord and grateful to this brother. He will never forget him, and he will love him. This kind of experience builds us together.</p>
<p>Then these brothers may fellowship about how enjoyable it is to come together in this way. Perhaps one brother may express a concern for brothers that do not come to their meeting. They may pray with tears, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy upon Dave, have mercy upon Don, have mercy upon James.&rdquo; By this kind of prayer these two brothers love each other and get into each other&rsquo;s heart. They are built together. This kind of building together will impress people to the uttermost. Then the two would go to see the backsliding brother. This brother may know that the two were not one in the past, but now he sees that they are so one. There is hardly any need for them to say anything. He would be impressed and inspired. It is so easy to recover him. Gradually day after day this one and that one will be recovered. These small meetings will build up the saints, keep the saints, recover the backsliding ones, and also bring in the new ones.</p>
<p>Those who are accustomed to the enjoyment of the big meetings have to realize that the big meetings can never build up. In Taiwan after 1960 we slowly and unconsciously drifted back to the way of Christianity. Gradually we gave up the practice of the small groups. Although year after year we baptized more than eight hundred, eventually not many were preserved. We did not have the preserving strength. We did not have a proper reservoir to keep the rain because we did not practice the home meetings. We had strong Sunday morning meetings in some halls, but that did not fulfill the purpose of building. So we surely discovered the shortage, the need of the home meetings. We have to endeavor, struggle, and strive for the building up of the home meetings.</p>
<p>To turn our attention from big meetings to small meetings may temporarily be a kind of suffering, but for the long run it will be a very healthy activity in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We are not accustomed to having small meetings in the homes. We like to have the big meetings. We even pray for big speakers. That means we want a big cook to come, to cook feasts for us. But to eat feasts every day is not healthy. The most healthy way is to eat home-cooked meals. Home cooking is really healthy. Everyone can live a long life by eating home meals. Even if they never have one feast in their whole life, still they will be healthy. But I assure you, if every day you attend a feast, you will soon die.</p>
<p>A big feast is tasteful, but for the long run it is not healthy. Big meetings are tasteful and enjoyable, but for the long run they do not build up the Body of Christ. Occasionally, we may all come together for a big feast like the Israelites in the ancient time. They stayed home and ate their home meals for nearly the whole year. Only three times a year they all came together to have a feast lasting not more than seven days. This is very good, but after this you have to go back to your home meals to make you healthy. Learn to treasure the small meetings. Even if you do not feel so tasteful as in the big meetings, try to enjoy it. Try to talk with some new ones or with some who are weaker, who have been away from the church meetings for a while. Try to talk to them. This will help the building.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Divine Speaking &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
