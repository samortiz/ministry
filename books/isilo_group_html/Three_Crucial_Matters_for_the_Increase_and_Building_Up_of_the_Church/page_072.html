IN THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We must remember these points when we go out to spread the gospel. We are wrong if we are merely using these methods to mechanically lead people to salvation. We should not do this. Our commission is to preach the gospel and bring people into the new way. The new way is the only way that has organic edification and building. As we have already fellowshipped, organic building requires organic preaching, organic nourishing, and organic perfecting. Preaching the gospel is organic, nourishing new ones in home meetings is also organic, and perfecting them in small group meetings is even more organic. The new way is entirely organic.</p>
<p>The small group meetings include teaching, edification, building, and perfecting. In the original Greek, the word <em>perfecting</em> in Ephesians 4:12 means &ldquo;equipping.&rdquo; When a person enters the military, he is trained, taught, made to practice, and thus he is equipped. However, <em>perfecting</em> has the meaning of both equipping and supplying. A soldier is not only equipped with the skills necessary to fight; he is also supplied with a gun and bullets. Then he can fight the battle. This is the meaning of perfecting, and this is achieved in the small group meetings.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the small group meetings emphasize fellowship, and this fellowship should not have regulations. On the other hand, the meetings emphasize prayer. We must pray immediately after we fellowship. Prayer brings in mutual concern and care. Therefore, there should not be many people in a small group meeting, and everyone must function. Suppose there are two hundred people in a church, and they attend only the big meetings. Even though they can greet one another, there is no way for them to know one another&rsquo;s situation. However, because there are no set forms or regulations in the small group meetings, everyone can function and speak. After fellowshipping about many things, we will have a burden to pray. We may pray for a sister who is sick or for a brother who lost his job. When everyone prays in one accord for five minutes, there will be a concern and care for one another. Fellowship brings in prayer, and prayer brings in mutual concern and care. This is what we should do in the small groups.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the small group meetings the brothers and sisters can ask questions. Some questions will be concerning our living, concerning life, and other questions will be related to the Bible, concerning the truth. For example, someone may read 1 Corinthians 11 and not understand what is written concerning cutting one&rsquo;s hair or shaving one&rsquo;s head and concerning long hair and head coverings. If he asks a question, everyone should corporately answer the question. Instead of only one person responding to the question, everyone should give a short answer. After everyone has answered, an older or more experienced person should give a concluding word. In this way there is mutual perfecting and edifying. In addition, during the mutual fellowshipping, praying, and caring, everyone functions.</p>
<p>The goal of the small groups is to perfect the saints to do the same things we do. If we have twenty people in our group, after five or six months of perfecting, many of them should be able to do what we do. Hence, after six months we can explain that everyone in the group is ready to &ldquo;graduate,&rdquo; and therefore we should split into groups of three to five people to form new small groups.</p>
<p>Some people may say that three to five people are too few to form a small group. This is true. Therefore, they must first preach the gospel by knocking on doors. After one week of knocking on doors, they may have three to five people who require their care. They should establish home meetings and then bring the new ones into small groups. Then the new ones will not only have the nourishing of the home meetings but also the perfecting of the small group meetings. The believers we gain are the first generation, and they will do what we do. After six months they can go out to gain the second generation; then in another six months, another generation will be produced. By this continuous reproduction there will be a constant spread and increase. If we are faithful to practice in this way, our numbers will double within one year. Our numbers may more than double, because it is especially easy to increase in the beginning.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOAL OF THE NEW WAY&mdash;PERFECTING THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-12 says, &ldquo;He...gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; According to these verses, after we are perfected by the gifted members, we become gifts. This can be compared to a university professor who teaches his students so that they can become teachers when they graduate. This is the goal of the new way, and this is what is revealed in the Bible. However, according to our past practice, we would baptize a person and then not care for him for several weeks. If we did care for him, the most we would do is encourage him to come to the Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings. Hence, people have listened to messages on the Lord&rsquo;s Day for ten to twenty years without experiencing much growth in life. While the saints may have experienced some growth in life, we did not perfect anyone.</p>
<p>The new way does not merely involve preaching the gospel, establishing home meetings, nourishing new ones, and starting small group meetings with mutual fellowship, prayer, and care. It also involves teaching the truth and pursuing the growth in life. The new way is all-inclusive. All the basic exercises and pursuits in the church life are in the small groups. Eventually, everyone in a small group &ldquo;graduates&rdquo; and is able to go out and start a small group meeting. They first preach the gospel and set up home meetings. Then they can set up a small group meeting in the same way that we do. As a result, the second generation, third generation, and the following generations will be the same as the first generation. In other words, one small group will become two small groups, and then it will become four, eight, and eventually twelve small groups. In this way the gospel will be thoroughly preached. Moreover, everyone will be able to preach the gospel, prophesy, and establish churches; that is, everyone will function as an apostle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LONG-TERM VIEW OF GOSPELIZING TAIPEI</h2>
<p>After Taiwan is gospelized, the full-time serving ones who graduate from the training will not need to go anywhere for the spread of the gospel; they will remain in Taipei. Presently, six full-time serving ones go to a town or village to establish a church, but when the full-time serving ones remain in Taipei, they will go to a district to establish a district meeting. If they practice in this way, the new ones they gain will do the same things that they do. We also look to the Lord for the perfecting of the five thousand brothers and sisters who meet regularly in the church in Taipei so that they can go out in teams of six to spread the gospel in the communities and raise up district meetings. Among these five thousand saints, there are about one thousand elderly saints who need to pray much for the Lord&rsquo;s new way. Apart from the elderly saints, the young people who are under the age of eighteen are able to knock on doors, but they are not experienced. If we do not include these two categories of saints, there are about three thousand saints who can go out to knock on doors.</p>
<p>Most of these three thousand saints either work or are housewives; they are not full-time serving ones. Hence, these three thousand saints can function like one thousand saints. They can form one hundred sixty teams with six saints on a team. These teams can labor in a new district to start a district meeting. In this way six people can spend one year to establish a meeting with forty people. This is marvelous.</p>
<p>If we will be faithful to practice this, all of Taipei can be gospelized within one year. During the first six months we will labor to produce the first generation, and in the second six months we will produce the second generation. If we continue in this way, we will not merely gospelize Taipei, but we will spread to every corner of the city. There will be Christians everywhere, and we will hear people singing hymns and praising everywhere. There are many large apartment complexes in Taipei. Eighteen teams can labor in one apartment complex and sing hymns there. This will bring about a wonderful revival.</p>
<p>There are presently one hundred thirty full-time serving ones whom we will send out with our blessing. They have truly received mercy to be the pioneers to open new frontiers. I believe that these serving ones will establish a pattern for the church in Taipei to learn. The population of the city of Taipei is equivalent to two hundred towns with a population of ten thousand people each. Therefore, if we want to gospelize Taiwan, we must also gospelize Taipei. Even though we have set aside Taipei in order to send the full-time serving ones to the countryside, we must be clear that Taipei is still crucial.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei needs three hundred full-time serving ones in addition to the five thousand saints in the church. According to our fellowship, when we subtract the number of elderly saints and teenagers from the five thousand saints, there are three thousand saints who are equivalent to one thousand full-time serving ones. If we apply ourselves, we will succeed. Just as the six-member teams that went to the towns and villages have been successful, the work in Taipei will be successful with six-member teams. We need to testify concerning this in every meeting hall and encourage the saints to follow this pattern for spreading the gospel by going out in teams of six. If the saints will follow this pattern, we will have good results in Taipei.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_071.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_073.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Crucial Matters for the Increase and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 72</div><br></body></html>
