   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hymns: #852, #203</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OUTLINE Since the transmitting of the transcending Christ includes all the triune dispensing, it is the total continuation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity Eph 1:19-22a: The three aspects of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity produce the components of the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The transmitting of the transcending Christ is the total consummation to continue the dispensing of the Divine Trinity for the continual and permanent supply to the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The transmitting of the transcending Christ is to transfuse into the church, the Body of Christ, what the Triune God has accomplished, attained, and obtained in Christ: This is not only for producing the church but also for growing, establishing, and building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This function is local for the universal Body of Christ and universal for the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church Eph 1:22b: It is not merely the redeemed, called-out people of God gathering together, as denoted by the Greek word ekklesia.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is also, even more, the organic constitution issued out from the element and essence of the Triune God into the regenerated believers in Christ that they may be an organism to express the processed Triune God as the Body of Christ: Such a church is universal, but it is to be expressed locally.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Though there are many churches locally, yet they are still one Body universally.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In nature it is universal; in practice it is local.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In business affairs the local churches are different from one another, but in testimony all are identical, like the seven lampstands being indiscernible Rev 1:20b.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The local churches may be distinct but they should not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Any kind of division damages both the Body and its local expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To keep the unique oneness of the one Body in all the local churches is vital, and it safeguards the believers from being led astray.</S>
