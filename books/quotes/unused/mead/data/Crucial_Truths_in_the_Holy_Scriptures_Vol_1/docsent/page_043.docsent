   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Regeneration is a great subject in the Scriptures and a very important part of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The aspects of God s salvation in the previous chapters forgiveness, cleansing, sanctification, justification, and reconciliation with God are all related to regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God forgives us, cleanses us, sanctifies us, justifies us, and reconciles us to Himself so that He can regenerate us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man assumes that he would be free from all problems if he only received the forgiveness of sins and was justified before God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the salvation that God accomplished for us does not stop with these items.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s salvation not only grants us an outward position of being accepted by Him but also involves our inward regeneration, through which we receive a life that pleases Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE NEED OF REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God ; You must be born anew John 3:3, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus said that we must be born anew because unless we are born anew, we cannot see the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The kingdom of God is the realm where God rules.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this realm God does His will and manifests all that He is, and everything is spiritual and heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fleshly and the earthly cannot understand what occurs in this realm.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the meaning of cannot see.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To understand, one must be born anew.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every kind of life is a sphere, a kingdom with its own realm and boundaries, and the things in it can be apprehended only by those who possess its life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, the bird life exists in its own realm, and only those with a bird s life and nature understand this realm.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who are outside the sphere of birds cannot understand the things of the bird kingdom because they do not have the life of a bird or the function of a bird s life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the same way, the life of God has its own realm.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This realm is the kingdom of God, and the things in it can be understood only by those who possess the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since man is outside the kingdom of God and without the life of God and the function of God s life, he cannot understand things that belong to the kingdom and sphere of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to see the kingdom of God, he must be regenerated and obtain the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No one can understand the things of a particular realm apart from the life of that realm.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is also impossible for the life of a lower realm to comprehend things that belong to a higher realm.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How high is God s life compared to man s life!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order for man, who belongs to a lower realm, to understand the things of God s higher realm, he must obtain the life of God s higher realm.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To possess this life, he must be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man and God have two fundamentally different lives in two different realms, two different kingdoms.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order for man in the human sphere to enter into the kingdom of God or the sphere of God, he must have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a man has the life of God, he will share in the kingdom of God spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To possess the life of God, one must be born anew.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many presume that a human being needs to be born anew because he is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, we need to be regenerated whether we are good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to be born again because our life is not the life of God, not merely because our life is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even if our life is good, it is still only human.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not the life of God, it does not have the function of God s life, and it cannot understand or do the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, even if our life is faultless, we still need to be born anew, to receive the life of God, so that we can understand the things of God s realm and participate in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Jesus answered,...Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit John 3:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our human life is incapable of understanding the things of God s realm and God s kingdom, and it is also of the flesh since it was born of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It does not matter how we feel about our own life; in actuality, our life is of the flesh and comes from the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whatever is of the flesh and comes from the flesh is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The flesh is brought forth in iniquity Psa 51:5 , originating from sin; it is sold under sin Rom 7:14 and belongs to sin; in it nothing good dwells v. 18 , and there is only evil; it is weak and profits nothing pertaining to the things of God 8:3; John 6:63 ; it is incurable Jer 17:9 ; it is at enmity against God, not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be, and it cannot please God Rom 8:7-8 ; it is alienated from the life of God Eph 4:18 , having nothing to do with God; and it is unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Most people think that man can change for the better.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is especially true of the Chinese teachers of ethics who suggest that human beings can be reformed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet in the Bible, God uses two unchangeable things, the skin of a Cushite and the spots of a leopard, to illustrate how man cannot be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In essence, God is saying that if these two things could be changed, the flesh of man, or the man of flesh, could also be changed Jer 13:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, the skin of a Cushite will never turn white.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even if the skin were painted white, it would still be essentially black.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We all have considered changing ourselves for the better.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In whatever way we might change, however, it would merely be like applying white paint on the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Inside we would still be dark.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We also think that we can stop sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even if we do not sin outwardly, we would still be sinful inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We may succeed in changing our outward behavior, but we cannot alter our inward nature.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The leopard s spots also cannot be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We may clothe a leopard with a spotless garment, but its spots will be untouched underneath.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We may decorate and dress ourselves up on the outside, but inwardly we are still the same.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may change our outward form, but we cannot change our inward essence.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The man of the flesh, or the fleshly man, is unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No matter the amount of outward adjustment, our inward nature cannot be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Regardless of correction, a man of flesh is still the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The flesh is the flesh, and it will never become the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Only spirit can be born of the Spirit, and only what is born of the Spirit is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To be born of the Spirit, there is the need of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Since the kingdom of God is of God, it is also spiritual, because God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Fleshly man can never have a part in a spiritual kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In order for man to partake of this spiritual kingdom, he must have a spirit that is born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, he must be regenerated.</S>
