<h2 class="head1">MOSES NOT BEING ABLE TO ENTER CANAAN</h2><p>In Numbers 20, Moses smote the rock at Meribah, and God forbade him from entering Canaan. Although Moses later pleaded, "Let me please cross over" (Deut. 3:25), God would not answer his pleading. When God said that he could not enter Canaan, it meant that he could not enter it. We know it was wrong for Moses to lose his temper and smite the rock with his rod. But we do not realize the gravity of the mistake he committed. We think that Moses was a meek person and that he unfortunately lost his temper. We may have seen many gentle persons lose their temper, yet God did not deal with them severely. Why was God so severe toward Moses? Let us see what God said. He said to Moses and Aaron, "You did not...sanctify Me in the eyes of the sons of Israel" (Num. 20:12). What does it mean to not sanctify the Lord? It means that we have implicated the Lord. To sanctify God is to set Him apart, to express His distinctive character. This is to sanctify the Lord. Even if Moses lost his temper ten times, others would only say that Moses had a quick temper, and the consequence would not be great. But when Moses lost his temper this time, it affected God Himself. God said that by losing his temper this way, Moses had involved God. He did not sanctify God; he did not put God in His rightful place. The problem with Moses' temper was that he lost his temper on the one hand, and water came out of the smitten rock on the other hand. God's work was evident. This made it difficult to distinguish who was involved. Moses involved God, because the Israelites might have thought in their hearts, "Now we know that God is this kind of God. He is a God who loses His temper and reviles." God was implicated through Moses. If Moses lost his temper and men only saw his bad temper, the consequence would have been small, and God would not have needed to seriously deal with him. God paid attention to this incident because Moses performed a miracle on the one hand&mdash;water came out and God's power was manifested&mdash;and lost his temper on the other hand. The Israelites could not distinguish the difference. They might have said that God caused the water to flow out for their drink and that God also lost His temper and reviled them. Moses dragged God into this confusing picture and did not make a clear distinction. This offended the testimony. The consequence was serious; God could not let him off easily; He had to disqualify Moses from entering the land.</p><h2 class="head1">UZZAH BEING KILLED</h2><p>In considering the matter of offending the testimony, we cannot help but recall the hand of Uzzah. Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God to take hold of it, and he was smitten by God and died by the ark (2 Sam. 6:1-7). God did this to vindicate Himself. We have said in the past that Uzzah tried to take hold of the ark with hands of flesh, but this is still not clear enough; it does not convey the seriousness of the matter. We must see that the ark is the ark of testimony. Before David became king, the ark was captured. At that time there was no Uzzah to protect the ark, yet the ark was able to protect itself. The ark was among the heathens, and it was moved from one place to another. There was no Uzzah or even a single Israelite to protect the ark, yet the ark did not fall. It had never fallen, and man could do nothing about it. When David moved it back, it was among God's people. Did it need someone to take hold of it? Here we see the sin of Uzzah. When the ark was among enemies, it protected itself. When it was among God's people, did it need someone to protect it? God wanted the Levites to lift the ark, yet they put it on a cart drawn by oxen. If the ark fell, that would be God's concern. But the use of man's hand to aid His will damaged His testimony. This is why God would not let this matter go.</p><p>We have to learn the lesson of allowing God to do many things. Those who do not know God's will try to help God. But if we spend some time before the Lord to consider the end of many men in the past, we can identify a principle: no one is allowed to offend God's testimony. Whenever anything offends God's attributes, His authority, His way, His plan, or His testimony, His disciplining hand will quickly come. God cannot allow His testimony to be damaged. He will demonstrate that He is a God of holiness, a God of power, and a God of life. Therefore, we must stand before Him in fear and trembling and not be careless or foolish at all.</p>
