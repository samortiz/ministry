   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE WAYS TO COME TO THE WORD The Way of Being Nourished</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now that we have seen that we need to come to the Word daily, we need to go on to see the way to come to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to our experience, there are three ways to come to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first way is the way of being nourished, which is to spend at least ten minutes to read the Word and five minutes in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should take three or four verses each time to read and then pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To pray-read is to make reading and prayer one thing, mingling our reading of the Word with our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In our times of coming to the Word in the way of being nourished, we should not pray for our relatives, our friends, or any situation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, we should simply praise the Lord for His many wonderful attributes and virtues, give Him thanks, or talk to Him from our heart, confessing our real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may pray, Lord, You are so good.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I just love You.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, I am sorry that I am cold toward You.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, stir up my love for You; kindle the fire within me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not need to compose prayers, for we already have a wonderful prayer book the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The words of the verses we read may be used to compose our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we use the words of the Bible for our prayer, we will touch God, Christ, the Spirit, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, we will be watered, enlightened, sustained, supported, supplied, strengthened, and nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everyone can spend at least ten to fifteen minutes each morning to come to the Word in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not read the Bible in a random order but consecutively from the first verse of a book to the last.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should first ask the Lord to show us which book of the Bible we need to read at the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the Lord leads us to the Gospel of John, we should read and pray-read a few verses from John every morning, beginning with John 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we pray-read through the whole book of John, verse after verse, there will be a great difference in our life because we will be nourished every day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I recently heard that some saints hold the concept that the more they sleep in the morning, the more spiritual they will be.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This concept is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are not already spending time every morning in the Word, we need to begin to rise up at least fifteen minutes earlier to make time to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Early rising will make us healthy, not only spiritually but also physically and mentally.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By rising fifteen minutes earlier, we can spend time in the word of our heavenly Father and thereby absorb all His unspeakable riches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not a one-day matter; it is a lifelong matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If every morning we spend at least fifteen minutes in the Word, we will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the way to be nourished by the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Spending fifteen minutes in the Word in the way of being nourished each morning is to have our spiritual breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not do this, we are like a naughty child who refuses to come to breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Mothers know that in order to have healthy children, they must feed them a healthy breakfast every day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The mothers of children who refuse to eat their breakfast may discipline them in order to encourage them to come and eat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many dear saints have been disciplined by the Holy Spirit for remaining in bed too long and not spending time in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we will rise up only fifteen minutes earlier, we will receive a great blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everyone can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By the Lord s mercy and grace, every day for the past fifty-four years I have spent time in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I will never regret this; rather, I will always be thankful to the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I cannot describe what abundant blessing I have received from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we come to the Word daily, we will never regret it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do not do this, we will suffer a great loss in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Spending time in the Word every day is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every morning we need to spend at least ten to fifteen minutes in the Word, but thirty to forty minutes is better.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should never think that we do not have the time to read the Bible; this is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We know that this is not true because when we receive a phone call, we always have time to talk, sometimes for almost an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we receive no phone calls for two days, we will wonder why.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our ears are always itching for a phone call.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need phone calls to tickle our itching ears, but we may think that we have no time to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may say that we cannot spend time in the Word because we are busy doing laundry and cleaning our house, but if a phone call comes, we have plenty of time to talk.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not allow our time on the phone to replace our time in the Word, even if our conversations are about spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is nothing more important than spending time in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to change our habits.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all need to pray, Lord, rescue me from my unnecessary occupations and strengthen me to spend more time in the Word.</S>
