[2]  CHAPTER ONE HOW TO BE A CO-WORKER AND AN ELDER 1 OUTLINE To know Christ Phil 3:10 , to particularly know that: He is both God and man.
[3]  In His humanity He accomplished His judicial redemption through His death.
[4]  To experience and enjoy Christ to gain Christ Phil 3:8 in His full ministry in His three divine and mystical stages: In the first stage, the stage of His incarnation, from His human birth to His death: To bring the infinite God into the finite man.
[5]  Prayer: Lord, thank You for putting us in Your recovery to be the slaves of Your children.
[6]  To be a co-worker or an elder, first, we must know Christ.
[7]  D. In His Divinity He Is Carrying Out His Organic Salvation in His Resurrection
[8]  A. In the First Stage, the Stage of His Incarnation, from His Human Birth to His Death
[9]  The full ministry of Christ is in three divine and mystical stages.
[10]  The first stage, the stage of His incarnation, began with His human birth and ended with His death, including the entire course of His human life.
[11]  In His full ministry in the first stage of His incarnation, Christ also expressed in His humanity the bountiful God in His rich attributes through His aromatic virtues.
[12]  To be attracted and captivated is to be charmed.
[13]  First, He brought the infinite God into the finite man; second, He united and mingled the Triune God with the tripartite man; third, He expressed the bountiful God in His rich attributes through His aromatic virtues; and fourth, eventually, He accomplished His all-inclusive judicial redemption.
[14]  CHAPTER TWO HOW TO BE A CO-WORKER AND AN ELDER 2 OUTLINE To experience and enjoy Christ to gain Christ Phil 3:8 in His full ministry in His three divine and mystical stages: In the second stage, the stage of His inclusion, from His resurrection to the degradation of the church: To be begotten as God's firstborn Son: From eternity past without beginning, Christ was God's only begotten Son: 1 Possessing only divinity, without humanity.
[15]  In incarnation the only begotten Son of God became flesh to be a God-man, a man possessing both the divine nature and the human nature.
[16]  To regenerate the believers for His Body 1 Pet 1:3: The pneumatic Christ became the firstborn Son of God and the life-giving Spirit for the regenerating of the believers, making them the many sons of God born of God with Him in the one universally big delivery: 1 For the composition of the house of God, even the household of God.
[17]  2 For the constitution of the Body of Christ to be His fullness, His expression and expansion, to consummate the eternal expression and expansion of the processed and consummated Triune God: a All the believers of Christ in this one Spirit have been baptized into the one Body of Christ 1 Cor 12:13a. b All the believers who are baptized in this one Spirit are given to drink this Spirit 1 Cor 12:13b.
[18]  Prayer: O Lord, thank You that You are the Lord who speaks and who gives to us the Spirit, even the unlimited Spirit.
[19]  We believe that You will speak here tonight and will give us the unlimited Spirit.
[20]  To Be Begotten as God's Firstborn Son a. From Eternity Past without Beginning, Christ Was God's Only Begotten Son
[21]  The second great thing accomplished by Christ in the stage of His inclusion was that He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .
[22]  Christ Was Transfigured into the Life-giving Spirit in His Resurrection
[23]  Christ, the Son of God as the second of the Divine Trinity, after completing His ministry on the earth, became was transfigured into the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection.
[24]  This life-giving Spirit, who is the pneumatic Christ, is also called the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7 , the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , and the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:18 .
[25]  This pneumatic Christ, who is the Spirit of life, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and the Lord Spirit, supplies our needs in every way that we may gradually grow in His life and nature unto maturity.
[26]  The third great thing accomplished by Christ in the stage of His inclusion was that He regenerated the believers for His Body 1 Pet 1:3 .
[27]  Christ regenerated the believers for His Body that all the believers in Christ may be built up into a dwelling place of God in their spirit indwelt by Him as the Spirit Eph 2:22 .
[28]  CHAPTER THREE HOW TO BE A CO-WORKER AND AN ELDER 3 OUTLINE To experience and enjoy Christ to gain Christ Phil 3:8 in His full ministry in His three divine and mystical stages: In the third stage, the stage of His intensification, from the degradation of the church to the consummation of the New Jerusalem: To intensify His organic salvation: For His ministry in the stage of His inclusion, Christ became the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, to carry out His organic salvation for the producing of the church and the building up of His Body to consummate the New Jerusalem.
[29]  On the way of Christ's ministry in the stage of His inclusion, the church became degraded to frustrate the accomplishment of God's eternal economy.
[30]  Hence, Christ as the one life-giving Spirit became the seven Spirits of God Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6; 3:1: 1 Not seven individual Spirits.
[31]  In His seven epistles to the degraded churches, Christ calls the defeated believers to be His overcomers by Himself as the sevenfold intensified Spirit for their experience of His organic salvation in His sevenfold intensification.
[32]  Prayer: O Lord, we bow our heads in worship to You, for everything depends upon Your mercy.
[33]  TEN GREAT THINGS ACCOMPLISHED BY CHRIST IN HIS FULL MINISTRY IN THREE STAGES
[34]  It is not enough merely to know Christ; we still need to experience and enjoy Him that we may gain Him.
[35]  In 2 Timothy Paul also charged Timothy to cut straight the word of the truth 2:15 , which means to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion, as a carpenter cutting wood perfectly straight without any crookedness.
[36]  Another example is that the Bible says that Christ became the Spirit in His resurrection 1 Cor 15:45b , yet some insist to say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are separate Persons and therefore Christ is not the Spirit.
[37]  The first thing which Christ is doing in the third stage of His intensification is to intensify His organic salvation.
[38]  Today's reformed theology teaches people that God has predestinated us, and if we believe, His salvation will be accomplished in us.
[39]  The degradation of the church is mainly due to the fact that nearly all Christian workers have been distracted to take many things other than the New Jerusalem as their goal.
[40]  Hence, under the degradation of the church, to be overcomers answering the Lord's call, we need to overcome not only the negative things but even more the positive things which replace the New Jerusalem as the goal.
[41]  CHAPTER FOUR HOW TO FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE CO-WORKERS AND ELDERS 1 OUTLINE Beware of: Ambition: To fulfill the obligations of a co-worker or an elder, you need to have a pure heart, purified from any form of subtle ambition in intention, purpose, motive, and action in the Lord's recovery.
[42]  Prayer: O Lord, we praise You that Your abundant mercy is our daily song; we can never exhaust speaking it.
[43]  From 1950 to 1996, for forty-six years, I have been devoting much more time and energy to the Word.
[44]  In John chapters one, three, four, and eight there are illustrations showing us that Christ as the Son of Man came to cherish people and as the Son of God came to nourish people.
[45]  John 1:29 says, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"
[46]  THE THREE STAGES OF CHRIST IN THE NEW TESTAMENT
[47]  In recent years the Lord has been giving us new messages, and the newest ones are the first three messages given in this international conference of the co-workers and elders.
[48]  Even with Paul, the Lord Was Wary of His Exceeding Exaltation of Himself, So He Let Him Have a Thorn in His Flesh from Satan
[49]  Paul told us that if we desire to live the life of the Body of Christ, we must not think more highly of ourselves than we ought to think Rom 12:3 .
[50]  CHAPTER FIVE HOW TO FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE CO-WORKERS AND ELDERS 2 OUTLINE Beware of: Not being conformed to the death of Christ not denying putting to death your self, natural man, disposition by birth, flesh, preference, and ambition Phil 3:10b; Matt 16:24; Gal 2:20; 5:24.
[51]  The first stanza of Hymns, #501 says, "O glorious Christ, Savior mine,/Thou art truly radiance divine;/God infinite, in eternity,/Yet man in time, finite to be."
[52]  This God infinite in eternity came to be a man finite in time.
[53]  D. Not Being Conformed to the Death of Christ
[54]  Paul said, "To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death" Phil 3:10 .
[55]  F. Not Setting the Mind on the Mingled Spirit
[56]  The co-workers and elders also have to beware of not living with Christ, not walking, working, and moving with Him.
[57]  I. Not Letting Christ Make His Home in Our Heart
[58]  Furthermore, we need to beware of not letting Christ make His home in our heart by our inner man being strengthened by the Father according to His glory with power through His Spirit unto the fullness expression of the Triune God Eph 3:16-21 .
[59]  If we beware of the above six "nots," that is, if we are conformed to the death of Christ, walk and have our being strictly according to the mingled spirit, set our mind on the mingled spirit, magnify Christ by living Him through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, live, walk, work, and move with Christ, and let Christ make His home in our heart by our inner man being strengthened by the Father according to His glory with power through His Spirit unto the fullness, the expression, of the Triune God, then we can attain this last item, which is the working out of our own salvation.
[60]  CHAPTER SIX HOW TO FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE CO-WORKERS AND ELDERS 3 OUTLINE Work with God 1 Cor 3:9 to carry out His divine building in three aspects for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy: Establishing and shepherding the churches by the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit, with His organic salvation.
[61]  Building and constituting the Body of Christ by Christ as the sevenfold intensified Spirit with His sevenfold intensified organic salvation.
[62]  The three aspects of God's divine building are the church, the Body of Christ, and the New Jerusalem.
[63]  We need to adorn and consummate the New Jerusalem with God the Father as its golden base, God the Son as its pearl gates, and God the Spirit for its wall of precious stones, by drinking the Spirit, the flowing Triune God, as the river of water of life and eating Christ, the overcoming Lion-Lamb, as the tree of life with His rich and fresh supply.
[64]  In this building, in the middle of this city, a river of water of life flows out for us to drink and in the river the tree of life grows for us to eat.
[65]  What we drink and what we eat are the Spirit and Christ, that is, the Triune God.
