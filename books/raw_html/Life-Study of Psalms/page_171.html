<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. PRAISING THE KING<br>IN THE PRAISING OF HIS SONS</H2><P>Thus far in Psalm 45 we have seen the praising of Christ in Himself and the praising of Christ in the praising of His church, of His redeemed. Now, in verses 16 and 17, we have the praising of the king in the praising of his sons, his descendants. Here, the sons of the king signify the members of Christ. On the one hand, as believers, we are the members of Christ; on the other hand, we are the sons, the descendants, of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The King's Sons Being<br>in the Palace of His Fathers,<br>and the King Making Them Princes<br>in All the Earth</H2><P>"In the place of your fathers will be your sons;/You will make them princes in all the earth" (v. 16). Here "fathers" signifies Christ's forefathers in the flesh, and "sons" signifies the overcomers of Christ. The word "princes" signifies the overcomers of Christ reigning with Christ over the nations.</P><P>No one can solve the problems of today's world. Only Christ the King can solve these problems. When Christ reigns on earth, the overcomers will be His helpers in the kingship, His co-kings. The sons of Christ, the overcomers, will be the princes reigning with Christ over the nations.</P><P>We need to see not only the beauty of Christ that is in Christ Himself and the beauty of Christ that is in the church but also the beauty of Christ that is in all His descendants, all His members, as the princes. If we see Christ's beauty in these three ways, we will have a complete view, the full picture, of His beauty.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. His Name Being Remembered<br>in All Generations, and the Peoples<br>Praising Him Forever and Ever</H2><P>Finally, in verse 17 the psalmist says, "I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations;/Therefore the peoples will praise you forever and ever." This reveals that Christ's name will be remembered in all generations through the overcoming saints and that Christ will be praised by the nations through His overcoming and co-reigning saints.</P>
