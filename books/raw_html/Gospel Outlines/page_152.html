<h1 class="title">CONDEMNATION AND DEATH BY ONE MAN,<br />
JUSTIFICATION AND LIFE BY ONE MAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rom. 5:15-19</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>There are only two men in the universe
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>According to God, there are only two men in the universe: Adam and Christ. All men are in one of these two persons; either they are in Adam or in Christ.</li>
	<li>Whoever is born of Adam is considered by God to be in Adam and to be Adam, because he is born of Adam. For example, if a watermelon is cut into twenty slices, every slice is watermelon. And if a bottle of wine is poured into twenty cups, every cup is a cup of wine.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Adam was condemned to die because he sinned
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Adam sinned, and so all his descendants sinned. Because he sinned, we in Adam have also sinned. For example, if the forefathers are captives, when the grandsons are born, they are automatically captives.</li>
	<li>The condemnation of Adam is the condemnation of his descendants.</li>
	<li>Because Adam should die, his descendants also should die.</li>
	<li>Because of the one man Adam, we all became sinners condemned to die.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Through Christ&rsquo;s righteous act we are justified to receive life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When Christ died on the cross we also died with Him; because of this righteous act we were delivered from God&rsquo;s condemnation.</li>
	<li>The death of Christ not only delivered us from God&rsquo;s condemnation, but also, on the positive side, justified us before God. This is proven by the resurrection of Christ. The resurrection of Christ proves that God accepted Him and His works. God&rsquo;s acceptance of Him is His acceptance of us, because we are all in Christ.</li>
	<li>Through the resurrection of Christ we receive His life. Through His resurrection from the dead He was accepted by God; we, in the same manner, are accepted by God and justified to receive the life of God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to be transferred from being in Adam to being in Christ
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Confess that you are born in Adam.</li>
	<li>Confess that you deserve death and are condemned to die.</li>
	<li>Receive Christ as the life-giving Savior.</li>
	<li>Believe the fact that you are in Christ the moment you receive Him.</li>
	</ol></li>
