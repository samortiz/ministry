Peter said, "But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word" (Acts 6:4). Peter's words indicate that everyone has a ministry, and that the apostles were committed to fulfill the ministry of the word. The phrase the ministry of the word in Greek is diakonia tou logou. It means a service. A ministry is a service; it means to wait on others. We should serve men with words. The ministry of the word is to serve men, to attend to their needs, with God's word. A minister of the word first must have the word. If he does not have the word, he cannot fulfill his ministry or attend to others' needs. How can one attend to others' needs by fulfilling the ministry of the word? When a man has the ministry of the word, he receives a revelation and a burden in his spirit. He is clear within about the Lord's will, the Lord's commission, and the Lord's word. He knows how to release this word. In the books of the prophets in the Old Testament, the word inspiration should be translated as "the burden of the word." In other words, once a person has a burden, he has inspiration. Without a burden, there cannot be any inspiration. A minister of the word first must have a burden for the word before he can step onto the platform.</p><p>It is not hard for a man to have a burden, but whether or not his outer man is broken is altogether a different matter. Sometimes a man has a definite burden and sense from the Lord, but his outer man cannot furnish him with the proper utterance. This happens to those whose outer man is not broken. Those whose outer man is not broken cannot speak to relieve their burden. Sometimes, their burden becomes heavier by speaking. If a man is broken, his inner man will be released. Sometimes a person stands on the podium and goes around in circles in his speaking. He is bound by his burden; he cannot release or discharge it. The burden inside his spirit cannot break through his outer man. Outwardly he may be preaching, but inwardly his burden is still within his spirit. His mind is not under his control, and he cannot discharge his inner burden through his speaking. He may speak for two hours, tiring out the audience as well as himself. He may use many words, but his spirit is not released. He comes to the meeting with a burden, and he returns home with the same burden. The load on his shoulder remains the same. If part of our outer man, the mind, is not broken, we will be useless to God. I am not saying that we should not exercise our mind. I am saying that the mind and the soul have to be servants to the spirit. The soul must be dealt with and smitten before it can become useful to the Lord. Only then is our mind no longer its own master but an instrument of the spirit.</p><p>A minister of the word must not only have a burden and a word from the Lord; his mind must be dealt with. If his mind has been dealt with, he can listen to others. He is not independent, and he can easily convey the burden of his spirit to others. When the word is released this way, the burden is released. One must not be satisfied simply with others' approval of his speaking; he must have the sense that he has spoken the right thing. If he speaks in this way, his burden will be discharged as soon as he finishes speaking. The audience will be satisfied, and he will be satisfied as well. The two worst conditions facing a minister of the word are: 1) Having thoughts but not being able to release the spirit in his ministry, that is, the spirit is not exercised, and 2) having the spirit and the exercise of the spirit in the ministry, but not having the proper thoughts. Both cases speak of a conflict between the outer man and the inner man. In neither case is there a proper ministry of the word. The first kind of ministers are heady and full of thoughts; they are blind in their mind. The second kind of ministers have a burden in their spirit, but they do not have the words to release them. Their outer man and inner man are in conflict with one another; they are not in harmony. Only a broken man can fulfill the ministry of the word and release his spirit quickly without going around in circles. As soon as his spirit is released, it touches others. If a man does not have an inward burden, he cannot fulfill the ministry of the word. If he has a burden but his outward thoughts do not cooperate with him, he cannot fulfill the ministry of the word either. Only those whose outer man has been smitten and broken by God can be proper ministers of the word. The ministry of the word means a ministry that discharges one's inward burden.</p><h2 class="head3">Conditions after the Breaking of the Outer Man</h2><h2 class="head4">The Will Being Pliable yet Strong</h2><p>After a man experiences the breaking of his outer shell, several things happen. First, the will becomes pliable. The will occupies a great part of the outer man. Once the outer man is broken, the person, the will, becomes softened. Before a man's shell is broken, he is hard. Those with an uncracked shell have a will that is hard but not powerful. A broken man, however, is a softened man. His will is strong but not hard. His will is like a tire which is strong but not hard. Those who want help find that it is easy to approach such a person. Such a person sees light easily. It is easy to approach such a person, and it is easy for him to approach others. Those whose outer man is broken and whose will is made pliable are very approachable for help, and it is also easy for them to receive help. They know men, and they are easy to get along with. It is easy for them to release their spirit and easy for them to receive God's word. We can talk to some people for two hours and yet still be in the dark about everything. We can talk with others for two minutes and all of our problems are solved. Those whose outer man is not broken have a hardened will. They like to argue, and they become quite rigid in their mentality. It is not easy for them to receive light or teaching from God. The first thing that happens with the breaking of the outer man is a softening of the will. This is not a mere form of politeness. Such softening is useless. The kind of softening that is manifested in a broken man is very spontaneous.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 59: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (1) &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
