<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Daily Hungry and Daily Satisfied&#151;<br>the Normal Experience of One<br>Who Is in Fellowship with the Lord</H2><P>The Christian experience is one where we are daily hungry and are daily satisfied. I had a meal this morning. But by this afternoon and this evening, I will be hungry again. This is like a person having fellowship with the Lord in the morning; he feels sweet and satisfied. But in the afternoon, he needs to come to Him again. This is God speaking in Him. Many Christians do not pay attention to this. They do not realize that every time they are hungry, they have to contact God. Every time we do not follow the Holy Spirit, we will lose the sense of hunger. This sense of hunger is the sense of life.</P><P>The Song of Songs says that God's leading directs us to the place of peace and rest. If we do not have rest, this proves that God is speaking to us. In the Song of Songs we see a person working for God, yet one who did not fellowship with Him. She was busy with her work, yet she was hungry within. She asked where the Lord fed His flock, because she wanted to be satisfied, and she asked where the sheep could find rest. She asked these questions because she herself did not have rest. This sense of hunger and restlessness is God's speaking. The purpose of this speaking is to turn us to seek after the Lord. The result of the Lord's leading is to bring men to Him. At the end of chapter one of the Song of Songs, we see the result of the Lord's leading, which is the seeker sitting at the table with the Lord. In chapters two, three, and four she was repeatedly hungry and restless. Every time she was hungry and restless, it was God's speaking to her for the purpose of drawing her to the Lord. In this way, she was kept constantly in a state of seeking after God. There is no other way to take care of man's hunger and restlessness except by coming to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ALL SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES BEING<br>GOD PASSING THROUGH US</H2><P>Some people study the Bible and pray, but they are not satisfied. The reason for this is that they need to have the sense of the Holy Spirit within them. When we pray, we cannot pray according to our mind or our memory; we have to pray according to our inner feeling. If we pray according to our inner feeling, the more we pray, the more we will touch God. This kind of prayer is like our eating; it satisfies us.</P><P>Some people pray according to their memory. They pray for their husbands, and they pray for their sons, from the first one to the last one, and ask God to protect them from car accidents. But the more such ones pray this kind of prayer, the emptier they become. After the prayer, when such ones see their children, they lose their temper again. What is the real prayer? The real prayer is the Christ within praying to the Christ in heaven. The real prayer is God passing through you and praying out of you. All spiritual experiences are a matter of God coming in and going out of you. The real prayer is not a matter of kneeling down or saying the right words, but of praying according to the inner feeling. If the Lord wants you to pray, you should pray. You should pray to the extent that you are filled with God and that God passes through you. This is the real prayer. It is right that we pray for the brothers and sisters, and sometimes God does give us the burden to pray for others; the more we pray that kind of prayer, the more burden we will have. But many times when others ask me to pray for them, I would not answer anything. It does not mean that it is wrong for others to ask me to pray for them. It means that I have to go before God and see what His mind is. We are not praying according to man's need, but according to the inner feeling. In other words, we pray according to God's need.</P><P>The same is true with our reading of the Bible. For example, when we read Matthew 1, we should not right away look up the meaning of the word Abraham. Rather, whenever we come to some words that we are touched with, we should immediately pray. In this way, our reading of the Word will cause us to touch God and be filled with Him.</P>
