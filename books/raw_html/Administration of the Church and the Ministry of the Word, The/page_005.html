 <h2 class="head1">LEARNING THE PRINCIPLES FOR<br />
ADMINISTRATING THE CHURCH AND<br />
MINISTERING THE WORD</h2>
<p>We might not all be able to speak and fulfill the ministry of the word as prophets, nor can all of us administrate the church as elders. Nevertheless, there should be good elders and those who can minister the word in a strong way among us. In principle, those who have a part in God&rsquo;s work should learn to administrate the church and minister the word. Although the sisters, standing in the position of having their heads covered, should not be elders, in principle they should learn to administrate as elders. Everyone who has a part in God&rsquo;s building work should learn to administrate the church and minister the word. Every serving one should know the administration of the church and the ministry of the word. If we do not know these two matters, we are unskilled in God&rsquo;s work. The administration of the church and the ministry of the word are two lessons that we must learn, because the building up of the church depends on both.</p>
<p>The progress of the church first requires the administration of the church and then the ministry of the word. The sequence in the Bible, however, first presents the ministry of the word and then the administration of the church. When the condition of the church is normal, the administration of the church is not as crucial. But when the church becomes desolate and disorderly, there is a need for the administration of the church and the ministry of the word. The ministry of the word and the administration of the church go together; it is difficult to say which is first and which is second. Therefore, the brothers, especially those who minister the word and those who serve as elders, need to see the responsibility they bear. The condition of God&rsquo;s building, that is, whether a local church is strong or weak, depends on the administration carried out by the elders and the word released by the ministry. The elders and those who minister the word are skilled workers. They are assisted by others who are not as skilled. This can be compared to building a house with workers who are skilled and with others who are not as skilled. Whenever the skilled workers are weak, the administration of the church and the ministry of the word are weak in that church, and the workers who are not as skilled will be confused and not know what to do. But whenever the skilled workers are strong in carrying out the work, it is easy for other workers to cooperate.</p>
<p>This is the condition of the local church. When the ministry of the word and the administration of the church are strong, the brothers and sisters who are not as skilled can have a beautiful coordination. However, when the administration by the elders and the ministry of the word are weak, the church will be in disorder even if the brothers and sisters are busy zealously preaching the gospel and edifying the saints. In such a situation the building will not be accomplished, because the more they &ldquo;build,&rdquo; the more they tear down. The building up of the church depends on the administration of the church and the ministry of the word. Those who are involved with the work must know the principle of the administration of the church and the ministry of the word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONDITION OF THE ADMINISTRATION<br />
OF THE CHURCH AND THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD DEPENDING ON OUR PERSON</h2>
<p>The condition of the administration of the church and the ministry of the word depends on our person. Our person determines the condition of the administration of the church and the ministry of the word. The central work of God is His building, which depends on the administration of the church and the ministry of the word. The kind of person we are determines how we administer the church and minister the word. The administration of the church and the ministry of the word cannot be separated from our person. This is similar to the fact that houses built by Westerners have a Western appearance, and those built by Chinese have a Chinese appearance. We build according to our person. This is especially true in spiritual matters. For this reason it is inadequate merely to study how to administrate the church and minister the word. Rather, we must see that the way is our person. The way to administrate the church is related to the person who administrates. The kind of person we are determines how we administrate. It is inadequate for us to merely learn an outward way; we must deal with our person.</p>
<p>After a long period of unrest, God gave me the feeling within that He is doing a building work in this age. In Manila I released over fifteen messages related to the building. When I went to Hong Kong, the brothers wanted me to perfect them in certain matters. I pointed out to the serving ones that it is inadequate simply to be busy. We must see that God desires a building. During this period of time in Taipei, I have much feeling concerning God&rsquo;s building and the serving ones. When I view these two together, I have deep sorrow and a burden within because our condition is far from God&rsquo;s building.</p>
