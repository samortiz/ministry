<P>When we hear the Father telling us that our sins are forgiven, we have peace and joy. If we have not yet received the freedom of forgiveness, we are indeed poor men. All who are sitting here today have heard that their sins are forgiven; they have peace and do not need to ask anyone or look for any other evidence. As long as God has said it, it is enough. When He says that we are forgiven, we are forgiven. Unfortunately, we only enjoy half of the happiness; we have not yet entered into God's happiness, enjoyed His happiness, and allowed Him to enjoy His happiness over us. Real worship is having the happiness which God has. Some have said it well, that worship is not just to thank Him but to consider Him as one's joy. We joy in God. There is a phrase in Psalms which says that God is our exaltation's rejoicing (Psa. 43:4). We should all consider God as our exaltation's rejoicing.</P><P>Verse 24 says, "Because this son of mine was dead and lives again; he was lost and has been found. And they began to be merry." God says that we should be merry. What are the reasons for being merry? There are two reasons. The first is that the son was dead and now lives. The second is that the son was lost and now is found. This is why we should be merry. Being dead and living again is the son's gaining something. Being lost and being found again is the father's gaining something. The prodigal son was originally a son; now he becomes a son once again. Man was first created by God, but later he fell and was as good as dead. When the Lord Jesus came to save men, He caused dead men to become alive again. This is to be dead and live again. This is not the part we emphasize today. What we will pay attention to today is to be lost and found again.</P><P>There are three parables in Luke 15. They are the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the lost son. Have you ever thought about this? With these three losses, who do you think is the one that lost them? We think that the lost sheep was poor, who was probably fumbling in the barren hills and the scattered rocks, and who had probably fallen into the thorny paths. We forget that the one who lost the sheep was the shepherd. The one who suffered was the shepherd. The one who was poor was the shepherd. We wonder where the lost coin was, but we forget that it was the woman who had lost the coin and it was she who suffered. In the last parable we always think about the poor prodigal son, who wandered in destitution and longed to be satisfied with carob pods when no one would give him anything. When we consider how he turned, we rejoice for the great blessing he received. But who was the one who had lost the son? It was not the son but the father. The poor one was the father; the suffering one was the father. It was the father who had sacrificed his heart and wasted his money on his son's education. This is why the father said that his son was lost and now was found, and why they began to be merry. Have we ever thought that when we turn back and obey, God's heart will rejoice? The highest point of the gospel is not to show us what the sinner has received but what God has obtained. We have squandered the money, but God has suffered. We should give ourselves totally to God. How much have we given to God? Do not think that it is all right to be a little cold. We have to realize how much God suffers by our little coldness. Do not think that it is all right to love the world a little and be mixed with it a little. We have to realize how much this affects God. This will cause God to suffer. Every time we come before God, consecrate ourselves to Him once again, and deny ourselves once again, God gains something, and we are giving joy to God.</P><P>Our personal, petty gains and losses are worth nothing. What counts is for God to gain something. It is a wonderful thought that every time we choose the way of submission to God, we make His heart happy and gain something for Him. God can create the universe, and He can give things to men. But it is possible for Him to lose the heart of men! God cannot force man's heart to go His way! What a joy to consider that a God as great as ours, who is omnipotent, who has everything, and who is the Creator of everything, would want something from those who are like worms and dust! He said, "We had to be merry and rejoice" (v. 32). The return of a prodigal son can cause God to rejoice. The God who holds the universe will rejoice at a little obedience from us. Consecration is not an imposition or concession but a way for us to enter into the joy of God; it makes God happy on account of us. How amazing this is! May we all enter into the joy of God today, and may we all render Him the joy.</P>
