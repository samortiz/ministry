   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MY REALIZATION OF BROTHER NEE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH MY CONTACT WITH HIM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At this point I would like to fellowship about my realization of Brother Nee through my contact with him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Nee and I were far away from one another when we were young Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was in southern China, and I was in northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was saved in 1920, and I was saved in 1925.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My mother was baptized as a teenager, and she became a member of a Southern Baptist denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I was brought up and educated in Christianity, but I was not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One day I heard that a young lady preacher around twenty-five years old was coming to my town to hold some gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I was nineteen years old at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I was curious to see such a young woman preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One afternoon I went to hear her speak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since that time I have never seen a person preaching who was that prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She was preaching to a crowd of over one thousand people about how Satan has captured, possessed, and occupied people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She used the story of Pharaoh having the children of Israel under his tyranny.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I was captured by the Lord because of her preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That young sister's name was Peace Wang.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She became the second sister who was a co-worker among us after Ruth Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through her preaching I was saved in April 1925.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that time as a young man, I was very ambitious, but I was really turned to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I loved the Lord, but I had nowhere to go for help.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I tried to collect books about the Bible to help me understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In my hometown there was a Christian paper called The Morning Star.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In that paper there was an article by Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was the best article in the paper to me, and I enjoyed reading it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I did my best to collect all of the issues with his articles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I had never met him, and from reading his articles I thought that he must have been an old writer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In one of the issues, there was an advertisement for people who wanted to subscribe to Brother Nee's monthly magazine entitled The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I sent in my subscription and received the twenty-four issues of The Christian in 1925 and 1926.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>During that time I wrote to Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was the beginning of my contact with him through written correspondence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Mostly, I asked him questions about the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In one letter I asked him to tell me the best book to help me understand the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He told me that according to his knowledge, the best book to help me know the whole Bible was J. N. Darby's Synopsis of the Books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He said that I would have to read it a number of times in order to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Later when I went to visit him for the first time, he gave me a set of Darby's five-volume synopsis.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By reading Brother Nee's writings, I began to realize the truth concerning what the proper church is and the wrongdoings of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although I was then in a denomination, I was inwardly through with the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In my denomination there was a young man who noticed that I had become different from the others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One day he came to me and asked me how we could know that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I gave him a booklet by Brother Nee on the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After reading that, he was clear that he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, our pastor referred to us two as Joshua and Caleb.</S>
