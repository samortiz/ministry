   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christians Not Engaging in War</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is a basic difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament in the matter of going to war.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Old Testament shows us that God is a God of warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He ordained that there would be war in Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We cannot say that war is altogether wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, in the New Testament we are made ambassadors of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this age the Lord does not go to war.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He says, "My kingdom is not of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If My kingdom were of this world, My attendants would be struggling so that I would not be delivered to the Jews" John 18:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the garden of Gethsemane, Judas came with men to take the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Peter took out his sword and cut off the right ear of one of the servants of the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord told him, "Put the sword into its sheath" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our Lord does not call us to war.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to remember that the goal of God's work is peace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The proper place of a Christian's sword is the sheath.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some have argued that the Lord once told us to buy swords.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Luke 22:35-38 the Lord said to the disciples, "When I sent you without purse and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was what the Lord told them to do before.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now things had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord told them to bring everything they had and that he who had no sword should sell his garment and buy one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The disciples did not understand this and answered immediately, "Lord, behold, here are two swords."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord said, "It is enough."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord was saying, "You have spoken enough.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The age has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From now on I will be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Previously, men welcomed Me, but now I am rejected."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The disciples did not see this at all.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A little while later, in the garden of Gethsemane, Peter still cut off the ear of the servant of the high priest with his sword.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If I tell the brothers that the Lord's word is a lamp unto my feet, and they come back and ask if it is electric lamp or oil lamp, I will say, "It is enough."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we have to be clear of our way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do not want to go to war with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the ancient days the Jews traveled with swords and staffs.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord told the disciples to sell their garment to buy a sword, but this sword was not for warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He said this to the disciples because men would no longer receive the Lord and would no longer render any supply to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord has never commissioned us to go to war because His kingdom is not of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Should a Christian be against war?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have no compulsion to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are standing on Christian ground, and we are not for war.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But this does not mean that we will oppose war.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>War is something that a government engages in. A government can declare war, but Christians should abide by Christ's commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord has not commanded us to be fighters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the time of the Franco-Prussian war in Europe, one person wrote, "If a Christian goes to war, he is a fallen Christian."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But no individual has a choice when a nation goes to war.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a man is forced to fight, we have nothing to say about this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is between him and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But we have to be clear that God's Spirit is for peace in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord said, "Blessed are the peacemakers" Matt 5:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a brother finds himself in a war, he should say to those in authority, "I believe that the human soul is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I cannot kill."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What the authority will want to do with us is up to it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We cannot be fighters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a brother stands in a battlefield and his enemy is a brother, surely he cannot kill him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If he is a sinner, he cannot kill him either.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If he kills him, he is sending his soul to the eternal lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, a Christian cannot go to war.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The above discussions pertain to a Christian's attitude and practice with regard to civil government and his country.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to make these things clear to the new ones so that they will have the right attitude and will choose the right way.</S>
