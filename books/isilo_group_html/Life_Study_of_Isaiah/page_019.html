Their Land Being Full of Idols</H2><P>Their land was full of idols; they bowed down to the work of their hands, to that which their fingers had made (v. 8). They were rich not only in money but also in idols. Idols always go together with money. This is true of worldly people today. When such people are rich in money, they are also rich in idols. This is why money is called mammon (Matt. 6:24; Luke 16:9, 11, 13).</P><P>Because the nations trusted in their idols, God judged them in order to humiliate them. Thus, the ordinary man was humbled, and the man of distinction was abased (Isa. 2:9a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Asking Jehovah Not to Forgive Them</H2><P>In his accusation against the haughty nations, Isaiah asked Jehovah not to forgive them (v. 9b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jehovah's Humiliating Judgment</H2><P>In 2:10-22 we see Jehovah's humiliating judgment on the haughty nations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Object of Jehovah's Humiliating Judgment</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Man's Haughty Look and Man's Loftiness</H2><P>The first object of God's judgment is man's haughty look and man's loftiness (vv. 11a, 17a). Each person has his own kind of look. For example, a banker has a banker's look, and a professor has a professor's look. Those with a haughty look make a display of their dignity. The same is true of those who are lofty.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Everything Proud and Lofty and Everything Lifted Up</H2><P>God judges whatever is lofty and proud and whatever is lifted up (v. 12). If we study history, we will see that throughout the ages God has judged those who are proud, lofty, and lifted up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. All the Lofty and Lifted-up Cedars<br>of Lebanon and All the Oaks of Bashan</H2><P>The objects of Jehovah's judgment also include all the lofty and lifted-up cedars of Lebanon and all the oaks of Bashan (v. 13). These cedars and oaks are types of lofty persons, those who lift themselves up. All those who uplift themselves and become lofty will be "chopped" through God's judgment.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
