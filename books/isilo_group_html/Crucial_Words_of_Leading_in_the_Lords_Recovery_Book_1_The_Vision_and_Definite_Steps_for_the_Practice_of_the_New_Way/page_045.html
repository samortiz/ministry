THE DOWNWARD TREND</h2>
<p>In general, while Christianity is on a downward trend, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is on an upward trend. Today it is altogether right for us to promote the home meetings. This is the unique way that the Lord&rsquo;s church has taken since the first day it was on the earth. It was because of the degradation of Christianity that the church degraded into a formal and organized religion and annulled the home meetings. This is the situation we are in today. However, we need to admit honestly that even until today we have not rid ourselves completely of the traditional influence of Christianity. Please give me the liberty to say that over the last twenty years we have stopped advancing. Instead, we have been drifting downward and have fallen into a situation akin to that of an organization.</p>
<p>Now you can understand to a small degree why I stressed so much the changing of the system when I returned to Taiwan a year and a half ago. I wanted to overturn everything so that we could practice the small group meetings. I publicly acknowledged my mistake before everyone, because I also had fallen into the same trap. My blood was not fully purged of that religious influence. We have said that in the small group meetings we do not have any leader but that everyone is a leader. Yet after a while we came up with something called the &ldquo;Training for the Core Members.&rdquo; You were not the only ones who were thinking in this way; I was thinking in the same way. You were not the only ones who were not fully purged from the influence; I was not purged from the influence either. To designate &ldquo;core members&rdquo; in a small group meeting is in effect to kill the small group meetings.</p>
<p>Perhaps some would not agree with me. Perhaps we think that the small group meetings would not have survived until today had there not been some &ldquo;core members.&rdquo; However, to my feeling, it is the presence of these &ldquo;core members&rdquo; that is crippling the small group meetings and limiting their development. If we are fair and compare the results, we will see that those small groups without &ldquo;core members&rdquo; are actually thriving. They are bustling with people, and everyone participates.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CRUCIAL POINTS RELATED TO CHANGING THE SYSTEM</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Removing Human Hands, and<br />
Trusting in the Lord&rsquo;s Gracious Hand</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we pointed out that there are four hundred small groups in the church in Taipei. We have been practicing this for more than a year and a half, yet we still have not seen any subdivision of the groups. I have said from the very beginning that the best thing that can happen to a small group is for every one of its members to have regular meetings and for every home to have a group meeting. In this way, there will be no need for &ldquo;core members&rdquo; or so-called leaders. There will not be any hierarchy. Everyone will be able to lead the meeting. Everyone will be able to pick songs, pray, expound the truth, prophesy, and testify. Everyone will be able to speak God&rsquo;s word. The church in Taipei was the first place where I released such a message, but up until today, the church in Taipei has not done this. The most likely obstacle in this matter is the elders and the co-workers. To put the matter in a polite way, the elders and co-workers are too conservative and too faithful; they dare not let go. They are afraid that if they let go, disaster will follow. The truth of the matter is that they have been holding on too tightly and controlling too much. As a result, the saints are hindered from advancing and growing.</p>
<p>I have often prayed to the Lord concerning such a condition among us. On the one hand, I admire our faithfulness to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and our fearfulness that something might come in to damage the church. If possible, we would embrace the church like a child embraces his pillow when he sleeps. This is true in particular with the older saints. Their faithfulness is not a matter of three to five years; they have been faithful for almost their entire lives, at least over twenty or thirty years. I believe that our consecration to the Lord is valuable in His sight and will be remembered by Him. Yet I hope that we will realize that sometimes we are a little too much; we have delayed the Lord&rsquo;s business in this way. We have gone a little overboard and have held things too tightly in our hand. This has become a limitation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Control Limiting Growth</h2>
<p>Let me give two examples of how control kills. During the 1940s, Honor Oak in London was a place of high spirituality. We read the books they published and received help from them for many years. In 1955 and 1957 I invited their leader to visit us, and in 1958 I accepted his invitation and visited London, where I stayed for four weeks. I saw many things during my stay there, one of which was that the leader, because of his high spiritual view, considered everyone unqualified. There were more than a hundred young people, all of whom were very capable. Not a few among them were college graduates. They were all under this leader and had been trained by him for many years. Eventually, they all wanted to go out to begin a work for the Lord, but the leader considered them unqualified and substandard. He held all of them in his hand and kept them in his own &ldquo;pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day all these young ones invited me to a picnic. A few of the leading ones among them asked me a question: &ldquo;Brother Lee, we have been trained and perfected here for so many years. Our goal is based on one burden, which is that we would go out to work for the Lord. But we are forbidden again and again to do this. What should we do?&rdquo; Their question put me on the cross. I tried to follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading within and spoke something inoffensive that would not upset the situation.</p>
<p>My point is that we must be very clear that control and restriction only drag down the church and the saints. The more control there is, the more stunted the growth is, and the more our numbers dwindle. Before long, only a few will remain. That brother was at one time greatly used by the Lord, but before he passed away, the church and the saints were almost choked to death. In 1965, only seven years after my visit, all the young people who fellowshipped with me that day were dispersed. They drifted away as a result of that kind of control. This shows that as long as there is &ldquo;birth control,&rdquo; there is no possibility of multiplication.</p>
<p>A second example is the Brethren assembly in my hometown of Chefoo. Almost the next day after I was saved, the Lord brought me to a Brethren assembly. The leader in that assembly was an old British brother by the name of Mr. Burnett. From his youth he was taught at the feet of Mr. Benjamin Newton, the famous Brethren teacher. Later he became a missionary of the China Inland Mission and went to Szechwan to preach the gospel. As time went on, he felt that the China Inland Mission was wrong because he had received light from the Brethren teaching. He quit his post and was led to Chefoo to begin a Brethren assembly there.</p>
<p>At that time this brother was sixty, and I was only twenty-one years old. At first, his ability to expound the Scripture attracted people to follow him, but all those gained by him were eventually killed by him in their spiritual function. The reason for this is that he exercised a tight control over them. He worked in Chefoo for a few decades without experiencing any growth or advancement, and his group remained a small assembly. I met with them for seven and a half years without seeing any growth year after year. In fact, the number dwindled year after year until eventually almost no one was left. I realized that there was a problem. The truths he expounded were high, but there was no advancement. It is a good thing that there were other denominations in the Shantung province which were preaching the gospel and contacting people. Otherwise, the gospel would have been squelched. When I saw that, I knew that there was something wrong with his way and that I could not take that way.</p>
<p>I mention these two examples to warn the elderly saints among us. I would like the senior co-workers among us to consider for a moment whether we have been behaving in the same way for the past twenty years. We have had a certain kind of spiritual standard. We preached spiritual messages concerning the cross and resurrection, and it is right for us to preach these things because they help us to meet God&rsquo;s standard. Yet these very practices deter us from letting go. We are afraid that once we let go, we will create problems, and the saints will fall into indulgence and become unspiritual, giving up the way of the cross, drifting from the path of life, and walking contrary to the leading of the church. The result of our way is that, on the one hand, our messages sound spiritual, yet on the other hand, we do not experience any growth or spread. This shows that there is a problem with our kind of spirituality.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 1: The Vision and Definite Steps for the Practice of the New Way &nbsp; pg 45</div><br></body></html>
