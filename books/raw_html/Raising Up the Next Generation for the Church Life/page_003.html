        <h2 class="head2 alignleft">Excerpts from the Ministry:</h2>
<p>The entire economy of God, and especially that in the New Testament age, is a matter of dispensing...Many matters are covered in the New Testament, but if we dive into the depth of the New Testament as the divine revelation, we will see that God surely has an economy, a household administration, to carry out His eternal purpose. This economy is just God&rsquo;s universal operation. If you would ask me what God is doing today, I would answer that God is operating in one thing and for one thing: He is spending much time to patiently dispense Himself into all His chosen people. Everything that is mentioned in the New Testament concerning God has to do with His dispensing for His economy. (<em>The Economy and Dispensing of God,</em> p. 70)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>What we have presented in this message concerning God&rsquo;s creation of man in the view of His divine dispensing according to His divine economy is what God desires. This is God&rsquo;s good pleasure, and this is our ministry, burden, and commission. We do not have any other burden besides this ministry of God&rsquo;s economy with His divine dispensing into humanity. We must learn to receive God&rsquo;s dispensing every day. He is dispensing Himself to us every moment and in every situation, even in the small things, for our renewal, transformation, and conformation. Eventually, we will be glorified. Then we will enjoy the consummation of His divine dispensing according to His divine economy. (<em>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation,</em> p. 76)</p>
<h2 class="head1">A PLAN MADE BY GOD<br />
ACCORDING TO HIS GOOD PLEASURE</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is a plan made by God according to His good pleasure. Concerning this, Ephesians 1:9 says, &ldquo;Making known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s good pleasure is the desire of His heart. This good pleasure was what God purposed in Himself for a dispensation, for a plan (v. 10). This plan made by God was according to His good pleasure, the desire of His heart.</p>
<p>We have seen that Ephesians 1:9 speaks of God&rsquo;s good pleasure. Everyone desires pleasure. If we desire pleasure, then certainly God does also. Every living thing desires pleasure. In fact, the more living you are, the more pleasure you need. Because God is the most living One, He surely needs the most pleasure. If we, as fallen sinners, require pleasure, then how much more does God, the living One, have a deep need for it?</p>
<p>Unlike the book of Romans, which begins from the perspective of the condition of fallen man, the book of Ephesians was written from the perspective of God&rsquo;s good pleasure, the desire of His heart. What, then, is God&rsquo;s good pleasure? God&rsquo;s good pleasure is to dispense Himself into us. This is the unique desire of God. We may say that God is &ldquo;dreaming&rdquo; of dispensing Himself into us. His longing, His aspiration, is to dispense Himself into His chosen people. (<em>The Conclusion of the New Testament,</em> pp. 15, 16)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>Romans 9:21 discloses God&rsquo;s purpose in creating man. This verse is unique in its revelation of God&rsquo;s purpose in the creation of man. Without this verse it would be difficult for us to realize that God&rsquo;s purpose in creating man was to make him His vessel to contain Him. We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that we are God&rsquo;s containers and that He is our content.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s selection in His sovereign mercy has a goal, and this goal is to have many vessels to contain God and express Him eternally. God created us in such a way that we are able to take Him into us and contain Him as our life and life supply, to the end that we may be one with Him to express what He is and that He may be glorified in us and with us. This is God&rsquo;s goal in His selection and in His creation of man. (<em>The Conclusion of the New Testament,</em> p. 1187)</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&mdash;THE CENTER OF GOD&rsquo;S PLAN</h2>
<p>Our God, who is full of wisdom, has a plan, and the entire universe was created according to His purpose, His will, His plan. We must know what God&rsquo;s eternal plan is...Man&rsquo;s position, man&rsquo;s place, in God&rsquo;s plan is very central. It is absolutely right to say that the Bible is a book full of Christ, yet we can also say that the Bible is a book full of men. Even God Himself became a man (John 1:1, 14). Jesus is the complete God and the perfect man. Even after His resurrection and ascension, He is still a man. Before Stephen was stoned, he said that he saw &ldquo;the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God&rdquo; (Acts 7:56). Stephen saw the Lord Jesus as the Son of Man in the heavens. Man is the center of God&rsquo;s plan. A bicycle wheel may have a hub with many spokes. The hub and the spokes subsist in the wheel. If the hub, the center, is taken away, the spokes will collapse. In like manner, without man as the center, God&rsquo;s plan would collapse. (<em>A Young Man in God&rsquo;s Plan,</em> p. 7)</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEARING THE APPEARANCE OF A MAN</h2>
<p>The main point of Ezekiel 1:5 is that the four living creatures bear the appearance of a man. Verse 26 says that &ldquo;upon the likeness of the throne was One in appearance like a man, above it.&rdquo; <em>Man</em> is a great word in the Bible. God&rsquo;s intention is with man, God&rsquo;s thought is focused on man, and God&rsquo;s heart is set upon man. God&rsquo;s desire is to gain man. The fact that four living creatures bear the appearance of a man and that God on the throne also bears the appearance of a man indicates that God&rsquo;s central thought and His arrangement are related to man.</p>
<p>Many Christians have been influenced by the concept that it is better to be an angel than to be a man. If you had a choice, which would you prefer to be&mdash;an angel or a man? Perhaps many of us would prefer to be an angel. However, God has enough angels, but He is short of men. God does not appreciate angels so much. The angels are His servants. God tells them to go, and they go; He tells them to come, and they come. The angels are also our servants (Heb. 1:13-14). As believers we all have our own angel (Acts 12:12-15). We need to drop the concept that it is better to be an angel than a man. We need to see how glorious and how marvelous it is that we are men. (<em>Life-study of Ezekiel,</em> pp. 47, 48)</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
