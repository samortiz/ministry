   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. The Parable of Two Sons</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the Lord Jesus had dealt with the chief priests and elders in such a wise manner, He gave them a parable about a man who had two children vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>28-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The man told the first child to work in the vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At first the child refused, but later he regretted it and went.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The man told the second child to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But after saying that he would go, he eventually did not go.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus then asked His hearers which of the two did the will of the father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When they said the first, the Lord said to them, Truly I say to you, that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God before you v. 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Luke 15:1-2, 11-32, the Lord likened the leaders of Judaism to the firstborn son, and the tax collectors and sinners to the second son; but here the Lord likened them in the opposite order.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that the Jews were the firstborn of God Exo 4:22 , having the birthright, but due to their unbelief the birthright was shifted to the church, which has become God s firstborn Heb 12:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the Lord s word here implies a shifting of the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In God s economy the birthright was taken from Israel and given to another people, a people composed of saved sinners and tax collectors.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that the birthright of God has been transferred from Israel to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 32 says, For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him; and you, when you saw it, did not later regret it so as to believe him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord seemed to be saying, You chief priests and elders are the second sons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Apparently you obey God, but actually you disobey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the eyes of God, the sinners, tax collectors, and prostitutes are much better than you, because they received the preaching of John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because they received John s way of righteousness, they will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but you will be shut out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that the birthright was taken from Israel and given to the saved, repentant, and forgiven sinners who constitute the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 32 speaks of the way of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Gospel of Matthew, as the book on the kingdom, stresses the matter of righteousness, for the kingdom life is one of strict righteousness, after which we must seek 5:20, 6; 6:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John the Baptist came in the way of such righteousness, and the Lord Jesus was willing to be baptized by John to fulfill such righteousness 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>F. The Parable of the Vineyard 1.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A Householder Planting a Vineyard</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>and Leasing It to Husbandmen</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verses 33 through 46 the Lord continues with another parable concerning the transfer of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 33 says, There was a man, a householder, who planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower, and leased it out to husbandmen, and went into another country.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The householder is God, the vineyard is the city of Jerusalem Isa 5:1 , and the husbandmen are the leaders of the Israelites 21:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Householder Sending His Slaves</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Again and Again to Receive Fruits,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>but the Husbandmen Flogging and Killing Them</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the householder sent his slaves to the husbandmen to receive his fruits, the husbandmen flogged them and killed them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>34-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These slaves were the prophets sent by God 2 Chron 24:19; 36:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The flogging, killing, and stoning mentioned in verse 35 were the persecutions suffered by the Old Testament prophets Jer 37:15; Neh 9:26; 2 Chron 24:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Householder Later Sending His Son</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>but the Husbandmen Casting Him Out</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>of the Vineyard and Killing Him</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Later, the householder sent his son.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The son, of course, was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the husbandmen saw the son, they said, This is the heir; come, let us kill him and possess his inheritance v. 38 . This word indicates that the Jewish leaders were jealous of Christ s rights and wanted to maintain their false position.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him v. 39 . This refers to Christ s being killed outside the city of Jerusalem Heb 13:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Householder Destroying</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>the Evil Husbandmen and Leasing</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>the Vineyard to Other Husbandmen</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verses 40 and 41 say, When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those husbandmen?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They say to Him, He will miserably destroy those evil men, and will leave the vineyard to other husbandmen, who will render the fruits to him in their seasons.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verse 41 was fulfilled when the Roman prince, Titus, and his army destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The other husbandmen spoken of in this verse were the Apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ as the Cornerstone</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rejected by the Jewish Builders</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In verse 42 the Lord Jesus says, Have you never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the cornerstone; this was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The stone here is Christ for God s building Isa 28:16; Zech 3:9; 1 Pet 2:4 , and the builders are the Jewish leaders, who were supposed to work on God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this verse the Lord said that the stone rejected by the builders has become the cornerstone Gk., the head of the corner .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ is not only the foundation stone Isa 28:16 and the topstone Zech 4:7 , but also the cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Kingdom of God Having Been Taken</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>from the Jews and Given to the Church</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Verse 43 says, Therefore I say to you that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing the fruits of it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The kingdom of God was already there with the Israelites, whereas the kingdom of the heavens had only drawn near 3:2; 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This proves that the kingdom of the heavens is different from the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this verse the Lord says that the kingdom of God will be given to another nation, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>7.</S>
