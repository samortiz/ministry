   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>NOVEMBER 21, 1949 CHAPTER ONE A TALK WITH CO-WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>FROM HONG KONG AND CANTON 1 Date:Monday evening, August 29, 1949</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Place:Canton CONCERNING FEELINGS Learning Not to Go Along with</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Too Many Feelings</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Chou Kang-Yao: I am very conscious of myself when I stand on the platform, and I am not able to overcome this feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Watchman Nee: We have to learn to deny living according to feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our feelings may be right some of the time, but in essence they are deceptive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not look for truth among deceptions, because we can never find it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Satan can speak some truths, but we have to reject everything that comes from his mouth because in essence he is a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even when he speaks the truth, he speaks it for the purpose of deceiving others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to calm down our feelings completely.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This requires the breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The spirit is surrounded by the soul, just as a hand is surrounded by a glove.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A glove must be empty before a hand can get into it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a glove has something in it, how can it receive a hand?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Similarly, if our mind, emotion, and will are filled with thoughts, feelings, and opinions instead of being empty and available, when the spirit needs to use them, it will find itself bound.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Under such circumstances, it is hard to have right judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to have right judgments, we need to "let this mind be in us , which was also in Christ Jesus" Phil 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means to have the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can only improve in judgment when we take the mind of Christ as our own.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to improve our utterance, we have to be enlightened within.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our inner being has to shine with light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only then will our judgments be accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We treasure accurate judgments, but such judgments come from practice, not from gift.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the foot is wearing the shoe, the foot will feel very comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if the shoe is "wearing" the foot, no one can take a step forward.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The shoe must fit the foot; no one can trim the foot to fit the shoe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If feelings are improper, the spirit cannot be free, because the spirit will be bound by the feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather than being directed by the spirit, the soul will be directing the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Feelings Must Match God's Light</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Lo Yi-xin: Since the work started in Canton, I have felt quite useless within myself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I cannot do anything, and I do not know how to begin any work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, I am afraid of making mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the other hand, I am afraid of being counted as unfaithful in my responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I feel that I need a mentor, a teacher to guide me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am willing to learn and follow.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Watchman Nee: Your feelings should be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Your condition is different from Brother Chou's. He has too many feelings and should learn to deny them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You do not have enough feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although you have some feelings, they are not strong enough.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our feelings should match the light we receive from God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once we realize that we are truly weak, we will be conscious of our real impotence.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the Lord grants us a little light concerning what we are, we will receive great profit; this profit will be more than what we could learn by ourselves in twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What we really need is light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If light increases, we will see our weakness in a clearer perspective.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We will be humbled to such an extent that no weakness will be a barrier to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we have not learned our lessons well enough, our feeling of weakness can be a hindrance to us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But once our weakness breaks out and spreads like leprosy, then we are healed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When our feeling of weakness is light, it is a hindrance to us; we feel that we can still do something and that there is still something about which we can boast.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the feeling of weakness overwhelms us, however, this feeling will no longer constitute a hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God's power is manifested when we are down to our weakest point.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Actually, not many people understand Paul's experience in 2 Corinthians 12:9.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Psalm 4:1 says, "You made room for me when I was in straits."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The feeling of weakness must reach a stringent point before we find "room" being made for us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It takes at least three to five years, perhaps even eight to ten years, before we can understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We cannot be impatient.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God has to bring us to the valley of weakness before we can be brought to a spacious land.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What is death?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is being weak to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We can know about the crucifixion with Christ without knowing the meaning of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In such a case, crucifixion with Christ is merely a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is no such thing as knowing death without knowing the meaning of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You can go on the same way as you have in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You do not have to ask the Lord to make you stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the contrary, you should ask the Lord to increase your feeling of weakness so that you can be brought to a spacious place.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May God show you not only your powerlessness but His gracious power as well.</S>
