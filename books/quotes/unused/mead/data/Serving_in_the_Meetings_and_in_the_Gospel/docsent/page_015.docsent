   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Our Cooperation Bringing In</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Lord s Anointing with His Presence</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Recently the meeting for the Lord s table among us has very much improved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is this because the brothers and sisters love the Lord more than they did a few months ago or they have more ability and stature of spirituality?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No, it is due mostly to our learning and training.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The brothers and sisters to some degree have learned the technique for the Lord s table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Along with the improvement there has been the anointing with the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the past we did not have the anointing with the Lord s presence as much as we now do because we did not have much training and cooperation to meet the Lord s need.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more cooperation we afford the Lord, the more He grants us His anointing with His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more we are ready, the more the Lord will do through us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore in the matter of bringing people to the Lord, we need the technique and training.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>FIVE MAIN CATEGORIES OF PERSONS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After we have the burden for someone, pray for him, and receive the anointing and the power from on high, what shall we do with him?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to deal with a person, we must know how to categorize or classify him, just like a fisherman knows the categories of fish.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a fisherman classifies his fish, he will know what kind of bait to use.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A certain bait may be good for one kind of fish, but to use the wrong bait will scare the fish away.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we classify people, we will know what they need.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To properly classify people, we must have the right technique.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We would not be so foolish as to ask someone what kind of person he is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, we can classify people by contacting them in a general way through conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should be general and not make a display to them that we are religious, spiritual, or heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>People do not like to talk to angels or religious persons; this scares them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, we must talk to people in a general, human way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then by our general talk, we must learn to realize what kind of person each one is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the past I have given more than twenty classifications of people, but here it is sufficient to give only five main categories.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first is a so-called atheist, someone who does not believe that there is a God in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is easy to find out if a person is an atheist.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The second category is people who are sinful and living in sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These also are easy to know.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The third classification is people who sense the vanity of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They always have the sense that life is vain, a vanity of vanities.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fourth classification is moral people, people who always pay attention to morality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The last classification includes professing Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we know these classifications, it is easy to realize what category a person belongs to.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we will know how to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Dealing with Atheists</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In principle, the best way to contact an atheist for the gospel is never to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, we must touch his feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Atheists are strong in their mentality, but regardless of how strong people are in their mind, they have a certain amount of feeling concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In their mind there is no God, and in their mouth there is no God, but in their heart there is a feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should realize that many times when an atheist is saying there is no God, an inner voice within him is saying, Suppose there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What would you do?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is an inner voice and an inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we must learn not to argue with their mentality but strike their feeling in a nice way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After touching their feeling, we should touch their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even atheists have a conscience, and in their conscience there is the consciousness that they are wrong in certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the ground for us to take to speak something that they may be convinced not from without but from within.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A person is a human, not a lower animal like a bird or the cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Within man in God s creation there are certain things according to God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even if we do not have the words to express or explain it, we realize that within our human nature there is something that senses there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot explain this, but we sense it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A young man may be able to boldly say that there is no God, but the older he becomes, the more weakly he will say this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When he comes to the verge of death, he will have no more boldness to say there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is because the inner sense created by God within our nature becomes stronger and stronger as we grow older.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The older we become, the stronger this inner sense is.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is no argument against this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Someone may say to us that he still does not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, we can tell him that within him is something that believes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This may cause him to not sleep for the whole night.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this way we pave the way for the Holy Spirit to work in him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sometimes a strong person can say that for many years he was not convinced, but this inner voice was always speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Eventually, such a person will be convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is no need to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Rather, we should learn to touch people s feeling and conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the principle of speaking with an atheist.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we practice this, we will see that it works.</S>
