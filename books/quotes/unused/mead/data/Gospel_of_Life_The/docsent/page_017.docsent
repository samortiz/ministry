   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER 16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1 These things I have spoken to you so that you would not be stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>2 They will put you out of the synagogues; but an hour is coming for every one who kills you to think that he is offering service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>3 And these things they will do because they have not known the Father nor Me. 4 But these things I have spoken to you that when their hour comes you may remember them, that I told you of them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now these things I have not said to you from the beginning, because I was with you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Work of the Spirit Consummating in the Mingling of Divinity with Humanity 16:5-33</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>5 But now I am going to Him who sent Me; and none of you asks Me, Where are You going?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>6 But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>7 But I tell you the truth, It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>8 And when He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment: 9 Concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me; 10 And concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you no longer behold Me; 11 And concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>12 I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>13 But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>14 He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>15 All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>16 A little while and you no longer behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me. 17 Some of His disciples then said to one another, What is this that He says to us, A little while and you do not behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me; and, Because I am going to the Father? 18 Therefore they said, What is this that He says, A little while? We do not know what He is talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>19 Jesus knew that they wanted to ask Him and He said to them, Are you inquiring among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while and you do not behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>20 Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>21 A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow because her hour has come; but when she brings forth the little child, she no longer remembers the affliction because of the joy that a man has been born into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>22 Therefore you also now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one takes your joy away from you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>23 And in that day you will ask Me nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Truly, truly, I say to you, Whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give to you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>24 Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask and you shall receive, that your joy may be made full.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>25 These things I have spoken to you in parables; an hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in parables, but I will report to you plainly concerning the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>26 In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father concerning you, 27 For the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>28 I came forth out from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and am going to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>29 His disciples said, Behold, now You are speaking plainly and not saying any parable.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>30 Now we know that You know all things and have no need that anyone ask You; by this we believe that You came forth from God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>31 Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>32 Behold, an hour is coming, and has come, that you will be scattered each to his own place and will leave Me alone; yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me. 33 These things I have spoken to you that in Me you may have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the world you have affliction, but take courage; Ihave overcome the world.</S>
