   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God not only created the heavens and the earth but also moved in all these steps.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But most Christians today in reading the Bible do not care for these mysterious, invisible steps of God's move in man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why we have the burden to see how God moved in taking so many steps in Christ in humanity.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ was the one grain of wheat containing the divine life within His human shell.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One day He was killed and that killing on the cross broke His human shell to release the divine life within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This released divine life produced many grains by dispensing the divine life into His believers John 12:24 .</S>
