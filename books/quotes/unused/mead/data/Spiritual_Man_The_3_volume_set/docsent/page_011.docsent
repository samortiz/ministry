   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I have a few words to say particularly about the last section.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It seems that I am not worthy to write it because of the weakness of my body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But precisely because my weakness, sickness, and sufferings are more than others', I can write about them in more detail.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many times I did not have the boldness to write.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But thank the Lord that eventually I wrote it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I hope that those whose experience with their earthly tabernacle is similar to mine will accept what I have written and take it as light from a brother who has seen light in his darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Of course, believers today have many contentions about the matter of divine healing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A book such as this one on the teaching of principles should indeed not engage in any debate with the brothers and sisters concerning the fine points.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have said what I wanted to say.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>My request now is that in our sickness we should differentiate between the things that come from ourselves and the things that come from God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As to the rest, I do not like to say too much.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I confess that this book has many deficiencies.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, I have done my best.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have offered to you my best.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I know how solemn the consequence of releasing this book is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For that reason, I have no other prayer except that, in fear and trembling, I would ask God to bring us through all the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now that the book is completed, I would commend what I have written to the conscience of God's children and leave it up to them to discern and to judge.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I know that such a book that exposes the enemy's tactics will surely stir up the hatred of the power of darkness and will subsequently raise up much opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But my purpose in writing this book is not to please men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, none of these things will affect me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I also know that some of God's remnant will be helped by this book and will consider me more highly than I should be considered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May I say this to these ones: I am a man only and a very weak one indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The teachings in this book can testify to my experience of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now this book is in the hand of the readers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you have the courage and the patience to go on after reading Section One, God will perhaps bless you with the truth contained in it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you read through the whole book, I would advise you to read it one more time after a while.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Dear friends, at this point, while you are reading these lines, may we lift up our heads to our Father, and may we come to Him once again in faith, casting ourselves into His bosom and receiving from Him His life once more.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May we confess anew that we are nothing and that with Him is the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have nothing, and He has all.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Unless He gives, and unless He graces us and fills us, we remain helpless sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us praise Him with a heart of thanksgiving for the grace that the Lord Jesus has bestowed on us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>O holy Father, what You have entrusted to me is now here.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If You see fit, bless it!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But may You preserve Your children in this end time and deliver them from the corrupted flesh and the wicked evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Father, build up the Body of Your Son, destroy the enemy of Your Son, and hasten the coming of His kingdom!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Father God, I look to You!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I trust in You!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I long for You!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I trust in You!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The author</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Shanghai, June 25, 1928</S>
