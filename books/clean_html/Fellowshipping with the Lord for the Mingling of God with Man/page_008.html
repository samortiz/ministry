<h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP AND THE MINGLING<br />
OF GOD WITH MAN</h1>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP BEING TO LET GOD&rsquo;S LIFE<br />
FLOW THROUGH US AND BE MINGLED WITH US</h2>
<p>The proper meaning of being used by God is to be a channel for the life of God to flow into us and then flow out of us. Since we are not lifeless pipes, when the divine life flows through us, it is also mingled with us. Fellowship is to allow God not only to flow through us but also to mingle with us. Some believers teach that a Christian must pursue to arrive at the stage of having nothing of his own life and nature but only having God&rsquo;s life and nature. This teaching seems to be very spiritual, but it is not accurate. Genuine spirituality does not mean that our human life ceases to exist but that God&rsquo;s life is mingled with our human life. It is not that we lose our human nature but that God&rsquo;s nature is mingled with our redeemed humanity.</p>
<p>When Peter wrote his Epistles, he was filled with the life of God. However, it is obvious that Peter did not lose his life, nor was his life replaced by the divine life. Rather, the divine life was mingled with his human life. Although Peter expressed the divine life, this expression had the flavor of his humanity. Similarly, Paul was also full of the divine life, but the divine life expressed through Paul also possessed his human flavor. The early believers were filled with the divine life, but what they expressed was distinct. What they expressed contained the element of their life and nature. This is genuine spirituality.</p>
<p>Genuine spirituality does not mean that the human life is exchanged for the divine life. Genuine spirituality means that God is mingled with man, such that the human life does not exist alone nor does the divine life exist alone. Strictly speaking, our fellowship with God, in which He flows into us and flows out of us, is not merely a matter of His flowing through us but of His mingling with us. In this mingling, God is constituted into us. In this mingling, the human element is not annulled or abolished. The human element continues to exist, but it is mingled with God. As a result of this mingling, man becomes a hybrid, possessing two natures and two lives. On the one hand, it is God who lives, but on the other hand, it is man who lives. Do not think that those who fellowship with God and allow Him to flow through them do not have thoughts, emotions, intentions, preferences, or inclinations. They still possess the function of their mind, emotion, and will, but the element of God is mingled with them. The element of God is mingled in their thoughts, feelings, and decisions. As a result, God is manifested through their mind, emotion, and will.</p>
<p>To say that a person gives up his human life in exchange for the divine life is an erroneous concept. On the contrary, every person who fellowships with God becomes living and active. His will becomes strong, his emotion becomes fervent, his mind becomes sober, and he becomes living, energetic, and full of activity. Then not only does he afford God an adequate, sound, and living coordination, but he also has continual fellowship with God. Nevertheless, his thoughts, will, preferences, opinions, and inclinations are not independent. His thoughts are dependent on God and are mingled with God&rsquo;s thoughts, and his emotions are also mingled with God&rsquo;s emotions. Everything that he wills and does is the result of God being mingled with him. Therefore, his thinking is God&rsquo;s thinking, and his speaking is God&rsquo;s speaking.</p>
<p>According to this view, all the Epistles are God&rsquo;s words. It does not matter whether they were written by Paul, Peter, or John; they are God&rsquo;s words. It is difficult for unbelievers to accept the view that the words written by Paul are God&rsquo;s words. If we understand what it means to fellowship with God, however, we will know why the words of the apostles are God&rsquo;s words. The apostles had such a deep mingling with God that their speaking was His speaking in them, their preferences were His preferences, and their move was His moving within them. This corresponds to Philippians 1:20-21, which says, &ldquo;As always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body...For to me, to live is Christ.&rdquo; These verses mean that it is not only Christ living but Christ living in me. This is also what Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh...&rdquo; The first part of this verse says, &ldquo;It is no longer I,&rdquo; but the next part says, &ldquo;I now live.&rdquo; This is genuine spiritual living. It is not that we lose our human element but that our human element is mingled with the divine element; our whole being is filled with God&rsquo;s element. Such a person expresses the flavor of God. When he speaks, others sense that God is speaking. When he gives his view, others sense that it is the mind of God. Even when he is angry, others sense God&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<p>It is not a matter of being a water pipe through which God as the living water flows, because there is no relationship between a pipe and the water flowing through it. Genuine spirituality means that the human nature is mingled with the divine nature. God was mingled with Paul. As a result, on the one hand, Paul&rsquo;s Epistles bear Paul&rsquo;s flavor, but on the other hand, they are the words of God. This situation differs from the way that the prophets spoke in the Old Testament. The Old Testament prophets spoke because God&rsquo;s words came to them. Hence, their tone was God&rsquo;s, not theirs. The prophets in the Old Testament often said, &ldquo;Jehovah says,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Thus says Jehovah.&rdquo; The situation in the New Testament Epistles is completely different. Apart from the seven epistles in Revelation, the Epistles do not bear the tone of the Lord&rsquo;s direct speech. On the contrary, Paul charged the believers (1 Cor. 7:10; 11:17), and Peter entreated them (1 Pet. 2:11; 5:1). The book of Romans is the Word of God and is inspired by the Holy Spirit. However, in this book Paul says, &ldquo;I exhort you...through the compassions of God&rdquo; (12:1), and &ldquo;I say&rdquo; (15:8). In his Epistles, John says, &ldquo;We report also to you,&rdquo; and &ldquo;These things we write&rdquo; (1 John 1:3-4). Even though these were John&rsquo;s words, they were recorded in the New Testament. Even though these words were spoken by the apostles, they are God&rsquo;s words because God was mingled with the apostles. For this reason, when the apostles spoke, God spoke through them. The apostles were God-men. This is spirituality.</p>
