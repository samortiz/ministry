   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, within the one Body you cannot make any division.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To make the churches autonomous is like making the members of your body into different autonomies.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Could any part of Christ's Body be autonomous?</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1 Cor 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since Christ cannot be divided, how could the Body of Christ as the one new man be divided?</S>
