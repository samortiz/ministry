   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE THE GROWTH IN LIFE 14 THE PRINCIPLE OF INCARNATION FOR THE CHRISTIAN LIFE The Christian Life Being in the Principle of Incarnation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Christian life is a life in the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because many Christians have not seen the principle of incarnation, there have been many debates concerning the nature of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some have said that the Christian life is an exchanged life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This understanding of the Christian life, however, is not correct.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As Christians we have a dual nature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are no longer merely men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before the incarnation of Jesus, the New Testament had not come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The New Testament would not be possible without the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The incarnation of Jesus initiated and ushered in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we, the New Testament believers, are wonderful persons who have God in us and have been made one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How glorious it is to be one with God, to be a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's Speaking in the Principle of Incarnation</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Old Testament, when the prophets prophesied for God, their prophecies many times began with, "The word of the Lord came unto me" Jer 1:4; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>3:16; Isa 38:4 or "Thus saith the Lord" Isa 7:7; Jer 2:2; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates that the Lord was separate from the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word of Jehovah came objectively upon the speakers, and they declared that it was not their word but the Lord's. However, in 1 Corinthians 7:25 Paul said, "Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as having received mercy of the Lord to be faithful;" and in giving his opinion he said, "But I think that I also have the Spirit of God" 7:40 . Paul indicated that what he spoke was not a word from the Lord; it was his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet in the giving of his opinion was the speaking of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God lived in Paul and spoke in Paul's speaking, even in his opinion, because God had become one with Paul and had made Paul one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>While we are speaking, it is not only we but Christ, the embodiment of God, who speaks with us and speaks in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hebrews 1:1-2a says, "In many portions and in many ways, God, having spoken of old to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, the book of Hebrews was written anonymously.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this book the Old Testament is quoted without mentioning the names of the speakers 1:5-13; 2:6-8a; 3:7-11; 4:3-5; 8:8-12; 10:5-7, 15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the other hand, Hebrews is the speaking of God in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hebrews 3:7 says, "Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit says," and 10:15 says, "And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The speaker in Hebrews is not merely Paul, the Psalmist, or Jeremiah, but the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The entire New Testament, from Matthew to Revelation, is God's speaking in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the four Gospels God spoke in the Son, and in Acts through Revelation God continued to speak in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the four Gospels He spoke through Jesus Christ, but in Acts through Revelation the outward form of His speaking changed, and He spoke in the Son through the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The speaking of the apostles was the Son's speaking because the apostles had become one with the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ is the firstborn Son of God, and we are the many sons of God Rom 8:29; Heb 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God has many sons, and the many sons have been incorporated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Firstborn plus the many sons are the collective, corporate Son.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this reason, God's speaking through the apostles is referred to as God's speaking in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Lord Jesus as the Spirit spoke through Peter, that was God speaking in the Son because Peter was one with the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul wrote more than Peter, having received the commission to complete the word of God concerning His mystery in His economy Col 1:25-26 , but Revelation, the conclusion of the holy Word, was written by John.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, the entire New Testament is the speaking of the processed God in the person of the Son Heb 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, the Son is not the Son alone, but the Son with all His members.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are the members of the Body of Christ, and the Body is composed of all the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God begot many children to become His sons, and these sons are the components of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we are the members of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today God is still speaking in the corporate Son in the principle of incarnation.</S>
