   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Even so, before the New Jerusalem comes into being, we need to seek a new experience of life every month.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The particular experience we had twenty years ago is no longer fresh, nor can it be of any help to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Neither can the experience of five years ago be fresh or of any profit to us now.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We cannot live by the fruit of the tree of life from former months.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Each month we must continue to have fresh fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before God we must receive life continuously; we must receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not only do we need fruit each month, we need a different kind of fruit each month.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot be satisfied before God only having a little portion, a certain part.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must learn to know the Lord in many aspects; we must bear all manner of fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 2 continues, "And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Fruit represents life; leaves, the clothing of the tree, represent our external behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus cursed the fig tree because it only had leaves; there was no fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It only had the outward behavior without the inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the new heaven and new earth, the people of the nations will have no sin, no death, no pain, no curse, nor any demons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This group of people, the nations, will continue living in the earth with the holy city in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Being healed by the leaves of the Lord Jesus means that the deeds of the Lord Jesus will be their example.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We will obtain the fruits of the tree of life, and they will obtain the leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By following the behavior of the Lord Jesus, they will be able to live on in well-being; and this way the nations will dwell together in peace and blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In these verses the street, the river of water of life, and the tree of life are all linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the New Jerusalem, wherever you find the street, you will find the river of water of life, and wherever you find the river of water of life, you will find the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, wherever there is activity, there will be the river of life and the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that as we learn to follow the Lord, all our conduct should include the river of water of life and the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then everything will be well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The street is a place for people to move about.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to move about we need to have all of our activities based upon the tree of life, not upon the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the life within us generates the activity, the result will be the outflow of the river of the water of life in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The outflowing of life is our street, our way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the life of the Lord Jesus is not moving in us, we simply cannot walk.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If there is not the life of the Lord and if there is not the outflow of the river of water of life in the Spirit, we cannot move.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If, according to our own wisdom, we judge whether a certain way to act is good or bad, we are planting the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, not the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if we act according to the moving of the life within, the result will be that the water of life will flow out to others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All of these things are linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All of God's work is based upon the tree of life and results in the river of water of life.</S>
