   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After Andrew Murray, Jessie Penn-Lewis was raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>She received help from Andrew Murray and became very prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She stressed the subjective death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Her message was not on the objective cross but on the subjective cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some portions concerning the cross in Brother Watchman Nee's book The Spiritual Man mostly were translated from Mrs. Penn-Lewis's writings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Mrs. Penn-Lewis was also very strong in teaching concerning spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This teaching is in a book entitled War on the Saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The section in The Spiritual Man concerning spiritual warfare is fully a translation from this book.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, Mrs. Penn-Lewis was very famous in two things: in the subjective death of Christ and in the spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Following her, one of her co-workers by the name of T. Austin-Sparks was raised up by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He became prevailing in the teaching of the principles and life of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, Sister Penn-Lewis, in the first quarter of this century, emphasized the death of Christ, and Brother Austin-Sparks, in the second quarter of this century, emphasized the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both of them were strongly against Pentecostalism.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you read Brother Nee's The Spiritual Man carefully, you can realize that the writer of the section on spiritual warfare was a strong opposer of Pentecostalism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Mrs. Penn-Lewis considered Pentecostalism altogether as a demonic work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Austin-Sparks was also absolutely against Pentecostalism.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They were both against Pentecostalism, but they also were very strong in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brother Austin-Sparks would not recognize any meeting as a church meeting unless that meeting was initiated by long prayer for the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He told me that every local church should be established by the leading of the Spirit through much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because the Spirit is abstract and mysterious, many disregard and neglect the truth concerning the Spirit and the experience of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Southern Baptist denomination, the biggest and most fundamental denomination in the United States, discourages their preachers from speaking concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They stress the Word, not the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By this we can see that the bona fide, fundamental, real seekers of Christ all have problems related to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The divisive factor among the fundamental, spiritual, and seeking Christians is not mainly related to doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The divisive factor is nearly altogether due to the apprehension, comprehension, and realization of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are different concepts concerning the Spirit because the Spirit is so mysterious and deep.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is a mystery, God's mystery is Christ Col 2:2 , and Christ's mystery is the church Eph 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit is also a great mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If this message concerning the compound Spirit could be understood, comprehended, and apprehended by us, the problems concerning the Spirit would spontaneously be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to receive the fellowship in this chapter properly, we not only need to exercise our spirit but also need to exercise our sober mind.</S>
