   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Widow</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This widow was helpless.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word widow shows her isolated situation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The husband on whom she depended for her living was gone, and she had become a widow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a good representation of a Christian on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our Lord Jesus has ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As far as the flesh goes, Christians are helpless and are like widows.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The teaching of Matthew 5 tells us of the sufferings that Christians face on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are the weak and have no power to resist anyone; everywhere they go they are taken advantage of and ridiculed by others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Neither the Lord Jesus nor the apostles taught the believers to have great power or high position in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, they should be humble, despised, and persecuted everywhere by others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They cannot base their reasoning with others on justice or the law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the portion of the Christians; it is the way that the Lord has prepared for them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the Son of God was crucified without opposing or murmuring, why should His disciples expect to receive better treatment?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, this widow is a true representation of the Christians in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Opponent</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The widow had an opponent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We Christians also have our opponent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This opponent is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The meaning of the word Satan is adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>An adversary is an opponent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Peter 5:8 says, "Your adversary, the devil."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The devil is our adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must clearly identify who our adversary is before we can know how to come to our Judge, God, to accuse him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How the devil became our adversary is a long story.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Simply put, this hatred began from the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God said, "I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel" Gen 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is because of the devil's deceiving of the world that God put a hatred in his heart and also a hatred in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We know that the seed of the woman in Genesis refers to the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is forever at enmity with the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is what God has ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We who have believed in the Lord Jesus belong to His side.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As such, we cannot help but take His adversary as our adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the same time, the enemy of the Lord Jesus, Satan, will not let us go easily, with no opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He took the Lord Jesus as his enemy; hence, he has to take the disciples of the Lord Jesus as his enemies as well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who have not yet believed in the Lord Jesus are children of the devil John 8:44 , and naturally, he loves those who belong to him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But we have believed in the Lord Jesus and are joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because he hates the Lord Jesus, he hates us also.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This hatred grows deeper as the days go by.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Satan is strong and forceful, while we are isolated and helpless like the widow.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He oppresses us with his power, suppressing us and bringing great havoc upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the end, we are even wrongly accused by him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The word avenge speaks of much suffering which we must endure under him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to pay close attention to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even now, Christians are being wrongly accused by the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Unless this wrong is avenged, we will continually suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What a pity that many children of God are not even aware of their being wronged by Satan!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>SATAN AND THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As the opponent persecuted the widow, so the devil now persecutes the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We do not know how much we have suffered under him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Of course, Satan does not appear personally when he persecutes us; rather, he does all his works through men or things; he will never expose himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He pushes the world to the foreground, while behind the scenes he is secretly directing everything.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As he worked the first time in the form of a serpent, in the same way, in all of his subsequent work he comes in a disguised form.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is because he hides himself in this way that God's children misjudge the enemy, not realizing that he is their real opponent.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He causes the believers to be physically weak or to suffer pain and sickness Acts 10:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The believers may think that they have violated some law of hygiene or that they are exhausted, without realizing that it has been the devil's manipulation all the while!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Alas, countless numbers of believers have suffered at the hand of the devil in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sometimes he will persecute the believers through the world Rev 2:10 , attacking them through their immediate family, relatives, or the society.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The believers may think that it is man who is hating the Lord, without realizing that it is the devil who is stirring up everything behind the scenes.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sometimes he works through the environment, causing the believers to encounter dangers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sometimes he spreads misunderstandings among believers, separating the dearest of friends from one another and bringing them to tears.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Sometimes he cuts off the supply to the believers, bringing upon them all kinds of deprivation, even starvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes he will cause the believers to be depressed, restless, and aimless.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Sometimes he causes the believers to become lost and indecisive, losing control of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sometimes he puts an inexplicable fear within the heart of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Sometimes he exhausts the believers through their affairs and work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Sometimes he takes away the believers' sleep, causing them to be tired physically and mentally.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Sometimes he puts unclean thoughts in the believers' minds or injects confused thoughts into their brains, stripping them of any defense.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Sometimes he disguises himself in the form of an angel of light, deceiving the believers and leading them into the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>To exhaust his workings is beyond the scope of what we can do here.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In conclusion, everything that causes the believers to suffer, whether physically or spiritually, and everything that causes the believers to sin or suffer loss is a wile of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But although many children of God are taken advantage of by Satan, most do not realize that it is the working of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Sometimes they think that what happens is natural and accidental or that it is something done by man.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Little do they know that behind many natural phenomena, there exist many supernatural things.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Behind many so-called accidents, there is much scheming.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Within many dealings from men, we can see the plots of Satan.</S>
