   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Lesson Twenty-Two CHRIST AS THE ESSENTIAL AND ECONOMICAL SPIRIT Scripture Reading Jn.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>20:22; Acts 2:1-4; Rom 8:10-11; 2 Cor 13:5; 2 Tim 4:22;Jn.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>6:63; Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4-5, 8; Mark 16:15; 1 Cor 12:13.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Outline The inward content and the outward equipment The essential inward aspect Christ in us Christ as our life The content of the church The economical outward aspect The baptism of the Holy Spirit The propagation of Christ Our experience of both aspects of the Spirit Text</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ has passed through a marvelous process.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He has gone through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every item of that process was a further step in God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That economy is to produce the church as the Body of Christ the full, corporate expression of the Triune God and the mutual dwelling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we pointed out in the previous lesson, Christ, the Head in heaven, needs His Body on the earth to coordinate fully with Him in order to carry out His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot do anything without Him but neither can He do anything without our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The crucial element of this coordination is that Christ is now the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the Spirit, He can live in us and supply us inwardly; and at the same time He can empower us and work with us outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I. THE INWARD CONTENT</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>AND THE OUTWARD EQUIPMENT</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many Christians do not realize that on the day of resurrection the resurrected Christ came as the heavenly breath and breathed Himself into His disciples John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is one aspect of the formation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then, fifty days later on the day of Pentecost, the ascended Christ on the throne poured Himself out upon the disciples Acts 2:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is another aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The breathing out of the holy breath on the day of resurrection was for life, and the pouring out of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost was for power.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the day of resurrection there was the "pneuma."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That is the Greek word for "Spirit"; it also means "breath" or "air."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But on the day of Pentecost there was the mighty wind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Air is for life and wind is for power.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit of life, who is the resurrected Christ, is our content of life; the Spirit of power, poured out by the ascended Christ, is our outward equipment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, we have the inward content of life and the outward equipment of power.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first is essential and the second is economical.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are not two Spirits, but are two aspects of the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must be very clear about these two aspects of Christ as the Spirit.</S>
