<h2 class="head2">B. God&rsquo;s Promise</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s promise first was that no man would be able to stand before Joshua all the days of his life (v. 5a). Second, God&rsquo;s promise was that He would be with Joshua and would not fail him or forsake him (v. 5b). In verse 9c God said to Joshua, &ldquo;Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. God&rsquo;s Encouragement</h2>
<p>In verses 6 through 9 we have God&rsquo;s encouragement to Joshua.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. To Be Strong and Bold</h2>
<p>First, God encouraged Joshua to be strong and to be bold (vv. 6a, 7a, 9a). Joshua was to be bold not in himself but in the moving and operating God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Not to Be Afraid or Dismayed</h2>
<p>Next, God encouraged Joshua not to be afraid or dismayed (v. 9b).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Saying That Joshua<br />
Would Have Success Wherever He Went</h2>
<p>Furthermore, God told Joshua that he would have success wherever he went (vv. 7c, 8b).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. In the Term of Walking in the Word of God</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s encouragement to Joshua was in the term of Joshua&rsquo;s walking in the word of God. Joshua was not to turn away from the law given by Moses &ldquo;to the right or to the left&rdquo; (v. 7b). The book of the law was not to depart from his mouth, but he was to muse upon it day and night so that he would be certain to do according to all that was written in it (v. 8a). Joshua was to be occupied with God&rsquo;s word and to let the word occupy him. By being occupied and filled with the word, he would have prosperity and success in taking the good land.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. JOSHUA&rsquo;S CHARGE TO THE PEOPLE</h2>
<p>Verses 10 through 15 are Joshua&rsquo;s charge to the people to prepare provisions for their entering into the good land within three days.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. To All the People</h2>
<p>In verses 10 and 11 Joshua&rsquo;s charge was to all the people. They were to prepare provisions for themselves, for in three days they would be crossing the Jordan to enter and possess the land which Jehovah their God was giving them to possess.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. To the Two and a Half Tribes</h2>
<p>Joshua&rsquo;s charge in verses 12 through 15 was to the two and a half tribes&mdash;to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. Joshua reminded them of Moses&rsquo; word, saying that their wives, their little ones, and their livestock would remain in the land which Moses had given them, but that they themselves would cross over in battle array before their brothers and help them until Jehovah had given rest to them. This charge indicates that the possessing and enjoying of God&rsquo;s promised land was a corporate matter among all God&rsquo;s chosen people. The land could not be possessed by an individual nor by a single tribe. Rather, all the elect of God were required to rise up, fight for the land, and gain and possess the land, fighting for one another. Then everyone would be able to enter into his particular portion and be at rest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE PEOPLE&rsquo;S RESPONSE TO JOSHUA</h2>
<p>Verses 16 through 18 are the people&rsquo;s response to Joshua.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Willing to Carry Out Joshua&rsquo;s Charge</h2>
<p>The people answered Joshua, saying, &ldquo;All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. As in all things we listened to Moses, so we will listen to you&rdquo; (vv. 16-17a). This indicates that they were willing to carry out Joshua&rsquo;s charge.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Blessing Joshua</h2>
<p>The people also blessed Joshua, saying, &ldquo;Only may Jehovah your God be with you, as He was with Moses&rdquo; (v. 17b).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Encouraging Joshua</h2>
<p>Finally, the people responded to Joshua by encouraging him, saying to him, &ldquo;Be strong and be bold&rdquo; (v. 18b).</p>
<p>The children of Israel agreed with Joshua in taking God&rsquo;s commission. Their response implied their willingness, their readiness, and their being in one accord not only with Joshua but also with Jehovah their God as expressed by their blessing of Joshua in the name of their God. They were one with the Triune God in the great wheel of His economy for the purpose of gaining the good land.</p>
