   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The Relationship between the Anointing and the Applying of the Blood</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A very close relationship also exists between the anointing and applying the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The purpose of the anointing is to anoint God into us, that we may have fellowship with God and be mingled and united with God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, many areas of our being are incompatible with God, and many situations in our lives do not match God's righteousness, holiness, and glory; these make it impossible for God to mingle or unite with us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, there is the need to first apply the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The purpose of the blood is to cleanse all the areas which are incompatible with God, and to remove all the situations which do not match Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First we have the applying and cleansing of the blood; then God's holy ointment anoints us with God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, to experience the anointing we must first have the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The blood is the basis for the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The relationship between the anointing and the applying of the blood is also seen very clearly in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a priest intends to apply the ointment to a leper at the time of his cleansing, the blood must first be applied.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some of the ointment is placed "upon the blood," or "upon the place of the blood" Lev 14:14-18, 25-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a great sin against God if we should apply the ointment before the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because the ointment prefigures the Holy Spirit who came to mingle God with man, it must never be applied to one who has never been cleansed by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was necessary first to apply the blood, which would cleanse away all the filthiness and all the areas which are incompatible with God; then, the ointment, signifying God mingled with man, could be applied.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This principle remains unchanged in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have said that because 1 John speaks of the fellowship of life, it mentions the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But not only so, it also mentions the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, it mentions first the blood in chapter one, then the anointing in chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This also indicates that in order to have the fellowship of life, we need not only the anointing of the ointment, but also the cleansing of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, the blood comes before the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The blood is required to wash away all iniquity in order that the anointing may subsequently bring in the fellowship with God in life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, if we wish to experience the anointing, we must first experience the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we apply the blood and allow it to wash us continually, the more we will experience the anointing and feel the living presence and moving of God; thus, we will have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the anointing and the applying of the blood are also inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>KNOWING THE TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First John 2:27 says, "His anointing teacheth you concerning all things."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the teaching of the anointing, there is not only the teaching aspect, but also the anointing aspect; there is not only the teaching of the Holy Spirit, but also the moving of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The teaching does not come from the ointment or the Holy Spirit, but from the anointing of the ointment, or the moving of the Holy Spirit.</S>
