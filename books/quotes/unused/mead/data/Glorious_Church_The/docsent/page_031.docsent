   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The church according to God's will and the church in experience are two entirely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church in God's plan is completely without sin; it has never known sin, nor had any history of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is transcendent far above sin, without even a trace of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is altogether spiritual and wholly out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the church in history has failed and is fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today the Lord is working among fallen men to bring them back to the church of His original will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord desires to work among people who are fallen, corrupted, and desolate, full of sin and filthiness, so that He may obtain a church from among them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He intends to restore and recover them to what He purposed in eternity past, so that He might have that which fulfills His desire in eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In His magnificent work, the Lord is using the words He speaks as the instrument to bring the church back to God's original purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Oh, may we not lightly esteem the words of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must remember that knowledge is one thing and spiritual stature is quite another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All doctrine, teaching, theology, and knowledge are of little use if they just flow from one person to another.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>True growth depends upon our receiving the word directly from God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is using His rhema to do His work, and He desires to speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, if our purpose in reading the Scriptures is solely for knowledge, it is indeed pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If this is so, we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The real value of the Scriptures is that God can speak to man through them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we desire to be useful in the Lord's hands, we must be spoken to by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whether or not our building is spiritual depends upon whether the Lord has spoken to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Knowledge and doctrine are of no spiritual use.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only the Lord's speaking in us is of spiritual value.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How can we ever be satisfied with knowledge and doctrines while the church is in a fallen state, when she has failed God and is blind to His will?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>May God have mercy upon us and be gracious to us!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Oh, may we have such a prayer: "Lord, we pray that You would speak to us."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the words that are from without, all the words that are passed on to us by others, though they have been spoken a thousand or ten thousand times, are of no use.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only rhema is of any value.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do something just because others tell us to do it, we are keeping the law; we are not in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A person with a clear mind can divide the book of Romans into sections, such as "Salvation," "Justification," etc. But within him there is a great deficiency God has not spoken to him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A man may have knowledge and yet be without God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many people think that knowledge of the Scriptures and understanding of the doctrines are spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no such thing!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Bible knowledge can never be a substitute for spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only God's speaking to us, personally and directly, is of any real value.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When God speaks to us through His word, we are enlightened; through His word we are sanctified; and through His word we are made to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to know what is dead and what is living, what is mere knowledge and what is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whatever is not living has no spiritual value.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we have rhema, the living word of God, we can be cleansed and sanctified.</S>
