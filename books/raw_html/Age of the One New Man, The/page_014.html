        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEARNING TO BE USED<br />
BY THE LORD<br />
IN THE FLOW OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we considered the age of the one new man and how the co-workers should continue to go on in the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date way. Concerning where the co-workers should go, we do not want much arrangement. The co-workers should touch the Lord inwardly to find out the area that they should have a burden for and where they should go. This does not mean that the work cannot make arrangements; however, too much arrangement may not be of the Lord. Nor does this mean that the co-workers can act independently. Acting independently will not produce results.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THINGS THAT AFFECT THE FRUIT<br />
OF OUR WORK</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider a few things that affect the fruit of our work. Some people say that we cannot evaluate the fruit of our work until the Lord comes and that only the Lord&rsquo;s evaluation counts. This may sound good, but it is not practical. When we work for the Lord, we should pay attention to the fruit of our work, because the Lord said, &ldquo;Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for by the fruit the tree is known&rdquo; (Matt. 12:33). In order to know a tree, we must look at its fruit. Our main problem is not that we bear corrupt fruit but that we do not bear any fruit. Therefore, we cannot afford to neglect the matter of fruit. There are four things that negatively affect the fruit of our work. We need to be aware of these things.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Problem of Disposition</h2>
<p>The first thing that negatively affects the fruit of our work is our disposition. Our disposition can limit and even nullify the fruit of our work. Our disposition is a stubborn enemy. Every person has a different disposition. Some people have good dispositions; others have bad dispositions. For example, some people are sensitive. This is a bad disposition. A sensitive person is self-conscious. A person cannot be self-conscious if he is to accomplish anything. If we are self-conscious when we stand up to speak for the Lord, we will not be able to say anything. We must not be self-conscious when we preach the gospel. In other words, we should preach the gospel without caring about our feelings so that our speaking will be strong and our spirit will be released. A sensitive person considers many things before opening his mouth to speak; his sensitivity kills him. Sensitive brothers should learn not to care about their feelings or others&rsquo; comments but to care only for the burden. Then they will be able to subdue their sensitive disposition.</p>
<p>Another kind of disposition involves the tendency to point out others&rsquo; mistakes. This is not a simple matter. We need to minister life before we have any ground to point out others&rsquo; mistakes. If we point out someone&rsquo;s mistakes without ministering life, we will cause damage and accomplish nothing. A mother can rebuke her child because she gave birth to the child, raised the child, and taught the child. Even if she strongly disciplines him, the child will not leave. How can someone accept our pointing out of their mistakes if we have not begotten, nurtured, and taught him? If a co-worker goes to a local church and sees that the chairs are not properly arranged, he should not be concerned. His only concern should be to minister life. Only when we minister life can people be subdued. When they are subdued, we can point out mistakes. Then, even if they do not fully agree with us, they will not oppose, and they will eventually accept the correction.</p>
<p>Hence, the ability to point out people&rsquo;s mistakes depends on how much life we minister. If we minister much life and criticize little, there will be no problem. If we do not minister much life but criticize much, we will create problems. If we do not minister life, we will not be able to perfect. If we continually criticize others, they will eventually leave. People with such a disposition easily damage others. In order to perfect others, we must first minister life. If we cannot minister life, we should not speak about perfecting others, for there is no perfecting without ministering life. If someone makes a mistake, it is his concern, not ours; we do not have the ground to interfere. A mother can rebuke her child because she gave birth to the child, raised the child, and taught the child. She cannot rebuke children whom she sees on the street. There will be problems if she rebukes them.</p>
<p>The problem of disposition exists not only in the East but also in the West. Some American brothers who were under my leading lost their usefulness because of their disposition. There is an old Chinese saying: &ldquo;It is easier for rivers and mountains to change than for a person&rsquo;s nature to change.&rdquo; A person&rsquo;s nature is his disposition. Spiritually weighty people should have great value and function, but some are peculiar by disposition, and this negates their usefulness. A person&rsquo;s disposition affects his function. Everyone who desires to be used by the Lord must go against his disposition. Otherwise, he will not be useful. Our disposition can kill our function. Hence, we must stand against it. Not going against our disposition is the reason that we lose our function.</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
