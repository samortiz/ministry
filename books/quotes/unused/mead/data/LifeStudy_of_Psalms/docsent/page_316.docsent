   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Unless Jehovah builds the house,/Those who build it labor in vain./Unless Jehovah keeps the city,/The guard watches in vain" v. 1 . This is a comforting word, especially for the elders and for those who consider themselves guards protecting the church.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"It is vain for you to rise up early,/To lie down late,/To eat the bread of toil;/All the same, He gives to His beloved while they sleep" v. 2 . This indicates that if the Lord does not do anything for us, whatever we do will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead of toiling and striving in ourselves, we need to trust in Him, for He gives to His beloved even while they sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do you believe that what you do means something?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to realize that whatever we do without trusting in the Lord means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we realize this, we will rest in the Lord.</S>
