   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, this morning we ask You to give us a trance that transfers us from the visible circumstances into the invisible scene.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We want to see something that is invisible to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We want to see You.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We want to see Your Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We want to see Your economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We want to see Your doing and Your working to dispense Yourself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thank You, Lord Jesus; thank You, God the Father; thank You, the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thank You that You all are working within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Especially in these days, we are enjoying Your intensified presence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Give us a trance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>RECEIVING A TRANCE TO SEE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE INTRINSIC VIEW OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to see something more than the physical universe created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this universe there are two scenes, two views.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One scene, one view, is visible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can see the visible universe with the heaven, the earth, the sun, the moon, and millions of items.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the Bible shows that behind this visible scene, there is a scene which is altogether invisible to our senses.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Old Testament book of Daniel shows us these two scenes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the one hand, the Greeks were fighting against the Persians, and the Persians were resisting the Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That was seen by everybody with their physical eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But behind that scene were the prince of Persia and the prince of Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Daniel 10 records the fighting in the unseen world between Michael, the prince of Israel, and the evil princes of Persia and Greece vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>10-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is an example of the two scenes in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the New Testament Jesus came.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was altogether visible for people to see.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One night a ruler of the Jews named Nicodemus came to see Him and said to Him, "Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher, for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him" John 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the things which Nicodemus spoke about were in the visible realm.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the Lord Jesus answered him by telling him that he needed to be born anew to see the kingdom of God v. 3 . He told Nicodemus that he needed regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time on earth, no one understood what regeneration was.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nicodemus did not understand because he was in the visible realm.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He asked, "How can a man be born when he is old?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born, can he?" v. 4 . The Lord spoke of regeneration in the invisible realm, but Nicodemus tried to understand it in the visible realm.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The divine revelation in the holy Word, especially in the New Testament, speaks altogether of invisible things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the things which we have covered from Ephesians 1 3 are invisible to our eyes, invisible to our natural understanding, invisible to our natural realization, and invisible to all of our physical senses.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many readers of the Bible understand it merely according to the letter in the visible realm, but they never see anything invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ephesians is a book mainly on invisible things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Ephesians 5 Paul charges the husbands to love their wives v. 25 , and he charges the wives to submit themselves to their husbands vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>22, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you think such a word is concerning something visible or invisible?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Humanly speaking, everybody knows what this means.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A husband's love and a wife's submission are visible to our senses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But what the apostle speaks of here is altogether invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The apostle's teaching of submission is absolutely different from the teaching of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Confucius also taught submission, even a threefold submission.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, what Confucius taught is something visible, but what the apostle taught is something invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why is it invisible?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is invisible because the submission taught by the apostle Paul is not a natural submission.</S>
