 <h2 class="head2">B. The New Testament</h2>
<p>[The Gospel of Matthew was written by Matthew. He was originally a tax collector, and his origin was not honorable. The Lord called him to be one of the twelve apostles. His Gospel was probably written in Judea.</p>
<p>The Gospel of Mark was written by Mark. He was a very ordinary disciple. His Gospel was probably written in Rome.</p>
<p>The Gospel of Luke was written by Luke. He was a Gentile doctor. His Gospel was probably written in a Gentile land.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John was written by John. John was a fisherman in Galilee and was not well educated. But he was also called by the Lord to be one of the twelve apostles. His Gospel was probably written in a Gentile land.</p>
<p>The Acts of the Apostles was also written by Luke, the doctor. This book was probably also written in a Gentile land.</p>
<p>The fourteen books from Romans to Hebrews were written by Paul. He was originally zealous for Judaism and was also a very learned person. He had capability, ability, and capacity and could accomplish things. He was specially called by the Lord early in life to become an apostle to the Gentile people. His books were all written in the Gentile lands, and some were written in a Roman jail.</p>
<p>The Epistle of James was written by James. He was the flesh brother of the Lord Jesus (Gal. 1:19) and was a devout Christian who became a pillar of the church (2:9), but he was rather full of Judaism from his background. His book was probably written in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The first and second Epistles of Peter were written by Peter. Peter was also a fisherman without much education, but he was called by the Lord to become the first of the twelve apostles. His book was probably written in a Gentile land.</p>
<p>The first, second, and third Epistles of John were all written by the apostle John. These three books should have been written in a Gentile land.</p>
<p>The book of Jude was written by Jude. He was also a flesh brother of the Lord. He could have written this book in Judea.</p>
<p>The book of Revelation was also written by the apostle John. It was written in a Gentile land and probably on the island of Patmos.</p>
<p>Hence, there were eight authors of the New Testament. Among them, Paul was a Jewish scholar, and Luke was a Gentile physician. They were the only two who had received a high education. The rest were all common people and without much education.</p>
<p>The number of authors of the whole Bible was more than forty, and most of them were Jews. Luke was one who was a Gentile. This indicates that among the authors there were Jews and Gentiles, kings and common people, scribes and soldiers, scholars and uneducated ones. Some were in high places, and some were very lowly; some were rich, and some were poor. There were all kinds of people. As to the places where the books were written, some were written in the wilderness; some, in a palace; some, on an island; and some, in jail.]</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE TIMES WHEN THE BIBLE WAS WRITTEN</h2>
<p>[The first few books in the Old Testament, the Pentateuch of Moses, were written about 1500 B.C. The last book, Malachi, was written about 400 B.C. Therefore, all thirty-nine books in the Old Testament were completed within eleven hundred years .</p>
<p>Matthew, the first book in the New Testament, was written between A.D. 37 and 40. Revelation, the last book, was written between A.D. 94 and 96. Therefore, the whole New Testament was finished within fifty or so years. Hence, the whole Bible spans about 1500 to 1600 years from beginning to end, from Genesis to Revelation.]</p>
