        <h2 class="head2">Fellowshipping over the Ground of the Church</h2>
<p>We talked over the course of a week. The last time we talked, he took me to a large house with a quiet room upstairs. This time I began to speak first, and I asked, &ldquo;Brother, when you go out to work, do you hope that people would be helped by your ministry?&rdquo; When he said, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;After they receive your help, where should they go?&rdquo; When he did not reply, I asked, &ldquo;If they cannot go someplace, how can they meet together?&rdquo; He still did not reply. Then I asked, &ldquo;Brother, can the light and the vision that we have seen concerning the Body of Christ be practiced in the denominations?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo; Then I asked, &ldquo;If it cannot be practiced in the denominations, where can it be practiced?&rdquo; He had no answer. Since I was shortly about to leave, I was quite burdened that he would face the consequences of his thinking.</p>
<p>Then he said, &ldquo;Brother, please do not think that I do not care for the church. I care for the church, but the church must be one hundred percent out of the Spirit; it must be a work done by the Spirit in order for it to be absolutely of the Spirit.&rdquo; This was a serious matter to him, so I responded, &ldquo;Brother, you have been in our midst twice. You have visited Taiwan from north to south, and you have seen over fifty churches among us. Is it possible that all these churches are of the flesh, having nothing of the Spirit?&rdquo; He could not reply, because he had testified in Taiwan that he had never seen believers as good as the ones in Taiwan in his entire life of ministry and preaching. When he returned to the West, he even showed people pictures and spoke highly of the situation in Taiwan. At this point, he knew that there was no way I could change, and I knew that he would not repent. At the end of our talk, we both were clear concerning the position of the other, and we stopped discussing the matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Touching God&rsquo;s Government<br />
by Opposing the Ground of the Church</h2>
<p>In 1964 a group of people in Manila, together with dissenters in Taiwan, invited Brother T. Austin-Sparks to the Far East. He went to the Philippines for four weeks and then planned to come to Taipei. A group in Singapore, who coordinated with the group in Manila, also invited him to speak in Singapore. The dissenters thought that when he came to Taiwan, they would have a great victory, and the church would be finished. They also believed that this would happen when he went to Singapore.</p>
<p>Concerning this situation, the responsible brothers in Taiwan could only cry out to the Lord and pray. Then a telegram came from London for Brother Sparks, saying that his only son, a healthy man about forty years old, had passed away suddenly. He immediately returned, and the potential for turmoil was quickly diffused in Taiwan.</p>
<p>I do not like to speak about such tragic matters, but Brother T. Austin-Sparks told me himself that the flow within him stopped when he left Hong Kong in 1957. According to my personal observation, his high ministry began to decline at this point, and it declined rapidly. I even told the brothers that I was very worried for him, because in his opposition to the ground of the church, he was touching the government of God. If the ground of the church was something only of our doing, it would not matter how much he opposed it. However, if the ground of the church is according to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in this age, it is a tremendous matter. Brother Austin-Sparks did not err morally or in his deeds, but he opposed God governmentally. This is a severe and serious thing. We can see in the decade following the turmoil in Taiwan that there has been no blessing upon the opposers or their work. Instead, there have been repeated divisions among themselves.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STANDING ON THE GROUND AND LIVING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>It is the Lord&rsquo;s mercy that we are standing on the ground today, but we should not think that standing on the ground alone is sufficient to be the Lord&rsquo;s living testimony. We must still have content, which is related to the spirit. If we lack the spirit, there will be disputes even if we are standing on the ground. If we have truly seen the ground and have learned the lessons associated with it, the ground will prevent us from being divided when there are disputes. The ground is the means for the Lord&rsquo;s preservation, but if we continue to dispute because of a lack of the spirit, the Lord will have no way to truly go on.</p>
<p>Thus, we need to practice living in the spirit with the Lord. The leading ones should help the brothers and sisters live in the spirit with the Lord. If the co-workers and elders are not one and in the spirit, our testimony before the Lord is finished. For example, one elder may advocate a practice related to prayer, another to silent prayer only, and still another to a practice related to being broken. All these ideas may be good, but if a local church receives three different opinions from three different elders, there will be no leading in one accord. I am worried that in some places the condition of the church is even lower due to the assertion of natural authority in the flesh. These kinds of situations cause us to lose our testimony before the Lord. Even if we stand on the ground, Satan will mock us, saying, &ldquo;What are you doing on the ground? You are acting in the flesh. You are on the ground of oneness, but you still love the world. Moreover, you also covet men&rsquo;s appreciation, and you hope to gain their support.&rdquo; God knows these things, Satan knows these things, and we know these things. How can we bring the brothers and sisters into living in the spirit with the Lord under such conditions? It is impossible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FLEEING INTO THE SPIRIT TO BE ONE<br />
AND TO BRING IN THE LORD&rsquo;S BLESSING</h2>
<p>If such conditions are not uprooted from our midst, I am not optimistic about the way ahead of us. The ground is right and even precious, but the content of our testimony on the ground is a serious matter. We must go before the Lord and humble ourselves and say, &ldquo;Lord, cleanse me; cause me to repent for all these things.&rdquo; Now we can understand why Paul spoke of fleeing for refuge in Hebrews 6:18. We need to flee indeed; we need to flee from our prejudices, our feelings, our earthly element, our uncleanness, and even our spiritual cultivation and accomplishments. If we do not flee such things, it will not be possible for us to be one with the brothers. Being in such a position is dangerous.</p>
<p>By birth, each of us has his own personality and disposition. How is it possible for us to be one? We must flee within the veil into our spirit. We can be one only in the spirit. When we are in the spirit, there is no insistence on our part for anything related to our natural inclinations. In fact, we do not even have any natural inclinations.</p>
<p>I hope that every brother will go before the Lord and let the Lord thoroughly shine upon him. We may be standing on the ground of oneness, but do we want something else, something other than the spirit? If we bring in other things, we will cause damage. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we may flee from these things into our spirit to live within the veil. Once we are within the veil, the life that we live will be the life of the Body of Christ. In every locality we should not only lead the church outwardly but also have a living testimony of the Body in spirit. The Body of Christ is in the spirit, and if the brothers are in spirit, the reality of the Body of Christ will be manifested. We must be in spirit and follow our spirit in our leading of the church. If we do this, God, who is the living Spirit, will confirm and bless our work with His presence among us.</p>
<p>Without this, there can only be different opinions and different proposals on how to lead the church because one brother will feel to do one thing, and another brother will feel to do something different. If we take this way, we will destroy ourselves. Even if we are able to show some self-restraint outwardly, Satan will know that we are not in the spirit and thus not one inwardly. This will surely cause us to lose the Lord&rsquo;s presence and blessing. May the Lord have mercy on us. We need a thorough turn to the spirit so that we all may be one. Then we will be victorious in one spirit. This is what the Lord wants today. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
