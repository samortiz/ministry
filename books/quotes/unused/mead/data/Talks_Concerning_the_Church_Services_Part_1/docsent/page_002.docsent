   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REVEALED IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The so-called new way the Lord has shown us in the past four and a half years is a way that is fully revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not really new.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But to us it is a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, I prefer to term it the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is something ordained by God, and is neither invented nor produced by human thought.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the end of the first century after the Apostle John passed away, the church lost its direction.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From the second century the lovers of the Lord Jesus and His Word studied the New Testament and as a result saw something but not in full.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In every century there have been these lovers of the Lord and lovers of the Word groping to find the right way to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This kind of groping was needed because the New Testament was written in the way of life, not in the way of religious regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Old Testament was likewise not written in the way of religious regulation but was rather written by God s revelation in different ages through different channels.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The entire Old Testament from the first five books written through Moses to the last book of Malachi was written for revelation, not for regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, in the five books of Moses God gave a clear record indicating how the priests in the Old Testament should serve.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From the priesthood and the priests in the priesthood one could learn how to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not one point was left for anyone s decision.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For any detail you had to refer to Moses writing, the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You had to find out what was regulated by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the New Testament, however, it is difficult to find such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, for close to sixty years I have tried to find verses concerning the matter of Christian meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You may not find one right away; then you may find a verse in Matthew 18.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 20 says, For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there I am in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may consider that this is part of the way to have a Christian meeting, or from another angle you may not.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You can thus see it is difficult to find the way to meet in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Similarly, consider the matter of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Preaching the gospel is there in the New Testament, but it is difficult to say what the right way is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The New Testament tells us in full, but you need to spend much time to find the way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then you will find some part in Matthew, some part in Luke, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, through the centuries there have been some new discoveries.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, in each century something of human invention, human concept, and human ideas was added to what was discovered in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example the Presbyterians discovered the presbytery but added something to it, and the Baptists discovered baptism by immersion but added something to it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a result, what has come to us through today s Christianity is a kind of a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through the centuries there have also been some lovers of the Lord who knew the Bible better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They therefore dropped many things which were added or brought in through human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For instance, the Brethren dropped a lot and came out of the mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet even they did not get into the full understanding of the biblical way ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As I have often mentioned, we followed them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the beginning under Brother Nee s teaching, at least eighty percent of our practice was a copy of the British Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was the reason some of the missionaries called us the Chinese edition of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ten years later Brother Nee began to see more from the Bible which did not justify some of the things of the Brethren practice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He therefore published a short four chapter book in 1934 entitled The Assembly Life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Three years later, in 1937, he spoke the messages contained in The Normal Christian Church Life, published the subsequent year in Chinese and later in English.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brother Nee received further visions from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For example, in The Normal Christian Church Life he wrote concerning the meeting of mutuality in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This chapter, which is particularly on the church meeting, indicates that when the whole church comes together, each should share something, one by one, in the way of mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This matter is still not properly practiced among us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Ten years later, in 1948, Brother Nee again stressed these things in his training and in the book Church Affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Brother Nee saw something, but it was difficult to find a way to carry it out.</S>
