<p>According to the type of the tabernacle, we experience the work of Christ and what He has accomplished for us in the outer court. Then we enter into the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies where we experience Christ Himself as everything to us. We experience Christ as the supply of life, the light of life, the resurrection, and the all-inclusive One so that He may be wrought into us.<p>In this way we become the material for the building up of the church. In the Spirit of regeneration and the Spirit of maturity, signified by the golden rings and the golden bars that unite the boards of the tabernacle, we will be united, combined, and built up together as a home, as one. This is the Body of Christ and the dwelling place of God. The building up of the church is a matter of growth. Christ is wrought into us gradually and progressively as everything so that we may grow in Christ, by Christ, and with Christ. Then in the Spirit of regeneration and the Spirit of maturity we become the material fitly framed and united together as a whole. This oneness is the Body of Christ and the dwelling place of God, the church. We have to keep our human hands away from this building of the divine life.<p>We also need to realize that regardless of how much Christ has been wrought into us, we can only be good enough to be the boards. We cannot be the covering of the tabernacle. If we were the covering, the church would be the expression of us. Only Christ can be the covering, so the church is the expression of only Christ Himself. The roof of the tabernacle is of four layers of covering. Each layer is an aspect of Christ, and the entire covering as a roof is the full revelation of Christ. Christ is the only covering, so the whole tabernacle is an expression of Christ. It is only when Christ is the expression that He will be our covering.<p>All the utensils, furniture, and boards of the tabernacle were also protected by the covering. Thus, the covering is both the protection and expression of the tabernacle. If we do not have Christ as our expression, we do not have His protection. If we expect Christ to protect the church, we must have Him as our expression. Some groups of believers are covered by certain doctrines or gifts. Thus, these doctrines or gifts become their “roof,” their expression. They are not under the covering of Christ Himself, so there is no real protection. No doctrine or gift can protect us. Only Christ can protect us. We must uplift Christ, exalt Christ, and express Christ as the only roof covering us. We are under the roof of Christ Himself.<p>The measurements of the tabernacle show that the covering as the roof also covers the sides of the tabernacle. Thus, from the outside, nothing can be seen except the covering. The boards and the contents of the tabernacle cannot be seen from the outside. This means that when people look at the local church from without, they must see Christ and only Christ. Then when people come into the church, they should see the mingling of Christ with human beings. Whenever people contact us, they should have the realization that there is something of Christ within us. From without people should see nothing but Christ. From within people should see nothing but Christ wrought into human beings. This is the real church life.<p>Without the picture and pattern of the tabernacle, we could not be so clear about what the church life should be. We need this picture in addition to the definition of the church in Paul’s Epistles. A child needs both a picture and a definition to receive a thorough understanding. If you want him to understand what a cat is, you must not only give him the word cat but also show him a picture of a cat. When we look at the picture of the tabernacle, we can understand what the real building of the church is. The church is not produced by human organization or formed by human endeavor. The church is the issue of Christ being wrought into a group of people, and all of these people uplift Christ, exalt Christ, and put on Christ to cover them and protect them.
