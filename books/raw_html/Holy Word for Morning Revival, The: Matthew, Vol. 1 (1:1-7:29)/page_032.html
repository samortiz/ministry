<p class="bold">WEEK 5 — DAY 3</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 6:19-24, 31, 33</h2><p class="bold">19 &nbsp;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth.…</p><p class="bold">20 &nbsp;But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven.…</p><p class="bold">21 &nbsp;For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p><p>22 &nbsp;The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is <sup>1</sup>single, your whole body will be full of light;</p><p>23 &nbsp;But if your eye is <sup>1</sup>evil, your whole body will be dark. If then the <sup>2</sup>light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!</p> <p>24 &nbsp;No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and <sup>1</sup>mammon.</p><p>31 &nbsp;Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?</p><p class="bold">33 &nbsp;But seek first His <sup>1</sup>kingdom and His <sup>1</sup>righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The fifth section of the King’s decree, 6:19-34…concerns the material riches of the kingdom people.…To store up treasures in heaven is to give material things to the poor (19:21) and to care for the needy saints (Acts 2:45; 4:34-35; 11:29; Rom. 15:26) and the Lord’s servants (Phil. 4:16-17).</p><p>Apparently [in vv. 19-34] the Lord is speaking about the dealing of the kingdom people with material riches. Actually, He is dealing with the matter of anxiety.</p><p>In ancient times, the children of Israel had to labor by tilling the ground, sowing the seed, watering, and harvesting. This was their duty. But whether or not they received the harvest depended upon God. Their responsibility was to labor without having any anxiety. Boaz, a forefather of David, is an example of one who did his duty without anxiety. Boaz was a rich farmer; he was very productive. However, this man was not productive for the sake of anxiety, but for the sake of fulfilling his duty. When the time came, the Lord told him to give a certain amount away, and he did it.…Through the overcoming of anxiety, he laid up treasures in heaven.</p><p>Your duty is to give, to lay up treasures in heaven. Do not aspire to be a millionaire.…Rather, learn to give and…transfer your treasure from the earth to the heavens.…Be a good giver according to the life and nature of your heavenly Father. (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 271, 273, 277-279)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>22<sup>1</sup> Our two eyes can focus on only one thing at a time.…If we store up our treasure both in heaven and on earth, our spiritual vision will be blurred. For our vision to be single, we must store up our treasure in one place.</p><p>23<sup>1</sup> To look at two objects at the same time, not focusing on one object alone, is to make our eye evil (cf. 20:15; Deut. 15:9; Prov. 28:22). In such a case, our whole body will be dark.</p><p>23<sup>2</sup> If our heart is fixed on treasure laid up on earth, the light that is in us will become darkness, and great will be the darkness.</p><p>24<sup>1</sup> An Aramaic word signifying wealth, riches. Mammon stands in opposition to God, indicating that wealth, or riches, is the opponent of God, robbing God’s people of their service to Him.</p><p>33<sup>1</sup> The Father’s kingdom is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today, the reality of the church life today, and will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the coming age. The Father’s righteousness is the righteousness expressed by the keeping of the new law of the kingdom, as mentioned in 5:20. This righteousness is Christ, who is lived out by the kingdom people. Since the kingdom people seek first the kingdom and the righteousness of their heavenly Father, no only will His kingdom and His righteousness be given to them, but also all that they need will be added to them.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 271-281; Hymns: #445, #442</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
