<h2 class="head2">On Seeing the Body</h2><p>A piece of glass may hold a little bit of water, but it can never hold the equivalent of a cup of water. Every Christian has received some grace, but individual Christians are not the whole. Even if they receive much grace, they can only be considered big pieces of glass. They are still two-dimensional; they are not three-dimensional. Today individuals have to be set aside. What the Lord wants is not individual pieces of broken glass, but a whole cup. God's principle is for one to chase a thousand, and two to chase ten thousand (Deut. 32:30). Today the church is filled with individuals. But wherever there are two persons who are one, they can drive out ten thousand, eight thousand of which they gain as extra profit. God wants to see the church preaching the gospel, the church teaching the truth, and the church making the money. Everything is placed in the church. Seeing the Body is one kind of salvation. This salvation is stronger and richer than the first salvation that an individual receives. Once a person has been touched by the Lord, he can no longer say that he can be an individual Christian. We need to allow God to work in us. A man develops the Body-consciousness not through thinking or deduction. Once the self is dealt with, the Body- consciousness is manifested. On the one hand, you will see that you are the Body. On the other hand, you will see that you are also a member. When a man sees individualism as a sin, he will submit to God. Once a man sees the Body, nothing will be difficult. When a man sees the Body, it will not be difficult for him to love others. When a man sees the Body, it will not be difficult for him to live by faith or to receive answers to prayers. In the Lord's work, if a man has not seen the Body, he cannot do anything. Hence, many things today hinge on seeing the Body truth.</p><h2 class="head2">To Be Obedient, to Be Taught,<br />and to Not Assume Headship</h2><p>A person has a problem with Body-consciousness because he has a problem concerning individualism. In order for a brother to become submissive, first his own ideas must go. My hands have been listening to my head for forty-five years; they never express their own ideas. They always keep their place. This is why there is no problem with my body. If my heart tries to set up another head, my body will argue with itself from morning until night. To remove our individualism, we have to tear down our own head. We have to learn to speak as one who is taught, to think as one who is taught, and to act as one who is taught. Submission is the simplest thing there is. It is difficult for a person to submit alone. But when there are many people around, it will become easy to submit. In order to submit to one another, there is the need for everyone to be dealt with.</p><p>Coordination does not come through human thoughts and opinions. If our physical body can have such a wonderful coordination, how much more wonderful should the coordination in the Body of Christ be? We believe that when Christ's spiritual Body is coordinated together, what we see will be even better and more beautiful, and its result will far exceed what we think.</p>
