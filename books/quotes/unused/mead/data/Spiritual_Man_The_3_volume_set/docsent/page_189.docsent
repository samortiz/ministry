   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FURTHER DANGERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the life of walking according to the spirit, spiritual believers should be aware of other dangers besides the disguise of Satan and his various attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many times our own soul, for reasons of its own without the counterfeiting of the evil spirit , initiates a certain feeling to prompt us to act.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A believer must know that his body has feelings, his soul has feelings, and his spirit also has feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not all feelings are from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, it is extremely important not to mistake the feelings from the soul or the body for the intuition of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In his daily experience, a believer must learn what really is his intuition and what is not.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is easy for a believer, after realizing the importance of following the intuition, to forget that other parts of his being besides his spirit have feelings, and thus he falls into error.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A genuine spiritual living is not as difficult as some would think; in fact, it is rather simple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, it is also not as easy as some may consider because it also has complex areas.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here are two difficulties: first, we mistake other feelings as the intuition of the spirit; second, we misunderstand the meaning of the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such difficulties are often encountered in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the teachings of the Bible not verses randomly picked are crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To prove whether the stirring within us and our intended actions are from the Holy Spirit, we need to check if this matter agrees with the teachings of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is impossible for the Holy Spirit to inspire the prophets to write the Scriptures in one way, and then move in us in another way today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is impossible that what the Holy Spirit has forbidden to others would be permissible to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The intuition in our spirit must be confirmed by the teachings of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By simply following the intuition and not the Bible, one will definitely go wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The revelation of the Holy Spirit sensed in our spirit perfectly matches the revelation of the Holy Spirit in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our flesh likes to exercise its power everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we must be watchful of its incursions even while we are following the teachings of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We know that the Bible completely reveals the mind of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we think that if we absolutely follow the Bible, we surely must be in accordance with the desire of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not so!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many times a believer can use his own natural mental ability to search the doctrines of the Bible and, having understood, can determine to act accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this situation, there is the danger of comprehending and executing through the fleshly power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although what was understood and carried out is completely according to the Bible, there was absolutely no reliance on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, it was totally in the realm of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not only should the intent of the Holy Spirit, as understood in our spirit, be confirmed by the Bible, but even the Scriptures, as understood by us, should be executed through the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should realize that even in the matter of following the Bible, the flesh desires to be first!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The spirit has not only the intuition but also the power.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the doctrines that we understand in our minds are not executed through the power of the spirit, they have no spiritual value at all.</S>
