With this message we begin the life-study of Proverbs.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE TITLE</H2><P>Proverbs in Hebrew is mishle, meaning "similitudes, proverbs, parables," to represent general truths.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE WRITERS</H2><P>Proverbs is a collection of the words of the wise. The main writers and collectors are Solomon, who wrote three thousand proverbs (1 Kings 4:32; cf. Eccl. 12:9), and Hezekiah, who added some proverbs of the forefathers in chapters twenty-five through twenty-nine.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE TIME</H2><P>The time of the writing of this book was about 1000 B.C. Whereas Solomon's portion was written about 1000 B.C., Hezekiah's portion was written about three hundred years later.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE PLACE</H2><P>Proverbs probably was written in Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE THEME</H2><P>The theme of Proverbs is that this book consists of words of wisdom teaching people how to behave and how to build up their character in the human life. Humanly speaking, this is the great subject, and all religions and philosophies are concerned with it. The matters of behavior and the building up of character have been the subjects of teaching ever since humankind came into being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE POSITION OF PROVERBS<br>IN THE DIVINE REVELATION OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES</H2><P>Now we need to consider the position of Proverbs in the divine revelation of the Holy Scriptures.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Divine Revelation Being Progressive</H2><P>The divine revelation in the Holy Scriptures is progressive, from the creation of man in God's image in the first chapter of Genesis, through many processes in both the Old Testament and the New Testament, to the consummation of the New Jerusalem in the last two chapters of Revelation. Thousands of things are covered in the Bible. The first thing is God's creation of the heavens and the earth, and the last thing is the New Jerusalem. Between these two ends, the divine revelation goes along with the course of human history.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Difficult to Locate</H2><P>As Proverbs is a collection of the words of the wise of many centuries up to Hezekiah in the seventh century before Christ, it is difficult to locate it in the divine revelation of the Holy Scriptures.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. A Subsidiary to the Law</H2><P>Since the proverbs were collected mainly by two kings of Judah in the age of the law, the book of Proverbs may be considered a subsidiary to the law. The law is the portrait of God, demanding God's people to keep it that they might be made copies of God for His expression and glorification. Proverbs as a subsidiary to the law helps God's people to keep the law.</P><P>Because the law was written according to what God is, the law tells man how to behave and how to build up himself according to God's attributes. God is love and light, and God is holy and righteous. These are some of God's attributes. For God to create man in His own image means that God created man according to what He is, that is, according to His attributes. The law, which was written according to God's attributes, demands that man behave and build himself up according to God. Regarding this, Proverbs is a subsidiary part of the law, instructing people how to behave and how to build themselves up according to what God is. This helps us to see what the position of Proverbs probably is in the divine revelation in the Scriptures.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Sequence of the Five Books of Poetry</H2><P>The sequence of the five books of poetry&#151;Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs&#151;in their spiritual significances is excellent and sweet.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Job</H2><P>Job stresses that God wants man to seek and gain God solely without any other blessings and prosperity, and that God wants man to seek Him for his perfection and not for his integrity. From this we see that God wants man to seek the kind of perfection that is God Himself, not a perfection based on human uprightness and integrity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Psalms</H2><P>Psalms stresses man's seeking and contacting of God through his praises, prayers, and singing with exultation. The way to seek and contact God is to praise Him, to pray to Him, and to sing with exultation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Proverbs</H2><P>Proverbs stresses wisdom that man receives of God through his contacting of God and that teaches man how to behave in his human life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Ecclesiastes</H2><P>Ecclesiastes stresses the vanity of vanities of all the things under the sun, which is realized by man through the wisdom received from God. The things under the sun are vanity, but the things in the heavens are reality. If you have contacted God and have received wisdom of God, you will see that everything under the sun is a vanity, a chasing of the wind.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Song of Songs</H2><P>Song of Songs stresses that Christ is the song of songs, the satisfaction of satisfactions to human life that is versus the vanity of vanities of all the things under the sun. Only Christ is the satisfaction, becoming our song which we sing to Him because we are satisfied. A lover of Christ should be one who is attracted by His love and drawn by Him in His sweetness to pursue after Him for full satisfaction.</P><P>The book of Proverbs is a particular book among the books of the Bible. It has a particular character; that is, it presents to us the words of wisdom by many ancient wise men, which is unanimously considered good by all the people who read it. But whether it is really good or not depends upon what kind of reader you are.</P><P>If you are an ethical person with a strong mind and have a desire to be perfect as a genuine moral person, surely this book would help you to make a success in your pursuit of perfection. But it helps you to cultivate yourself, that is, to cultivate the human "bright virtue" created for man by God according to His attributes, that is, according to what He is. However, it does not help you to be a person who lives in his spirit according to the Spirit of God who dwells in you for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy, that is, to produce and build up the Body of Christ which consummates the New Jerusalem as God's heart's desire and ultimate goal. In the Old Testament Job was exactly such a person. He was satisfied with his integrity, with his pursuit of human perfection. But that was not what God wanted of him; rather it replaced what God wanted of him and then it became an enemy of God frustrating him, a man created by God to fulfill God's purpose. God's purpose in creating man is to have man be filled with Him to be His expression, not an expression of human perfection. So the success of Job in human perfection was torn down by God. In this tearing down by God, God tore down Job also. Job was perplexed, not knowing what to do. Then God came in to reveal Himself to Job, indicating that He Himself is what Job should pursue, gain, and express. Then Job had a big turn from pursuing human perfection to pursue God Himself.</P><P>If you are a person who is a law-keeper, surely you will appreciate all the proverbs in this book as words of wise men, thinking that they could help you to be a good or even better law-keeper. If so, you just make all the proverbs many, many laws and fall into the snare of keeping the law as many Jews do, who do not know God's purpose in the dispensation of His law, that is, to expose fallen man's weakness.</P><P>If you are a person who loves the Lord and pursues Christ, not self-perfection, and who loves the Lord's word in the entire Bible and reads it with a praying spirit, not for the seeking of the doctrine of letters but for seeking the Spirit and word of life, not to get any help for self-cultivation but for the nourishment of your spirit that you may live a Christian life which is perfect not in human virtues but in the divine virtues which are the expressions of the divine attributes, then this book will render you nuggets and gems to strengthen your life of pursuing Christ for the fulfillment of God's economy in producing and building up the Body of Christ.</P><P>Furthermore, God does not want us just to seek the knowledge, doctrine, truth, theology, and so-called revelation in letters. God wants us to seek after Him that we may gain Him and that He may fill us up with Himself for His expression. He is the Spirit and we worship Him and contact Him in our spirit. The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. The word spoken to us by the Lord should become the Spirit and the life to us (John 6:63). If we study the Bible by the way of letters, not by the way of the Spirit and of life, we make the Bible, regardless of what part, a book of letters. Most Christians today have made the New Testament of the Spirit and of life the Old Testament of letters. To Paul the apostle even the Old Testament was like the New Testament, of the Spirit and of life. Too many Christians have made the New Testament proverbs, precepts, exhortations, and instructions of letters. Our life-studies have made all of the Old Testament as the Word of God books of the Spirit and of life. By this we have to realize that what the book of Proverbs would be to us depends upon what kind of persons we are and by what way we take it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE SOUND ATTITUDE THE NEW TESTAMENT<br>BELIEVERS SHOULD HAVE TOWARD PROVERBS</H2><P>The next matter that we need to see is the sound attitude the New Testament believers should have toward Proverbs.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Believing That It Is a Part of the Holy Word</H2><P>As New Testament believers, we should believe that Proverbs is a part of the holy word in God's holy Scriptures.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Realizing That It Is the Breath of God</H2><P>We should realize that Proverbs is the breath of God for us to breathe in that we may receive the life supply from God (2 Tim. 3:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Reading It</H2><P>Next, we should read Proverbs by being filled with the fullness of God in our spirit (Eph. 5:18-19), in the New Testament Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), with our regenerated spirit, and by pray-reading to mingle it with spirit and life (cf. John 6:63).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE SECTIONS</H2><P>Proverbs has four sections: the collection of Solomon (chs. 1&#151;24), the collection of Hezekiah (chs. 25&#151;29), the word of Agur (ch. 30), and the word of King Lemuel (ch. 31).</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF PROVERBS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRINCIPLES<br>FOR MAN TO LIVE A PROPER HUMAN LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Prov. 1&#151;9; 31</H1><P>What the book of Proverbs is to us and what the entire Bible is to us depend on what kind of person we are. For the apostle Paul every book of the Old Testament was Spirit and life. But for many of today's Christians the Bible, including the New Testament, is mainly a book of proverbs. Such Christians do not understand a verse like Ephesians 3:8, which speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ for the producing of the church to fulfill God's economy. They may have no interest in these matters. However, they may be very interested in what Ephesians 5 says about husbands loving their wives and about wives submitting to their husbands. This illustrates the strong tendency among Christians to try to understand the New Testament according to their ethical mind. They are not interested in anything that cannot be understood in an ethical way. In particular, they do not understand the New Jerusalem and do not seek to understand it. From this we see that the kind of person we are determines what the Bible will be to us.</P><P>In this message we will consider from Proverbs the principles for man to live a proper human life. Each of these principles&#151;revering God, needing wisdom, honoring one's parents, and holding marriage in honor&#151;is a nugget.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. REVERING GOD</H2><P>The first principle for man to live a proper human life is revering God. We should not only worship God but also revere Him. To revere God is to consider and regard Him in everything, never forgetting that He is the wonderful God who has created us. When we are about to lose our temper, we should revere God. Revering God stops us from doing evil. Revering God also causes us to be touched by the sufferings of others and to show mercy and compassion to them.</P><P>Even though I was born into Christianity, before I believed in the Lord Jesus I never revered God. But from the day I got saved, I began to revere God. In everything I respected and regarded God. That caused a great change in my life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Fearing God</H2><P>To revere God is to fear God. The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge and wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding (1:7; 9:10; 15:33a). Knowledge, wisdom, and understanding come from God. If we fear Him, revering Him, these will be our possession. If we seek wisdom like silver and search for her like hidden treasures, then we will understand the fear of Jehovah and find the knowledge of God (2:4-5). The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil (8:13). The fear of Jehovah prolongs days, but the years of the wicked will be shortened (10:27). He who walks in his uprightness fears Jehovah, but he who is perverse in his ways despises Him (14:2). In the fear of Jehovah is strong confidence, and his children will have a place of refuge. The fear of Jehovah is a fountain of life, that one may turn aside from the snares of death (vv. 26-27). Better is a little with the fear of Jehovah, than great treasure and turmoil with it (15:16). If we are rich in the fear of Jehovah, we will have peace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Trusting in God</H2><P>To revere God is also to trust in Him. Proverbs 3:5-8 charges us to trust in Jehovah with all our heart and not to rely on our own understanding. In all our ways we should acknowledge Him, and He will make our paths straight. We should not be wise in our own eyes; we should fear Jehovah and depart from evil. This will be healing to our body and refreshment to our bones.</P><P>He who gives heed to the word will find good, and blessed is he who trusts in Jehovah (16:20). In my frequent travels by airplane, many times Satan has threatened me within by saying that my plane would crash. At those times I spoke to the Lord, saying, "Lord, I am not in a plane; I am in You. You are my plane." This is to trust in the Lord.</P><P>According to 3:26 Jehovah will be our confidence, and He will keep our foot from being caught. Every word of God is tried; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him. We should not add to His words, lest He reprove us and we be found a liar (30:5-6). We must not change His word by adding something to it according to our point of view. This is dangerous.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Honoring God</H2><P>To revere God means that we also honor God. Proverbs 3:9-10 says that we must honor Jehovah with our substance and with the firstfruits of all our produce. Then our barns will be filled with plenty, and our vats will burst open with new wine. If we make more money to lay up treasure for our future, that is pitiful. At least one tenth, the firstfruit, of our produce must be given to God. We should always be very generous in giving of the things which God has given us. This honors God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. NEEDING WISDOM</H2><P>The second principle, the second nugget, is needing wisdom. Notice that I do not say seeking wisdom but needing wisdom. We are always in need of the wisdom of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The One Who Finds Wisdom Being Blessed</H2><P>Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, for her profit is better than the profit of silver, and her income is better than gold. She is more precious than corals, and nothing we desire compares with her. Length of days is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her, and happy are those who hold her fast (3:13-18; 8:11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Not Letting Wisdom Depart from Our Sight</H2><P>We should not let wisdom depart from our sight, but we should keep sound wisdom and discretion. They will be life for our soul and a graceful ornament for our neck (3:21-22). The real beauty is wisdom and discretion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Wise Inheriting Honor</H2><P>The wise will inherit honor, but fools increase their own disgrace (v. 35).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Getting Wisdom and Not Forsaking Her</H2><P>We should get wisdom. We should not forsake her, and she will keep us; we should love her, and she will guard us (4:5-6). "The beginning of wisdom is this:/Get wisdom; and in all your getting, get understanding./Prize her highly, and she will exalt you;/She will honor you if you embrace her./She will give a garland of grace for your head;/A crown of beauty will she bestow on you" (vv. 7-9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Saying That Wisdom Is Our Sister</H2><P>According to 7:4 we should say to wisdom, "You are my sister."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Wisdom Having Built Her House</H2><P>Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out her seven pillars (9:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Personified Wisdom of God</H2><P>In certain portions of Proverbs the wisdom of God is personified. This personification of God's wisdom is the second of the Trinity, the Son of God. Christ is the personified wisdom of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Jehovah by Wisdom Founding the Earth</H2><P>Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; He established the heavens by understanding (3:19). This One by whom Jehovah founded the earth and established the heavens is Christ, who is the wisdom of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Jehovah Possessing Wisdom<br>in the Beginning of His Way</H2><P>In 8:22-31 personified wisdom says that Jehovah possessed her in the beginning of His way, before His works of old. Wisdom was set up from eternity, from the beginning, before the earth was. When there were no depths, wisdom was brought forth, when there were no fountains abounding with water. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, wisdom was brought forth; when He had not yet made the earth and the fields, nor the first dust of the world. When He established the heavens, wisdom was there; when He inscribed a circle upon the surface of the deep, when He made firm the skies above, when the fountains of the deep became strong, when He set for the sea its boundary, that the waters should not transgress His commandment, when He marked out the foundations of the earth; then wisdom was by Him, as a master workman. Wisdom was daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him, rejoicing in His habitable earth; and wisdom's delight was in the sons of men. Again, this personified wisdom refers to Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Wisdom Dwelling with Prudence</H2><P>In verses 12 through 21 we are told that wisdom dwells with prudence and finds knowledge and discretion. Counsel and sound wisdom are hers. Wisdom is understanding and has might. By wisdom kings reign, and rulers decree justice. By wisdom princes rule, and nobles&#151;all who judge righteously. Wisdom loves those who love her, and those who seek wisdom diligently will find her. Riches and honor are with wisdom, enduring wealth and righteousness. Wisdom's fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; and her yield than choice silver. Wisdom walks in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice, that wisdom may cause those who love her to inherit substance and that she may fill their treasuries. Once again, this personified wisdom signifies Christ. If we have Christ as wisdom, we have everything, including spiritual things and material things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Personified Wisdom of God<br>Being Christ as Its Reality</H2><P>In the New Testament the personified wisdom of God is Christ as its reality. First Corinthians 1:24 says, "To those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God." Verse 30 continues, "Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption." Christ became wisdom to us from God in three vital things in God's salvation: righteousness (for our past), by which we have been justified by God, that we might be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life (Rom. 5:18); sanctification (for our present), by which we are being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will, with the divine life (6:19, 22); and redemption (for our future), that is, the redemption of our body (8:23), by which we will be transfigured in our body with the divine life to have His glorious likeness (Phil. 3:21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. HONORING ONE'S PARENTS</H2><P>The third nugget, the third principle, is the honoring of one's parents. After God, we should respect our parents, having regard for them, honoring them, and obeying them. Honoring our parents will prolong our days.</P><P>Revering God and honoring one's parents are mentioned together in Proverbs. In the Ten Commandments the first four, concerning God, and the fifth, concerning honoring our parents, are on the first of the two tablets. This indicates that our parents are ranked with God. To honor our parents is to remember our source. Ultimately, if we trace back to our source, we will reach God. Therefore, to honor one's parents is nearly equal to revering God. If we revere God, we will honor our parents.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Hearing the Instruction of Our Father</H2><P>We should hear the instruction of our father and not reject the teaching of our mother; for they will be a wreath of grace for our head and ornaments for our neck (Prov. 1:8-9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Receiving Our Father's Words<br>and Treasuring Up His Commandments within Us</H2><P>We should receive our father's words and treasure up his commandments within us, making our ear attentive to wisdom and inclining our heart to understanding. Indeed, if we cry out for discernment and lift up our voice for understanding and if we seek her like silver and search for her like hidden treasures, then we will understand the fear of Jehovah and find the knowledge of God. For Jehovah gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding (2:1-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Not Forgetting Our Father's Instruction</H2><P>Proverbs 3:1 and 2 charge us not to forget our father's instruction but to let our heart keep his commandments; for length of days and years of life and peace will they add to us. Here longevity and peace are related to honoring our parents. Verse 4 goes on to speak of our finding favor and a reputation for fine understanding in the sight of God and man. In verse 5 we are told to trust in Jehovah with all our heart and not to rely on our own understanding. We should not despise the chastening of Jehovah, nor be weary of His discipline; for whom Jehovah loves He disciplines (vv. 11-12). Verses 21 and 22 say, "My son, do not let them depart from your sight;/Keep sound wisdom and discretion;/And they will be life for your soul/And a graceful ornament for your neck."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Hearing and Receiving Our Father's Words</H2><P>The writer says in 4:3 that he was a son to his father, tender and the only beloved in the sight of his mother. In verses 10 through 13 he says, "Hear, my son, and receive my words,/And the years of your life will be many./I have taught you in the way of wisdom;/I have led you in the paths of uprightness./When you walk, your steps will not be hindered;/And when you run, you will not stumble./Take hold of instruction; do not let go;/Guard her, for she is your life." Verses 20 through 22 say, "Be attentive to my words;/Incline your ear to my sayings./Do not let them depart from your sight;/Keep them in the midst of your heart./For they are life to those who find them,/And healing to all their flesh."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Listening to Our Father</H2><P>Proverbs 8:32, 34-35 say, "Now therefore, my sons, listen to me;/For blessed are they who keep my ways....Blessed is the man who listens to me,/Watching daily at my doors,/Waiting at my doorposts./For whoever finds me finds life,/And will obtain favor from Jehovah."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. A Wise Son Making a Father Glad</H2><P>A wise son makes a father glad, but a foolish son is a grief to his mother (10:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Mocking Eye Being Plucked Out by Ravens</H2><P>The eye that mocks at his father, and despises to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley will pick it out, and the young eagles will eat it (30:17, 11). This is a serious warning regarding the honoring of our parents.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. HOLDING MARRIAGE IN HONOR</H2><P>The fourth nugget is to hold marriage in honor. In order to live a proper human life, we must hold marriage in honor.</P><P>I love America, but the marriage life in America bothers me very much. In American society the contact between males and females is too loose, without restriction. In this sense, the United States today is like Sodom. I am concerned about this because it offends God to the uttermost.</P><P>Marriage produces not only children but also parents. So that man can exist on earth to continue God's economy, honoring parents and holding marriage in honor are necessary. I hope that all the saints in the Lord's recovery will bear a strong testimony of honoring their parents and of holding marriage in honor.</P><P>Females should always be restricted by a sense of honorable shame. Today in America young women have physical contact with young men without shame. This kind of loose contact can easily lead to fornication. The co-workers who serve the Lord and often contact people must be careful. Many useful servants of the Lord have been spoiled because of their careless contact with the opposite sex. Revering God, honoring our parents, and holding marriage in honor are a real protection to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Man's Faithfulness Being the Base</H2><P>In holding marriage in honor man's faithfulness is the base. Regarding this, Proverbs 5:5-19 gives us a warning about the "strange woman," whose feet go down to death and whose steps hold fast to Sheol. She does not make straight the path of life. Her ways wander, and she does not know it (vv. 5-6). Verses 7 through 14 are a charge to young men to keep their way far from her and not to go near the door of her house; lest they give their honor to others, and their years to the cruel; lest strangers be filled with their wealth, and their labors go to the house of a foreigner, and they mourn at their end, when their flesh and body are consumed, and they say, "How I have hated instruction,/And my heart has despised reproof!/And I have not listened to the voice of my teachers/Nor inclined my ear to my instructors;/I was almost into every evil/In the midst of the congregation and assembly." Verses 15 through 19 conclude with a charge to married men to drink waters out of their own cistern (wife) and running water out of their own well. Their springs should not be shed forth like streams of water in the streets but should be theirs alone and not for strangers. Verses 18 and 19 say, "Let your fountain be blessed,/And rejoice in the wife of your youth,/A lovely hind and a graceful doe./Let her breasts satisfy you at all times./May you be ravished with her love always."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Woman's Virtues Being the Building Up</H2><P>Whereas in holding marriage in honor man's faithfulness is the base, woman's virtues are the building up. A gracious woman lays hold of honor (11:16a). A worthy woman is the crown of her husband (12:4a). The wise woman builds her house&#151;14:1a. Regarding woman's virtues, we need to read 31:10-31.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF PROVERBS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE DETAILED PRECEPTS FOR MAN<br>TO LIVE A PROPER HUMAN LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Prov. 10&#151;30</H1><P>When we come not only to the Proverbs but to any book of the Bible, especially Ephesians, the most spiritual book, we must be persons who are right. In reading the Bible, a right person is one who loves Christ, pursues after Him, and lives a life of denying himself and of being conformed to the death of Christ. This means that, on the negative side, we must deny the self, having all aspects of our being crucified, including our self, our natural man, our old man, our character, and whatever we have from birth. We have to put all these things on the cross. In other words, we must experience the cross of Christ, which has crucified us in every way.</P><P>God's salvation, however, does not have only a negative aspect&#151;termination. After termination there is a positive aspect&#151;germination. After death there is resurrection. Death terminates and resurrection germinates. The human life, the fallen, rotten, corrupted life that has become satanic, must be terminated. In resurrection Christ dispenses the divine life which was released through His death. In the last step of His death, He released the divine life out from His humanity, and in resurrection He dispensed this released divine life into us through regeneration. This is germination. Now we have a new beginning with a new life and a new person. This new life is a life of both divinity and humanity. This is wonderful.</P><P>As lovers of Christ, we need to realize that, on the negative side, we are finished, terminated. Nevertheless, on the positive side we have the processed and consummated Triune God to replace us as a new life. Therefore, we should live by this life every day. We have been crucified. Now we should be able to say with Paul in Galatians that it is no longer I who live, but another "I," Christ Himself as our person, lives in us and we live with Him. We should live such a person by the power of resurrection and by the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ.</P><P>When we are such persons, we can come to the Bible not merely by exercising our mentality but mainly by exercising our spirit. Our spirit will control our mind. In our spirit there is the marvelous, wonderful, processed, all-inclusive, sevenfold-intensified, life-giving Spirit. We live with Him, and He lives with us. Now when we come to the Bible by exercising our spirit, letting the Spirit move in us, every word of the Bible, in the Old Testament as well as in the New Testament, becomes spirit and life. Then our reading of any verse in the Bible will revive us. However, if we exercise only our mind, the words of the Bible will become death to us.</P><P>I can testify that after just a few minutes of fellowship with the Lord, I am fed, nourished, and stirred up. Then when I come to the Bible, every word becomes a gem. We all need to read the book of Proverbs in this way. Then every word of Proverbs will become spirit and life to us. Every word will be living and become a gem to strengthen our life of pursuing Christ for the fulfillment of God's economy in producing and building up the Body of Christ.</P><P>When I had a life-study on Proverbs in Taipei many years ago, I studied and classified all the detailed proverbs. There are at least seventy items, with many items containing several verses. These proverbs are the detailed precepts for man to live a proper human life. Each precept is a gem. Let us now begin to consider these precepts.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Contrast between Doing Righteousness<br>in Wisdom and Doing Wickedness in Folly</H2><P>In chapters ten through nineteen many proverbs show us a contrast between doing righteousness in wisdom and doing wickedness in folly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Wisdom versus Folly</H2><P>The first contrast is the contrast between wisdom and folly. A wise son makes a father glad, but a foolish son is a grief to his mother. The wise in heart will receive commandments, but the foolish in speech will be cast down. Wise men treasure up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool is imminent destruction (10:1, 8, 14). He who walks with wise men will be wise, but the companion of fools will be troubled (13:20). The tongue of the wise utters knowledge well, but the mouth of fools pours out folly. A wise son makes a father glad, but a foolish man despises his mother (15:2, 20). Insight is a fountain of life to him who has it, but the correction of fools is folly (16:22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Righteousness versus Wickedness</H2><P>Righteousness is versus wickedness. Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but righteousness delivers from death (10:2). Blessings are upon the head of the righteous man, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. The memory of the righteous man is blessed, but the name of the wicked will rot (vv. 6-7). The mouth of the righteous man is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence (v. 11). The wages of the righteous man lead to life; the income of the wicked man, to sin (v. 16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Diligence versus Slothfulness</H2><P>A slack hand causes poverty, but the hand of the diligent makes rich. He who gathers in summer is a prudent son, but he who sleeps at harvest time is a son who brings shame (vv. 4-5). The hand of the diligent will rule, but the slothful will be under forced labor. The slothful man does not roast his game, but the precious substance of men is to the diligent (12:24, 27). The soul of the sluggard desires and has nothing, but the soul of the diligent will be made fat (13:4). He also who is slack in his work is brother to him who is a destroyer (18:9). Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep, and the idle soul will suffer hunger. The sluggard buries his hand in the dish, and will not even bring it back to his mouth (19:15, 24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Integrity versus Crookedness</H2><P>He who walks in integrity walks securely, but he who perverts his ways will be known (10:9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Love versus Hatred</H2><P>Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all transgressions (v. 12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Restrained Lips versus Many Words</H2><P>When there are many words transgression does not cease, but he who restrains his lips is prudent (v. 19). He who guards his mouth keeps his soul, but he who opens wide his lips will have destruction (13:3). In all labor there is profit, but mere talk leads only to poverty (14:23). He who restrains his words has knowledge (17:27a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Humility versus Pride</H2><P>When pride comes, then comes dishonor; but wisdom is with the humble (11:2). In the mouth of a fool is a rod for his pride, but the lips of the wise will preserve them. A wise man fears and departs from evil, but the fool is arrogant and is confident (14:3, 16). Jehovah will tear down the house of the proud, but He will establish the territory of the widow. The fear of Jehovah is the instruction of wisdom, and humility comes before honor (15:25, 33). Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, than to divide the spoil with the proud (16:18-19). Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, but before honor goes humility (18:12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. The Worthy Woman versus the Foolish Woman</H2><P>A gracious woman lays hold of honor. Like a nose-ring of gold in a pig's snout, so is a beautiful woman who is without discretion (11:16a, 22). A worthy woman is the crown of her husband, but she who brings shame is like rottenness in his bones (12:4). The wise woman builds her house, but the foolish one tears it down with her own hands (14:1). Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing, and obtains favor from Jehovah (18:22). House and wealth are an inheritance from fathers, but a prudent wife is from Jehovah (19:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Mercifulness versus Cruelty</H2><P>The merciful man rewards his own soul, but the cruel troubles his own flesh (11:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. Perfection versus Perverseness</H2><P>Those who are perverse in heart are an abomination to Jehovah, but those who are perfect in their way are His delight (v. 20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. Almsgiving versus Stinginess</H2><P>There is one who scatters and increases yet more, and there is one who withholds what is appropriate but ends up only in want. The blessing soul will prosper, and he who waters will also be watered himself. As for him who withholds grain, the people will curse him; but blessing will be upon the head of him who sells it (vv. 24-26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. Love for Correction versus Hatred for Reproof</H2><P>Whoever loves correction loves knowledge, but he who hates reproof is stupid (12:1). Poverty and shame will come to him who refuses correction, but he who regards reproof will be honored (13:18). A fool despises his father's correction, but he who regards reproof gets prudence. The ear that listens to the reproof of life will lodge among the wise. He who ignores instruction despises his own soul, but he who listens to reproof acquires understanding (15:5, 31-32).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>13. Practicalness versus Vainness</H2><P>He who tills his land will have plenty of bread, but he who pursues worthless things lacks sense (12:11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>14. Listening to Counsel versus Being Self-righteous</H2><P>The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to counsel (v. 15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>15. Holding Back Anger versus Being Prone to Anger</H2><P>A fool's anger is known at once, but a prudent man conceals shame (v. 16). He who is slow to anger is of great understanding, but he who has a hasty spirit exalts folly (14:29). A wrathful man stirs up contention, but he who is slow to anger quietens strife (15:18). He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he who rules his spirit, than he who captures a city (16:32). He who is cool in spirit is a man of understanding (17:27b). The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger, and it is his glory to overlook a transgression. A man of great wrath will bear the penalty; for if you deliver him, you will only have to do it again (19:11, 19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>16. Truthfulness (or Faithfulness) versus Falsehood</H2><P>The lip of truth shall be established forever, but a lying tongue is only for a moment. Lying lips are an abomination to Jehovah, but those who deal faithfully are His delight (12:19, 22). A faithful witness will not lie, but a false witness utters lies (14:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>17. Pretending to Be Poor<br>versus Pretending to Be Rich</H2><P>There is one who pretends to be rich yet has nothing; there is one who pretends to be poor yet has great wealth (13:7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>18. Wealth Obtained by Diligent Labor<br>versus Wealth Obtained by Vanity</H2><P>Wealth obtained by vanity will be diminished, but he who gathers by labor increases it (v. 11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>19. Early Chastening versus Rod-sparing</H2><P>He who spares his rod hates his son, but he who loves him chastens him early (v. 24). Discipline your son, for there is hope; but do not set your heart on destroying him (19:18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>20. Being Cautious versus Believing Easily</H2><P>The simple man believes every word, but the prudent man considers his steps (14:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>21. Graciousness to the Needy<br>versus Oppression of the Poor</H2><P>He who oppresses the poor reproaches his Maker, but he who is gracious to the needy honors Him (v. 31). Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker; he who rejoices at calamity will not go unpunished (17:5). He who has pity upon a poor man lends to Jehovah, and He will repay him for his good deed (19:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>22. Softness versus Grievousness</H2><P>A soft answer turns away anger, but a grievous word stirs up anger (15:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>23. Poverty with Love versus Wealth with Hatred</H2><P>Better is a dinner of vegetables where love is, than a fattened ox and hatred with it (v. 17). Better is a dry morsel and quietness with it than a house full of feasting with strife (17:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>24. A Soothing Tongue versus a Perverse Mouth</H2><P>The tongue of the wise utters knowledge well, but the mouth of fools pours out folly (15:2). A soothing tongue is a tree of life, but perverseness in it is a breaking of the spirit (v. 4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>25. Hating of Bribes versus Being Greedy for Gain</H2><P>He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house, but he who hates bribes will live (v. 27).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>26. Taking the Lord as the Only Friend<br>versus Making Many Friends</H2><P>A man of many friends comes to destruction, but there is a true friend that sticks closer than a brother (18:24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>27. The Paths of Life versus the Ways of Death</H2><P>A number of proverbs contrast the paths of life with the ways of death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Paths of Life</H2><P>The paths of life involve fearing the Lord, trusting in the Lord, and taking refuge in the name of the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) Fearing the Lord</H2><P>He who walks in his uprightness fears Jehovah, but he who is perverse in his ways despises Him (14:2). In the fear of Jehovah is strong confidence, and his children will have a place of refuge. The fear of Jehovah is a fountain of life, that one may turn aside from the snares of death (vv. 26-27). Better is a little with the fear of Jehovah, than great treasure and turmoil with it. The fear of Jehovah is the instruction of wisdom, and humility comes before honor (15:16, 33). By lovingkindness and truth iniquity is expiated, and by the fear of Jehovah men depart from evil (16:6). The fear of Jehovah leads to life, and he who has it will lodge in contentment; he will not be visited with evil (19:23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) Trusting in the Lord</H2><P>The plans of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue is from Jehovah. A man's heart devises his way, but Jehovah directs his steps (16:1, 9). He who gives heed to the word will find good, and blessed is he who trusts in Jehovah. The lot is cast into the lap, but everything it decides is from Jehovah (vv. 20, 33). There are many devices in a man's heart, but it is the counsel of Jehovah that will stand (19:21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) Taking Refuge in the Name of the Lord</H2><P>The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; the righteous man runs into it and is safe (18:10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Ways of Death</H2><P>There is a way which seems right to a man, but the end of it is the ways of death (14:12; 16:25).</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF PROVERBS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TOUCHING THE WORD OF GOD BY OUR NEW MAN</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:22-24; 6:17-18</H1><P>Ephesians 4:22-24 tells us clearly that a believer in Christ has two men&#151;the old man and the new man. The old man is of Adam through our natural birth, and the new man is of Christ by a new birth, regeneration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LIVING A LIFE OF PUTTING OFF THE OLD MAN<br>AND PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</H2><P>According to my observation, very few believers in Christ and lovers of Christ live a life of continually putting off the old man and putting on the new man. In our daily life we mainly live an ethical life, spontaneously caring for matters of right and wrong. Those who live such an ethical life try their best to do what is right and to avoid doing what is wrong.</P><P>What kind of life do you live day by day? Is your daily life a life of the new man? In your daily living do you put off the old man and put on the new man? In your married life is it your practice to love your wife or husband by the new man or by the old man? We should not think that loving in the old man is justified by God. That kind of love is according to the law, according to the old dispensation, not according to God's New Testament economy and not according to the new creation. A brother may love his wife very much, but his love may be of the old creation, not of the new creation.</P><P>Among us in the Lord's recovery today, who is living a daily life not ethically according to right and wrong but according to the new man through putting off the old man and putting on the new man? When we say that a particular brother is a good brother, we usually mean that he is an ethical brother, that he is not wrong in any way with his wife and family, with the brothers and sisters in the church, and with the elders. Our basis for saying that he is a good brother is that he seems to be right with others. This evaluation is according to the old creation. On the other hand, we may criticize a certain brother because of his temper or his lack of patience. This criticism is based on the old creation. To evaluate and criticize others in this way indicates that we are living an ethical life according to the old man and that our daily life is not based on the new creation. Where can we find a person who is living according to the new creation?</P><P>The book of Ecclesiastes tells us that everything under the sun is vanity. Only the new creation is above the sun and thus is not vanity. No matter how good, how excellent, how marvelous, and how wonderful something may be, as long as it is of the old creation, it is part of the vanity of vanities under the sun.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>STUDYING THE BIBLE<br>BY THE OLD MAN AND BY THE NEW MAN</H2><P>We need to have this realization when we come to the Bible. We may study the Bible either by the old man or by the new man. Many Christians study the Word in a natural way, according to their old man. When you read the Word of God, do you read it by the old man or by the new man? If we merely exercise our mind to get knowledge from the Word, we are reading it by the old man.</P><P>To read the Bible by the new man is very different. Even before coming to the Bible, a person in the new man exercises his spirit to contact the Lord. He may confess, saying, "Lord, I am sorry that I live so much in my old man, not exercising my spirit to contact You, to live by my new man, as one of Your new creation. Lord, forgive this sin." When we approach the Bible in this way, exercising our spirit, we have the deep feeling and sense that we are approaching, touching, and contacting God. By this I do not mean that the Bible is God but that in coming to the Bible we are coming to contact God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PRAY-READING THE WORD OF GOD</H2><P>When we come to the Bible to contact God, we should not only read but pray-read the Word. No matter who we are, as long as we read the Bible without praying, we are reading by the old man. To read the Bible without praying is to contact the Word by the old man. The genuine reading of the Bible by the new man can never be separated from praying.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Reading the Bible Prayerfully</H2><P>The term pray-reading has been in use for less than thirty years. This does not mean, however, that before we invented this term, there was no such thing as pray-reading. Many saints have practiced the pray-reading of the Word without using this expression to describe what they were doing. A number of seeking Christians have pointed out that the best way to read the Bible is to read it prayerfully. I have read certain books which said that we should read the Bible in a prayerful way. To read the Word prayerfully actually is to pray-read the Word.</P><P>I can testify that long before we began to speak of pray-reading, it was my practice to read the Word with prayer. For example, I remember reading John 3:16 and praying, "O God, thank You. You loved the world so much. O God my Father, You loved me so much that You gave Your Son, the Only Begotten, to me." I had the feeling that I had touched God and that He had touched me. Through my prayer John 3:16 became Spirit and life to me.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Pray-reading by Exercising Our Spirit</H2><P>My burden in these messages on Proverbs is to help you touch the Word of God by your new man, by exercising your spirit to pray-read. Pray-reading changes the Bible from letters to Spirit and life. Apart from pray-reading, the book of Proverbs is merely a collection of proverbs. But when we pray-read Proverbs, our pray-reading causes all the proverbs to become words of Spirit and life to us.</P><P>Ephesians 6:17-18 unveils the matter of pray-reading, and our invention of the term pray-reading was based on these verses. Ephesians 6:17-18 tells us to "receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit." Here we see that we should receive the word of God not merely by exercising our mind to understand but by means of all prayer and petition, praying by exercising our spirit. Prayer is general; petition particular.</P><P>We receive the word by reading. However, to receive (read) without praying is altogether a matter in the mind. Along with our reading we must pray. When we pray-read the Word by exercising our spirit, the word in black and white immediately becomes the Spirit. In this way the Spirit and the word are one. When we read, it is a word. When we pray with the exercise of our spirit, the word becomes Spirit and life. Whenever we come to the Word we must pray, and we should pray not merely with the mind but with the spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BIBLE BEING GOD'S BREATHING</H2><P>The Bible is God's breathing. God is breathing out Himself as the word (2 Tim. 3:16a). This means that the Bible is God's exhaling. The exhaling of God in the Bible is waiting for us to inhale. When we read any verse and pray, this praying becomes our inhaling of God's breath. By this the Word becomes Spirit and life to us in our experience. If this is not our situation, then even in our reading of the Bible we are not in the new man but are still in the old man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COMING TO THE WORD OF GOD<br>NOT TO BECOME PERFECT BY CULTIVATING THE SELF<br>BUT TO RECEIVE NOURISHMENT AND ENLIGHTENMENT<br>BY PRAYING IN SPIRIT</H2><P>We have pointed out that in Proverbs there are many detailed precepts for man to live a proper human life and that every precept is a gem. Even if a person accepts all these gems and is successful in keeping them, he will only build up himself to be a perfect man by cultivating the self. But the Lord Jesus said that whoever would follow Him must deny himself (Matt. 16:24).</P><P>In their reading of the Proverbs and even of the entire Bible, many Christians receive only teachings, admonitions, exhortations, proverbs, and precepts to cultivate their self and to build up the natural man, who has been fully condemned by God. We must learn to come to the Word of God as those who are approaching God, not to receive proverbs and teachings but to receive nourishment and enlightenment, so that we may know that, according to God, we should always be conformed to the death of Christ by the power of His resurrection (Phil. 3:10), which is the consummated Spirit, who is the reality of the resurrection of Christ.</P><P>A certain teaching in the Bible may be very good, but we should not take it as something to cultivate our self and build up our natural man. We must reject self-cultivation and condemn the building up of the natural man. We need to turn the Bible from a book that teaches us to cultivate the self and to build up the natural man to a book that is full of life, spirit, spiritual nourishment, and spiritual enlightenment. This will tear down our self, break our natural man, and supply us with the consummated Spirit of the Triune God. Then we will live a life not by our natural man, by our old man, and by our self but by the Lord Jesus, who is our life and person living in our spirit.</P><P>We need to learn to exercise our spirit every day in our daily life, especially in our Bible study. We need to turn ourselves from the mind to the spirit by praying in our spirit. If we come to the Bible in this way, we will be touching the Word by the new man and it will become to us a book of Spirit and life.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF PROVERBS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE DETAILED PRECEPTS FOR MAN<br>TO LIVE A PROPER HUMAN LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Proverbs 10&#151;30</H1><P>In this message we will consider more of the detailed precepts for man to live a proper human life. Each of these precepts is a gem in Proverbs.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Admonitions and Teachings</H2><P>Chapters twenty through twenty-nine contain many admonitions and teachings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Concerning Gluttonousness,<br>Wine-loving, and Pleasure-loving</H2><P>Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler; and whoever errs by it is not wise (20:1). He who loves pleasure will be a poor man; he who loves wine and oil will not be rich (21:17). Do not be among those who get drunk with wine, among gluttonous eaters of flesh; for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and drowsiness will clothe them with rags (23:20-21). When you sit to eat with a ruler, consider carefully who is before you; and put a knife to your throat if you are a man of great appetite. Do not desire his delicacies, for they are deceitful food. Do not eat the bread of one who is envious, and do not desire his delicacies; for as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to you, "Eat and drink"; but his heart is not with you. You will vomit up the morsel which you have eaten, and waste your pleasant words (vv. 1-3, 6-8). Verses 29 through 35 say, "Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions?/Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes?/Those who linger late over wine,/Those who go to seek out mixed wines. / Do not look upon the wine when it is red,/When it sparkles in the cup,/When it goes down smoothly;/In the end it bites like a serpent,/And stings like an adder./Your eyes will see strange things,/And your heart will utter perverse things;/And you will be like one who lies down while at sea,/Or like one who lies down at the top of a mast./They struck me, but I was not hurt;/They beat me, but I did not feel it;/When will I awake? I will seek another drink."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Concerning Anger and Strife</H2><P>It is an honor for a man to keep away from strife, but every fool rushes headlong into it (20:3). Do not go out hastily to strive; otherwise what will you do in the end, when your neighbor puts you to shame? (25:8). For lack of wood the fire goes out, and where there is no whisperer, contention quiets down. As charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire, so is a contentious man to kindle strife (26:20-21). A fool utters all his anger, but a wise man holds it back. An angry man stirs up contention, and a furious man abounds in transgression (29:11, 22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Concerning Sin</H2><P>Who can say, I have made my heart clean; I am pure from my sin? (20:9). He who covers his transgressions will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy (28:13). Proverbs 28:13 is a good verse. We should ask the Lord to help us not to cover our transgressions but to confess and forsake them. In 22:8 we are told that he who sows injustice will reap iniquity, and the rod of his wrath will fail.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Concerning Falsehood and Perverseness</H2><P>Differing weights and differing measures, both of them are an abomination to Jehovah. Differing weights are an abomination to Jehovah, and false scales are not good (20:10, 23). Thorns and snares are in the way of the perverse; he who guards his soul will keep far from them (22:5). The bread of falsehood is sweet to a man, but afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel (20:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Concerning Pride,<br>Self-trusting, Self-boasting, and Self-honoring</H2><P>Proverbs 21:24 says that Proud, Haughty, Scorner are the names of him who works in the arrogance of pride. A man's pride will bring him low, but he who is of a lowly spirit will obtain honor (29:23). He who trusts in his own heart is a fool, but he who walks wisely will be delivered (28:26). Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring forth. Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; a foreigner, and not your own lips (27:1-2). Do not claim honor for yourself in the presence of the king, and do not stand in the place of great men; for it is better that it is said to you, "Come up here," than that you should be put lower in the presence of the noble, whom your eyes have seen (25:6-7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Concerning Seeking One's Own Glory</H2><P>Have you found honey? Eat only what you need, lest you become filled up with it and vomit it. It is not good to eat much honey, nor is it glory for men to search out their own glory (vv. 16, 27).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Concerning Slothfulness and the Love of Sleep</H2><P>The sluggard will not plow because of winter, therefore he will beg in harvest and have nothing. Do not love sleep, or else you will come to poverty; open your eyes, and be satisfied with bread (20:4, 13). The sluggard says, "There is a lion outside! I will be slain in the streets!" (22:13). The drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and drowsiness will clothe them with rags (23:21). Proverbs 24:30-34 says, "I passed by the field of the sluggard,/And by the vineyard of the man lacking sense;/And there it was, all overgrown with thorns;/Its surface was covered with nettles,/And its stone wall was broken down./When I looked, I considered it;/I saw it and received instruction:/A little sleep, a little slumber,/A little folding of the hands to rest,/And your poverty will come upon you like a robber,/And your want, like an armed man." The sluggard says, "There is a roaring lion on the way; a lion is in the streets!" As the door turns upon its hinges, so does the sluggard upon his bed. The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he gets weary by bringing it to his mouth again. The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who can answer discreetly (26:13-16). The desire of the sluggard puts him to death, for his hands refuse to work (21:25).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Concerning Becoming a Surety</H2><P>Proverbs 20:16 says, "Take his garment when he becomes a surety for a stranger, and hold the pledge when he becomes surety for foreigners." Do not be one of those who give their hand as a pledge, or one of those who are a surety for debts. If you have nothing with which to pay, why should your bed be taken away from under you? (22:26-27). Take the garment of him who is surety for a stranger, and hold one in pledge who is surety for a foreign woman (27:13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Concerning the Mouth and Tongue</H2><P>Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles (21:23). He who goes about as a gossip reveals secrets; therefore do not associate with one who opens his lips wide (20:19). Proverbs 29:20 says, "Do you see a man who is hasty in his words?/There is more hope for a fool than for him." It is a snare to a man to rashly say, "It is holy," and after making the vows to begin to consider (20:25).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. Concerning Fools</H2><P>Like snow in summer and like rain in harvest, so honor is not fitting for a fool. Like the sparrow in its fluttering, like the swallow in its flying, so a curse without cause does not alight. A whip for the horse! A bridle for the donkey! And a rod for the back of fools! Do not answer a fool according to his folly, lest you also be like him. Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes. He who sends a message by the hand of a fool cuts off his own feet and drinks violence. Like the legs of the lame which hang down, so is a proverb in the mouth of fools. Like one who binds a stone in a sling, so is he who gives honor to a fool. Like a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a proverb in the mouth of fools. Like an archer who wounds everyone, so is he who hires a fool or who hires those who pass by. Like a dog that returns to its vomit is a fool who repeats his folly. Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him (26:1-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. Concerning Contentious Women</H2><P>A continual dripping on a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike. He who would restrain her restrains the wind, and grasps oil with his right hand (27:15-16). It is better to dwell in a corner of a housetop than in a house shared with a contentious woman. It is better to dwell in a desert land than with a contentious and vexing woman (21:9, 19; 25:24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. Concerning Strange Women and Harlots</H2><P>The mouth of strange women is a deep pit; he with whom Jehovah is indignant will fall in there (22:14). For a harlot is a deep pit, and an adulteress is a narrow well. Indeed, she lies in wait as a robber, and increases the number of the treacherous among men (23:27-28). He who keeps company with harlots wastes his substance (29:3b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>13. Concerning Riches</H2><P>An inheritance gained hurriedly at the beginning will not be blessed in the end (20:21). A faithful man will abound with blessings, but he who makes haste to be rich will not go unpunished. A man who is envious hastens after wealth, and does not know that want will come upon him (28:20, 22). Proverbs 23:4-5 says, "Do not weary yourself to become rich; /Cease from your consideration of it./When you set your eyes upon it, it is gone;/For wealth certainly makes itself wings, /Like an eagle that flies toward heaven." The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor, a snare of death. All day long one covets greedily, but the righteous man gives and does not hold back (21:6, 26). The ruler who lacks understanding is also a great oppressor, but he who hates unjust gain will prolong his days (28:16). A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches, and favor is better than silver and gold (22:1). Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than he who is perverse in his ways though he is rich (28:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>14. Concerning Truth, Wisdom, and Knowledge</H2><P>There is gold and an abundance of corals, but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel (20:15). In 24:13-14 the writer says, "My son, eat honey, for it is good,/And the drippings from the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste:/Know that wisdom is such for your soul;/If you find it, then there will be a latter end,/And your hope will not be cut off." Through wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established, and by knowledge the rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches (vv. 3-4). Whoever loves wisdom makes his father glad (29:3a). Proverbs 23:23 charges us, saying, "Buy truth, and do not sell it;/Buy wisdom and instruction and understanding." Verse 19 says, "Listen, my son, and be wise,/And direct your heart in the way."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>15. Concerning Forbearance and Softness</H2><P>By forbearance a ruler may be persuaded, and a soft tongue can break the bone (25:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>16. Concerning Working</H2><P>Proverbs 22:29 says, "Do you see a man skilled in his work?/He will stand before kings;/He will not stand before obscure men." The plans of the diligent lead only to plentifulness, but everyone who is hasty comes only to want (21:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>17. Concerning Correcting the Children</H2><P>Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction will drive it far from him (22:15). The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a child left to himself brings shame to his mother (29:15). Proverbs 23:13-14 says, "Do not withhold correction from a child;/If you beat him with the rod, he will not die./If you beat him with the rod,/You will deliver his soul from Sheol." Proverbs 22:6 charges us to train up a child according to the way he should go; even when he is old, he will not depart from it. Finally, 29:17 admonishes us, saying, "Correct your son, and he will give you rest;/He will also give delight to your soul."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>18. Concerning Stripes and Reproof</H2><P>Stripes that wound purge away evil, and strokes reach the innermost parts of the inner being (20:30). He who hardens his neck after being often reproved will suddenly be broken beyond remedy (29:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>19. Concerning Prayers</H2><P>Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor man also will cry and will not be heard (21:13). He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination (28:9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>20. Concerning Sacrifice</H2><P>To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to Jehovah than sacrifice. The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; how much more when he brings it with evil intent! (21:3, 27).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>21. Concerning the Praise from Man</H2><P>The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold, and a man is tried by the praise given him (27:21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>22. Concerning Association with Others</H2><P>Make no friendship with a man who is given to anger, and with a wrathful man do not go (22:24). Do not associate with those who are given to change (24:21b). He who goes about as a gossip reveals secrets; therefore do not associate with one who opens his lips wide (20:19). Whoever keeps the law is an understanding son, but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father (28:7).</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF PROVERBS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>COMING TO PROVERBS<br>TO CULTIVATE OUR REGENERATED NEW MAN</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:22-24; Gal. 2:20; 2 Tim. 3:16a; Eph. 6:17-18a</H1><P>In this message I would like to give a word concerning the proper way to come to the book of Proverbs.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FIVE MATTERS REVEALED IN THE BIBLE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God</H2><P>The Bible first reveals God (Gen. 1:1). The whole universe is a mystery, and the center of this mystery is God. God created the heavens and the earth. Without God nothing would exist.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Word</H2><P>The second thing the Bible shows us is God's speaking, God's word. Hebrews 1:1-2a says, "God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son." Thus, in the Bible we first have God, and then we have God's speaking, the word that proceeds out of His mouth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Word Becoming Flesh</H2><P>Genesis 1:1 says, "In the beginning God created," and John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word." This Word became flesh (v. 14). First is God, then the Word, and then the Word became flesh.</P><P>We are accustomed to saying that God was incarnated. However, it may be more precise to speak of the Word becoming flesh. This Word-become-flesh is Christ in the flesh as the embodiment of God. Now we have three: God, the Word, and Christ in the flesh. The Word, Christ the Son of God, became flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>Fourth, the Son of God in the flesh as the Word became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Therefore, we have God, the Word, Christ in the flesh, and the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Spirit Being the Word</H2><P>Ephesians 6:17 says, "Receive..the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God." According to the Greek grammar, which in this verse refers not to sword but to Spirit, indicating that the Spirit is the word. This corresponds to Christ's word in John 6:63: "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life." Hence, we have God, the Word, Christ in the flesh as the embodiment of the Word, the Spirit, and the word again.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Five Factors Which Are Now<br>Mingled with the Regenerated Human Spirit</H2><P>In the book entitled The God-men, I pointed out that the Bible shows us the God-men, the new man, the new creation, the Body of Christ, and the New Jerusalem. Here I would point out that all of these issue from God, the Word, Christ as the embodiment of the Word, the Spirit, and the Spirit as the word. Without these five things as the factors, we cannot have the God-men, the new man, the new creation, the Body of Christ, and the New Jerusalem. Furthermore, these five factors are one. God is the Word; the Word is Christ; Christ is the Spirit; and the Spirit is the word. Today all these five are in our regenerated human spirit and are even mingled with our spirit as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BOOK OF PROVERBS<br>NOT BEING THE WORD DIRECTLY FROM GOD</H2><P>The book of Proverbs is recorded in the Word of God, but it is not the word directly from God. Rather, it is the word of many wise men, especially Solomon. In the same way, most of the Bible is not the word of God directly. However, much of the Old Testament is God's speaking, such as Genesis 1:3, where God said, "Let there be light." Although Proverbs is a book in the Bible, when we contact it by our natural man, it is not the word of God to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WORD BECOMING SPIRIT AND LIFE TO US<br>THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF OUR SPIRIT</H2><P>In 1 Corinthians 7:25a Paul said concerning marriage, "I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion." Here Paul says clearly that what he is about to speak is not the word of God but his opinion. In verse 40 he went on to say, "But I think that I also have the Spirit of God." This is an illustration of the fact that the Bible is full of human words, the words of the people of God. These words are the word of God because they are in the Bible, and the Bible is God's breathing (2 Tim. 3:16a), God's exhaling of Himself.</P><P>When we come to contact the word in the Bible by our natural man, by our mind, it is not the word of God to us. But when we come to the Bible by exercising our spirit to contact God, the word becomes the Spirit. This should be our experience as we read the book of Proverbs. The words in this book are the words of wise men, but when we contact these words by exercising our spirit in the spirit of prayer, every word becomes spirit and life to us. It is crucial that we all see this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR NEED TO HAVE THE PROPER, SPIRITUAL PROVERBS<br>FOR THE CULTIVATION OF OUR REGENERATED NEW MAN</H2><P>As believers in Christ, we are no longer the old man&#151;we are the new man. However, no matter how new we may be, we still have our humanity. Instead of casting away our created humanity, God regenerated this humanity. Yes, Christ crucified, terminated, the fallen old man, but He regenerated, germinated, our God-created humanity with God's life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Our Resurrected Humanity</H2><P>Resurrection follows crucifixion, and without resurrection there can be no regeneration (1 Pet. 1:3). What Christ terminated on the cross was the fallen humanity, the fallen old man, yet the God-created humanity remained to be resurrected. In resurrection the divine element uplifted the regenerated humanity. Now after we have been regenerated to be a new man, we still have our humanity, but it is a resurrected, regenerated humanity.</P><P>Because this is a difficult matter for believers to understand, we need to have a clear vision concerning the old man and the new man. On the one hand, our old, fallen humanity has been terminated in Christ's crucifixion; on the other hand, our God-created humanity has been germinated, regenerated, through Christ's resurrection. Thus, we have been terminated and also germinated. The humanity which we have today is not the old, terminated, fallen humanity but the new, germinated, uplifted humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Crucified "I" and the Regenerated "I"</H2><P>In the first part of Galatians 2:20 Paul says, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live." If we pay attention only to this part of the verse, we may think that Paul is saying that his humanity has been altogether terminated, for he says, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives." But where and in whom does Christ live? Paul answers this question when he says, "Christ..lives in me." Furthermore, Paul immediately goes on to say, "And the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith." First, Paul declares, "I am crucified..it is no longer I who live," but then he says, "I live." The crucified "I" is the old "I." The "I" who lives is the new, regenerated "I," the regenerated humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Coming to Proverbs to Cultivate Our New Man</H2><P>Now we can understand the place that Proverbs should have in our Christian life. Because we still have our humanity, we need the proper, spiritual proverbs, not to cultivate our natural man but to cultivate our regenerated new man. For example, a certain brother may be able to speak much about doctrines, but he may be very slothful, careless, and disorderly with many things in his daily life. Such a person surely needs to have his regenerated humanity cultivated through the book of Proverbs.</P><P>We all need Proverbs for the cultivation of our new man. We need to come to Proverbs as a new man by exercising our spirit with the Spirit to contact the word. Then the word in Proverbs will become spirit and life to us, not to cultivate our natural man but to cultivate our regenerated new man.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF PROVERBS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE DETAILED PRECEPTS FOR MAN<br>TO LIVE A PROPER HUMAN LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Prov. 10&#151;30</H1><P>In this message we will continue to consider the admonitions and teachings found in chapters twenty through twenty-nine. Then we will see the general words of wisdom in chapter thirty.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>23. Concerning the Lord's Dealing with Man</H2><P>A number of portions in Proverbs speak of the Lord's dealing with man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Ordering Man's Steps</H2><P>A man's steps are ordered by Jehovah; how then can man understand his own way? (20:24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Controlling Man's Heart</H2><P>The king's heart is like streams of water in the hand of Jehovah; He turns it wherever He wishes (21:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Weighing Man's Heart</H2><P>Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but Jehovah weighs the hearts (v. 2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. Giving Justice to Man</H2><P>Many seek the ruler's favor, but justice for man comes from Jehovah (29:26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. Giving Victory to Man</H2><P>There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel that can avail against Jehovah. The horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory belongs to Jehovah (21:30-31).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. Preserving Man with His Eyes</H2><P>The eyes of Jehovah preserve knowledge, but He overthrows the words of the treacherous man (22:12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. Concealing Matters from Man</H2><P>It is the glory of God to conceal a matter, but the glory of kings is to search a matter out (25:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>24. Concerning Dealing with the Lord</H2><P>Proverbs also speaks of dealing with the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Fearing the Lord</H2><P>The reward of humility and the fear of Jehovah are riches and honor and life (22:4). Do not let your heart envy sinners, but live in the fear of Jehovah all day long (23:17). Blessed is the man who always fears, but he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity (28:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Seeking the Lord</H2><P>Evil men do not understand justice, but those who seek Jehovah understand all things (28:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Waiting for the Lord</H2><P>Do not say, "I will recompense evil"; wait for Jehovah, and He will save you (20:22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. Trusting in the Lord</H2><P>Proverbs 22:19 says, "So that your trust may be in Jehovah,/I have made them known to you today, even to you." A greedy person stirs up contention, but he who trusts in Jehovah will prosper (28:25). The fear of man brings a snare, but whoever puts his trust in Jehovah will be exalted (29:25).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. Taking Man's Spirit as the Lord's Lamp<br>to Search All Man's Innermost Parts for Him</H2><P>The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, searching all the innermost parts of the inner being (20:27).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>25. Concerning Dealing with Parents</H2><P>Whoever curses his father or his mother, his lamp will go out in deep darkness (20:20). In 23:22 the writer says, "Listen to your father who begot you,/And do not despise your mother when she is old." Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, "It is no transgression," is the companion of a man who destroys (28:24). Proverbs 23:25 says, "Let your father and your mother rejoice,/And let her who bore you exult."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>26. Concerning Dealing with Others</H2><P>To have respect of persons is not good, because for a piece of bread a man will transgress (28:21). The fear of man brings a snare, but whoever puts his trust in Jehovah will be exalted (29:25).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>27. Concerning Dealing with Neighbors</H2><P>Proverbs 25:17 says, "Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor's house, otherwise he will become weary of you and hate you." A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his steps (29:5). Like a madman who shoots firebrands, arrows, and death, so is the man who deceives his neighbor, and says, "Was I not joking?" (26:18-19). A man who bears false witness against his neighbor is like a club and a sword and a sharp arrow (25:18). Proverbs 25:9-10 charges us, saying, "Argue your case with your neighbor himself,/And do not reveal the secret of another;/Lest he who hears it revile you,/And the evil report of you does not go away." According to 22:28 and 23:10-11, we should not remove the ancient boundary marker, which our fathers have set up, or go into the fields of the fatherless; for their Redeemer is strong; He will plead their cause against us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>28. Concerning Dealing with the Poor</H2><P>He who gives to the poor man will not lack, but he who shuts his eyes will have many curses (28:27). Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor man also will cry and will not be heard (21:13). He who oppresses the poor to multiply his gain and he who gives to the rich will only come to want. Do not rob the poor, because he is poor; nor oppress the afflicted in the gate (22:16, 22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>29. Concerning Dealing with Evil Men</H2><P>Proverbs 24:1 tells us not to be envious of evil men, nor desire to be with them. We should not be incensed because of evildoers and not be envious of the wicked (v. 19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>30. Concerning Dealing with Enemies</H2><P>Concerning dealing with enemies we should not say, "I will recompense evil"; we should wait for Jehovah, and He will save us (20:22). We should not say, "I will do to him as he has done to me; I will render to the man according to his work" (24:29). We should not rejoice when our enemy falls, and we should not let our heart exult when he is overthrown; lest Jehovah see it, and it displease Him, and He turn away His anger from him (vv. 17-18). If our enemy is hungry, we should give him bread to eat; and if he is thirsty, we should give him water to drink; for we will heap coals of fire upon his head, and Jehovah will reward us (25:21-22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>31. Concerning Dealing with Oneself</H2><P>Like a city that is broken down, without walls, is a man whose spirit is without restraint (v. 28). Blessed is the man who always fears, but he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity (28:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>32. Concerning Visions</H2><P>Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint (29:18a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. General Words of Wisdom</H2><P>In chapter thirty we have general words of wisdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Not Having the Knowledge of the Holy One</H2><P>Verses 2 through 4 say, "Surely I am more stupid than any man,/And do not have a man's understanding;/And I have not learned wisdom,/Nor do I have the knowledge of the Holy One./Who has ascended into heaven and descended?/Who has gathered the wind in his fists?/Who has wrapped up the waters in his garment?/Who has established all the ends of the earth?/What is his name, and what is his son's name, if you know?"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Every Word of God Being Tried</H2><P>Every word of God is tried; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him. Do not add to His words, lest He reprove you and you be found a liar (vv. 5-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Two Things Being Asked For</H2><P>In verses 7 through 9 the writer asks for two things. He says, "Remove far from me falsehood and lies./Give me neither poverty nor riches;/Feed me with the food that is my portion,/Lest I become full and deny You and say, Who is Jehovah?/Or lest I become poor and steal and profane the name of my God."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Not Slandering a Servant to His Master</H2><P>Verse 10 tells us not to slander a servant to his master, lest he curse us, and we be held guilty.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Four Detestable Generations</H2><P>Verses 11 through 14 speak of four detestable generations: "There is a generation that curse their father,/And do not bless their mother./There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes,/And yet are not washed from their filthiness. /There is a generation&#151;oh how lofty are their eyes,/And their eyelids are raised arrogantly./There is a generation whose teeth are like swords,/And their jaw teeth like knives,/To devour the afflicted from off the earth,/And the needy from among men."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Leech Having Two Daughters</H2><P>The leech has two daughters, crying, "Give, give." There are three things that are never satisfied, indeed, four that do not say, "Enough": Sheol and the barren womb, the earth that is not satisfied with water, and the fire that does not say, "Enough" (vv. 15-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Eye That Mocks at His Father</H2><P>The eye that mocks at his father, and despises to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley will pick it out, and the young eagles will eat it (v. 17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Three Things Which Are Too Wonderful</H2><P>In verses 18 through 19 the writer speaks of three things which are too wonderful for him, indeed four which he does not know: the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a serpent upon a rock, the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man with a maiden. This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth and says, "I have done no wickedness" (v. 20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Under Three Things the Earth Quaking</H2><P>Under three things the earth quakes, and under four, it cannot bear up: under a servant when he is king, and a fool when he is filled with food; under a hated woman when she gets married, and a maidservant who is heir to her mistress (vv. 21-23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. Four Things Which Are Small<br>but Are Exceedingly Wise</H2><P>Four things are small on the earth, but they are exceedingly wise: The ants are a people without strength, yet they prepare their food in the summer; the rock badgers are a people without might, yet they make their houses in the rocks; the swarming locusts have no king, yet all of them go out in ranks; the lizard can be grasped with the hands, yet she is in kings' palaces (vv. 24-28).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. Three Things Which Are Stately in Their Step</H2><P>There are three things which are stately in their step, indeed four which are stately in walking: the lion, which is mightiest among beasts, and does not turn back before any; the strutting cock girded in the loins, or a male goat, and a king who has a band of soldiers with him (vv. 29-31).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. Being Foolish in Exalting Oneself</H2><P>Verse 32 says, "If you have been foolish in exalting yourself,/Or if you have thought an evil scheme,/Put your hand upon your mouth."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>13. The Pressing of Wrath Bringing Forth Strife</H2><P>The churning of milk produces butter, and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood, so the pressing of wrath brings forth strife (v. 33).</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF PROVERBS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>USING PROVERBS FOR BUILDING UP THE NEW MAN</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:20-21, 23; 1 Pet. 1:18-19; Eph. 4:30; 2 Cor. 4:16</H1><P>In this message I would like to give a further word regarding the proper way to receive and to use the book of Proverbs.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE POSITION OF PROVERBS,<br>ECCLESIASTES, AND SONG OF SONGS<br>IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE BOOKS OF THE BIBLE</H2><P>The Bible was breathed out by God through more than forty different persons. The sequence of the sixty-six books of the Bible was arranged by God. According to this sequence, God put Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs together and placed them immediately before the prophets.</P><P>There are two ministries in the Old Testament: the ministry of law, represented by Moses, and the ministry of the prophets, represented by Elijah. Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs are placed at the end of the section of the law, just before the prophets. Do these books belong to the law or to the prophets? I would say that they belong to the section of the law. In particular, Proverbs may be considered a subsidiary, or a helper, to the law.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WISDOM, VANITY, AND SATISFACTION</H2><P>Solomon, the writer of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs, was the last writer in this section. God raised him to the highest peak of humanity. What he was, what he had, and what he did were unparalleled. It is hard to believe that eventually he became degraded to the uttermost. These three books were written by Solomon, the last two after his degradation, repentance, and return to God.</P><P>Of these three books, the first is on wisdom; the second, on vanity; and the third, on satisfaction. Proverbs is on the real wisdom, and Ecclesiastes is on the real meaning of the human life under the sun, which is vanity of vanities, a chasing after wind. Song of Songs is the satisfaction of satisfactions. Apart from Christ, there is no satisfaction in the whole universe. The unique Christ, the embodiment of God, is the unique satisfaction not only to man but to the entire universe, which has been made subject to vanity (Rom. 8:20). The fact that the creation is now subject to vanity means that everything under the sun is vanity. Today God is embodied in Christ, and Christ is realized as the compounded, sevenfold, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God. This indwelling One is our subjective satisfaction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR NEED TO KNOW THE PROPER WAY<br>TO TAKE THE BOOK OF PROVERBS</H2><P>We may know the position of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs in the Bible, but we may not know the way to take the book of Proverbs. Proverbs gives us wisdom to be a proper person and to do the right things. But for whom is this wisdom given, and how should this one use it? Is the wisdom in Proverbs for the fallen man? The Old Testament does not reveal the proper way to take the book of Proverbs because the divine revelation had not progressed to this extent at Solomon's time. Solomon did not receive very much of the divine revelation. Rather, he wrote Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs according to his observations of humanity and of the universe and according to his experiences of falling away from God, of repenting, and of returning to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S REDEMPTION<br>BEING A GREAT PART OF HIS ECONOMY</H2><P>To use the book of Proverbs properly, we must know God's economy. God's economy is that God became man so that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead to produce the organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ, which consummates the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Need for Redemption</H2><P>A great part of God's economy is His redemption. Redemption indicates that something is wrong, requiring a rescue and a remedy. Redemption is needed because after God created man for the fulfillment of His economy, the subtle one, Satan, came in to seduce man from the line of God's economy to sin. Man fell into sin, and sin as the sinful nature of Satan was injected by Satan into man's nature. As a result, the God-created man became sin, poisoned by Satan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Way to Carry Out His Redemption</H2><P>How does God carry out His redemption to rescue fallen man? None of the traditional theological systems provide a clear and adequate answer to this question. The answer can be found only through a careful, thorough, and detailed study of the Bible.</P><P>To understand the Bible is not easy. We have spent more than seventy years to study the Bible. The Bible is like a big jigsaw puzzle with thousands of pieces scattered throughout it. We need to put all the pieces together in order to have the complete picture. Brother Nee read through over three thousand classical Christian books on various subjects and collected many precious items, or "pieces," from them, which he passed on to me. During the past seventy years we have been putting together the pieces of this great "puzzle." Now we have a picture of the whole Bible, and we can see in a detailed way how God's redemption is related to His economy and how His redemption is carried out.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Terminating the Fallen Old Man</H2><P>The Bible shows us that man has become fallen and needs to be redeemed. In God's redemption the first part is to terminate, to destroy, the fallen old man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Rescuing the Humanity Created by God</H2><P>The second part is to rescue what was created by God, the God-created humanity. Something remains of the humanity created by God, and God is not willing to give it up. He created it, and although it has become fallen, He will maintain it and bring it back to Himself. Thus, in His redemption, God, on the one hand, destroys what is fallen and, on the other hand, rescues what was created by Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Uplifting the Redeemed Part of Created Man</H2><P>In the third part of His redemption, God uplifts the redeemed God-created humanity. Sometimes when a certain thing which we have made becomes lost and damaged, we find that thing and repair it, making it better than it was originally. This is what God has done in His redemption. He made the man created by Him better than he was in the beginning. This means that God uplifted the redeemed humanity by dispensing Himself into it.</P><P>The God-created humanity was very good, but it did not have anything of God's nature. It was only human, without divinity. After this humanity became fallen, in His redemption God destroyed the fallen part, rescued the God-created part, and then dispensed Himself into this redeemed humanity.</P><P>At this juncture we need to point out that, according to the Bible, God's redemption includes not only death but also resurrection. Without resurrection, God could not bring back to Himself the lost created man. To bring back the lost God-created man is actually to resurrect the God-created man. In resurrection God used His own life, nature, and element as the substance to uplift the redeemed created man. Furthermore, in resurrecting the dead humanity, God put Himself into man. Now this man is regenerated and uplifted, having all that God is within him. The entire God has entered into this resurrected, regenerated, and uplifted man. This man is what the Bible calls the new man (Eph. 4:24).</P><P>God's intention is no longer with the old man. In the sight of God, the old man has been finished, terminated, and thus he no longer exists. In His redemption God's eyes are always on the new man. We all need to see this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Redemption Being according to His Economy</H2><P>God's redemption is according to His economy. In one sense, God's redemption has already been accomplished, but the application, or the practice, of God's redemption requires a long process. In the view of God's economy, we became fallen in Adam six thousand years ago (Rom. 5:12); Christ as the Lamb of God was slain from the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8); and we were regenerated through Christ's resurrection almost two thousand years ago. This is the view according to God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Sealed with the Spirit until the Day of Redemption</H2><P>Nevertheless, it takes time in God's economy for us to experience the redemption in Christ's death, in Christ's resurrection, and in the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. We were sealed by the Spirit when we were saved initially, and this sealing will proceed until the day of redemption (Eph. 4:30). Redemption here does not mean to redeem our spirit or our soul but to redeem our body. Our body still remains unredeemed. Redemption in its entirety was accomplished by God in an instant, but in practice and application redemption is still not finished.</P><P>When I believed in the Lord Jesus, I experienced His redemption in His death, but at that time I did not know redemption through resurrection. Then I began to love the Lord, to seek after Him, and to love the Bible. I studied the Bible for many years and eventually learned that redemption is not only through His death; it is also through His resurrection. Without Christ's resurrection God as life could not germinate us from death (1 Pet. 1:3).</P><P>After my initial salvation, through more than seventy years I have learned one lesson: to follow the Spirit, to walk in, according to, and with the Spirit, to be in the Spirit and with the Spirit, and to be mingled and mingling with the Spirit. I am still learning this. In recent months I have often confessed, saying, "Lord, I am sorry that I did not do this according to Your Spirit. O Lord, forgive me. When I spoke to my wife, I did not speak according to Your Spirit." I have not finished learning this lesson.</P><P>In the last step of His redemption, God will redeem our body at the fullness of the times. At Christ's coming He will transfigure our body (Phil. 3:21). That will be the completion of God's redemption.</P><P>We have not yet been fully redeemed, but we are on the way. On the one hand, the Bible says that we have been redeemed (1 Pet. 1:18-19). On the other hand, it says that we have been sealed by the Spirit until the day of redemption. Romans 8:23 says that we who have the firstfruits of the Spirit groan in ourselves, eagerly awaiting sonship, the redemption of our body. When others ask us if we have been redeemed, we should say, "Yes, I have been redeemed, yet I still need to be redeemed." Even if we have been redeemed in our spirit and our soul, we are still waiting to be redeemed in our body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God Being Patient with Us<br>and Doing Things Slowly</H2><P>When Paul received an abundance of revelations, having been caught away to the third heaven and to Paradise, God was concerned that he might become proud (2 Cor. 12:1-7). Therefore, Paul was given a thorn in his flesh by a messenger of Satan. This was permitted by God, and it was a real perfection to Paul, who had not yet been purified and could have become proud. Thus, God purified him, perfected him, by an affliction in his body. This is God's economy. Our God is omnipotent, yet for us He has to be very patient and do things slowly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Outer Man Decaying<br>and the Inner Man Being Renewed Day by Day</H2><P>Second Corinthians 4 tells us that "though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day" (v. 16). Day after day our outer man is decaying, being consumed, and our inner man is being renewed. This indicates that it is not easy for God to renew us. This cannot be accomplished just by our prayer. God needs to use His "therapy" to renew us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PLACE OF THE BOOK OF PROVERBS<br>IN GOD'S ECONOMY</H2><P>Now we can see the place of the book of Proverbs in God's economy. According to His economy Proverbs should not be used to build up the old man. The big proverbs, like nuggets, and the small ones, like gems, are not for us to build up our old man, to cultivate our self and our natural man. Rather, they are for us to build up our new man. It is for this purpose that they are useful. While we are still living in this body, we need Proverbs to give us instructions on how to live rightly in so many aspects, in order to build up our new man.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF ECCLESIASTES</H1>

<H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE ONE</H1>

<H1 CLASS=TITLE>VANITY OF VANITIES</H1>

<H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1>

<H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eccl. 1:1-11</H1>

<P>In this message we will give an introductory word to the life-study of Ecclesiastes and then begin to consider the book itself.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. AN INTRODUCTORY WORD</H2>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Title</H2>

<P>Ecclesiastes in Hebrew is Qohelet, meaning "preacher" (or "teacher"), one who gathered and spoke to an assembly of the children of Israel.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Writer</H2>

<P>The writer of Ecclesiastes was the wise King Solomon (1:1, 12; 12:9; cf. 1 Kings 4:32).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Time</H2>

<P>The time of writing was about 977 B.C., after Solomon's fall.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Place</H2>

<P>The place of writing was Jerusalem (Eccl. 1:1, 12).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Contents</H2>

<P>The contents of Ecclesiastes are a description by Solomon, after his falling away from God and returning back to God, concerning the human life of fallen mankind under the sun, which is in the corrupted world. He set his heart to seek and to search out all that is done under the heavens, and he observed that according to the natural phenomena all the things done in cycle remain the same, generation after generation, all wearisome and nothing new. In his conclusion, this is all vanity of vanities and a chasing after wind to the human life of fallen mankind. Such a conclusion of the wise king by his wisdom may be considered a history of the vain life of a fallen man. His conclusion in this book is like a dirge to a man whose end is in misery.</P>

<P>According to Ecclesiastes, human history, from its beginning to the present, is vanity. Because creation has been made subject to vanity and to the slavery of corruption, everything under the sun is vanity. Paul's word concerning this in Romans 8:20-21 corresponds to Ecclesiastes. Today everyone is actually not living but dying. We have been born to die; that is, we have been dying since the day of our birth. From this we see that human life under the sun is vanity of vanities.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Central Thought</H2>

<P>Solomon had unequaled wisdom, the supreme position, unsurpassed wealth, and hundreds of wives and concubines, and fell in the indulgence of his lust to an unparalleled extent. Through all the positive and negative experiences of the human life under the sun, his thought was deeply impressed and occupied with the central thought of this book, that is, the vanity of vanities of the human life under the sun in its falling away from God. Man was created by God with the highest and most noble purpose, that is, to express Him in the resemblance of Him in His life, nature, and expression. But God's enemy, Satan the devil, came in to inject himself as sin into the man created by God for His purpose. Through this fall of man, man and all the created things that had been committed by God to his dominion were brought into the slavery of corruption, made subject to vanity (Rom. 8:20-21). Thus, the human life in the corrupted world also became a vanity, a chasing after wind. The writer Solomon had fully realized this and stressed this to the uttermost in his description. Yet he was not fully disappointed in this, but rather he instructed men that there is a way to get out of this vanity, that is, to come back to God and take God as man's everything, redemption, life, wealth, enjoyment, pleasure, and satisfaction, that man still may be used by God to fulfill His original purpose in man for the fulfillment of His eternal economy (Eccl. 12:13-14).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE BOOK ITSELF</H2>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Opening Word</H2>

<P>Ecclesiastes 1:1-11 is the opening word.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Writer</H2>

<P>Verse 1 indicates that the writer was Solomon, the son of David, king in Jerusalem&#151;the Preacher.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Theme</H2>

<P>In verses 2 through 11 we see that the theme of this book is vanity of vanities.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. All the Works of Man<br>
under the Sun Being Done in Cycle</H2>

<P>All the works of man under the sun are done in cycle (vv. 3-4). Every day the sun rises and goes down. Every year one season follows another. Parents bring forth children and eventually die. The children grow and bring forth children of their own, and then they die. The cycle goes on and on, with nothing new.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. All Remaining the Same</H2>

<P>All remain the same, generation after generation, like the phenomena in nature (vv. 4-7).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. All Being Wearisome</H2>

<P>All are wearisome, nothing is satisfying, nothing is new, and nothing is remembered (vv. 8-11).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Writer's Experiments</H2>

<P>Ecclesiastes 1:12&#151;6:12 is a lengthy section concerned with the writer's experiments.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. In Wisdom and Knowledge</H2>

<P>The first experiment is in wisdom and knowledge (1:12-18). The writer says that it is grievous travail that God has given to the children of men to travail in (v. 13). What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannot be counted (v. 15). In much wisdom is much vexation, and the increase of knowledge increases sorrow (v. 18). To know wisdom and to know madness and folly also are a chasing after wind (v. 17).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. In Pleasure</H2>

<P>In 2:1-11 we have the experiment in pleasure, in particular of enjoyment (vv. 1-2), drinking (v. 3), building and planting (vv. 4-6), possessions (v. 7), silver and gold (v. 8a), music (v. 8b), and the delights in concubine after concubine (v. 8c). Solomon's unparalleled experiences of these pleasures with his wisdom were all found by him to be vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was no advantage under the sun (vv. 9-11).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. In Being a Wise Man or a Fool</H2>

<P>Verses 12 through 26 describe the experiment in being a wise man or a fool.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. To Be a Wise Man Being Better than to Be a Fool</H2>

<P>To be a wise man is better than to be a fool, but after death both become a vanity, a chasing after wind. So Solomon hated life under the sun which was grievous to him (vv. 12-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Solomon, as a Man Who Labored, Leaving<br>
the Issue of His Labor to One Who Had Not Labored</H2>

<P>Solomon, as a man who had labored with wisdom, knowledge, skill, and striving and would leave the issue of his labor to a man who had not labored, hated all his labor under the sun and despaired of it because he would leave his gain to the man after him, considering it a great evil, sorrow, and vexation that caused his heart to have no rest in the night. Hence, all this was vanity and a chasing after wind to him (vv. 18-23).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Solomon Recognizing What Is from the Hand of God</H2>

<P>Solomon considered that nothing is better for man than to eat, drink, and make his soul taste enjoyment in his labor and recognized that this is from the hand of God, who gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy to the man who is good in His sight (3:13; 5:18-20), but to the sinner, the travail of gathering and heaping up for him who is good in God's sight. To him this also was vanity and a chasing after wind (2:24-26).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. In Fate under God's Sovereignty</H2>

<P>In 3:1-15 we have a word regarding the experiment in fate under God's sovereignty.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. There Being a Season for Everything</H2>

<P>There is a season for everything, appointed by God. What profit does the worker have in all that he labors? (vv. 1-9).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Reasons Why God<br>
Appointed a Season for Everything</H2>

<P>Solomon goes on to list the reasons why God appointed a season for everything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) God Having Given the Children of Men to Travail</H2>

<P>God has given the children of men to travail in travail (v. 10).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) God Having Put Eternity in Man's Heart</H2>

<P>God has made everything beautiful in its own time and has put eternity (an aspiration for the things in eternity) in man's heart, yet so that man does not find out what God has done from the beginning to the end (v. 11). In His creation of man, God put something into man which Solomon called "eternity." This means that in man there is a kind of aspiration for God, an aspiration for something eternal. Physical things may be enjoyable, but they are temporal.</P>

<P>Many successful people can testify that when they were endeavoring to advance in their career, they sensed that there was an emptiness within them. They began to realize that they were seeking something eternal. After they gained something they wanted, they felt that it was nothing. This feeling comes from the aspiration in man's heart for something eternal.</P>

<P>According to our own experience we know that whenever we have a success in our human life, we also have an empty feeling. This indicates that within man there is an aspiration for eternal things. God has put such an aspiration, such a seeking, in man's heart so that he will seek God. Every person, especially every thoughtful person, has within him this longing and seeking for eternity.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) There Being Nothing Better for Man<br>
than to Rejoice and Do Good in His Lifetime</H2>

<P>Verses 12 and 13 say that there is nothing better for man than to rejoice and do good in his lifetime, eating, drinking, and tasting enjoyment in all his labor; it is the gift of God.</P>

<P>God created man for Himself, but man was seduced by Satan to give God up, and thus man became fallen. Nevertheless, God still blesses man so that he may have a good living and enjoy various material things. By blessing man with material things, God maintains the existence of mankind from generation to generation. God has preserved man in this way for the sake of the redemption of His chosen ones.</P>

<P>Apart from God's blessing no one could bear to live on earth. On the one hand, everything under the sun is vanity of vanities and is subject to the slavery of corruption. On the other hand, certain things in human life, such as education, work, and marriage, are still very appealing. If we did not strive to gain an education or to succeed in our work or to have a good married life and family life, we might be tempted to commit suicide. God uses man's striving for these things in order to keep man on earth. If mankind ceased to exist, God could not gain His chosen ones from among the fallen human race. If mankind had been terminated, Christ could not have come, for there would have been no lineage for His incarnation.</P>

<P>Although man is fallen, God continues to bless man, causing the sun to shine and the rain to fall and maintaining a proper order in the universe. As a result, people have the desire to go on living. In this way mankind is preserved for God to fulfill His purpose in choosing us before the foundation of the earth.</P>

<P>We were born at the right time and in the right place. Therefore, we all are here today for God's purpose. Without God's sovereign preservation of physical, human life, none of us could exist for His purpose. I believe that this is the correct understanding of Solomon's thought when he wrote that "every man should eat and drink and taste enjoyment in all his labor; it is the gift of God" (v. 13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>4) God Having Appointed<br>
All Things Which Are in the Present<br>
and Which Will Be in the Future</H2>

<P>God, in His sovereignty over all, has appointed all things which are in the present and which will be in the future and seeks to reemploy the things which took place in the past. Whatever God does will be forever; nothing can be added to it, nor can anything be taken from it, that all would fear Him that they may have His wisdom to realize the real meaning of human life (vv. 14-15).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. In Ranks and Classes in Human Society</H2>

<P>Ecclesiastes 3:16&#151;4:16 is concerned with Solomon's experiment in ranks and classes in human society.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Judgment of God Bringing the Righteous Down</H2>

<P>The judgment of God in the appointed time brings the righteous down to the same level as the wicked (3:16-17).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. God Proving That Men Are But Beasts</H2>

<P>This is for God to prove that men are but beasts, bringing men down to the same level as beasts. Thus, there is nothing better than that a man take his portion to rejoice in his works, for who will bring him to see what will be after him? (vv. 18-22).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Oppressed Being in Tears<br>
and the Oppressors Having Power</H2>

<P>The oppressed are in tears and the oppressors have power, but both have no comforter. Solomon praised the dead more than the living and even the more the one who has not yet been and has not seen the evil work under the sun (4:1-3).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. All Labor and All Skill in Work<br>
Causing Man's Jealousy for His Neighbor</H2>

<P>All labor and all skill in work cause man's jealousy for his neighbor. The fool folds his hands together and consumes his own flesh. One handful with quietness is better than two hands full with labor. All these are vanity and a chasing after wind (vv. 4-6).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. One Who Is Alone and without a Second</H2>

<P>One who is alone and without a second, having no son or brother, labors without end. His eye is not satisfied with riches, but he labors and deprives himself for no one. Two are better than one, and three are even better than two (vv. 7-12).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. A Poor but Wise Youth<br>
Being Better than an Old and Foolish King</H2>

<P>A poor but wise youth is better than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to be admonished (vv. 13-16).</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF ECCLESIASTES</H1>

<H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWO</H1>

<H1 CLASS=TITLE>VANITY OF VANITIES</H1>

<H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1>

<H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eccl. 12:13-14</H1>

<P>In this message we will continue to consider the writer's experiments and then go on to see his searching and testing.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. In Contacting God</H2>

<P>Ecclesiastes 5:1-7 describes the writer's experiment in contacting God.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. In the View of Caution</H2>

<P>Solomon's word here is not in the view of encouragement but in the view of caution. This is different from the view of the apostle Paul in encouraging the believers to approach God for receiving mercy and finding grace for timely help (Heb. 4:16).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Guarding Our Steps<br>
When We Go to the House of God</H2>

<P>Ecclesiastes 5:1a cautions us to guard our steps when we go to the house of God.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Drawing Near to Listen</H2>

<P>Verse 1b charges us to draw near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools, who do not know that they are doing evil.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. Not Being Rash with Our Mouth</H2>

<P>We should not be rash with our mouth and not let our heart hastily utter anything before God, for God is in heaven and we are on the earth. Therefore, we should let our words be few, unlike the fool's multitude of words (vv. 2-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. Not Delaying in Paying Our Vow to God</H2>

<P>Verses 4 through 6 tell us not to delay in paying our vow to God. It is better that we not vow than that we vow and not pay.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. Fearing God</H2>

<P>Verse 7 says, "For in the multitude of dreams and in many words are also vanities. Rather, fear God."</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. In Sundry Illustrations</H2>

<P>In 5:8-17 and 6:1-12 we have sundry illustrations of various things in human life that are vanity.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. A Poor Man Being Oppressed<br>
under the Wresting of Justice and Righteousness</H2>

<P>In a province a poor man is oppressed under the wresting of justice and righteousness, although there are ranks of officials who should attend to this matter and even there is a king who is used to doing things for the advantage of the land. This is vanity (5:8-9).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Ones Who Love Silver Not Being Satisfied</H2>

<P>The ones who love silver and love abundance with income will not be satisfied, and the fullness of the rich will not let him sleep. This is also vanity (vv. 10-12).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Rich Man Keeping His Riches to His Hurt</H2>

<P>The rich man keeps his riches to his own hurt, and his riches are lost in a bad venture and nothing is left for his son. He has labored for the wind, eating in darkness and having much vexation and sickness and resentment. This is a grievous evil and is also vanity (vv. 13-17).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. An Evil That Is Heavy upon Man</H2>

<P>According to 6:1-2 an evil that is heavy upon man concerns a man to whom God gives riches, wealth, and honor. God does not empower him to eat of it, but a stranger eats it. This is vanity and an evil plague.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. A Man Whose Soul Is Not Filled with Good</H2>

<P>A man begets a hundred children and lives many years, but his soul is not filled with good and he even does not get a proper burial. He is worse off than a stillborn. This is also vanity (vv. 3-6).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. Man Laboring for His Mouth,<br>
yet His Soul Not Being Filled</H2>

<P>Man labors for his mouth, yet his soul is not filled. What advantage, then, does the wise man have over the fool? And what advantage does the poor man have in knowing how to walk before the living? All these are vanity and a chasing after wind (vv. 7-9).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. There Being Many Things Which Will Increase Vanity</H2>

<P>In verse 12 the writer asks, "Who knows what is good for a man in life during the few days of his vain life, which he will spend as a shadow?" There are many things which will increase vanity. What is the advantage to man? (v. 11).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Solomon Encouraging the Fallen Men<br>
to Enjoy What God Has Given Them</H2>

<P>In all his experiments Solomon encouraged, according to God's economy, the fallen men under the sun to enjoy what God has given to them that they may exist and afford God the opportunity to carry out His eternal purpose in choosing and predestinating them for the issue of the Body of Christ and to maintain the fallen man of God's old creation to be the provision for God to bring in His new creation in Christ out of the old creation (2:24; 3:13; 5:18-20; 8:15; 9:7-10). This is proved by the apostle Paul's preaching in Acts 14:15-17 and 17:24-31.</P>

<P>Here we should note that for us to live a life that we may testify Christ and minister Christ to others to glorify God, we need the material things and physical matters. But we should not be attracted, captured, and usurped by them. If we are usurped by them, we will suffer their vanity. We are living in the world and passing through the "vanity fair," but we should not linger in it for its vainglory. Today all things of the old creation are under the slavery of corruption. If we do not escape "the corruption which is in the world by lust" (2 Pet. 1:4), we will share in its vanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Writer's Searching and Testing</H2>

<P>In 7:1&#151;12:12 we have the writer's searching and testing.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Searching and Testing<br>
All Things of the Fallen Human Life</H2>

<P>The writer searched and tested all things of the fallen human life under the sun (7:23-29; 8:9, 16; 12:9-10).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. All Things Being Vanity of Vanities</H2>

<P>All the things under the sun, regardless of the kind of persons involved, wise or foolish, diligent or lazy, rich or poor, old or young, high or low, righteous or wicked, good or sinful, clean or unclean, and regardless of how they were born, how they worked, how they died, and how their end was, all are vanity of vanities (7:6, 15; 8:10, 14; 9:9; 11:8, 10; 12:8).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Proverbs, Words of Wisdom, Being Produced<br>
out of the Writer's Searching and Testing</H2>

<P>Proverbs, words of wisdom, were produced out of the writer's searching and testing (7:1-9, 11-12, 14-17; 8:1b, 5b, 8; 9:4b, 7-12, 16-18; 10:1-2, 4b, 8-14a, 18-20; 11:1, 3-8; 12:11, 12b). All these proverbs are good for building up the character of one who lives a better human life, but they do not have the function to afford the growth in the divine life for the building up of the Body of Christ. Yet, for the building up of the Body of Christ there is the need of a proper character, not by self-cultivation but by the Spirit's anointing under the work of the cross of Christ with the rich elements of Christ (Gal. 5:16; 2:20; Phil. 1:19-21).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. What God Is to Man</H2>

<P>The writer searched and tested what God is to man.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. God Creating Man</H2>

<P>God created man, so God is the Sovereign over man (Eccl. 7:29; 12:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. All Things concerning Man<br>
Being in the Hand of God</H2>

<P>All things concerning man are in the hand of God, and God is inscrutable in His doings (9:1; 8:17; 7:13-14; 11:5).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. God Judging Man in Everything</H2>

<P>God will judge man in everything (3:17; 11:9; 12:14; Matt. 12:36; Rom. 2:5, 16; Acts 17:31; Rev. 20:11-13).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. God Giving Man a Portion<br>
in Human Life for Him to Enjoy and Exist</H2>

<P>God gives man a portion in human life for him to enjoy and exist that God could have an opportunity to call out some for the carrying out of His eternal selection and predestination for the accomplishment of His eternal economy (Eccl. 8:15).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. What Man Should Be to God</H2>

<P>The writer also searched and tested what man should be to God.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Fearing God</H2>

<P>Man should fear God that he may gain the wisdom from God to know how to live the human life and to know God further (7:18b; 8:12-13; 12:13).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Repenting to God</H2>

<P>Man, being fallen from the God-created good condition into his schemes (7:29b) and having a heart full of evil (9:3), not one of whom is righteous, does good, and does not sin (7:20), should repent to God and receive the Redeemer whom God has prepared for him (Job 19:25).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Enjoying God's Provision</H2>

<P>Man should enjoy God's provision for his living and the marriage life for man's existence and multiplication to replenish the earth (Gen. 1:28) that it may be possible for God to save some of them in order to produce the church&#151;the Body of Christ&#151;which will issue in the New Jerusalem as God's eternal enlargement and expression according to God's eternal economy (Eccl. 9:7-10).</P>

<P>The unveiling of the above points of the writer's experiments and searching and testing should not be considered the divine revelation from God, though they are included in the Scriptures. They are the conclusion of the writer's research in his experiments of the fallen men's human life under the sun. All the concluding words may be considered as proverbs, words of wisdom, directing the fallen and aim-missing men to return to God and receive Him according to His New Testament economy in His Son as their Redeemer and life that they may be regenerated to be the God-men for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Advice to Young Men</H2>

<P>In 11:9&#151;12:1 the writer gives advice to young men.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Young Men Endeavoring<br>
to Enjoy the Human Life in Their Youth</H2>

<P>Young men should endeavor to enjoy the human life in their youth in the light of God's judgment to remove vexation from their heart and put away evil from their flesh (11:9-10).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Remembering Their Creator While They Are Young</H2>

<P>Young men should remember their Creator while they are young and not hesitate in this until old age comes (12:1).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Sad Portrait of Man's Old Age</H2>

<P>In 12:2-8 the writer shows us the sad portrait of man's old age. The bright environment with the three lights created by God and the artificial ones made by man becomes gloomy, and the pleasant atmosphere of the clear sky is cloudy (v. 2). The hands, the keepers of the house, tremble (v. 3a). The loins, the men of strength, are bent (v. 3b). The teeth become few (v. 3c), the eyes become dim (v. 3d), and the ears become dull to sound (v. 4a). One awakens early in the morning (v. 4b). The vocal cords become low (v. 4c). One is afraid of what is high (v. 5a) and is terrified in walking (v. 5b). The hair becomes white (v. 5c). One is unable to bear any burden, even any as small as a grasshopper (v. 5d). No medicine can keep the old man away from death, and mourners attend his funeral (v. 5e). The corpse&#151;the spinal cord (the silver cord), the head (the golden bowl), the lungs (the pitcher), and the heart (the wheel)&#151;decays (v. 6). The body made of dust returns to the earth, and the breath returns to God who gave it (v. 7; Gen. 2:7). This indicates that the entire human being with his human life apart from God is nothing but vanity of vanity (Eccl. 12:8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Concluding Word</H2>

<P>In 12:13-14 we have the writer's concluding word.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Writer's Intention</H2>

<P>The writer's intention is to lead men to fear God that God may eventually show them His New Testament economy concerning the producing of His church, the Body of Christ, which consummates in the New Jerusalem as God's eternal enlargement and expression (v. 13).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God Judging Men<br>
in This Age and at His Great White Throne</H2>

<P>God will judge men in this age for their deeds, even every secret thing, according to good or evil, and at His great white throne for their eternal destiny (v. 14; Rev. 20:11-15).</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF SONG OF SONGS</H1>

<H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE ONE</H1>

<H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN INTRODUCTORY WORD<br>
AND<br>
DRAWN TO PURSUE CHRIST FOR SATISFACTION</H1>

<H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1>

<H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: S.S. 1:1-8</H1>

<P>At the beginning of this life-study of Song of Songs, I would like to offer a word of appreciation and memorial of and an expression of gratitude to Brother Watchman Nee. The outline with all the headings and subtitles and the interpretation of figures in this present life-study of Song of Songs are based on Brother Nee's particular study with a few co-workers in May 1935, in which I participated as one of not more than ten attendants, in a hotel on the shore of West Lake of the city of Hangchow, close to Shanghai.</P>

<P>The theme of Song of Songs is satisfaction of satisfactions. This book portrays the four stages in the experience of the lover of Christ and can be summarized by the following four sentences:</P>

<P>(1) A lover of Christ should be one who is attracted by His love and drawn by Him in His sweetness to pursue after Him for full satisfaction.</P>

<P>(2) A lover of Christ should be one who is called by Him to be delivered from the self through his oneness with the cross of Christ.</P>

<P>(3) A lover of Christ should be one who is called by Him to live in ascension as the new creation of God in the resurrection of Christ.</P>

<P>(4) A lover of Christ should be one who is called by Him more strongly to live within the veil through His cross after the lover's experience of His resurrection.</P>

<P>In the first stage the lover of Christ is attracted by Christ to follow Him. In the second stage the lover of Christ experiences the cross for the breaking of the self. The cross saves us from the self in order to get us out of ourselves. In the third stage the lover of Christ lives in ascension. To live in ascension is to experience the new creation of God in Christ's resurrection. In the fourth stage the lover of Christ lives within the veil, in the inner chamber of the whole universe, the Holy of Holies. In experience the cross comes first, followed by resurrection and ascension. Yet the experience of ascension is not sufficient. After ascension there is still the need of another following stage&#151;living within the veil through further experience of the cross.</P>

<P>In Song of Songs, a book of poetry, we cannot find the words cross, resurrection, and ascension. Neither do we have the expressions new creation or within the veil. How, then, can we say that this book unveils different stages of the Christian life? If we would answer this question, we need to see that in Song of Songs the stages of the Christian life are revealed, or unveiled, through many different figures. The word cross is not used, but there are figures of the cross. In like manner, instead of the words resurrection and ascension, there are figures of resurrection and ascension. There are also figures signifying the new creation and the life within the veil. In reading this book, the hardest thing is to interpret the figures.</P>

<P>In this message we will first give an introductory word and then begin to consider the first stage&#151;the stage of being drawn to pursue Christ for satisfaction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AN INTRODUCTORY WORD</H2>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. A Particular Book</H2>

<P>Song of Songs is a particular book in the holy Scriptures, for it is not a book of history, law, prophecy, or gospel.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. A Poem of the History of Love<br>
in an Excellent Marriage</H2>

<P>This book is a poem of the history of love in an excellent marriage. It is a romance of the highest standard. The entire Bible is a romance, a love story, of God "falling in love" with man.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>a. A History of King Solomon<br>
with the Shulammite</H2>

<P>Song of Songs is a history of the wise King Solomon, the writer of this book, with the Shulammite, a girl of the countryside. In this life-study Solomon is called the beloved and the Shulammite is called the lover (lit., "love"&#151;1:15; 2:2; 4:1, 7; 6:4). Solomon, in the masculine gender, means "peace," and Shulammite is Solomon in the feminine gender. One is the king in the palace at the capital in Jerusalem, and the other is a girl from the countryside.</P>

<P>In a sense, Solomon and the Shulammite were not a match. Concerning marriage most would agree that two people should match each other. Yet it is difficult to find a husband and wife who are really a match. Two people who are the same may become enemies, but two people who are different may become loving friends. Solomon fell in love with a country girl, and the two of them were joined together. After their union they remained in communion all the time.</P>

<P>In a similar way, God fell in love with man. Since God is great and wise and we are small and unwise, we may find it hard to believe that God could fall in love with us. Yet even though man does not seem to match God, God has nonetheless fallen in love with man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>b. A Portrait of the Love of Christ<br>
in His Union<br>
with His Individual Believers</H2>

<P>Song of Songs is a portrait of the love of Christ in His union with His individual believers. The entire New Testament stresses the Body life, not the individual life (Rom. 12:4-5; 1 Cor. 12:27). But Song of Songs stresses not the Body corporately but the believer individually. To have the Body life, we must have individual contact with the Lord. Without the individual fellowship with the Lord as a base, we cannot have the proper Body life.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>1) God Loving His Elect Israel<br>
as a Husband Loving His Wife</H2>

<P>As the record of a divine romance, the Bible first shows us that God loves His elect Israel as a Husband who loves His wife (Isa. 54:5-7; Jer. 2:2; 3:1; Ezek. 16:8; Hosea 2:19-20). Israel was a bride and God Himself was the Bridegroom. Thus, there was a bridal love between God and Israel.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>2) Christ Loving His Church<br>
as a Husband Loving His Wife</H2>

<P>Second, the Bible reveals that Christ loves His church as a Husband loves His wife (Eph. 5:25, 31-32; Rev. 19:7-9; 21:2, 9). In Revelation 19 we see that Christ will have His wedding feast with His overcomers as His bride, and His wedding day will be for a thousand years. Then in the new heaven and new earth, all of His believers as the New Jerusalem will be the wife of the Lamb. The New Jerusalem will be the corporate wife of Christ, the Lamb.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>3) The Believers Having Been Betrothed<br>
to Christ as Pure Virgins</H2>

<P>According to Paul's word in 2 Corinthians 11:2, the believers have been betrothed to Christ as pure virgins. In this sense, all the believers of Christ are female. Spiritually, we all, brothers and sisters alike, are virgins betrothed to Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. The Contents</H2>

<P>The contents of Song of Songs are the progressive experience of an individual believer's loving fellowship with Christ. To use Hudson Taylor's expression, this is a book of union and communion with Christ.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>4. The Sections</H2>

<P>The sections of Song of Songs, which are according to the intrinsic and spiritual significance of this book, are as follows: drawn to pursue Christ for satisfaction (1:2&#151;2:7); called to be delivered from the self through the oneness with the cross (2:8&#151;3:5); called to live in ascension as the new creation in resurrection (3:6&#151;5:1); called more strongly to live within the veil through the cross after resurrection (5:2&#151;6:13); sharing in the work of the Lord (7:1-13); and hoping to be raptured (8:1-14).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. ATTRACTED TO PURSUE AFTER CHRIST</H2>

<P>Let us now begin to see how the seeker is drawn to pursue Christ for satisfaction (1:2-4a).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Lover's Yearning</H2>

<P>"Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!/For your love is better than wine./Your anointing oils have a pleasant fragrance;/Your name is like ointment poured forth;/Therefore the virgins love you" (vv. 2-3). These verses express the lover's yearning.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Yearning to Be Kissed by Christ</H2>

<P>The lover of Christ yearns to be kissed by Christ with the kisses of His mouth (v. 2a). The kisses of the mouth are the most intimate kiss. This yearning to be kissed by Christ is a response to Christ's cheering love, which is better than wine (v. 2b), and to His charming name (person), which is like ointment poured forth with the pleasant fragrance of the anointing oils (v. 3a).</P>

<P>Song of Songs is composed of many figures. The first figure is the wine which cheers people up. The wine here signifies Christ's cheering love. When we are down, if we consider Christ's love, we will be cheered. The second figure is ointment. His charming name, which signifies His person, is like ointment poured forth. No one can resist His cheering love and His charming person.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Because of His Cheering Love<br>
and Charming Name,<br>
All the Chaste Believers Loving Him</H2>

<P>Because of His cheering love and charming name, all the chaste believers love Him (v. 3b). We all would condemn a man who attracts many young women to pursue him. But with Christ it is different. The more chaste lovers of Christ there are, the better.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Lover's Pursuing</H2>

<P>In verse 4a we have a word concerning the lover's pursuing: "Draw me; we will run after you." In her pursuit of Christ, she asks Him to draw her that she and her companions may run after Him. Everyone who is drawn by Christ will have companions in following Him. Since I was drawn by the Lord, many have followed the Lord with me. Consider the situation with Peter when he, a fisherman, was called by the Lord (Matt. 4:18-20). One day Christ the Beloved came, and Peter was charmed by Him and he left the nets and followed Him. Many followed Christ as Peter's companions. When we are drawn to follow Christ, we become a factor in others' following of Him.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. FELLOWSHIPPING WITH CHRIST<br>
RESULTING IN ENTERING INTO THE CHURCH LIFE</H2>

<P>In Song of Songs 1:4b-8 we see that fellowshipping with Christ results in entering into the church life. The church life is indicated by another figure&#151;the flock (vv. 7-8), which signifies the church as a collection of many believers.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Beloved Bringing Her into Her Spirit<br>
as the Holiest of All for Fellowship</H2>

<P>The Beloved brings her into her spirit as the Holiest of all (His chambers) for fellowship. The word spirit is not used here, but it is signified by the word chambers in verse 4. Our spirit as Christ's dwelling place (2 Tim. 4:22) becomes His Holy of Holies (Heb. 10:19) for fellowship.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. She and Her Companions Extolling<br>
His Love with Joy and Rejoicing</H2>

<P>In fellowship with Christ, the lover and her companions extol His love with joy and rejoicing, for rightly do they love Him (v. 4b).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Seeing Her Self That She Is Sinful<br>
in Adam but Justified in Christ</H2>

<P>She sees her self that she is sinful in Adam, but she is justified in Christ (vv. 5-6a). Her being sinful in Adam is signified by her being black like the tents of Kedar. Her being justified in Christ is signified by her being lovely like the curtains of Solomon. The tents are under the sunshine, but the curtains are within the inner chamber.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. She Being Instructed by Him<br>
in the Way to Enter into the Church Life</H2>

<P>In her fellowship with Christ, she is also instructed by Him in the way to enter into the church life (vv. 6b-8).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Persecuted by Her Denominational Brothers</H2>

<P>She was persecuted by her denominational brothers (her mother's sons&#151;v. 6b), and she was turned away from the church by the flocks of His companions (v. 7b). She was persecuted by her denominational brothers, though they also were born by grace&#151;the same mother (v. 6b)&#151;and she was turned away from the church. This is the situation today.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. He Telling Her to Follow Him<br>
on the Footsteps of the Church</H2>

<P>The Beloved tells her to follow Him on the footsteps of the church (flock) and pasture her spiritual children (young goats) at the local churches (the shepherds' tents), where He pastures His church (vv. 7-8). She prayed, "Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock?" Then Christ answered, "If you yourself do not know,/You fairest among women,/Go forth on the footsteps of the flock." To follow on the footsteps of the flock is to follow the church. We can testify that many times we did not know where Christ was, but as we followed the church, we found Him. When we find the church, we bring all the younger ones, indicated by the young goats, to the church as well.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. It Being Wonderful<br>
That the Fellowship of the Lover with Christ<br>
Results in the Church Life</H2>

<P>It is wonderful that the fellowship of the lover with Christ results in the church life.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF SONG OF SONGS</H1>

<H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWO</H1>

<H1 CLASS=TITLE>DRAWN TO PURSUE CHRIST FOR SATISFACTION</H1>

<H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1>

<H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: S.S. 1:9&#151;2:7</H1>

<P>In 1:2-4a we see that the lover of Christ yearned for Christ, sought Him, and was attracted by His love and drawn by Him in His sweetness to run after Him. Christ is pleasant, sweet, and full of fragrance as ointment. Furthermore, His love is cheering, better than wine. All the lovers of Christ are attracted and constrained by His love (2 Cor. 5:14).</P>

<P>In Song of Songs 1:4b-8 the Beloved answered His lover's yearning and seeking and brought her into the inner chamber (her spirit) to have intimate fellowship. That fellowship led the lover of Christ to enter into the church life, signified by the flock (v. 8; John 10:16). After the lovers of Christ enter into the church life, they begin to be transformed by the Holy Spirit. Apart from the church life we cannot be transformed. The church life is a very important means used by the Holy Spirit to transform us. The Holy Spirit is transforming us with the saints in the church.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. TRANSFORMED BY THE REMAKING OF THE SPIRIT</H2>

<P>The lover of Christ is transformed by the remaking of the Spirit (S.S. 1:9-16a; 2:1-3a). The Spirit is the compound, all-inclusive, sevenfold intensified, life-giving, and indwelling Spirit, who is the consummation of the consummated Triune God. This Spirit is actually God Himself doing the work of transformation by remaking us. Transformation involves a metabolic process by which the Spirit remakes us. This metabolic transformation is now going on within us in the church life.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Lover of Christ Being Transformed<br>
from a Strong Natural Person into a Person Who Trusts in Him and Looks to Him with a Single Eye</H2>

<P>The lover of Christ is transformed from a strong natural person (a mare among Pharaoh's chariots&#151;1:9) into a person who lives a life not relying upon herself but trusting in Him (lily&#151;2:1-2; Matt. 6:28) and looking to Him with a single eye (eyes like doves&#151;S.S. 1:15b; Matt. 10:16). At the beginning, the lover of Christ is strong naturally, like a mare among Pharaoh's chariots, but gradually she is transformed into a lily, one who is no longer full of natural strength but is full of life. Such a transformed one now looks to the Lord with a single eye. Her one goal, her one object, is the One whom she loves.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Beloved Appreciating Her Loveliness<br>
in Submission to Him</H2>

<P>"Your cheeks are lovely with plaits of ornaments,/Your neck with strings of jewels" (S.S. 1:10). Here the Beloved appreciates her loveliness in submission to Him (cheeks lovely with plaits of ornaments) and her beauty in obedience to the transforming Spirit (neck with strings of jewels). The expression of this lover of Christ is full of submission followed by obedience. When we submit to the Lord, we will surely obey Him.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Transforming Spirit<br>
and Her Companions Adorning Her<br>
with the Constitution of the Life of God<br>
by the Redeeming Work of Christ</H2>

<P>"We will make you plaits of gold/With studs of silver" (v. 11). The transforming Spirit and the lover's companions (we) will adorn her with the constitution of the life of God (plaits of gold) by the redeeming work of Christ (studs of silver). God's nature and Christ's redemption are put together by the Spirit and the companions to be her adornment. The Spirit transforms us, but the Spirit needs our companions to be His helpers. If we realize this, we will praise the Lord Spirit that He has given us many companions to be His helpers in transforming us.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. At the Table Where Christ<br>
Is Feasting with His Lover, Her Love toward Him<br>
Spreading Forth Its Fragrance</H2>

<P>"While the king was at his table,/My spikenard gave forth its fragrance" (v. 12). At the table where Christ is feasting with His lover (the king at his table), her love (spikenard) toward Him spreads forth its fragrance (cf. John 12:1-3). In the church life the small groups are often a feast with the Lord as the invisible guest. In the built-up vital groups, the lovers of Christ spontaneously spread their pleasant fragrance toward Christ.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. She Enjoying Him Privately in His Death<br>
in Her Embracing Love and Faith</H2>

<P>"My beloved is to me a bundle of myrrh/That lies at night between my breasts./My beloved is to me a cluster of henna flowers/In the vineyards of En-gedi" (S.S. 1:13-14). In these verses we see that she enjoys Him privately (at night) in His death (a bundle of myrrh) in her embracing with love and faith (breasts&#151;1 Tim. 1:14; 1 Thes. 5:8). Every lover of Christ is full of faith and love and embraces Him with faith and love. Furthermore, she enjoys Him publicly in His resurrection (a cluster of henna flowers) in the churches (vineyards) of Christ as the fountain of redemption (En-gedi&#151;"the fountain of the lamb"). In the churches Christ grows as clusters of henna flowers. In the churches there is also a fountain of redemption. The church is continually watered by the fountain of Christ's redemption. From this we see that a major part of our spiritual life is related to the church life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. He Appreciating Her Beauty in Her Looking<br>
to Him with a Single Eye by the Spirit</H2>

<P>"Oh, you are beautiful, my love!/Oh, you are beautiful! Your eyes are like doves" (S.S. 1:15). He appreciates her beauty in looking to Him with a single eye by the Spirit (eyes like doves&#151;v. 15). The first striking aspect of our beauty in the sight of the Lord Jesus is our single eye toward Him. By the Spirit we look to Him with a single eye.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. She Appreciating His Beauty<br>
in His Pleasantness</H2>

<P>The Beloved and the lover appreciate each other. "Oh, you are beautiful, my beloved; indeed, pleasant!" (v. 16a). In this verse she appreciates His beauty in His pleasantness.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. She Humbly Realizing<br>
That She Is a Small Person</H2>

<P>"I am a rose of Sharon,/A lily of the valleys" (2:1). The word for rose in this verse refers to a wild rose, despised in the land of Judea. Here the lover humbly realizes that she is but a small person, living on the one hand a pretty but despised life (rose) in the common world (Sharon, meaning "plain"), and on the other hand a pure and trusting life (lily) in the low place (valleys). This was her humble recognition and realization regarding herself.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. He Appreciating Her as His Love<br>
Who Lives a Pure and Trusting Life</H2>

<P>"As a lily among thorns,/So is my love among the daughters" (v. 2). Here He appreciates her as His love (Shulammite) among the world-loving adulteresses (daughters&#151;James 4:4) who lives a pure and trusting life (lily) among the filthy and unbelieving people (thorns).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. She Appreciating Him as the Source<br>
of Rich Provision Who Supplies Her in a Timely Way</H2>

<P>"As the apple tree among the trees of the wood,/So is my beloved among the sons" (S.S. 2:3a). Here she appreciates Him as the source of rich provision (apple tree) who supplies her in a timely way. The lover and the Beloved both have beauty, and they appreciate the beauty in each other. This shows us that transformation produces a mutual appreciation between Christ and His lover.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. SATISFIED WITH THE REST<br>
AND ENJOYMENT IN CHRIST</H2>

<P>The lover is satisfied with the rest and enjoyment in Christ (1:16b-17; 2:3b-7). Satisfaction requires two things&#151;rest and enjoyment. First, we need to rest and then, as we are at rest, we have some enjoyment. The issue of this rest and enjoyment is satisfaction.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. She Being Satisfied</H2>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. With Her Rest in His Feeding Life<br>
as the Resting Place in the Night<br>
in His Embracing and in His Death<br>
and His Resurrection as the Shelter</H2>

<P>She is satisfied with her rest in His feeding life (green) as the resting place in the night (couch) in His embracing (2:6) and in His death (cypresses) and His resurrection (cedars) as the shelter (beams and rafters&#151;1:16b-17). In typology, in figure, a cypress tree signifies Christ's death, and a cedar tree signifies Christ's resurrection, in which His humanity is high and uplifted. Christ's death and resurrection are a shelter with beams and rafters.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. With Her Delighting in Resting<br>
under Him as an Overshadowing Canopy in the Day<br>
and Her Tasting of Him as the Sweet, Timely Supply</H2>

<P>"In his shade I delighted and sat down,/And his fruit was sweet to my taste" (2:3b). This reveals that she is satisfied also with her delighting in resting under Him as an overshadowing canopy in the day (shade&#151;Isa. 4:5-6; 2 Cor. 12:9) and her tasting of Him as the sweet, timely supply (sweet fruit).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. With Triumphant Love Spread<br>
over Her in the Enjoyable Church Life</H2>

<P>"He brought me into the banqueting house,/And his banner over me was love./Sustain me with raisin cakes,/Refresh me with apples,/For I am sick with love" (S.S. 2:4-5). Here the lover is satisfied with triumphant love (banner of love) spread over her in the enjoyable church life (banqueting house), in which she is sustained with Him, Christ, as bread of life (John 6:35&#151;raisin cakes) and refreshed with Him as fruit of life (Rev. 2:7; 22:2&#151;apples) to heal her lovesickness. Christ sustains us with Himself as bread and refreshes us with Himself as fruit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. He Taking Care of Her Rest in Him</H2>

<P>"I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,/By the gazelles or by the hinds of the fields,/Not to rouse up or awaken my love/Until she pleases" (S.S. 2:7). Here we see that He takes care of her rest in Him.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Considering Her One Easily Stirred Up</H2>

<P>He considers her one easily stirred up (gazelles or hinds of the fields). Every lover of Christ is a person who can easily be stirred up.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Solemnly Charging the Meddling Believers</H2>

<P>He solemnly charges (adjure) the meddling believers (daughters of Jerusalem). Among the saints in the church life, there are a number of meddling brothers and sisters. They care about the things of others and not about their own need to love the Lord and to grow in the divine life. Such meddling ones are signified by the daughters of Jerusalem.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Not to Awaken Her<br>
from Her Experience of Christ in Resting in Him</H2>

<P>His charge is that no one awaken her from her present experience of Christ in resting in Him. In her Christian life she has reached the goal of resting in and experiencing Christ and being satisfied in the church life. Temporarily, Christ agrees with her situation and does not want anyone to awaken her. This is the end of the first stage of the Christian life of a lover of Christ.</P>

<P>Many of us can testify from experience that this truly is the situation. At this point we can say, "I am resting in Christ and I am enjoying Christ. I am covered by Him and I am in Him. His life is my couch, and His death and resurrection are the rafters which cover me. Here in the church life Christ's love is the banner spread over me. I am satisfied."</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Until She Feels Pleasant<br>
in Her Second Pursuit after Him</H2>

<P>He allows her to remain at rest until she feels pleasant in her second pursuit after Him (she pleases). As we will see when we come to the next section, Christ does not intend that His lover stay in this first stage. She needs to enter into the second stage of the Christian life of a lover of Christ&#151; the stage of experiencing the cross of Christ for the breaking of the self. The lover of Christ should not stay in the self, allowing the self to become the center, but should experience the breaking of the self by the cross.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF SONG OF SONGS</H1>

<H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THREE</H1>

<H1 CLASS=TITLE>CALLED TO BE DELIVERED FROM THE SELF<br>
THROUGH THE ONENESS WITH THE CROSS</H1>

<H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: S.S. 2:8&#151;3:5</H1>

<P>In Song of Songs 2:8&#151;3:5 the lover of Christ is called by Him to be delivered from the self through her oneness with the cross. This is the second stage in the experience of the lover of Christ. Three critical words help us to interpret this section: cross, self, and introspection.</P>

<P>The cross is signified by the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice (2:14). These are places of safety, but they are rugged, and few would be willing to go there. The clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice surely signify the cross as the place of safety for fallen man. The safest place for us to be is the cross.</P>

<P>Although the self has no figure in Song of Songs, according to Christian experience it is manifested in the second stage. In the first stage, the lover of Christ pursues Him, receives help in the fellowship in the inner chamber, and enters into the church life, where she experiences transformation. She enters into the rest and enjoyment of Christ for her full satisfaction. Then the self rises up, and the lover of Christ begins to care only for being perfect. This is the self.</P>

<P>The self is very subtle. In Matthew 16, after the Lord Jesus unveiled the way of the cross for the accomplishment of God's economy, Peter showed his love for the Lord by saying, "God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!" (v. 22). Peter thought that was his own word. Actually, Peter spoke from his self, which had become one with Satan. The Lord Jesus rebuked Peter saying, "Get behind Me, Satan!" (v. 23a). Then the Lord spoke about denying the self (v. 24). This reveals that the self is the satanic humanity; it is man possessed and usurped by Satan. As a result, man in his fallen humanity cares only for himself. Because everyone is for himself, selfishness is seen in all kinds of relationships&#151;between husband and wife, between children and parents, between employers and employees.</P>

<P>We should not think that we can become so spiritual that we no longer have a problem with the self. Even a lover of Christ, one who yearns for Him, seeks Him, and gains Him, is still troubled by the self. We still have a part of us that is fallen and satanic, and this part will remain with us until our physical body is redeemed, that is, until we will have been redeemed to the uttermost from the old creation. This was the situation even with the apostle Paul. He had received so many visions and revelations, yet he realized that he was still in the fallen humanity (2 Cor. 12:7). Although we also are still in the fallen humanity, we should not live in it and we should not live by it. As an elderly believer in Christ, I can testify that the older I become, the more bothered I am by the old creation, by the fallen, satanic humanity.</P><P>As we will see when we come to the end of Song of Songs, the lover of Christ eventually sighs because she is still in the old creation. She longs to be fully like Christ, who has absolutely nothing to do with anything of the old creation. She has been remade by God to be a new creation, yet according to God's economy, God has allowed a part of the old creation to remain with her.</P>

<P>We may have some success in pursuing after Christ and may attain a certain amount of satisfaction. But then we may ask, "How can I maintain this? How can I keep myself in this condition?" At this point the self comes in.</P>

<P>Self comes in under the false cloak of introspection. Actually, self is constituted with introspection. Introspection is to examine yourself by looking into yourself. The Bible teaches us to always look away unto Jesus (Heb. 12:2). We should not look at ourselves. Our self is not worthy to look at. Nevertheless, every spiritual person who reaches a situation of satisfaction in Christ eventually falls into introspection, not only examining the self but also analyzing it. When I was a young believer, I looked at myself quite often. I did not like to do anything that would not glorify the Lord. But actually I was not caring for the Lord; I was caring for myself and for what others thought of me. Looking into ourselves in this way is the greatest weakness in the spiritual life and the greatest enemy.</P>

<P>In helping others who are seeking to be spiritual, we may encourage them to pray and to confess their shortcomings to the Lord. Such prayer and confession are normal. However, in some cases we should encourage others to cease from confessing and simply believe that the blood of Jesus cleanses them and that God is faithful and righteous to forgive them (1 John 1:7, 9), reminding them that God is faithful to honor Christ's redemption.</P>

<P>When we are introspective, we may confess the same matter again and again, thinking that the more we confess, the more forgiveness we will receive. This kind of confession comes from the satanic self; it is the result of analyzing ourselves in spiritual things. Only the cross of Christ can deliver us from such a situation caused by introspection. Therefore, we need to be called to be delivered from the self through our oneness with the cross. When we become one with the cross, hiding ourselves in the clefts of the rock and in the covert of the precipice, we will be delivered from the self.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. BY CHRIST'S RESURRECTION POWER<br>
THROUGH HIS FELLOWSHIP</H2>

<P>The lover of Christ is called to be delivered from the self through her oneness with the cross by Christ's resurrection power through His fellowship (S.S. 2:8-9).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Coming, Leaping upon the Mountains<br>
and Skipping upon the Hills</H2>

<P>"The voice of my beloved! Now he comes,/Leaping upon the mountains,/Skipping upon the hills" (v. 8). This leaping and skipping signifies Christ's power to overcome difficulties and barriers. As the One in resurrection, He surely has a way to overcome difficulties and barriers. All the troubles concerning our fellowship with Christ come from our side. Many "hills" and "mountains" frustrate us from coming to Him, but He is never frustrated, for He can "leap" and "skip."</P>

<P>How can we go to the cleft of the rock, to the covert of the precipice? We do not have the strength to do this. The only way that we can go to the cross is by the power of His resurrection (Phil. 3:10). Therefore, Christ comes to the self-satisfied seeker in the power of resurrection.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Being Like a Gazelle or a Young Hart</H2>

<P>"My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart" (S.S. 2:9a). The word hind in the title of Psalm 22, which is concerned with resurrection, signifies Christ in resurrection. Christ's being like a young hart signifies that His power is the power of resurrection.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Standing behind "Our Wall"</H2>

<P>"Now he stands behind our wall" (v. 9b). His standing behind "our wall" signifies that the lover's introspection as the problem in her self is a separation between her and Him.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Looking through the Windows and<br>
Glancing through the Lattice</H2>

<P>"He is looking through the windows,/He is glancing through the lattice" (v. 9c). The windows and the lattice signify the openings set up by God for Him to fellowship, to commune, with her. No matter how much we try to hide ourselves secretly, there is a window that Christ can see through. Because man became fallen, there seemed to be no way for God to touch man or have fellowship with man. But the conscience of man is the window with a lattice, which is open for God to come in to contact fallen man. We should keep this in mind when we go out to preach the gospel. As we are preaching the gospel, we need to learn how to touch others' conscience.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. ENTREATED TO RESPOND AND ENCOURAGED<br>
WITH THE PASSING AWAY OF THE WINTER<br>
AND THE COMING OF THE SPRING OF RESURRECTION<br>
IN ITS FLOURISHING RICHES</H2>

<P>In verses 10 through 13 the lover is entreated to respond and is encouraged with the passing away of the winter and the coming of the spring of resurrection in its flourishing riches. The Beloved entreated His lover to come out from behind the wall.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Lover of Christ<br>
Failing to Respond to Him in His Fellowship</H2>

<P>"My beloved responds and says to me" in verse 10a indicates that the lover of Christ failed to respond to Him in His fellowship. If the lover had given a proper response, it would not have been necessary for the Beloved to speak again.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. She Being Down in Her Situation</H2>

<P>"Rise up, my love" (v. 10b) indicates that she was down in her situation, so Christ asked her in love to rise up. Whenever we have some attainment in spiritual seeking, the result is a down situation. Such a situation is mainly due to the self and introspection.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Christ Wanting Her to Come Out<br>
of Her Down Situation to Be with Him</H2>

<P>The words "My beauty, and come away" (v. 10c) indicate that Christ in His appreciation of her wanted her to come out of her down situation to be with Him. This is a word of encouragement.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Time of Dormancy and Trials Being Over</H2>

<P>"Now the winter is past;/The rain is over and gone" (v. 11). This indicates that the time of dormancy (winter) and trials (rain) is over and that the time of spring (resurrection) is coming.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Flourishing Riches of Christ's Resurrection</H2>

<P>"Flowers appear on the earth;/The time of singing has come,/And the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. /The fig tree has ripened its figs,/And the vines are in blossom&#151;they give forth their fragrance" (vv. 12-13a). Here "flowers," "singing," "voice of the turtledove," "blossom," and "fragrance" indicate the flourishing riches of Christ's resurrection. All these are signs of resurrection. When we sing, we are in resurrection. Whenever our mouth is closed, we are in winter.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Christ's Eagerness in Asking<br>
His Lover to Get Away from Her Introspection<br>
of the Self to Be with Him</H2>

<P>"Rise up, my love,/My beauty, and come away" (v. 13b). This repeated word indicates Christ's eagerness in asking His lover to get away from her introspection of the self to be with Him. However, it is not easy for one to come out of introspection. It is very difficult to help a brother or sister who is introspective. Sometimes it takes a year or more before such a one can be helped to get away from the introspection of the self.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. CALLED TO BE IN ONENESS WITH THE CROSS</H2>

<P>In verses 14 and 15 the lover is called to be in oneness with the cross. Whereas in the New Testament we have a clear word concerning the cross, in Song of Songs the cross is signified by figures of speech.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Christ Wanting to See<br>
His Lover's Lovely Countenance and Hear<br>
Her Sweet Voice in Her Oneness with the Cross</H2>

<P>"My dove, in the clefts of the rock,/In the covert of the precipice,/Let me see your countenance,/Let me hear your voice;/For your voice is sweet,/And your countenance is lovely" (v. 14). Here Christ, considering her His simple lover (My dove), wants to see His lover's lovely countenance and hear her sweet voice in her oneness, union, with the cross (the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice). Here we see Christ's call for His lover to be in oneness with the cross. This point on the cross is the central stress in this section on deliverance from the self.</P>

<P>If I had been the lover, I might have said, "My beloved, I cannot get to the clefts of the rock. The clefts are too high and the way is too rugged. I do not have enough power to go there." But here Christ was indicating to His lover that she could enter into the experience of the cross by the power of His resurrection.</P>

<P>The objective cross must become our subjective experience. We need to get into the cross and the cross must get into us. In this way we and the cross become one. Our oneness with the cross is our salvation. To be delivered from the self means to be saved from the self through becoming one with the cross. Every day we should be conformed to Christ's death by the power of His resurrection (Phil. 3:10). Without the oneness with the cross, we cannot be delivered from the self. I appreciate the chorus of the hymn which says, "Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray,/Put my soul-life all away;/Make me any price to pay,/Full anointing to receive" (Hymns, #279). We need to be willing to pay the price to enter into the subjective experience of the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Christ Charging His Lover to Be Aware<br>
of Her Peculiarities, Habits, and Introspections<br>
Which Ruin the Resurrection for His Lover</H2>

<P>"Catch the foxes for us,/The little foxes,/That ruin the vineyards/While our vineyards are in blossom" (S.S. 2:15). Christ charges His lover to be aware of her peculiarities, habits, and introspections (little foxes) which ruin the resurrection for His lover (our vineyards in blossom).</P>

<P>The little foxes that ruin the vineyards signify our peculiarities, our habits, and our introspections, and the vineyards signify the church life. To be spiritual is good, but it often leads to peculiarity. Nearly every spiritual person is peculiar, having some kind of peculiar streak. When we become peculiar, we are no longer spiritual. Instead, we become a trouble to the church. The deliverance from peculiarity is the cross.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE LOVER'S REJECTION AND FAILURE</H2>

<P>In 2:16&#151;3:1 we see the lover's rejection and failure.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Realizing That Christ Belongs to Her<br>
and She to Christ, yet He Not Being with Her</H2>

<P>"My beloved is mine, and I am his;/He pastures his flock among the lilies" (v. 16). She realizes that Christ belongs to her and she to Christ according to her feeling, yet He is not with her, but He is away feeding His pure and trusting followers (pastures among the lilies). At this point she and Christ are not one.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Rejecting Him by Asking Him to Wait<br>
until Her Down Situation Is Over</H2>

<P>"Until the day dawns and the shadows flee away,/Turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young hart/On the mountains of Bether" (v. 17). Here she rejects Him by asking Him to wait until her down situation is over and then to turn to her in His resurrection, like a gazelle or a young hart, at the time of their separation, which could be removed only by Him and not by her (on the mountains of Bether). The word Bether means "separation." The lover seemed to be saying to Him, "Lord, I am not ready. Please do not come now but wait until my situation is over. Be like a gazelle upon the mountain of separation." This separation, this mountain, is a problem, and it can be removed only by Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In Her Introspection She Seeking Her Beloved<br>
but Failing to Find Him</H2>

<P>"On my bed night after night/I sought him whom my soul loves;/I sought him, but found him not" (3:1). In her introspection, in her down situation, she seeks her Beloved, but she fails to find Him.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE LOVER'S WAKING UP AND RECOVERY</H2>

<P>Song of Songs 3:2-4 speaks of the lover's waking up and recovery.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. She Rising Up<br>
to Seek Her Beloved in the Ways<br>
and in the Methods of the Heavenly Jerusalem</H2>

<P>"I will rise now and go about in the city;/In the streets and in the squares/I will seek him whom my soul loves./I sought him, but found him not" (v. 2). She will rise up from her introspection to seek her Beloved in the ways and in the methods of the heavenly Jerusalem (signified by Jerusalem on earth).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Ones Who Watch Over God's People<br>
in the Ways of the Heavenly Jerusalem Finding Her</H2>

<P>"The watchmen who go about in the city found me&#151;/Have you seen him whom my soul loves?" (v. 3). The ones who watch over God's people spiritually (Heb. 13:17) in the ways of the heavenly Jerusalem find her, and she asks them if they have seen the One whom she loves.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Finding Her Beloved and Holding Him</H2>

<P>"Scarcely had I passed them/When I found him whom my soul loves;/I held him and would not let go/Until I had brought him into my mother's house/And into the chamber of her who conceived me" (S.S. 3:4). Not long after she leaves the ones who watch over God's people, she finds her Beloved, and she holds Him and will not let go until she brings Him into the Spirit of grace, through which she was regenerated (mother's house&#151;chamber&#151;Heb. 10:29; Gal. 4:26; Eph. 2:4-5; Gal. 5:4) for secret fellowship.</P>

<P>The mother's house was the place where she was born, and the mother's chamber was the place where she was conceived. The mother is grace. According to Galatians 4:25-26 the Jerusalem above, which is our mother, represents the principle of grace, which produces free heirs, and the Jerusalem on the earth produces children in bondage. The mother's chamber signifies love, which is of the Father. The Father's love issues in grace. Ephesians 2:4-5 says that God loved us and then saved us by grace. We were conceived in God's love and born by God's grace.</P>

<P>Although the lover of Christ fell into introspection, one day she woke up and realized that she was a sinner saved by grace. Then she could say, "God loved me and Christ saved me by grace." Second Corinthians 13:14 speaks of the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit brings God's love and carries God's grace to us. Hence, the Spirit is called the Spirit of grace (Heb. 10:29). Once the lover realized that she was a sinner saved by grace, she was revived. Then finding her Beloved, she held him and would not let go. She brought Christ to her mother's house, where she was born by grace, and to the chamber, where she was conceived in love. As the chamber is the inward part of the house, so God's love is the inward part of Christ's grace. As saved ones, we have both the love of God and the grace of Christ.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. CHRIST CHARGING<br>
THE MEDDLING DAUGHTERS NOT TO AWAKEN HER</H2>

<P>"I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,/By the gazelles or by the hinds of the fields,/Not to rouse up or awaken my love/Until she pleases" (S.S. 3:5). Here Christ charges the meddling believers (daughters of Jerusalem) not to awaken her from her experience of Christ in her being delivered from the self, secluded in her introspection, into her secret fellowship with Him until she feels pleasant concerning her next experience of Him (she pleases).</P><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF SONG OF SONGS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">CALLED TO LIVE IN ASCENSION<br />
AS THE NEW CREATION IN RESURRECTION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S. S. 3:6&mdash;5:1</h1>
<p>In the second stage (S. S. 2:8&mdash;3:5) the lover of Christ learned three basic lessons: the power of resurrection, the riches of resurrection, and the life of the cross. The power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is signified by Christ as a gazelle and a hart leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills (2:8-9). The riches of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection are signified by the plants, the voice of the turtledove, and the various fragrances in the spring (vv. 12-13a). The life of the cross is signified by the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice (v. 14). The life of the cross is lived by the power of resurrection and is encouraged by the riches of resurrection.</p>
<p>In the next stage&mdash;the call to live in ascension as the new creation in resurrection (3:6&mdash;5:1)&mdash;we need to learn the lesson of discerning the spirit from the soul (Heb. 4:12). Few of today&rsquo;s Christians are able to discern the spirit from the soul. Many actually believe that in the Bible the words <em>spirit</em> and <em>soul</em> are synonyms, even though 1 Thessalonians 5:23 speaks of &ldquo;spirit and soul and body.&rdquo; If we do not realize that the spirit is different from the soul, we cannot reach the stage of being called to live in ascension as the new creation in resurrection.</p>
<p>Ascension is in the heavens. Although we are on earth, as believers in Christ our regenerated spirit is joined to God the Spirit in the heavens. These two spirits are one. This is like electricity: It is in the power plant and also in our room, yet there is one current. When we are in our spirit, we are joined to the ascended Christ in the heavens.</p>
<p>To live in ascension means to have a Christian life all the time in our spirit. This requires that we discern our spirit from our soul. If we love others by our soul, we are on the earth, not in ascension. But if we love by our spirit, we are in ascension. We have been seated in the heavens with Christ (Eph. 2:6). Positionally, we are seated there, but we need to live in ascension. After calling us to the cross, Christ calls us further to live in ascension as the new creation in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE NEW CREATION</h2>
<p>Song of Songs 3:6&mdash;4:6 is concerned with the new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. By the Lover&rsquo;s Complete Union with Christ</h2>
<p>The lover of Christ becomes a new creation by her complete union with Christ (3:6-11). We were united with Adam, which made us the old creation. Now we are in union with Christ, so we are a new creation. Second Corinthians 5:17 says, &ldquo;If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. She Coming from Egypt like Persons<br />
in the Unshakable Power of the Spirit</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she who comes up from the wilderness / Like pillars of smoke, / Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, / With all the fragrant powders of the merchant?&rdquo; (S. S. 3:6). She (as an overcoming representative of God&rsquo;s elect) comes from Egypt (wilderness) like persons in the unshakable power of the Spirit (Exo. 14:19-20), perfumed with the sweet death and fragrant resurrection of Christ and with all the fragrant riches of Christ as a merchant. The Lord needs the overcoming ones, those who are perfumed, permeated, with the fragrance of Christ&rsquo;s riches.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. She Being the Victory of the Victorious Christ</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There is his bed, Solomon&rsquo;s&mdash; / Sixty mighty men surround it, / Of the mighty men of Israel. / All of them wield the sword and are expert in war; / Each man has his sword at his thigh / Because of the night alarms&rdquo; (S. S. 3:7-8). She is the victory (bed for rest and victory in the night) of the victorious Christ, full of the power of the overcomers among God&rsquo;s elect which carries Christ even in times of difficulties, and these overcomers are experts in war, fighting with their weapons at the time of alarms.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. She Being a Palanquin as a Carriage of Christ</h2>
<p>&ldquo;King Solomon made himself a palanquin / Of the wood of Lebanon. / Its posts he made of silver, / Its bottom, of gold; / Its seat, of purple; / Its midst was inlaid with love / From the daughters of Jerusalem&rdquo; (vv. 9-10). She is a palanquin (for the day) as a carriage of Christ, made by Christ Himself of the resurrected, uplifted, and noble humanity (the wood of Lebanon), having God&rsquo;s nature (gold) as its base, Christ&rsquo;s redemption (silver) as its supports, the royal (purple) throne as its seat, and the love of the believers covering the inside.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Spirit Bidding<br />
the Overcoming Believers to Look Away<br />
from Themselves unto Christ in His Humanity</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Go forth, O daughters of Zion, / And see King Solomon with the crown / With which his mother crowned him / On the day of his espousals, / Yes, on the day of the gladness of his heart&rdquo; (v. 11). Here the Spirit bids the overcoming believers to look away from themselves unto Christ in His humanity of incarnation as a crown of His boast, at the time of the believers&rsquo; betrothal to Christ, a day of the gladness of His heart.</p>
<p>If Christ did not have humanity, He could not marry us. Because we are human, we could not be betrothed to Him unless He also had humanity. Thus, our betrothal to Christ depends on His humanity, which is His crown. The humanity which Christ put on in His incarnation and uplifted in His resurrection is His crown. We need to look away to Christ in His humanity.</p>
<p>At this juncture we should note that the union of the bed with its sleeper, the union of the palanquin with its rider, and the union of the bride with her bridegroom, indicated in the three items above, all signify the complete union of the lover with Christ. Because we have been united to Christ, we have become the new creation.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Beauty of the Lover,<br />
the Bride, as the New Creation</h2>
<p>In 4:1-5 we see the beauty of the lover, the bride, as the new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Beauty in Her Singleness<br />
and Insight by the Spirit</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are beautiful, my love! / Oh, you are beautiful! Your eyes are like doves behind your veil; / Your hair is like a flock of goats / That repose on Mount Gilead&rdquo; (v. 1). In this verse we see the beauty in her singleness and insight by the Spirit, which is invisible to the outsiders, and in her submission and obedience through God&rsquo;s feeding that subdues her disobedience among the disobedient people.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Beauty in Her Receiving the Divine Food</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes / That have come up from the washing, / All of which have borne twins, / And none of them is bereaved of her young&rdquo; (v. 2). This speaks of the beauty in her receiving the divine food by her power that has been dealt with by the cross, made clean by the Spirit&rsquo;s washing, and strengthened twofold and balanced, without losing strength.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Beauty in Her Speaking<br />
with Christ&rsquo;s Redemption and His Authority</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Your lips are like a scarlet thread, / And your mouth is lovely; / Your cheeks are like a piece of pomegranate / Behind your veil&rdquo; (v. 3). This is her beauty in her speaking with Christ&rsquo;s redemption and His authority by her lovely mouth and in her expression full of life which is hidden.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Beauty in Her Submissive Will to Christ</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Your neck is like the tower of David, / Built for an armory: / A thousand bucklers hang on it, / All the shields of the mighty men&rdquo; (v. 4). Here we have the beauty in her submissive will to Christ that is rich in the defending power.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The Beauty in Her Tender Faith and Love</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Your two breasts are like two fawns, / Twins of a gazelle, / That feed among the lilies&rdquo; (v. 5). This speaks of the beauty in her tender faith and love strengthened twofold and nourished in the environment of a pure and trusting life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Her Deeper Pursuit</h2>
<p>Verse 6 speaks of her deeper pursuit: &ldquo;Until the day dawns and the shadows flee away, / I, for my part, will go to the mountain of myrrh / And to the hill of frankincense.&rdquo; In her deeper pursuit she would go and remain in Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection in their high peaks until Christ comes, when the day dawns and the shadows flee away. Earlier, she was afraid of the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice, but now she is willing to be there, remaining in Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. CALLED TO LIVE IN ASCENSION</h2>
<p>In verses 7 through 15 the lover is called to live in ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. His Calling</h2>
<p>In verses 7 and 8 we have the Beloved&rsquo;s calling.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Appraising Her Beauty and Perfection</h2>
<p>&ldquo;You are altogether beautiful, my love, / And there is no blemish in you&rdquo; (v. 7). Here He appraises her beauty and perfection.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Asking Her as His Bride<br />
to Look with Him from His Ascension</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me from Lebanon, my bride; / With me from Lebanon come. / Look from the top of Amana, / From the top of Senir and Hermon, / From the lions&rsquo; dens, / From the leopards&rsquo; mountains&rdquo; (v. 8). <em>Amana</em> means &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; <em>Senir</em> means &ldquo;soft armor,&rdquo; and <em>Hermon</em> means &ldquo;destruction.&rdquo; In this verse He asks her as His bride to look with Him from His ascension, the highest place of the truth and of Christ&rsquo;s victory in His fighting, and from the heavenly places of the enemies. Here we have a living in Christ&rsquo;s ascension.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Her Silent Answer</h2>
<p>The lover does not answer the Beloved&rsquo;s call audibly. Verse 9 indicates that she gives a silent answer: &ldquo;You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride; / You have ravished my heart with one glance of your eyes, / With one strand of your necklace.&rdquo; Here He considers her as one with Him in nature and as His bride, whose answer without voice, by a quick look and by her submission to God&rsquo;s instruction, has ravished His heart.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. His Private Enjoyment of Her</h2>
<p>Verses 10 through 15 describe His private enjoyment of her.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Enjoying Her Beautiful Love</h2>
<p>&ldquo;How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride! / How much better is your love than wine, / And the fragrance of your ointments / Than all spices&rdquo; (v. 10). Considering her as one with Him in nature and as His bride, He enjoys her beautiful love, which is much better than wine, and her ointments, which were the King&rsquo;s (1:3) and are more fragrant than all spices.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Enjoying Her Word as Fresh Honey<br />
and the Fragrance of Her Conduct</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Your lips drip fresh honey, my bride; / Honey and milk are under your tongue; / And the fragrance of your garments / Is like the fragrance of Lebanon&rdquo; (4:11). He enjoys her word as fresh honey (for restoring the weak), which comes from her lips, and her word as honey and milk (for restoring the weak and feeding the immature ones), which are under her tongue, and the fragrance of her conduct as the fragrance of ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Considering Her an Enclosed Garden,<br />
a Shut Up Spring, and a Sealed Fountain</h2>
<p>&ldquo;A garden enclosed is my sister, my bride, / A spring shut up, a fountain sealed&rdquo; (v. 12). He considers her not as something open and public but as an enclosed garden, a shut up spring, and a sealed fountain.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. An Enclosed Garden That Grows<br />
All Kinds of Plants in Different Colors</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates / With choicest fruit; / Henna with spikenard, / Spikenard and saffron; / Calamus and cinnamon, / With all the trees of frankincense; / Myrrh and aloes, / With all the chief spices&rdquo; (vv. 13-14). In His enjoyment of her she is an enclosed garden that grows all kinds of plants in different colors as different expressions of the inner life and in a variety of fragrances as the rich expression of the mature life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. A Sealed Fountain<br />
with a Shut Up Spring in Gardens<br />
That Flows as a Well of the Living Water</h2>
<p>&ldquo;A fountain in gardens, / A well of living water, / And streams from Lebanon&rdquo; (v. 15). He considers her a sealed fountain with a shut up spring in gardens that flows as a well of the living water of the life-giving Spirit and as streams of the resurrection life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. LIVING A LIFE OF LOVE</h2>
<p>Song of Songs 4:16&mdash;5:1 speaks of living a life of love.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Answer of the Bride</h2>
<p>Verse 16 is the answer of the bride: &ldquo;Awake, O north wind; / And come, O south wind! / Blow upon my garden: / Let its spices flow forth; / Let my beloved come into his garden / And eat his choicest fruit.&rdquo; She wants the difficult environment (north wind) and the pleasant environment (south wind) to work on her as a garden that its fragrance may be spread. She asks her Beloved to come into her as a garden and enjoy its choicest fruit. We all should consider ourselves gardens to Christ, producing fruit for His enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Answer of the Beloved</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; / I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; / I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; / I have drunk my wine with my milk. / Eat, O friends; / Drink, and drink deeply, O beloved ones!&rdquo; (5:1). Here the Beloved answers, inviting His beloved &ldquo;friends,&rdquo; the Triune God, to eat, drink, and drink deeply, to enjoy her with Him.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF SONG OF SONGS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIVING IN ASCENSION<br />
BY DISCERNING THE SPIRIT FROM THE SOUL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S. S. 4:7-15; Heb. 4:12; 1 Thes. 5:23; 2 Cor. 4:16</h1>
<p>In this message I would like to give a word about living in ascension by discerning the spirit from the soul.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CALL TO LIVE IN ASCENSION</h2>
<p>In Song of Songs 4:7-8 the Lord calls His lover to live in ascension as a new creation in resurrection. The new creation is only that which is in ascension in resurrection. Without resurrection, there cannot be a new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Expressing His Appreciation<br />
of His Lover</h2>
<p>&ldquo;You are altogether beautiful, my love, / And there is no blemish in you&rdquo; (v. 7). Here the Lord expresses His appreciation of His lover to prepare her to receive His call to live in ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Call to Come with Him<br />
from Lebanon</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me from Lebanon, my bride; / With me from Lebanon come&rdquo; (v. 8a). Lebanon is a high mountain, signifying resurrection. In 2:9 the lover was in &ldquo;our wall&rdquo; of the introspective self. The wall is down in the self. Her introspection had built a wall which separated her from the Lord. Now He calls her to come with Him to a high mountain, which is the top of resurrection&mdash;ascension. Christ died, rose, and then ascended. First we experience resurrection, then ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Looking from the Top of Amana,<br />
from the Top of Senir and Hermon</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Look from the top of Amana, / From the top of Senir and Hermon, / From the lions&rsquo; dens, / From the leopards&rsquo; mountains&rdquo; (v. 8b). We have pointed out that <em>Amana</em> means &ldquo;truth.&rdquo; Hence, this is the peak of revelation. <em>Senir</em> means &ldquo;soft armor.&rdquo; Soft armor indicates that the fighting is over and the victory has been gained. <em>Hermon</em> means &ldquo;destruction.&rdquo; The enemy has been destroyed. In Christ&rsquo;s ascension is His victory. There is no more fighting, for the enemy has been destroyed and the armor has become soft. Furthermore, the truth is here. The truth refers to the reality of the Triune God&mdash;all that God is, all that Christ is, and all that the Spirit is. This is ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Looking from the Lions&rsquo; Dens<br />
and from the Leopards&rsquo; Mountains</h2>
<p>Verse 8 speaks of looking from the lions&rsquo; dens and from the leopards&rsquo; mountains. The victory has been gained, but the lions and the leopards, which signify Satan and his evil forces, are still there. These evil powers are also in the heavenlies (Eph. 6:12). Christ calls His lover to look from this, indicating that we must have our living in ascension.</p>
<p>In our daily lives we should not live in our &ldquo;wall,&rdquo; down on the earth, nor should we live in our &ldquo;den.&rdquo; We should not live in seclusion. We have been resurrected and are now in ascension; the war is over, and victory has been gained. However, all the enemies are still there, and thus we need to be watchful.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR NEED TO DISCERN THE SPIRIT<br />
FROM THE SOUL</h2>
<p>To live in ascension requires that we discern our spirit from our soul. This is according to our experience.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Economy in Saving Us</h2>
<p>We are of three parts. We have a spirit, a soul (the self), and a body (1 Thes. 5:23). God&rsquo;s economy in saving us is first to regenerate our dead spirit by imparting Himself into it as the divine element, making our spirit new. However, our soul is still old. Hence, after we have been regenerated, our soul needs to be transformed. The transformation of the soul is a gradual process that takes place step by step. Our body is also old. Therefore, the body, the outer man, needs to be consumed day by day, while the inner man is being renewed (2 Cor. 4:16). This renewing will go on and on until it reaches its peak with the transfiguration of our body, that is, the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23; Phil. 3:21).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Saved Persons Having Two Men</h2>
<p>As saved persons we all have two men. The new man is in our spirit, and the old man is in our soul. Regardless of whether it is good or bad, right or wrong, whatever we do, if we do it in our soul, we are living by the old man. For instance, you may love a certain brother and want to help him. But if you love him and help him not in your spirit but in your soul, you are living in your self, the old man. This is to do a good thing in the old man. Before doing anything&mdash;in this case helping a brother&mdash;we must first pray to contact the Lord in our spirit, asking Him what He feels about what we intend to do. Then in our spirit we may have the sense that the Lord is happy. This is an indication that the Lord wants us to do this particular thing. Then we should proceed to do it in our spirit. This is to live in the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living by the New Man</h2>
<p>If we do things by the old man in the soul or in the self, we are living on the earth. The things we do may be good, but we are nevertheless on the earth because we are living in the soul. Today there are many good people who are doing good things, but these people are all living in the soul. As lovers of Christ, we need to realize that our old man, including our soul, has been crucified (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20a). It is no longer &ldquo;I&rdquo; who live, but another man&mdash;Christ&mdash;lives in me (Gal. 2:20b). When we live by this other man, we are the new man, for we are living in the spirit, not in the soul.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living in Ascension by Living in Our Spirit</h2>
<p>Our spirit is connected to the heavens by God as the Spirit. In spirit we are therefore in the heavens, in ascension. To live in ascension requires that we live, act, move, and do everything in our spirit. Thus, we must learn how to discern our spirit. If we do not know our spirit, if we do not know how to discern our spirit from our soul, we cannot be a spiritual person. When we live in our spirit, we are in ascension as the new creation in resurrection. We are a new person living in a new universe.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Need for Practice</h2>
<p>We should not think that discerning the spirit from the soul is something that is too difficult for us to learn. We all can learn how to do this if we practice one thing: We should always inquire of the Lord: &ldquo;Lord, is this the old man, the soul, the old `I&rsquo; only, or You with me?&rdquo; If we sense that we are alone in the old &ldquo;I,&rdquo; then we are in the soul, in the old man. If we sense that we are one with the Lord and that He is with us, then we are in the spirit. If we have proper fellowship with the Lord, inquiring of Him before doing things, then in our spirit we will have a deep sense of the Lord&rsquo;s feeling. We will know whether He is happy or not. This is to discern the soul from the spirit to live in ascension. May we all learn to have this most important practice in our daily living.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF SONG OF SONGS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">CALLED MORE STRONGLY TO LIVE WITHIN THE VEIL<br />
THROUGH THE CROSS AFTER RESURRECTION</h1>
<h1 class="msg">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S. S. 5:2&mdash;6:3</h1>
<p>In 5:2&mdash;6:3 the lover of Christ is called more strongly to live within the veil through the cross after resurrection. In the heavenly tabernacle (Heb. 8:2; 9:11-12, 24) a veil separates the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. The veil is a figure of our flesh (10:19-20). For us to enter into the Holy of Holies the veil must be rent. This indicates that no matter how much we are in ascension, in our spirit, we are still in the old creation and we still have our flesh. Thus, even after the experience of living in ascension, we still need the experience of the cross.</p>
<p>We should never think that while we are still in the old creation we can attain such a high degree of spirituality that we are no longer in the flesh. Consider the case of the apostle Paul, who surely was a very spiritual person. After God gave Paul high revelations, there was given to him &ldquo;a thorn in the flesh&rdquo; to warn him that he still had the flesh (2 Cor. 12:7).</p>
<p>We must never consider that we are a &ldquo;saint&rdquo; or an angel. We are proper believers in God&rsquo;s process of His economy. God&rsquo;s economy is first to regenerate our spirit and then to transform our soul, but the flesh is still here. We need to be warned that if we are careless with the flesh, we will damage our spiritual life.</p>
<p>Because Christians are often careless concerning the flesh, divisions among believers are common. According to the book of Acts, Barnabas became dissenting with Paul and separated himself from him (15:35-39). This division was caused by Barnabas&rsquo;s intention to take his cousin John, who was also called Mark, with them on a proposed journey to visit the churches. &ldquo;Paul did not consider it suitable to take with them this one who withdrew from them in Pamphylia and did not go with them to the work. And there was a sharp contention, so that they separated from each other; and Barnabas, taking Mark along, sailed away to Cyprus&rdquo; (vv. 38-39). Every argument involves something of the flesh. Probably Paul was in the spirit as he was contending, but Barnabas was arguing according to the flesh. This indicates that even with spiritual persons the flesh remains and can cause damage.</p>
<p>We should not think that if we are living in ascension the flesh is no longer with us. No, the flesh is still here. We may be in ascension, but the veil, the flesh, is still present. When Christ was crucified, the veil in the temple was split in two from top to bottom (Matt. 27:51). With Christ the veil was riven, but our veil still remains. Therefore, we need a stronger call, not merely to remain in ascension but to learn the lessons of the cross and live within the veil. In our experience the veil, the flesh, must be riven, and then we need to pass the riven veil to live in the Holy of Holies. For this, we daily need to learn the lesson of the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE STRONGER CALLING OF THE CROSS<br />
AFTER RESURRECTION AND HER FAILURE</h2>
<p>Let us now begin to consider the stronger calling of the cross after resurrection and after the lover&rsquo;s failure (S. S. 5:2&mdash;6:3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Beloved&rsquo;s Calling</h2>
<p>In 5:2 we have the Beloved&rsquo;s calling: &ldquo;I sleep, but my heart is awake. / A sound! My beloved is knocking: / Open to me, my sister, my love, / My dove, my perfect one; / For my head is full of dew, / My locks with the drops of night.&rdquo; In His calling of the lover, the Beloved regarded her as His sister. This means that she had the same nature as He. Here the lover realized that her old man, the outward man, was crucified and her new man, the inward man, is living. She heard her Beloved knocking and asking her to open to Him, reminding her of His suffering as He suffered at Gethsemane for His crucifixion. His head being &ldquo;full of dew&rdquo; and His locks with &ldquo;the drops of night&rdquo; refers to Christ&rsquo;s suffering at night in Gethsemane before His death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Her Refusal</h2>
<p>Verse 3 tells us of her refusal: &ldquo;I have put off my garment; / How can I put it on again? / I have washed my feet; / How can I dirty them again?&rdquo; The Beloved called, but she refused His call. Since she had put off the former manner of life of her old man through the dealing of the cross, how could she put it on again, for this would need her Beloved to repeat His suffering for crucifixion? Since she had been cleansed by His redeeming blood, how could she defile herself, since this would need her Beloved to repeat His suffering of death? These were her reasons for refusing the Beloved&rsquo;s call.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Her Opening of the Door</h2>
<p>In verses 4 and 5 she opened the door.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Her Beloved Showing His Pierced Hand<br />
through Her Narrow Opening</h2>
<p>&ldquo;My beloved put his hand into the opening of the door, / And my inner parts yearned for him&rdquo; (v. 4). Her Beloved showed His pierced hand through her narrow opening so that her inner parts were moved to yearn for Him. From experience we know that, on the one hand, we may reject the Lord, but, on the other hand, we may not close the door entirely. After closing the door, we may leave a little opening through which the Lord can stretch His hand. Here the Beloved&rsquo;s pierced hand reminded her that He was crucified for her.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Rising Up to Open the Door to Her Beloved</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I rose up to open to my beloved; / And my hands dripped with myrrh, / My fingers with liquid myrrh, / Upon the handles of the bolt&rdquo; (v. 5). She rose up to open the door to her Beloved. Her action showed her Beloved her appreciation of His sweet death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Beloved&rsquo;s Hiding</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I opened to my beloved, / But my beloved had withdrawn; he was gone. / My soul failed when he spoke; / I sought him, but found him not; / I called him&mdash;he answered not&rdquo; (v. 6). She opened to her Beloved, but He had withdrawn and gone. Her soul was discouraged when her Beloved spoke. Then she sought Him, but she did not find Him. She called Him, but He did not answer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Her Being Wounded</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The watchmen who go about the city found me. / They struck me; they wounded me; / The keepers of the walls took my veil from me&rdquo; (v. 7). The ones who watch over God&rsquo;s people (Heb. 13:17), not knowing her problem, struck and wounded her, thinking that she would be helped by their striking. The guards of God&rsquo;s people took away her veil, her covering, shaming her publicly. Sometimes we may think that we can help others by rebuking them. However, instead of helping them, this rebuking wounds them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Her Seeking Help from the Common Believers</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I adjure, O daughters of Jerusalem, / If you find my beloved, / What shall you tell him? / That I am sick with love&rdquo; (S. S. 5:8). This indicates that because her sense of failure was so deep, she felt that even the younger believers could help her. She charged them to tell her Beloved that she is sick with love, considering that her Beloved may have some concern about her love for Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The First Question of the Ones Whom She Asks</h2>
<p>In verse 9 we have the first question of the ones whom she asks concerning her Beloved: &ldquo;What is your beloved more than some other beloved, / O you most beautiful among women? / What is your beloved more than some other beloved, / That you adjure us so?&rdquo; Considering that she is the most beautiful among females, they asked her what was so much better about her Beloved than some other beloved that she adjured them so.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. Her Impression of Her Beloved</h2>
<p>In verses 10 through 16 she answered by giving her impression of her Beloved, appraising Him with many excellent and detailed expressions.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Her Beloved Being Pure<br />
</em><em>yet Full of Life and Power</h2>
<p>&ldquo;My beloved is dazzling white yet ruddy, / Distinguished among ten thousand&rdquo; (v. 10). Her Beloved is pure yet full of life and power, and He is distinguished as an uplifted banner against the enemy (Isa. 59:19) and for the drawing of the sinners (John 12:32).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. His Headship Being of God</h2>
<p>&ldquo;His head is the finest gold; / His locks are wavy, / As black as a raven&rdquo; (S. S. 5:11). His headship is of God (1 Cor. 11:3), and His submission to God is flourishing and strong.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. His Expression of Sentiment<br />
</em><em>Being Single and Pure</h2>
<p>&ldquo;His eyes are like doves / Beside the streams of water, / Bathed in milk, / Fitly set&rdquo; (S. S. 5:12). His expression of sentiment is single and pure, flowing like the river of life, distinct and clear and in proper order.</p><h2 class="head3">4. His Countenance Being Beautiful and Sweet</h2>
<p>&ldquo;His cheeks are like a bed of spices, / Mounds of sweetly fragrant herbs; / His lips are lilies, / Dripping with liquid myrrh&rdquo; (v. 13). His countenance is beautiful and sweet through His suffering of people&rsquo;s smiting and despising, and His mouth is pure, releasing sweet words of grace based upon His redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. His Works Being Full of the Divine<br />
Binding Power and Being Stable<br />
for the Carrying Out of God&rsquo;s Will</h2>
<p>&ldquo;His hands are tubes of gold, / Set with beryl; / His belly is an ivory work, / Overlaid with sapphires&rdquo; (v. 14). His works are full of the divine binding power and are stable for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s will. His inward parts (Phil. 1:8) are full of deep, tender feelings wrought through His sufferings under a clear heavenly vision (Exo. 24:10).</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. His Standing and Supporting Strength<br />
Being of the Righteous Standing<br />
Based on God&rsquo;s Divine Nature</h2>
<p>&ldquo;His legs are pillars of white marble, / Set upon bases of gold; / His appearance is like Lebanon, / As excellent as the cedars&rdquo; (S. S. 5:15). His standing and supporting strength is of the righteous standing based upon God&rsquo;s divine nature, and His expression shows that He is a person who has ascended into heaven and whose excellency transcends all others.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. His Taste of Divine Things Being Sweet</h2>
<p>&ldquo;His mouth is sweetness itself, / And he is altogether desirable&rdquo; (v. 16a). His taste of divine things is sweet, and He is altogether lovely and desirable.</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. The Impression of the Beloved<br />
Realized by the Lover</h2>
<p>&ldquo;This is my beloved, and this is my friend, / O daughters of Jerusalem&rdquo; (v. 16b). This is the impression of the Beloved as her Friend realized by the lover.</p>
<p>We might also be asked how much better our Christ is than others, that is, why our Christ is so sweet to us. Many of us may not be able to answer this question adequately. If you were to ask me, I would say, &ldquo;My Christ is the all-inclusive One. His riches are unsearchable (Eph. 3:8). He is the preeminent One, the first in everything (Col. 1:17-18): the first in all creation (v. 17), the first in resurrection (v. 18), and the first in everything in my living. He is also the God-allotted portion to me for my enjoyment (v. 12). My Christ is the Son of God who became a man. He was flesh, but in His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Moreover, my Christ has seven eyes, which are the sevenfold intensified Spirit (Rev. 5:6).&rdquo; We must forget about preaching other things and preach and teach only the all- inclusive Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. The Second Question<br />
of the Ones Whom She Asks</h2>
<p>In Song of Songs 6:1 we have the second question of the ones whom the lover asks concerning her Beloved: &ldquo;Where has your beloved gone, / O you most beautiful among women? / Where has your beloved turned, / That we may seek him with you?&rdquo; Still considering that she is the most beautiful among females, they asked her where her Beloved has turned that they may seek Him with her, indicating that they had been attracted by her testimony concerning her Beloved. She was a pursuer after Christ, and her pursuit influenced, affected, and attracted others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. Her Reply</h2>
<p>Verses 2 and 3 are her reply.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Realizing That Her Beloved Is within Her<br />
as His Garden</h2>
<p>&ldquo;My beloved has gone down to his garden, / To the beds of spices, / To feed in the gardens / And gather lilies&rdquo; (v. 2). After seeking help from others, she realized that her Beloved is within her as His garden and in all other believers as His beds of spices, feeding in her and other believers as His gardens and gathering the pure and trusting ones.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s garden is in our spirit. In our spirit we grow all the beautiful, spiritual, divine, and heavenly things, which are sweet to His taste. This is possible only if we live in our spirit. The most precious thing for a believer is to live in the spirit. If we live in our spirit, our spirit becomes a garden. The Lord is feeding, shepherding, and pasturing us that we may grow all kinds of spices and fragrances to satisfy Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Telling Them That She Belongs to Her Beloved</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I am my beloved&rsquo;s, and my beloved is mine; / He pastures His flock among the lilies&rdquo; (v. 3). She tells them, according to her faith, that she belongs to her Beloved and He to her and that He is now feeding His pure and trusting ones. Her word here indicates that she is now more matured in life than when she spoke the same word in 2:16.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF SONG OF SONGS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">CALLED MORE STRONGLY TO LIVE WITHIN THE VEIL<br />
THROUGH THE CROSS AFTER RESURRECTION</h1>
<h1 class="msg">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S. S. 6:4-13</h1>
<p>In this message we will consider further the matter of being called more strongly to live within the veil through the cross after resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. A LIFE WITHIN THE VEIL</h2>
<p>Song of Songs 6:4-13 speaks of a life within the veil. The intrinsic significance of this section is that a loving pursuer of Christ needs to experience His ascension by living in the heavenly Holy of Holies within the veil through the cross after she has experienced His resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Beloved&rsquo;s Praise</h2>
<p>Verses 4 through 10 are the Beloved&rsquo;s praise.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Her Beloved,<br />
Treasuring Her as His Love, Praising Her<br />
That She Is Beautiful as the Heavenly Sanctuary<br />
and Lovely as the Heavenly Jerusalem</h2>
<p>&ldquo;You are as beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, / As lovely as Jerusalem&rdquo; (v. 4a). Her Beloved, treasuring her as His love, praises her that she is beautiful as the heavenly sanctuary (Tirzah&mdash;1 Kings 14:17) and lovely as the heavenly Jerusalem (Gal. 4:26; Heb. 12:22), indicating that she lives in the Holy of Holies within the veil, experiencing the ascension of Christ through the cross after her experience of His resurrection.</p>
<p>In the heavens there is the sanctuary of God, which is divided into two sections. The first section is called the Holy Place, and the second is called the Holy of Holies. In between, there is a partition, a separation, a veil. Hebrews 10:20 tells us that the veil in the sanctuary signifies the flesh. In the heavenly sanctuary there is the flesh; this is according to God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>One basic principle in God&rsquo;s economy is that God is not a God of time and space. With Him there is no time element, for He is a God of eternity. We care for location, thinking that there is no flesh in the heavens, but God cares for the fact. Seemingly we are in the heavens, but we still have the flesh, and we will continue to have it until God accomplishes and consummates His economy absolutely.</p>
<p>In our spiritual experiences we were attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love and drawn by the Lord Himself in His sweetness. We followed Him by taking the footsteps of the saints in the church through the centuries. Then we entered the fellowship with Him in our spirit. In this fellowship we were instructed concerning how to enter into the church life, and in the church life we are being transformed. We have beauty through this transformation, and we also have rest, covering, and satisfaction. All these spiritual significances match Solomon&rsquo;s writing.</p>
<p>The next stage is that of living in the heavenlies as God&rsquo;s new creation in resurrection. After experiencing this stage we need to go on to experience the rending of the veil. The veil in the temple was split by Christ&rsquo;s death (Matt. 27:51). However, the veil of the flesh has not been taken away. Rather, the veil still remains for God to use in perfecting His seeking saints. For example, Paul was surely a matured brother, having passed through the age of living in the heavens as the new creation of God in resurrection. But according to 2 Corinthians 12 God allowed a &ldquo;thorn in the flesh&rdquo; to be given him (v. 7). Here we see that even such a mature and spiritual person could still be troubled by the flesh. This indicates that no matter how much of God&rsquo;s element we may have in our regenerated spirit, or how much we have been sanctified, renewed, transformed, and conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God, as long as we are living on earth, we still have the flesh.</p>
<p>Whereas the regeneration of our spirit was instantaneous, the transformation of our soul is progressive. The redemption of our body is also progressive. Paul said that our inner man is being renewed but that our outer man, our body, is decaying day by day. This is God&rsquo;s arrangement according to His economy. God has no plan for us to reach such a high standard of spirituality that the flesh is no longer present. God&rsquo;s economy is to keep us living in ascension as a new creation in resurrection, no matter how spiritual we may be. We might think that in resurrection there should no longer be the flesh, but God still needs it in order to work something in us.</p>
<p>Because the flesh is still with us, we need to deal with the flesh every day by watching and praying. If we do not watch, the flesh will act. In our prayer we need to be watchful, praying in the spirit.</p>
<p>In Song of Songs 6:4 Jerusalem is a sign of royalty. The more heavenly we are, the more royal we become. To be royal is to reign like a king. Romans 5 says that those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life (v. 17). Nevertheless, even though we may be royal and live in ascension as God&rsquo;s new creation in resurrection, there is still a veil in the heavenly sanctuary. This indicates that no matter how spiritual we may be, we are still in the flesh, which is the veil. Therefore, we need to learn to pass through the veil by the dealing of the cross every day. Then we will live within the veil, in the Holy of Holies, which is just God Himself. This is the highest stage in the experience of the lover of Christ as presented in Song of Songs. When we reach such a stage, we will have nothing to do but to wait and hope for rapture.</p><h2 class="head3">2. She Being Terrible<br />
as an Army with Banners</h2>
<p>The lover of Christ is also &ldquo;terrible as an army with banners&rdquo; lifted up as a sign of victory (v. 4b)</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Lover&rsquo;s Becoming the Heavenly Sanctuary and the Heavenly Jerusalem<br />
Being Due to Her Victory over the Enemies</h2>
<p>This praise of her Beloved indicates that her becoming the heavenly sanctuary and the heavenly Jerusalem is due to her victory over the enemies. Only by being an overcomer, one who overcomes the enemies, can we live within the veil.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. An Indication of Her Maturity<br />
in Life for God&rsquo;s Building</h2>
<p>Previously the lover was likened to a mare, a horse among Pharaoh&rsquo;s chariots, a rose in Sharon, a lily in the valleys and among thorns, a dove, a pillar of smoke, a bed, a palanquin, a garden, and a fountain with a spring, but now she is likened to the heavenly dwelling of God and the heavenly Jerusalem, indicating her maturity in life for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>For the building of the Body of Christ, we need the maturity of life. Ephesians 4:12-16, which speaks of the building up of the Body, tells us that we need growth to reach maturity so that the Body of Christ can be built up. To build up the church in a general way requires only the capacity to manage, arrange, and take care of things. This is not something organic but something organized according to human management. However, the building up of the Body has nothing to do with our ability to organize, manage, and arrange things. The Body of Christ is an organism, not an organization. The building up of this organism depends on growth and the maturity in life. The building of the Body is organic.</p>
<p>To build up the Body organically, we need to mature. This is the reason that we are now stressing the building up of the Body much more than the building up of the church. First Timothy is a book on the church as the house of God (3:15). There is nothing in this book on the building of the Body of Christ. First Timothy 3 speaks of the arrangement of elders and deacons in their service, but Ephesians does not speak of elders and deacons. Instead, it speaks of members growing. First, we need to grow, and then we can perfect others. This perfecting is according to 2 Corinthians 13, in which Christ is living and growing in us (v. 5) and we are enjoying the Triune God in the Father&rsquo;s love, the Son&rsquo;s grace, and the Spirit&rsquo;s fellowship (v. 14). This is the building up of the Body, not the building up of the church as a kind of organization. This building, for which we need the maturity in life, is unique. It is the organic Body of Christ, which will consummate the organic New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The Lord&rsquo;s Word of Seeming Rejection</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Turn your eyes away from me, / For they overcome me&rdquo; (S. S. 6:5a). This is the Lord&rsquo;s word of seeming rejection (cf. Mark 7:25-27; John 11:5-7; Exo. 32:10; Gen. 32:26), but actually it is the word inviting her expression of her overcoming love to Him. Such a rejection is actually a kind of welcoming. When the Lord says, &ldquo;Turn your eyes away from Me,&rdquo; He is really saying that we should put our eyes on Him all the time. When we love someone, we want that person to look at us all the time. The Beloved&rsquo;s words are words that invite the lover&rsquo;s expression of her overcoming love to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Her Hair Being Like a Flock of Goats</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Your hair is like a flock of goats / That repose on Mount Gilead&rdquo; (S. S. 6:5b). The meaning here is the same as that in 4:1b.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. Her Teeth Being Like a Flock of Ewes</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Your teeth are like a flock of ewes / That have come up from the washing, / All of which have borne twins, / And none of them is bereaved of her young&rdquo; (6:6). The meaning here is the same as that in 4:2.</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. Her Cheeks Being Like a Piece of Pomegranate</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Your cheeks are like a piece of pomegranate / Behind your veil&rdquo; (6:7). The meaning here is the same as that in 4:3b.</p><h2 class="head3">9. Her Beloved Being Loved<br />
by Many Different Believers</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There are sixty queens and eighty concubines / And virgins without number. / My dove, my perfect one, is but one; / She is the only one of her mother; / She is the choice one of her who bore her. / The daughters saw her, and they called her blessed; / The queens and the concubines, / They also praised her&rdquo; (6:8-9). Here we see that her Beloved (Solomon, typifying Christ in a positive sense) is loved by many different believers, some as queens, some as concubines, and some as virgins (all in the positive sense in poetry), but her Beloved, considering her as His love and perfect one, praises her as the only one lover of Him, the only and choice one regenerated by grace.</p>
<h2 class="head3">10. Her Beloved Praising Her as the Dawn</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this woman who looks forth like the dawn, / As beautiful as the moon, / As clear as the sun&rdquo; (v. 10a). Her Beloved praises her as the dawn, being beautiful as the moon and clear as the sun, bringing and shining the light on others.</p>
<h2 class="head3">11. Terrible as an Army with Banners</h2>
<p>In verse 10b the Beloved again says that she is as terrible as an army with banners. The meaning here is the same as that in verse 4b.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Lover&rsquo;s Work</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I went down to the orchard of nuts / To see the freshness of the valley, / To see whether the vine had budded, / Whether the pomegranates were in bloom&rdquo; (v. 11). Here we see the lover&rsquo;s work. She works on herself as a garden which is growing as the valley growing the fresh green things, as the vine budding, and as the pomegranates blossoming. She works on herself as a particular garden to grow nuts, to grow strong, hard food. She considers herself not only a garden of soft things but an orchard growing particular nuts for Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Lover&rsquo;s Progress and Victory</h2>
<p>Verses 12 and 13 describe the lover&rsquo;s progress and victory.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. She Not Being Aware<br />
That She Is Progressing Swiftly</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Before I was aware, / My soul set me among the chariots of my noble people&rdquo; (v. 12). She is not aware that she is progressing swiftly as the noble people&rsquo;s chariots going forth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Those Who Are Attracted<br />
by Her Asking Her to Come Back</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Return, return, O Shulammite; / Return, return, that we may gaze at you. / Why should you gaze at the Shulammite, / As upon the dance of two camps?&rdquo; (v. 13). Those who are attracted by her ask her to come back that they may look at her as at two camps of an army celebrating their victory by dancing (cf. Gen. 32:2).</p>
<p>In Song of Songs 6:13 the lover&rsquo;s name Shulammite, which is the feminine form of Solomon, is first used, indicating that at this point she has become Solomon&rsquo;s duplication, counterpart, the same as Solomon in life, nature, and image, as Eve to Adam (Gen. 2:20-23), signifying that the lover of Christ becomes the same as Him in life, nature, and image to match Him (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29) for their marriage.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF SONG OF SONGS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">SHARING IN THE WORK OF THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S. S. 7:1-13</h1>
<p>By the end of chapter six the lover, having passed through various stages of transformation, has become Solomon&rsquo;s duplication. She is now called <em>Shulammite</em> (the feminine form of <em>Solomon</em>&mdash;S. S. 6:13), for she has become the same as Solomon in life, nature, and image to match him for their marriage. This couple&rsquo;s becoming one indicates the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem the redeeming God (signified by Solomon) and all His redeemed (signified by the Shulammite) become one. The New Jerusalem is a mingling of divinity and humanity to express the processed, consummated Triune God in human virtues.</p>
<p>At this point it seems that the book should end, yet it continues. Solomon is the lord of many vineyards, and these vineyards require much labor. Now the country girl, who has become his Shulammite, must become his co-worker. This indicates that eventually Christ&rsquo;s lovers need to share in the work of the Lord. To share in the Lord&rsquo;s work we need to be qualified, and our qualification depends upon the spiritual equipment, that is, it depends on our being equipped with all the attributes of the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. EQUIPPED AS A WORKER IN THE WORK OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>In 7:1-9a we see that the lover, the Shulammite, is equipped as a worker in the work of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Spirit&rsquo;s Review of the Virtues of the Lover</h2>
<p>The speaker in verses 1 through 5 is not Solomon nor the Shulammite but a third one&mdash;the Spirit. The Spirit is one with Christ (2 Cor. 3:17), and the Spirit is one with the believers (Rev. 22:17). Thus, when this third one speaks, it is as if the two are speaking. Christ, the believers, and the Spirit are one.</p>
<p>Verses 1 through 5 are the Spirit&rsquo;s review of the virtues of the lover. Virtues are signs of maturity in the divine life. The more mature we are, the more virtues we have. Hence, to review the virtues of the lover is just to present what this co-worker has become, what she is.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Spirit Reviewing Her Beauty</h2>
<p>First, the Spirit, esteeming her as one of the royal household, reviews her beauty. Romans 5:17 reveals that the life of Christ in us can make us kings to reign: &ldquo;Those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.&rdquo; In Romans we see that Christ&rsquo;s life is a life of righteousness for our justification, a holy life for our sanctification, and a victorious life to make us overcomers. Romans also tells us that we can reign in this divine life of Christ. This life can make us kings; it can make us royal. Song of Songs indicates that a lover of Christ should reach the maturity in His royal life to reign as a king with Christ. This is the first virtue, the first qualification, for her to share in the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Her Beauty in the Gospel Preaching<br />
and in Her Standing Power</h2>
<p>Song of Songs 7:1 says, &ldquo;How beautiful are your footsteps in sandals, / O prince&rsquo;s daughter! / Your rounded thighs are like jewels, / The work of the hands of a skilled artist.&rdquo; Here the Spirit reviews her beauty in the gospel preaching and in her standing power through the skillful transforming work of God the Spirit (Rom. 10:15; 2 Cor. 3:18).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Her Beauty in Her Inward Parts</h2>
<p>Song of Songs 7:2 goes on to say, &ldquo;Your navel is a round goblet / That never lacks mixed wine; / Your belly is a heap of wheat, / Fenced in by lilies.&rdquo; In this verse the Spirit reviews her beauty in her inward parts filled with the divine life received through the drinking of Christ&rsquo;s blood and the eating of His flesh by faith (John 6:53-54).</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Her Beauty in Her Active Ability<br />
to Feed Others in a Living Way</h2>
<p>Song of Songs 7:3 continues, &ldquo;Your two breasts are like two fawns, / Twins of a gazelle.&rdquo; This refers to her beauty in her active ability to feed others in a living way (John 21:15, 17; cf. S. S. 4:5).</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Her Beauty in Her Submissive Will,<br />
in the Expression of Her Heart, and in Her Spiritual Sense of High and Sharp Discernment</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Your neck is like a tower of ivory; / Your eyes, like the pools in Heshbon / By the gates of Bath-rabbim; / Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, / Which faces Damascus&rdquo; (S. S. 7:4). Here the Spirit reviews her beauty in her submissive will (signified by the neck) wrought by the Spirit&rsquo;s transformation through sufferings for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s will, in the expression of her heart which is open to the light, clean, full of rest, and accessible (eyes&mdash;cf. 1:15; 4:1; 5:12), and in her spiritual sense of high and sharp discernment (nose).</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. Her Beauty in Her Thoughts and Intentionsand<br />
in Her Submission and Obedience for Her Consecration</h2>
<p>Song of Songs 7:5 says, &ldquo;Your head upon you is like Carmel, / And the locks of your head like purple. / The king is fettered by your tresses.&rdquo; In this verse the Spirit reviews her beauty in her thoughts and intentions, which are strong for God (cf. 1 Kings 18:19-39), and in her submission and obedience for her consecration, which are for the glory of God and capture her Beloved, who is the King.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Spirit&rsquo;s ReviewPresenting<br />
All the Believersa Beautiful Portrait<br />
of the Lovely Lover of Christ</h2>
<p>The Spirit&rsquo;s review presents all the believers a beautiful portrait of the lovely lover of Christ from her feet to her head as an expression of Christ, whom she loves (cf. S. S. 6:4-10). Such a portrait qualifies her to share in the work of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Beloved&rsquo;s Inserted Words</h2>
<p>Suddenly, while the Spirit is speaking, Christ inserts some words. In 7:6-9a we have the Beloved&rsquo;s inserted words.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Beloved, Considering Her His Love,<br />
Praising Her</h2>
<p>&ldquo;How beautiful and how pleasant in delights / You are, O love! / This your stature is like a palm tree, / And your breasts are like the clusters&rdquo; (vv. 6-7). Here the Beloved praises her first in her beauty and pleasantness that delight others and then in her mature stature like Christ (Eph. 4:13) and in her rich feeding of others.</p>
<p>A co-worker of Christ must be a beautiful and pleasant person who delights others. The young co-workers need to learn to be pleasant with others and to carry out an attracting work. Others should be happy to see you and want to have fellowship with you. The lover has become such a person, so she is qualified to participate in the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Beloved Enjoying Her Mature Stature of Christ<br />
and Sharing It with the Members of His Body</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I said, I will climb the palm tree; / I will take hold of its branches; / And your breasts will be like clusters of the vine, / And the fragrance of your nose like apples, / And the roof of your mouth like the best wine&rdquo; (S. S. 7:8-9a). This indicates that the Beloved will enjoy her mature stature of Christ and share it with the members of His Body. He wishes that her feeding of others would be rich, that her intuition would be fragrant for nourishing others in life, and that her foretaste would be of the power of the age to come (wine&mdash;John 2:10; Matt. 26:29).</p><h2 class="head1">II. WORKING TOGETHER WITH HER BELOVED</h2>
<p>We have seen the portrait of her qualifications. Now we will see that she works together with her Beloved (S. S. 7:9b-13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Wishing That Others<br />
Would Enjoy Smoothly What She Could Be</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Going down smoothly for my beloved, / Gliding through the lips of those who sleep&rdquo; (v. 9b). Here she continues her Beloved&rsquo;s word, wishing that the Lord would enjoy smoothly what she could be, and that those who love God in losing consciousness of themselves would enjoy what the Lord would enjoy. This indicates that our working together with others must become their enjoyment. As we co-workers are working together, we should remember to be a joy to others and to one another.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Confessing That She<br />
Belongs to Her Beloved for His Desire</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I am my beloved&rsquo;s, / And his desire is for me&rdquo; (v. 10). Here she confesses that she belongs to her Beloved for His desire.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Wanting to Carry Out with Her Beloved<br />
the Work That Is for the Entire World</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the fields; / Let us lodge in the villages&rdquo; (v. 11). This reveals that she wants to carry out with her Beloved the work that is for the entire world by sojourning from one place to another. This indicates that she is not sectarian. In the Lord&rsquo;s work it is not easy to keep our work open, to not keep our work &ldquo;in our pocket.&rdquo; We must learn to keep the work open, so that others can come to sojourn there and we can go to sojourn elsewhere. This is to keep one work in one Body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. She and Her Beloved Working<br />
Diligently Not for Herself but in the Churches</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Let us rise up early for the vineyards; / Let us see if the vine has budded, / If the blossom is open, / If the pomegranates are in bloom; / There I will give you my love&rdquo; (v. 12). She and her Beloved work diligently not for herself but in the churches, for others to bud, blossom, and bloom, in which she renders her love to her Beloved. If we work in this way, others will receive much help.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. In Her Working Together with Her Beloved There Being a Mutual Love<br />
Giving Forth Its Fragrance between Them</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The mandrakes give forth fragrance, / And over our doors are all choice fruits, / New as well as old. / These, my beloved, I have stored up for you&rdquo; (v. 13). In her working together with her Beloved there is a mutual love (signified by the mandrakes&mdash;Gen. 30:14) giving forth its fragrance between them as a couple loving each other, signifying the bridal love between the lover of Christ and Christ, and in their working places there are plenty of fragrant and choice fruits, new and old, which she stores up for her Beloved in love.</p>
<p>We need to learn to work for the Lord in a way that the Lord will enjoy. If in our working we care only for our own joy, we have already failed. We must work for His joy, bearing many fruits of love with much fragrance of love.</p>
<p>To share in the work of the Lord is not to work for the Lord but to work together with the Lord. This requires a matured life. The Pentecostal movement has stressed power and miracles, yet little attention has been paid to the matter of life. The Assembly of God has given more emphasis to the teaching of the truth, but it also has neglected the matter of life. Nevertheless, the Lord has had those who have sought out the experience of the inner life. This began with saints such as Madame Guyon, Brother Lawrence, and others. They were deep in life, but their teachings were mystical and mysterious. William Law improved their teachings into something quite practical, helping many believers. Andrew Murray was helped by him and was among the first to see that the New Testament Spirit of God has an element of humanity. He said that the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, the resurrected Christ who is the Spirit, contains His glorified humanity. Jessie Penn-Lewis received much help from Andrew Murray and stressed the subjective inner life, especially the subjective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death. A young man, T. Austin-Sparks, was saved through Mrs. Penn-Lewis&rsquo;s preaching and became her co-worker. Mrs. Penn-Lewis saw the subjective aspect of the death of Christ, and T. Austin-Sparks saw the principles of resurrection for the building up of the Body of Christ. Brother Nee received much help in the early days from the writings of these teachers and from other good writings from the second century forward.</p>
<p>Through our experience we have learned that to work together with the Lord we must be mature in life and we must teach the high truths. Song of Songs does not emphasize truth, mentioning it only once (<em>Amana</em> means &ldquo;truth&rdquo;&mdash;4:8). However, in Song of Songs we see that to work with the Lord we need the maturity in life, we need to be one with the Lord, and our work must be for His Body. Our Lord is Solomon and we must be the Shulammite; that is, we must be one with the Lord. Actually, to work with Christ we must be Christ. Paul was a real Shulammite because he lived Christ (Phil. 1:21).</p>
<p>The Shulammite works as Solomon&rsquo;s counterpart, taking care of all the vineyards (S. S. 8:11). This indicates that our work should be for the Body, not just one city. We must have a work that is for the entire world. This is what Paul did by establishing local churches and then working to bring them into the full realization of the Body of Christ.</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF SONG OF SONGS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOPING TO BE RAPTURED</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S. S. 8:1-14</h1>
<p>Song of Songs 8 reveals the lover&rsquo;s hope to be raptured. The Shulammite was matured in life to the extent that she became Solomon in every aspect and from every view, except for the fact that she still had the flesh.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. GROANING FOR HER FLESH</h2>
<p>&ldquo;O that you were like a brother to me, / Who nursed at my mother&rsquo;s breasts! / If I found you outside, I would kiss you, / And none would despise me&rdquo; (8:1). Realizing all the troubles from her flesh, she wishes that the Lord could be her brother in the flesh who was born of grace, the same as she is, and that she could kiss Him as one who is the same as she is in the flesh and no one would despise her. This indicates her groaning for her flesh. This shortage, this problem, could be settled only by rapture.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. HOPING TO BE SAVED<br />
FROM HER GROANING FOR THE FLESH</h2>
<p>In verses 2 through 4 we see that she is hoping to be saved from her groaning for the flesh (Rom. 8:19-25). This indicates that she hopes to be raptured through God&rsquo;s redemption of her body (Rom. 8:23b; Eph. 4:30b).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Hoping That She and Her Beloved<br />
Could Meet in the Heavenly Jerusalem</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I would lead you and bring you / Into my mother&rsquo;s house, / Who has instructed me; / I would make you drink spiced wine / From the juice of my pomegranate. / His left hand would be under my head, / And his right hand would embrace me&rdquo; (S. S. 8:2-3). Here she hopes that she and her Beloved could meet in the heavenly Jerusalem, where she is perfected by grace, and that she could afford her Beloved a way to enjoy the riches of her experience of the divine life for His satisfaction in His embracing, as what He did to her before rapture (2:6).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Her Beloved Charging<br />
the Meddling Believers Not to Awaken Her<br />
from Her Proper Hope of Rapture</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, / Do not rouse up or awaken my love / Until she pleases&rdquo; (v. 4). Her Beloved charges the meddling believers not to awaken her from her proper hope of rapture until she wakes up in the countenance of His face, that is, until she meets Him face to face in rapture.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. BEFORE THE RAPTURE</h2>
<p>Verses 5 through 14 are concerned with matters before the rapture.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Spirit Speaking<br />
through a Third Person</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, / Leaning on her beloved?&rdquo; (v. 5a). The Spirit, speaking through a third person, asks who this lover of Christ is who came up once from the spiritual wilderness by herself (3:6) and now comes up from the fleshly wilderness by her Beloved.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Christ Answering<br />
That She Is a Sinner Who Has Repented<br />
and Has Been Saved by Grace</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I awakened you under the apple tree: / There your mother was in labor with you; / There she was in labor and brought you forth&rdquo; (8:5b). Here Christ answers that she is a sinner who has repented and has been saved by grace through regeneration in Him as the Provider of life (2:3).</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Lover Admitting That by Herself<br />
She Is Not Able to Stand and Live<br />
in Her Beloved until Her Rapture</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Set me as a seal on your heart, / As a seal on your arm; / For love is as strong as death, / Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol; / Its flashes are the flashes of fire, / A flame of Jehovah. / Many waters cannot quench love, / Nor do floods drown it. / If a man gave all the substance of his house for love, / It would be utterly despised&rdquo; (8:6-7). Here we see that when the lover hears what her Beloved spoke in verse 5, she admits that by herself she is not able to stand and live in her Beloved until her rapture. She asks her Beloved to keep her by His love and His strength, for His love is as strong as the unshakable death and His jealousy is as cruel as the unconquerable Sheol, which is like the jealous Jehovah (Exo. 20:5; 2 Cor. 11:2), who is a consuming fire (Heb. 12:29) that burns up all the negative things that can be burned. His love cannot be quenched by trials nor drowned by persecutions nor replaced by any wealth. If one would replace it, he would be utterly despised.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Being Concerned<br />
for the Younger Lovers of Christ</h2>
<p>&ldquo;We have a little sister, / And she has no breasts: / What shall we do for our sister / On the day when she is spoken for?&rdquo; (S. S. 8:8). Since the lover has matured in life in pursuing Christ and in her ultimate consummation of her experience of Christ, before her rapture she with Christ is concerned for the younger lovers of Christ. She is concerned about how to perfect them to mature in life for the building up of the Body of Christ and to love Christ until they are betrothed to Him in love for the constituting of the bride of Christ (v. 8; 2 Cor. 11:2).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. She with Her Beloved Perfecting<br />
One Who Is a Wall and One Who Is a Door</h2>
<p>&ldquo;If she is a wall, / We will build on her a battlement of silver; / And if she is a door, / We will enclose her with boards of cedar&rdquo; (S. S. 8:9). If one is a wall for the separation of sanctification, she with her Beloved will perfect her by building upon her a battlement based upon the redemption of Christ (Rom. 3:24). If one is a door as an entry for people to enter into Christ, she with her Beloved will perfect her by building an enclosure around her with Christ&rsquo;s heavenly and glorified humanity (Matt. 26:64; Acts 3:13) and His heavenly human life (Phil. 2:7-8).</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Testifying That She Is a Separating Wall<br />
with Two Towers of Faith and Love</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers; / Then I was in his eyes like one who has found peace&rdquo; (S. S. 8:10). Here she testifies that she is a separating wall with two towers of her faith and love (1 Tim. 1:14), which have been developed, so she is in the eyes of her Beloved as a person who has obtained peace based upon sanctification.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. In the Work of Christ<br />
He Being the Lord of All the Works,<br />
and the Lover of Christ<br />
Participating in One Part of the Work</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon: / He let out the vineyard to keepers; / Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit. / My vineyard, which is mine, is before me. / You will have the thousand, O Solomon; / And those who keep its fruit, two hundred&rdquo; (S. S. 8:11-12). In the work of Christ He is the Lord of all the works (Baal-hamon and vineyard). The lover of Him participates in one part of the work (one vineyard) and gives to Him what He requires (a thousand shekels), and she as one joined to her Beloved gives to herself as a keeper of the fruit (not of the vineyard) two hundred shekels as a reward. This indicates that Christ as our Beloved is the Lord of all, possessing all things (Acts 10:36), and we as His lovers share in all His possessions (1 Cor. 3:21-22) freely in the grace of Christ (Rom. 3:24) which is the issue of the love of God (2 Cor. 13:14). Yet, we as His lovers still should give Him as our Beloved what we should give, not as a duty but as a matter of love (cf. Gal. 5:13). Christ as our Beloved, joining Himself to us as one, still likes to give us, as His lovers joined to Him as one, a reward of righteousness (2 Tim. 4:8). This implies that Christ as our Beloved gives us a reward for the residue of our labor as an incentive to our faithfulness in our labor for Him in love (cf. Matt. 25:20-23); hence, it is a reward of righteousness.</p>
<p>Solomon as a great lord, possessing many vineyards, rented the vineyards to gain produce. The vineyard keepers would pay Solomon one thousand shekels. Each vineyard keeper had helpers to keep the fruit. Each vineyard keeper had to pay those who kept the fruit two hundred shekels. We also have received a part of the Lord&rsquo;s work. According to the Lord&rsquo;s requirement, we should pay Him the one thousand shekels, that is, pay Him what He requires. Because we do not have helpers, we as the vineyard keepers are able to keep the fruit ourselves. Thus, instead of giving the two hundred shekels to others, we give it to ourselves. This is the same as the Lord giving us two hundred shekels as a reward.</p>
<p>Today, we work with the Lord, and He requires that we pay Him something. If we are faithful, we pay what the Lord requires. Yet we still have a residue, which becomes our reward.</p>
<p>To fulfill the Lord&rsquo;s requirements in our working with Him, we must have some residue. With this residue as the basis, the Lord will reward us when He comes back. According to Matthew 25 the Lord requires not only what He has delivered to us but what He has given to us with interest (vv. 26-27). This interest is the residue. In this parable the Lord says to the faithful one, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master&rdquo; (vv. 21, 23). This is to enjoy the millennial kingdom as the Lord&rsquo;s reward. However, in this parable the slothful slave, who did not have any interest or residue was disciplined and punished (vv. 28-30).</p>
<p>Song of Songs 8:11-12 shows us that our work with the Lord must exceed what He requires. Then we will have a residue, and this will be the reward which He will give to us righteously. In 2 Timothy 4:7-8 Paul said, &ldquo;I have fought the good fight; I have finished the course; I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, with which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will recompense me in that day.&rdquo; Here we see that the reward is not according to the Lord&rsquo;s grace but according to His righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Lover of Her Beloved<br />
Asking Him to Let Her Hear His Voice</h2>
<p>Song of Songs 8:13 says, &ldquo;O you who dwell in the gardens, / My companions listen for your voice; / Let me hear it.&rdquo; The lover of her Beloved asks Him who dwells in the believers as His gardens to let her hear His voice as her companions listen for His voice. This indicates that in the work, which we as the lovers of Christ who express Him as our living outwardly do for Him as our Beloved who indwells us as our life inwardly, we should fellowship with Him in His speaking. As we are working with Him, we need to maintain our fellowship with Him, always listening to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. The Lover of Her Beloved<br />
Praying That He Would Make Haste<br />
to Come Back in the Power of His Resurrection<br />
to Set Up His Sweet and Beautiful Kingdom</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Make haste, my beloved, / And be like a gazelle or a young hart / Upon the mountains of spices&rdquo; (v. 14). The lover of her Beloved prays that He would make haste to come back in the power of His resurrection to set up His sweet and beautiful kingdom which will fill the whole earth (Rev. 11:15; Dan. 2:35). Here we should note that the prayer of this lover of her Beloved is the concluding word of this poetic book, portraying the union and communion between Christ as the Bridegroom and His lovers as the bride in their bridal love, as the prayer of John, a lover of Christ, is the concluding word of the Holy Scripture, revealing God&rsquo;s eternal economy concerning Christ and the church in His divine love (Rev. 22:20).</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>The poem, as a type, in this poetic book as the story of the love between a king and a country girl is a marvelous and vivid portrait, as the fulfillment, of the bridal love between Christ as the Bridegroom and His lovers as His bride in their mutual enjoyment in the mingling of His divine attributes with the human virtues of His lovers. The correspondence of the progression with its stages on these two sides of the poem and its portrait is the intrinsic revelation of the Holy Word of the omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent God. The progress begins with the first stage of Christ&rsquo;s lovers&rsquo; being drawn to pursue Him for satisfaction, continues through the following stages of (1) their being called to be delivered from the self through the oneness with the cross, (2) their being called to live in ascension as the new creation in resurrection, (3) their being called more strongly to live within the veil through the cross after resurrection, and (4) their sharing in the work of the Lord, and ends with the last stage of their hoping to be raptured. May such a progress with its stages be a landmark to us in the course of our pursuing of Christ for His and our mutual satisfaction!</p><h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF SONG OF SONGS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FOUR STAGES<br />
OF SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE IN SONG OF SONGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S. S. 1:2-4a; 2:14; 4:8; 6:4</h1>
<p>Song of Songs, although it is a short book, contains a great many figures and is full of important points. In reading this book it is easy for us to lose our way. However, through the writings of those who have gone before us, especially through Brother Nee&rsquo;s study of this book, Song of Songs has been opened to us. I am thankful that through Brother Nee we can see that Song of Songs is a spiritual life-story of Christian experiences, signified by a romance. In Song of Songs these experiences are in four stages.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRST STAGE&mdash;ATTRACTED BY CHRIST<br />
AND DRAWN BY HIM TO PURSUE<br />
AFTER HIM FOR FULL SATISFACTION</h2>
<p>In the first stage we are attracted by Christ and drawn by Him to pursue after Him for full satisfaction (1:2&mdash;2:7). This stage includes many things: yearning to be kissed by Christ; the fellowship in the inner chamber; entering into the church life by following the footsteps of the flock; being transformed by the remaking of the Spirit; and participating in Christ&rsquo;s rest and satisfaction.</p>
<p>In this stage a sinner saved by grace is stirred up, attracted by Christ&rsquo;s love, and charmed by what He is. Song of Songs 1:2 says of Christ, &ldquo;Your love is better than wine.&rdquo; Nothing in the whole universe can compare with Him. Verse 3 goes on to speak of Christ&rsquo;s &ldquo;anointing oils&rdquo; and says that His &ldquo;name is like ointment poured forth.&rdquo; This ointment, which is actually Christ Himself as the Spirit, is a compound of divinity, humanity, Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, the effectiveness of His death, and the power of His resurrection. The name here signifies Christ&rsquo;s person, His being, and Christ is this compound Spirit. &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:45b). This indicates that Christ&rsquo;s name as His person is the compound ointment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SECOND STAGE&mdash;CALLED TO BE DELIVERED<br />
FROM THE SELF THROUGH THE ONENESS<br />
WITH THE CROSS</h2>
<p>The second stage is the call to be delivered from the self through the oneness with the cross (S. S. 2:8&mdash;3:5). In brief, the second stage is the stage of the experience of the cross. In considering this stage, it is sufficient that we remember just one word&mdash;cross. Song of Songs 2:14 says, &ldquo;My dove, in the clefts of the rock, / In the covert of the precipice, / Let me see your countenance, / Let me hear your voice; / For your voice is sweet, / And your countenance is lovely.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;the clefts of the rock&rdquo; and &ldquo;the covert of the precipice&rdquo; are figures of the cross. Christ wants to see His lover&rsquo;s lovely countenance and hear her sweet voice in her oneness, union, with the cross. The cross is the central stress in this section on deliverance from the self.</p>
<p>When we pursue after Christ and become satisfied with the rest and enjoyment in Christ, we may become very occupied with and concerned about the self and thereby fall into introspection. Thus, we need to experience the denying of the self and the breaking of the self by being one with the cross. We need to stay in the clefts of the rock and remain hidden in the covert of the precipice. This means that we should daily stay at the cross. We should be able to say with Paul, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). We&mdash;&ldquo;I,&rdquo; the self, the natural man, the old man&mdash;have been crucified, and now we should stay on the cross. This is to be in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the precipice. How can we reach the clefts and the covert, which are rugged places high up in the mountains? How can we remain there? We can go to the cross and remain there only by the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (Phil. 3:10).</p><h2 class="head1">THE THIRD STAGE&mdash;CALLED BY CHRIST<br />
TO LIVE IN ASCENSION AS THE NEW CREATION OF GOD<br />
IN THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The third stage is to be called by Christ to live in ascension as the new creation of God in the resurrection of Christ (3:6&mdash;5:1). Christ&rsquo;s death is followed by Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, and in His resurrection we are a new creation. The new creation is a product of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Anyone who is in Christ and in His resurrection is a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17). The matters of resurrection and a new creation are closely related to Christ&rsquo;s ascension. Actually, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension are one. If we are in His resurrection, we are also in His ascension. When we live in resurrection, we are surely living in ascension.</p>
<p>Proof that the third stage of spiritual experience in Song of Songs is the call to live in ascension is found in 4:8: &ldquo;Come with me from Lebanon, my bride; / With me from Lebanon come. / Look from the top of Amana, / From the top of Senir and Hermon, / From the lions&rsquo; dens, / From the leopards&rsquo; mountains.&rdquo; As we have pointed out, <em>Amana</em> means &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; <em>Senir</em> means &ldquo;soft armor,&rdquo; and <em>Hermon</em> means &ldquo;destruction.&rdquo; When we live in ascension, we have the truth (signified by Amana) and we have the victory (signified by Senir and Hermon) over the enemy. When we live in ascension, we realize that the war is over, that the victory has been gained, and that the enemy has been destroyed. The lions&rsquo; dens and the leopards&rsquo; mountains signify Satan and his evil forces. These evil powers are in the air, but when we live in ascension, we are in the heavens, far above them. Furthermore, when we live in ascension, spontaneously we are a new creation of God in the resurrection of Christ. How wonderful!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOURTH STAGE&mdash;<br />
CALLED BY CHRIST MORE STRONGLY<br />
TO LIVE WITHIN THE VEIL THROUGH HIS CROSS<br />
AFTER THE EXPERIENCE OF HIS RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>We may think that the third stage is the highest stage, but according to Song of Songs there is yet another stage. The fourth stage is to be called by Christ more strongly to live within the veil through His cross after the experience of His resurrection (5:2&mdash;6:13). In ascension, in the heavens, there is the sanctuary of God, and a veil, which signifies the flesh (Heb. 10:20), divides this heavenly sanctuary into two sections. We should not think that once we have arrived at the heavenly sanctuary, we have already attained the highest point of spiritual experience. We may have come to the highest point, but we may not yet be in the inner chamber of the heavenly sanctuary. This inner chamber is the Holy of Holies&mdash;God Himself. The veil separating the Holy of Holies from the Holy Place was split in two at the time of Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion (Matt. 27:51), but the veil has not been taken away. The veil is still there. After we reach ascension we eventually realize that with the sanctuary in the heavens there is an inner chamber and that we need to enter within the veil and live within the veil, that is, live in God Himself.</p>
<p>We have seen that the veil signifies the flesh, which is worse than the self. After the first stage, the object of our dealing is the self. Later, in the fourth stage, the object of our dealing is the flesh. This requires a further experience of the cross, for we need to enter within the veil through the cross. This means that even after we have experienced resurrection and ascension, we still need the cross in order to live in the Holy of Holies within the veil. We experience the cross in the second stage, but we need to have the deeper experience of the cross in the fourth stage.</p>
<p>Song of Songs 6:4 says, &ldquo;You are as beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, / As lovely as Jerusalem.&rdquo; Here the lover of Christ is likened to Tirzah and Jerusalem, indicating that she has become God&rsquo;s dwelling place. When she was first drawn by the Lord, He likened her to a mare, a horse among Pharaoh&rsquo;s chariots. Then she was likened to a rose in Sharon, a lily in the valleys and among thorns, a dove, a pillar of smoke, a bed, a palanquin, a garden, and a fountain with a spring. Now she is likened to the heavenly dwelling of God and the heavenly Jerusalem. The word <em>Jerusalem</em> in verse 4 is a sign of the New Jerusalem, indicating that all the lovers of Christ eventually will become the New Jerusalem&mdash;the ultimate consummation of the Bible. Here in God&rsquo;s Holy of Holies we have the highest spiritual experience.</p>
<p>We have seen the four stages of spiritual experience in this book: the stage of pursuit, the stage of the cross, the stage of ascension, and the stage of living in the Holy of Holies. If we have a clear view of these four stages, we will have the proper understanding of Song of Songs. Such an understanding surely is priceless.</p></body></html>
