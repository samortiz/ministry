   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED IN GENESIS In the Beginning God Created</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Heavens and the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are at least twelve instances in Genesis that indicate or imply the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first is Genesis 1:1, which says, In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The subject of this verse, God, which is Elohim in Hebrew, is plural in number, but the predicate, created, is singular.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, Elohim is uni-plural, implying the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The plural subject, God, implies the three of the Godhead, and the singular predicate, created, implies the one God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The three of the Godhead worked as one to create.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God created the heavens and the earth in His trinity because He created the heavens and the earth for man vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Zechariah 12:1 says, Thus declares Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This verse reveals that God s intention and goal in creating the heavens and the earth were to have a man with a spirit so that man may possess Him and enjoy Him and so that God may work Himself into man to fulfill His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first indication of the Trinity in the Bible, revealed in God s creation of the heavens and earth, is for man to exist so that God may dispense Himself into man for man s enjoyment and God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit of God Was Brooding upon</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>the Surface of the Waters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And God Said,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let There Be Light; and There Was Light</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Genesis 1:2-3 says, The Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And God said, Let there be light; and there was light.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Initially, we may not see that these verses also imply the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, we must consider why the subject of verse 2 is the Spirit of God and not simply God as in verses 1 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After verse 1 says, God created, verse 2 says, The Spirit of God was brooding.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This implies the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God is not as simple as some think He is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In a sense, the word triune, meaning three-one, is a complicated, puzzling word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 1 describes God s original creation, and verses 2b and 3 describe His restoration and further creation after the judgment and corruption implied in verse 2a.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God carried out His restoration and further creation by His Spirit and His speaking His word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 1:1-3 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God...All things came into being through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All things came into being, were created, through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hebrews 11:3 says, The universe has been framed by the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The universe was framed, that is, created, by the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Psalm 33:9 says, He spoke, and it was.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that God s speaking created.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Genesis 1:1 it is God who is creating, but in verses 2 and 3 it is the Spirit of God and God s word who are creating.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here is the implication of the Divine Trinity God, His Spirit, and His word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Revelation 19:13 says that Christ is called the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Divine Trinity being implied by God, His Spirit, and His word shows that the three of the Trinity are distinct but not separate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God s Spirit is God s breath Job 33:4 , and God s word is God s breathing 2 Tim 3:16 , which is by God s breath Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Job 33:4 says, The Spirit of God has made me, / And the breath of the Almighty has enlivened me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this verse we can see that the Spirit of God is the breath of the Almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Second Timothy 3:16 says, All Scripture is God-breathed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God, His Spirit, and His word are distinct, but they are inseparably related to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A man, his breath, and his speaking are three distinct things, but they cannot be separated from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is impossible to speak if we do not breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, speaking is a kind of breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, the implication of the Trinity in Genesis 1:1-3 with God, His Spirit, and His word establishes a basic principle concerning the Trinity that the three are distinct but not separate.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God Said, Let Us Make Man in Our Image, according to Our Likeness;...</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God Created Man in His Own Image;</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>in the Image of God He Created Him;</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Male and Female He Created Them</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God s aspect of being singular yet plural is also shown in Genesis 1:26-27, which says, God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness;...God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Elohim referred to Himself in verse 26 using Us and Our, but Moses referred to Elohim in verse 27 using His and He.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The pronouns Us and Our are plural, but His and He are singular.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Again, this reveals that God is uni-plural, triune.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, the Trinity is clearly indicated here directly for the creation of man in God s image with the intention that man may express God by having God wrought into him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These points strongly confirm that the Trinity is for God to dispense Himself into us for our enjoyment and experience so that we may express Him.</S>
