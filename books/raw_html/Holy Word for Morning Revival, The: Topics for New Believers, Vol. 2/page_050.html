<ol class="decimal">
<li>How glorious, how bright it shines,<br />
The holy, new Jerusalem;<br />
It is God&rsquo;s dwelling place with man,<br />
The spotless bride of Christ, the Lamb.</li>
<li>Saints of the Old and of the New,<br />
Heirs of the promise God bestowed,<br />
Components of the city are,<br />
Together built for God&rsquo;s abode.</li>
<li>Perfectly square the city lies,<br />
All sides are equal&mdash;length, width, height;<br />
No measurement more long or short,<br />
No part oblique, it stands upright.</li>
<li>The city with its street pure gold<br />
As clear as glass transparent is,<br />
Showing that God&rsquo;s transcendent life<br />
Its quality and nature is.</li>
<li>Twelve city gates are each one pearl;<br />
Thus man is through redemption shown<br />
Reborn and as a pearl transformed,<br />
Entering to a realm God&rsquo;s own.</li>
<li>The twelve foundations of its wall<br />
Are with twelve precious stones adorned;<br />
Through fire and pressure recomposed<br />
And with eternal value formed.</li>
<li>The wall of jasper, crystal clear,<br />
God&rsquo;s glory by it fully shown;<br />
His glorious light through it does shine,<br />
And He appears as jasper stone.</li>
<li>The wall a separation makes,<br />
Excluding all that is unclean;<br />
Gold, pearls, and precious stones alone<br />
The holy city has within.</li>
<li>God and the Lamb the Temple are!<br />
We shall behold His glorious face;<br />
His presence never will depart,<br />
We&rsquo;ll worship Him thru endless days.</li>
<li>The city needs no sun nor moon<br />
For God&rsquo;s own glory is its light;<br />
The Lamb&rsquo;s the lamp the city bears,<br />
In all directions blazing bright.</li>
<li>Out from the throne of God and the Lamb<br />
Flows midst the street a living stream,<br />
And on its banks, on either side,<br />
The tree of life is thriving seen.</li>
<li>This signifies the life of God<br />
Not just for food or water flows,<br />
But carries God&rsquo;s authority<br />
As it throughout the city goes.</li>
<li>The street of purest gold therein<br />
God&rsquo;s nature as the way doth show;<br />
A river in it flows for drink<br />
And fruits of life abundant grow.</li>
<li>The number twelve means government,<br />
Perfection which eternal is;<br />
God blent with man it also tells&mdash;<br />
Three multiplied by four shows this.</li>
<li>Darkness and death shall be no more,<br />
Sorrow and pain shall pass away,<br />
Old will be gone and all be new,<br />
God will abide with man for aye.</li>
<li>The city has God&rsquo;s image full,<br />
It rules for Him, the sovereign King,<br />
Fulfilling His eternal plan,<br />
Complete content to Him to bring.</li>
