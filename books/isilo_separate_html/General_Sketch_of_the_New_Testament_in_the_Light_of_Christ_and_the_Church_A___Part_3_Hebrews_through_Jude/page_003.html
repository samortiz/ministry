Neither did the heathen religions have such a covenant from God. Therefore, Judaism is altogether good. How then could the Hebrew believers as people of God forsake this religion? This bothered the Hebrews, because they had inherited all the things of Judaism, but then they believed in Christ and became Christians. On the one hand, they had received Judaism, while on the other hand they had received Christ. They realized that they needed Christ, but they could not give up Judaism. This became a bothering to them. It was under such a situation that Paul wrote this book to clarify the situation. He told them that Christ is altogether better than all of those five items.<p>In Judaism there is God, but Paul told the Hebrews that Christ is the very God. If we do not have Christ, we have God in terminology and name only, not in reality. The reality of this God is Christ, so in order to have God, we need Christ. Christ is better than Judaism because Judaism gives us God in name but not in reality, while Christ is the very embodiment and reality of God. If we have Christ as our reality, there is no need to hold on to Judaism. Since we have the reality, there is no need to keep the mere terms.<h2 class=head2>The Sections of Hebrews</h2><p>In the first two chapters of Hebrews, Paul tells us that Christ is better than the angels (1:4-2:18). Then chapters three and four tell us that Christ is better than the Jewish leaders (3:1-4:13). Christ is better than Moses and better than Joshua. From Hebrews 4:14 through 7:28, Paul tells us that Christ is also superior to Aaron and all the priests of the order of Aaron. Then from 8:1 through 10:18, Paul tells us that Christ&#8217;s new covenant is superior to the old. Chapters eleven through thirteen are a final section of this book, speaking of faith as the unique pathway to follow Christ, among other matters. We should keep these sections of Hebrews in mind. On the one hand, this book is hard to understand, but on the other hand, no other book is so clearly divided as Hebrews. The first four sections tell us that Christ is superior to everything else, and the last section shows us the way to go on and follow Christ.<p>In addition, each of the five sections contains a particular exhortation or warning. In order to understand this book, we must take care of these five warnings. The warnings appear either at the end of a section or midway through it. Hebrews 2:1-4, for example, is the first exhortation and warning, found in the middle of the first section of this book.<h2 class=head1>GOD SPEAKING IN THE SON</h2><p>The first three verses of Hebrews are the introduction of this book. This book begins by telling us that God is speaking in the Son. In the Old Testament time God spoke through many prophets, but now in the New Testament age God speaks in the Son. The Son is the Word of God, the explanation and expression of God.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST SUPERIOR TO THE ANGELS</h2><p>The first section of Hebrews, from 1:4 to the end of chapter two, reveals to us that Christ is superior to the angels because of two things. First, since Christ is God Himself and God is certainly superior to the angels, Christ is superior to the angels. Second, because Christ is also a man, as a man He is superior to the angels. We should give up wanting to be like an angel. Many times I have thanked the Lord that I was created as a man, not as an angel, because man is superior to the angels. Not only is God superior to the angels, but man is also superior to them. Therefore, in the first two chapters Christ is superior to the angels because according to chapter one He is God, and according to chapter two He is man.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
