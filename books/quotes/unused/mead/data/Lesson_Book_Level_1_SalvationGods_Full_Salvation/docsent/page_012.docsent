   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Heb 10:12; 9:28, 12, 14; 1 Pet 1:18-19 Outline What is redemption? to repossess at a cost Lost because of sin Redeemed by Christ s blood Text</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this lesson, we begin to cover five objective aspects of God s full salvation that solved our problem before God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first item is the redemption which Christ accomplished for us by His death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, read Ephesians 1:7: In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I. WHAT IS REDEMPTION?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>TO REPOSSESS AT A COST</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Redemption is the noun form of the word redeem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word redeem means to purchase back something which originally was yours but which had become lost.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This hymnal belongs to me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the hymnal becomes lost and I pay the price of buying it back, I would be redeeming the hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, redemption means to repossess at a cost.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We originally belonged to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We were His possession.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, we were lost.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, God did not give us up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He paid the price to have us back, repossessing us at a great cost.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even after we had become lost, He desired to regain us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, this was not easy for God to do because our being lost involved us in sins and in many other things that were against His righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because we were lost, we had many problems with God in respect to His righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We were under a threefold demand, the demand of righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many requirements were laid upon us, and it was impossible for us to fulfill them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The price was too great.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God paid the price for us, repossessing us at a tremendous cost.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ died on the cross to accomplish eternal redemption for us Gal 3:13; 1 Pet 2:24; 3:18; 2 Cor 5:21; Heb 10:12; 9:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His blood has obtained eternal redemption for us Heb 9:12, 14; 1 Pet 1:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>LOST BECAUSE OF SIN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are not righteous according to God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are not holy as God is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our destiny was holiness, but we fell from it and received a sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a result, we are not expressing God, but expressing Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>So, we have come very short of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What a dreadful condition!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because of sin, transgression, and lawlessness, we became lost.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We were under the demand of the law, and, according to this law, we were cursed to die.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>REDEEMED BY CHRIST S BLOOD</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But, praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jesus Christ came to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By His righteous death, He redeemed us back to God and to His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To accomplish this, His precious blood was the price.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because we could not pay such a high price, He paid it for us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We were destined to die in sin, but now we may come back to God, be forgiven by God, receive God s life, be filled with Him, and express Him.</S>
