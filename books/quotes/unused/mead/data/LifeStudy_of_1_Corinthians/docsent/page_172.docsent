   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 12:1-3 we have the governing principle of the spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 1 Paul says, Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapters twelve through fourteen Paul deals with the ninth problem among the Corinthians, the problem of spiritual gifts in relation to God s administration and operation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verses 2 and 3 Paul continues, You know that when you were of the nations, you were led away to dumb idols, however you were led.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Wherefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The apostle s thought here is that the dumb, voiceless idols in verse 2 make their worshippers dumb and voiceless.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the living God causes His worshippers to speak in His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This kind of speaking is related to the spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No one who speaks in the Spirit of God would say, Jesus is accursed ; he would like to say and he is able to say, Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No worshippers of God should be silent, but all should use their voices to speak forth the Lord Jesus in the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This to speak the Lord Jesus is the main function of all the spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The governing principle of the gifts is to speak by our spirit with the Spirit, that is, to utter something with the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of speaking is centered on the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, what we speak should be focused on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ should be the substance, the element, the essence, the center, and the circumference of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Paul writes about the gifts of the members of the Body, he begins by speaking of dumb idols.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The gifts, of course, have nothing to do with idols.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But what Paul says concerning the spiritual gifts is spoken against the Corinthians background in idol worship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verse 2 Paul reminds them that when they were of the nations, of the Gentiles, they were led away to dumb idols.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here Paul does not say they were led away to sins, lusts, or the world; he says that they were led away to dumb idols, in whatever way they were led.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No matter by what way they were led, they were led to dumb idols.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul s use of the adjective dumb implies that both the idols and those who worship them are dumb, unable to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the Corinthians were unbelievers, they also were dumb; they were silent worshippers of dumb idols.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that when they worshipped the idols, they did not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, because the idols were dumb, they also were dumb, silent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But after coming to believe in Christ, they are now worshippers of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is by speaking that we prove that we are living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our God is living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible reveals that our living God is the speaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Throughout the centuries, especially in this New Testament age, God has been speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To prove that we are a living member of Christ, we also must speak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We do not mean, of course, that we should speak in a light way or that we should gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, we should speak something for the Lord and even speak forth the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to speak things which are centered on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, Christ must be our speaking, our utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He must be the center and circumference of our speech.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To speak Christ in this way is a strong proof that we are living.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because the God whom we worship is the living and speaking God, we also speak and thereby prove that we are the living members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I can testify from experience that the more I speak, the more living I am.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To speak is actually to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I speak by exercising my spirit, I breathe Christ in. Day by day, we need to speak Christ to our husband or wife, to our children, and to our neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to speak Christ, taking Him as our center.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This speaking is the governing principle of the spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to verse 3, our speaking must be governed by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this verse Paul says, Wherefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Greek words rendered, Jesus is accursed, literally are Anathema Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Anathema denotes a thing or person accursed; set apart, devoted, to woe.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To say Jesus is accursed means to speak negatively concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever someone speaks in a negative way about Christ, that is a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In verse 3 Paul also says, No one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a literal translation of the Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This verse indicates that when we say with a proper spirit, Lord Jesus, we are in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, to call on the Lord Jesus is the way to participate in, to enjoy, and to experience the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have just pointed out that the literal translation of the Greek in verse 3 is Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we say, Jesus is Lord, we admit that the Lord Jesus is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But when we say, Lord Jesus, we not only make such an admission, but we also call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To say Lord Jesus is sweeter than saying Jesus is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This difference can be illustrated in the way we may speak of our father.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, to say, This is my father, is not as sweet and intimate as to say, My father!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In your daily living do you say, Jesus is Lord, or do you more often call, Lord Jesus ?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Most of us would testify that we call, Lord Jesus, much more frequently than we declare, Jesus is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No doubt, the expression Lord Jesus in verse 3 indicates calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today some oppose the practice of calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But in 12:3 Paul definitely refers to calling on the Lord audibly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The translation Jesus is Lord does not indicate calling.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But the literal rendering Lord Jesus indicates not only an admission, but also an address, a calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many of us can testify that calling on the name of the Lord Jesus causes us to be living.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we feel somewhat depressed, we simply need to call, O Lord Jesus, and we are strengthened and uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Reports have come to us that a number of saints in a certain place have been helped by calling on the name of the Lord and by pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>One brother testified that the Lord has given us His Word, His Spirit, and His name.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We may enjoy His Word by pray-reading; we may enjoy His Spirit by following the anointing; and we may enjoy His name by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As those who worship the living God, we must speak.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, many Christians are dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Pentecostal movement came in as a reaction to this dumbness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>At different times in the past, there have also been reactions against the dumbness of formal religion.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>For example, at the time of John Wesley, the preaching of the Word was limited to the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>No one was allowed to preach in a secular place.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But John Wesley reacted against that restriction and preached outdoors, on the streets and even to miners as they came from the coal mines after work.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Inspired by Wesley s preaching, some repented and wept.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Others, beside themselves for joy, shouted to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Christ is God s Word, God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Thus, when we enjoy Christ, we also shall speak.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We shall speak forth Christ and, at times, even shout Christ forth.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>On our way to the meetings of the church, we should not be dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Even as we are on the way, we should speak Christ and then bring Christ to the meeting by our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>To say that Jesus is accursed is to utter negative things concerning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But to say, Lord Jesus, means to speak of Him in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Furthermore, in 12:3 Paul tells us that no one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What an encouraging word!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>As long as we say, Lord Jesus, with a proper spirit, we are in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Do you feel that you are not in the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Then call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>By calling on His name, you will breathe in the heavenly air, the Holy Spirit, and you will be in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>However, if you are silent, not calling on the Lord, you will not breathe in the spiritual air.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This will make you spiritually unhealthy and unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But the more you speak for Christ and even speak Christ, the happier you will be.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We in the Lord s recovery have many positive things to talk about.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We have Christ, we have the church life, and we have God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Let us all learn to speak Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This speaking is the governing principle of the spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>When we were in Elden Hall in Los Angeles in 1970, the meetings always started well ahead of the scheduled time.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The saints gathered to speak, sing, shout, and praise long before the scheduled meeting time.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>But in certain places today there is a tendency for the saints to be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>It seems many have lost their function and their gift.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This opens the way for a return to the fallen situation, where there are meetings with forms and a system of clergy-laity.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In the church all the members should be living and speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Then all the time will be filled with the speaking of Christ and for Christ.</S>
