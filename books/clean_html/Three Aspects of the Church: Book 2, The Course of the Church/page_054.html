<h2 class="head3">Raising Up Churches in Taiwan</h2>
<p>When I arrived in Taiwan in 1949, the church in Taipei was the only relatively large church on the island. We met in a Japanese-style house on Shanghai Road, which is presently Lin Sen South Road; there were about one hundred people in the meetings, eighty to ninety percent of whom had come from the mainland. Brothers Chang Wu-chen, Sun Feng-lu, Liu Hsiao-liang, and Chao Ching-huai had been sent by the co-workers in mainland China to Taiwan at the end of 1948. Because the church in Taipei was small and weak, the co-workers asked these four brothers to take the responsibility to lead the church. This was the first strengthening of the church in Taipei.</p>
<p>In January 1949 Brother Chang Yu-lan and more than seventy brothers and sisters from the College of Medicine run by the Nationalist government&rsquo;s Department of Defense arrived in Taiwan. They were the second strengthening of the church in Taipei. Brother Chang Yu-lan had been a responsible brother in the church in Nanking; thus, when he came to Taipei, he was brought into taking the lead in Taipei. In May the Lord led me to Taiwan, and even more saints came at that time; that was the third strengthening of the church in Taipei.</p>
<p>The second largest church in Taiwan was the church in Kaohsiung. Brother Lin Mu-hsiang and his family were gained by the Lord in Chefoo in 1942 and 1943; after China won the Sino-Japanese War, he was sent by the Nationalist government to collect port duties in Kaohsiung. When he and his wife arrived in Kaohsiung, they began to meet in their own home. At the end of 1948 Brothers Chu Hsun-min and Cheng Ta-chiang came to Kaohsiung from Tsingtao and Shanghai respectively. Several of their colleagues also came to Kaohsiung. Through this, the church in Kaohsiung was strengthened. Thus, there were two relatively strong churches in Taiwan, one in the northern part and one in the southern part of the province.</p>
<p>A brother who recently graduated from the engineering department of the National Chiao Tung University came to Keelung in 1948 for an engineering apprenticeship at the Keelung Shipyards. Before he left Shanghai, he had a lengthy time of fellowship with me; he did not want to leave Shanghai and was afraid that by being alone in Keelung he would miss the spiritual leading in Shanghai. However, he accepted the arrangement because of the circumstances. When he arrived in Keelung, he met Brother Lee Wei-yi from Nanking, who was working as an engineer at a fertilizer factory, and they began to meet.</p>
<p>The church in Taichung began in the same way when brothers came there from the mainland. Brothers Abel Chu and Liu Chiu-fei arrived first; they were both serving in the Air Force. One was a chemical engineer, and the other was assistant director of a medical college. When they arrived in Taichung, they began to meet.</p>
<p>In 1949 there was no church in Chiayi. A sister named Chu Chih-pu worked as a health educator in Chiayi, and before I visited the southern part of the island for the second time, she wrote a letter asking me to visit her. When I went, I met Brother Liu Kuang-chih. They used a public place in Sister Chu&rsquo;s workplace to begin to have prayer meetings.</p>
<p>The church in Hsinchu began through Sister Chu Chih-pu and some other sisters who went to Hsinchu to teach health education. Later, Brother Cheng Pao-chih graduated from teachers&rsquo; college and went to Hsinchu to teach school; this strengthened the church in Hsinchu.</p>
<p>In this way the churches were raised up. According to our statistics, about four hundred brothers and sisters came to Taiwan from mainland China in the earliest group. They were scattered in the large cities throughout the province. These brothers and sisters were seeds sown by the Lord, and they raised up churches in locality after locality. At present there are fifty-nine localities, and not one was established through the Lord&rsquo;s workers. All these churches were raised up through working brothers and sisters who moved to various places for their jobs.</p>
<p>At the end of July 1949 we moved Hall 1 of the church in Taipei to its present location. The previous meeting hall only seated three hundred people. On August 1 we formally began the work with the first conference; that conference was the official beginning of the work in Taiwan. Three months from today it will have been seven years since we began the work. In these seven years, aside from those brothers in outlying areas who are building up the local service, we have carried out the following main items of work.</p>
