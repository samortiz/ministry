   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING VISITATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Witness Lee: Visitation is the most important work in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We ask all the responsible ones in the districts to make arrangements for the brothers and sisters to make visitations.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are two kinds of visitations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first is the visitation of new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As soon as a man believes in the Lord, the responsible brothers have to arrange for brothers and sisters to visit him, to strengthen his faith, and to make him feel that the church cares for him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The second is special visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This includes visiting saints who have lost their jobs, who are sick, or who have problems with their studies or their living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It also includes visitation under special occasions like death in the family, celebrations, or marriages.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we can cover these two kinds of visitations in a proper way, the church will be strong and will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Visitation requires all the brothers and sisters to work together in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In a district there may be twenty brothers and sisters on the list who are somewhat indifferent, cold, or passive toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The responsible ones have to find the zealous, compassionate, burning, and positive ones among the fifty saints meeting in that district and coordinate them together to make the visitations.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If possible, visitation should also cover all the other brothers and sisters in the form of regular fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more fellowship there is among the brothers and sisters, the better it is, and the more blessing we will see.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord promised His followers that they will receive a hundredfold of everything, including parents, children, brothers, and sisters Matt 19:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>CONCERNING THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The saints should not return home right after the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They should stay behind and fellowship with the other brothers and sisters, or spend twenty to thirty minutes visiting other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The time for the bread-breaking meeting should not be too long; it should be at most one hour.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As soon as we bring the saints' spirit to a high peak, we should briskly move on to the worship of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After the bread-breaking meeting, we can leave half an hour for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>CONCERNING EATING TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should encourage the brothers and sisters to come together to eat more often.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They should open their homes and invite three to five brothers and sisters over for meals and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But they should not prepare anything special.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If they prepare too much or too elaborately, the elders have to step in and intervene.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many brothers and sisters encounter problems and weaknesses in their daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sometimes a little spiritual fellowship will bring the saints through these trials.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is like the circulation of blood in the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Where the circulation goes, germs and waste materials are eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes it is not necessary to mention the problems at all; they go away spontaneously through such spiritual fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Dr. Stearns in Chefoo once said that it is an easy thing to invite people over for a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All one has to do is to add a pair of chopsticks.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no reason we cannot do it more often.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to encourage the brothers and sisters to open up their homes to others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If many people practice this, we will accomplish ninety percent of what we set out to accomplish with the visitation work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Single brothers and sisters can also use the married ones' homes to invite others for a meal and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In such fellowship, there is no need to touch problems or weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All we need to do is to exercise loving concern and provide spiritual nourishment one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Spontaneously, the guests will be stirred up, and something will happen within them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>LEARNING TO ASK OTHERS FOR THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DOING THINGS, AND TRUSTING IN</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE LEADING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT FOR THE DETAILS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The above few matters is a general fellowship of principles related to our service.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The brothers and sisters should not act presumptuously; they should ask the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After the elders have laid down the principles, they should act accordingly by the leading of the Holy Spirit when they set out to execute the fine details.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the brothers and sisters do not learn to ask, they will be in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But if everyone asks, there will be no confusion even if a thousand or two thousand people are serving together at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The brothers and sisters must keep learning.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In doing everything they must learn to ask the elderly brothers and sisters, but they should only consult them as far as the general principles are concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As for the small details, they have to learn to touch the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sometimes young people can ask too much.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They give the older ones a headache.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some people even ask if it will rain tomorrow, and if they should bring an umbrella with them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The young people have to learn to touch the feeling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They should also learn to adjust themselves according to outward needs while moving according to the principles set forth by the elders' fellowship.</S>
