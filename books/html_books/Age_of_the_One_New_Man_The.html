<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is a translation of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Chinese when he accompanied several overseas saints to visit Hualien, Taichung, and Kaohsiung, Taiwan. It also contains notes of fellowship given by Brother Lee in a co-workers&rsquo; meeting, a young working saints&rsquo; meeting, and a young people&rsquo;s meeting after he returned to Taipei. These messages were given on October 31 through November 12, 1977.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING UP TO DATE<br />
WITH THE AGE OF THE ONE NEW MAN</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE HISTORY OF THE DIVIDING<br />
AND SCATTERING OF FALLEN MANKIND</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals that God&rsquo;s intention in creating man was to gain a vessel to express Him and rule for Him (Gen. 1:26-27). Bible students agree that in Genesis 1 <em>man</em> refers to all mankind. God did not create an individual man; He created a corporate man in one man, Adam. Hence, according to God&rsquo;s intention, mankind should be considered as one man.</p>
<p>However, after the flood, fallen mankind was divided and scattered on the earth according to families and tongues in their lands and nations (10:5, 20, 31-32). After mankind rebelled against God at Babel, man&rsquo;s language was confounded, and man was scattered (11:9). The history of fallen man is a history of division and scattering. The nations on the earth became independent and were in conflict with one another.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ESTABLISHING OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE<br />
PAVING THE WAY<br />
FOR THE SPREAD OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Unifying the Jewish, Greek,<br />
and Roman Worlds</h2>
<p>Two thousand years ago the known world was limited to three continents&mdash;Europe, Asia, and Africa&mdash;centered around the Mediterranean Sea, and the nations around the Mediterranean Sea were divided. Around 27 B.C. Caesar Augustus unified the nations around the Mediterranean Sea and established the Roman Empire. The Hebrew religion, Greek philosophy and culture, and Roman politics and law were three dominant elements prior to the establishment of the Roman Empire. When the Roman Empire unified the territories around the Mediterranean Sea, the Hebrew religion, Greek philosophy and culture, and Roman politics and law were merged. When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, &ldquo;Pilate wrote a notice also and put it on the cross; and it was written, JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS&rdquo; (John 19:19). This notice was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek (v. 20). The fact that these three languages were used shows that the Roman Empire had unified the Jewish, Greek, and Roman worlds into one empire.</p>
<p>The Roman Empire was established before the Lord Jesus was born. It paved the way for the gospel to spread to all the peoples on the earth. After the Lord Jesus died on the cross to accomplish redemption according to God&rsquo;s plan, the gospel was ready to be spread. Because the Roman Empire had unified all the territories around the Mediterranean Sea and merged Roman politics, Greek culture, and the Hebrew religion, a broad way was paved for the gospel to spread around the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Making Greek the Common Language</h2>
<p>The Roman Empire made Greek the common language among the nations around the Mediterranean Sea. Having a unified language was a major contribution to the preaching of the gospel and the truth. How could the apostles preach the gospel if the Roman Empire had not been unified and if every nation around the Mediterranean Sea had its own language? Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty, before the Lord Jesus was born and long before the apostles were sent out, the Roman Empire made Greek the common language among the nations around the Mediterranean Sea. This paved a broad way for God&rsquo;s plan to be carried out, that is, for the propagation and spread of the gospel of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Merging the Nations<br />
around the Mediterranean Sea</h2>
<p>Furthermore, because the Roman Empire unified the territories around the Mediterranean Sea, Romans could go into Jewish regions, and Jews could go into Greek and Roman regions. There were Jews in nearly every city around the Mediterranean Sea. This can be seen in the account in Acts 2. During Pentecost devout Jews from every nation came to Jerusalem for the feast. Because they had been scattered for a long time, they had forgotten the Jewish language and could only speak their local tongues. While the Jews were at the feast in Jerusalem, the Holy Spirit was poured out on the disciples, and the church was produced (vv. 1-4, 37-41). According to verses 9 through 11, the Jews who were present came from at least fifteen nations represented by fifteen dialects. The establishing of the Roman Empire merged the nations around the Mediterranean Sea together.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Developing Transportation<br />
on Sea and on Land</h2>
<p>In the Roman Empire transportation on sea and on land was developed. There was convenient maritime transportation on the Mediterranean Sea, and roads that went all over Europe and Asia Minor were built so that there was no problem traveling from Spain to Jerusalem. The Roman Empire accomplished four things. It unified the Jewish, Greek, and Roman worlds; it unified the language; it merged the nations; and it built convenient sea and land transportation. As a result, the gospel could be spread to every place around the Mediterranean Sea. In other words, there were believers and followers of the Lord in all the nations, tribes, peoples, and races around the Mediterranean Sea.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DISCOVERY<br />
OF A NEW CONTINENT AND<br />
THE REFORMATION FREEING MAN&rsquo;S MIND</h2>
<p>According to church history, after the church was produced, it gradually became degraded. Eventually, the church entered into the so-called Dark Ages, which lasted ten centuries. During this period of time the Roman Catholic Church was prevalent, and the Bible was locked up. At the end of the fifteenth century Columbus discovered a new continent. At the beginning of the sixteenth century Martin Luther was raised up by the Lord to recover the truth concerning justification by faith. These two great historical events&mdash;the discovery of a new continent and the Reformation led by Martin Luther&mdash;freed the minds of people who were previously under the bondage of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>From that time, science became a powerhouse, and material culture became prevalent. The steamboat, automobile, and airplane were invented one after another. While science and industry were developing, capitalism and socialism emerged. Eventually, the overproduction of goods gave birth to imperialism. On the surface God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan, did many things during this period; however, we must realize that the Lord Jesus is above Satan. Satan is merely a &ldquo;colt&rdquo; used by the Lord Jesus to carry out God&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BRITAIN DEFEATING SPAIN</h2>
<p>After Columbus discovered the new continent, Spain became the leading power in the world, possessing the strongest navy. In order to bring the gospel to all the continents, especially to Africa and Asia, God raised up Britain to defeat Spain in a sea battle in 1588. From that time Britain became the leading power in the world. It was called &ldquo;the empire on which the sun never sets.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s purpose in raising up Britain was to limit the power of the Roman Catholic Church, supported by Spain, and to spread the gospel through Protestant missionaries. In the past two hundred years the missionaries who went to Africa and Asia to preach the gospel were mainly from the Protestant Church. We believe that it was God&rsquo;s doing to raise up Britain to maintain order on the earth for two hundred years and to take the gospel all over the world through many Protestant missionaries.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the gospel preached by most of the Protestant missionaries was merely about forgiveness of sins and going to heaven after death. Some missionaries preached a slightly higher gospel about loving the Lord, fearing God, and pleasing God, and they exhorted people to improve their human conduct. However, this is a very shallow gospel. After Martin Luther and in coordination with the political changes on the earth, God raised up Madame Guyon, Andrew Murray, and other inner-life people. These believers knew Christ as life and also had a deeper pursuit of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RISE OF THE UNITED STATES</h2>
<p>In considering the political and religious situations in the world, we must have a panoramic, broad, and high view in order to see God&rsquo;s wondrous doings. For two hundred years God used Britain to bring the gospel to all the nations in the world. After these two hundred years, however, God&rsquo;s work with Britain came to an end. After World War I God&rsquo;s move turned from Britain to the United States. World War I ended after the United States entered the war. World War II was also brought to an end by the United States. The United States played a critical role in both world wars.</p>
<p>After World War I President Wilson of the United States proposed the establishment of an international organization to oversee the relationships between different countries. Eventually, under the leadership of Britain and France, the League of Nations was established in Geneva, Switzerland, but the United States did not join. The League of Nations failed to fulfill its mission, especially in its inability to keep its promise related to China. On September 18, 1931, Japan invaded China and became the first country to violate the charter of the League of Nations. In 1935 Italy invaded Ethiopia, and in 1939 Germany invaded Poland. These three invasions buried the League of Nations and brought in World War II.</p>
<p>During World War II, God used the United States to bring the war to an end. After the war the United States became the leading country in the world. As a result, the United States formed the United Nations in New York City. After World War I the leading power shifted from Britain to the United States. Nearly every nation, such as China, Japan, France, and Britain, has been founded based on its race. The United States is an exception. It is a united country with different races merged together. The United States may be likened to a big melting pot, where white, black, Asian, and other races are melted together.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S WORK THROUGHOUT THE AGES<br />
PRODUCING THE ONE NEW MAN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Modern Technology Joining<br />
the Nations on the Earth Together</h2>
<p>We must see God&rsquo;s move in the universe from the perspective of world history. The United States was the first country that was not founded based on a single race; it is a united country with many different ethnicities. God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages is for the manifestation of the one new man. Therefore, we believe that all the political changes on the earth are under God&rsquo;s sovereignty for the fulfillment of His purpose.</p>
<p>After World War II the United States became the leading power in the world. The United States dominates the international realm in culture, politics, science, medicine, mathematics, and many other areas. Furthermore, the nations on the earth are no longer isolated. People travel everywhere in the world. Airports are filled with people. In the past there were few Chinese in the United States, but now there are at least two million Chinese; this is roughly one percent of the population of two hundred million in the United States. In other words, there is one Chinese for every one hundred people in the United States. This is not a small matter; it shows that the Americans and Chinese are blended.</p>
<p>One hundred years ago, it took six months for American missionaries to sail to China. Some missionaries suffered greatly from seasickness during that rough journey. Some died immediately after they reached China and were buried in China. When I was young, my family had contact with American missionaries, so I understand the hardships they experienced. At that time, traveling was not convenient. It took a year for a round trip between the United States and China. Transportation has advanced today. Within forty-eight hours, people can fly from China to the United States on a 747 airplane for business and return home safely. Furthermore, communication is very convenient. People can contact one another by telegram and telephone. There are also different kinds of audio and video equipment. All these things enhance communication among people and blend together people from all over the world. Although there are still distinctions in nationalities, no one can deny that this is an age of blending all the nations in the world.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The International Political Situation<br />
Being for the Producing of the One New Man</h2>
<p>On August 15, 1945, Japan surrendered. On September 2 Japan signed an official surrender, and World War II ended. In early September the Truman administration of the United States informed the Chinese government that the United States, Britain, and Russia had made an agreement at Yalta the previous February. This agreement allowed Stalin to gain territory in the northeast of China that had been taken by Japan. This agreement contradicted the interests of China. At that time I was recuperating from an illness in Tsingtao. When I heard this news, I was upset and grieved because I was clear that in order for the Lord&rsquo;s gospel to have a free way on the earth, there must be the covering of a proper government. Any political change in China would deal a heavy blow to the propagation of the churches. I was concerned about this.</p>
<p>In 1949 I was sent by Brother Watchman Nee to Taiwan because of the urgency of the political situation in China. At that time Taiwan was underdeveloped; it had pebble roads, and people wore clogs. When we were in China, Brother Nee took the lead in the work. By 1949 there were hundreds of local churches in thirty-three provinces and major cities. The Lord&rsquo;s work in China was prevailing, but due to the political change, I came to Taiwan. Every day I would lie depressed on my bed, staring at the ceiling and asking the Lord, &ldquo;Why am I here?&rdquo; I was frustrated. One day the Lord gave me the feeling to travel by train from station to station in order to visit the saints who had come from China. After this trip I became clear within that there was work to be done in Taiwan. Then I received the burden from the Lord to start the work on August 1, 1949.</p>
<p>Before the Lord returns, there will always be conflicts between nations. However, no country or nation can close its door and isolate itself; it must communicate with other nations. The different forms of communication benefit the preaching of the gospel and the producing of the one new man. The Lord planted a gospel nursery in mainland China. After 1949 the Lord moved this nursery to Taiwan, and from Taiwan He moved it to all the continents. In the first issue of <em>The Ministry of the Word,</em> published in 1951, there is a portion entitled &ldquo;Concerning Our Coming to Taiwan,&rdquo; which states that it was the Lord&rsquo;s good pleasure to bring us to Taiwan. Taiwan is connected to Southeast Asia and to Northeast Asia. If we take Taiwan as the center, one day the Lord will spread His testimony to Southeast Asia and to Northeast Asia. In 1951 we did not think of the West. Today we thank and praise the Lord that not only are Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia connected to Taiwan, but even the West is connected to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to communicate with saints from different continents, because we are members of the same Body and share the same life. We are the one new man. On the one hand, we should be good, lawful, and loyal citizens in our respective countries. On the other hand, we are of one Body, we share the same life in the spirit, and we are the one new man.</p>
<p>I have been to many places. Hence, I can testify that I do not feel strange in Australia, New Zealand, South America, Japan, or Korea, because wherever I go, I am with my family&mdash;those who are of the same Body and share the same life with me. Our view should not be narrow or small. We should not think that it is sufficient to be saved, love the Lord, visit the saints, serve the Lord, and make the church prosper and flourish. Our view must be uplifted and enlarged to a universal view. Then we will know what the Lord is doing on the earth today. Whether in world politics or in international affairs, the Lord is working. If the Lord has uplifted and enlarged our view, we will see that all things are for the producing of the one new man.</p>
<p>The present means of communication between countries make it possible for all races to communicate with and know one another. The Lord&rsquo;s leading in the truth in His recovery has reached the stage where we see that the Lord is after the one new man on the earth. We can no longer be believers with a narrow view. Instead, we must see that we are part of the universal one new man.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING ENCOURAGED<br />
TO BE UP TO DATE WITH THE AGE</h2>
<p>My first visit to Hualien was around the summertime in 1951 or 1952. I traveled from Kaohsiung to Taitung and then to Hualien. I did not take the perilous Suhua Highway, because I must take care of my life for the sake of the Lord&rsquo;s commission. My initial desire was to have contact with a few brothers. However, the brothers gathered a good number of saints, who requested to hear a message. After this visit a church was established in Hualien. I later visited Hualien one or two more times. Once in the month of April in 1957, I brought a group of overseas saints from England, the United States, and Denmark, as well as some saints from Taipei. We went from Kaohsiung to Hualien not by train or car; we took the risk of flying in an airplane. We thank the Lord for His preservation. After the conference in Hualien, I brought all the visiting saints who were with me back to Taipei.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Up to Date, Not Stagnant</h2>
<p>It has been twenty years since my last visit. When I got off the airplane this time, I was surprised at the new Hualien airport; it is decorated with marble inside and outside. Not only so, the roads and infrastructure in Hualien have improved. However, the church in Hualien is not up to date. Ten years ago there were more than one hundred people meeting here, but after ten years the number does not exceed two hundred. At the beginning of this chapter, we saw that God uses the political situation to pave the way for the spread of the gospel. All things work together for the church. Hence, the church should not be stagnant; rather, it should utilize the situation and be up to date.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seizing the Opportunity to Buy Land</h2>
<p>I encourage the saints in Hualien to do two things for the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony in this place. First, you need to buy one thousand ping [Editor&rsquo;s note: a ping is approximately 35.57 square feet] of land. You must not be satisfied with two hundred ping of land. In the future you will regret that you did not buy enough land. If the land is bought this year, in three years it will double in price. The sooner we buy the land, the more we will save. For the Lord&rsquo;s testimony in Hualien, the brothers must be up to date. In the future Hualien will become a major city on the east coast of Taiwan. When there is an opportunity, we should buy a large piece of land in preparation for the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Aggressively Gaining People</h2>
<p>Second, we need to aggressively gain people. I hope that by the end of the year there would be one hundred young people meeting in the church in Hualien. The number of young people in the church in Hualien is much smaller than the number of young people in the church in Taipei. Hence, the young people must pray desperately to the Lord. They should say, &ldquo;Lord, in the last two months of this year, I must bring two people to the church.&rdquo; Those who are under twenty-six years of age must answer the Lord&rsquo;s call to bring in two people this year. We should not be concerned about bringing in false believers. Some people are initially false believers before they become genuine believers. I grew up in a Christian family. Before the age of nineteen, I was a false believer. Then I became a genuine believer. Therefore, we do not need to worry. By January 1 of next year each young person should bring in two people. We need to learn to give an account to the Lord. Currently, there are about thirty young people in the meetings. If everyone brings two people into the church life, by next January there will be one hundred young people in the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Young People Being Raised Up by the Lord<br />
to Bear the Responsibility of the Church</h2>
<p>The rest of the saints should be encouraged to run once the young people begin to run. More middle-aged saints and young saints must be raised up to bear the responsibility of the church. I would ask the older saints to forgive me for saying a direct word. Because we are older in age, we should recognize the current situation and step aside. Every father is the same. Even when his son is almost fifty years old, and he has become a grandfather, he still sees his son as a child who does not know how to do things; hence, he continues to do things himself. The older saints should step aside so that the younger ones can take over. The younger ones may not know how to do things or may not do them as well as the older brothers. However, the more they do, the better they will become.</p>
<p>I hope that in the near future the Lord will raise up young adults between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-five to be elders in the church in Hualien. When those in this age group become elders, I believe that the number in the meetings will reach five hundred. Then we will need a meeting hall. We need to be wise and aware of the current situation, that is, aware of this age. We know that this is the age of the one new man. As the one new man, we must be up to date with the age of the one new man. I hope that from today the church will be completely new. This newness begins with the younger generation. In order for a family to be new, it must begin with the younger generation. Hence, every young person must take courage, pray, drink the living water, and have a fresh beginning. Then the Lord will have a way to gain a strong and bright testimony in Hualien.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">SEEING THE ONE NEW MAN</h1>
<p>There is only one Bible, but as a result of differences among Christians in their understanding of the Bible, there are different kinds of Christians. As an example of the different kinds of Christians, I will explain how the Lord led me level by level in my experience until I saw that the church is the one new man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEVEL ONE&mdash;<br />
BEING UNSAVED IN CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>I am Chinese, and I grew up in a Christian family. My mother&rsquo;s maternal grandfather was a zealous member of the Southern Baptist Church, and my mother studied in a school established by the Southern Baptist Church. This was during the Ching Dynasty when there were only old-style private schools. The modern educational system of elementary school, middle school, and college did not exist. The schools established by the missions taught the Bible in addition to the regular courses taught in the old-style private schools. As a result, my mother also joined Christianity, but she was not saved. She was influenced by Christianity, and she was a devout follower of Christianity. In those days the Western missionaries who went to China to preach the gospel were called &ldquo;foreign devils&rdquo; or &ldquo;primary devils,&rdquo; and the Chinese people who accepted Christianity were called &ldquo;secondary devils.&rdquo; Therefore, during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, the Boxers killed not only the foreign, or primary, devils but also the secondary devils. When the Boxers reached my hometown in Shangtung Province, my mother hid all the books concerning the Bible that were in our family&rsquo;s home, and they had to escape and hide in the hills.</p>
<p>Under my mother&rsquo;s influence, the children in my family met in the Southern Baptist Church from our youth. I studied at an elementary school operated by the Southern Baptist Church; I also went to church services and attended Sunday school. Therefore, I became familiar with the routine practices of Christianity. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning our mother would make sure that we put on clean or new clothes to attend the church service. After the service she would cook a delicious meal of noodles. The Lord&rsquo;s Day was a day for going to the church service and eating delicious food, not for doing any work. We were a Christian family.</p>
<p>I was in Christianity for nineteen years. As a result of my mother&rsquo;s influence, I did not contact other religions, nor did I worship idols. Everyone in my family was a church member in Christianity, but none of us were genuinely saved. Nonetheless, when someone criticized or opposed Christianity, we would rise up to defend it. I once went on an excursion with my teacher and some classmates. When we arrived at a temple, I stood in front of my teacher, classmates, and a Buddhist monk, pointed at the idols, and said, &ldquo;These are all false gods. They are like the mud under my feet because they are merely gilded with gold and are placed here on display. The true God is invisible and intangible. He is omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent. Only He, the Lord who created the heavens and the earth, is real.&rdquo; At the time I was not even saved; I was merely a nominal Christian and had never prayed or confessed my sins. Nevertheless, I loved Christianity and was able to speak convincingly concerning the true God versus idols.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEVEL TWO&mdash;BEING GENUINELY SAVED<br />
AND LOVING BIBLE KNOWLEDGE</h2>
<p>One day my second sister turned to the Lord and experienced salvation. She went to Nanking to study in the best women&rsquo;s seminary in China; she was determined to serve the Lord her whole life. Afterward, she began to pray for my mother and me to be saved. As a result of her prayer, God&rsquo;s salvation came to me. One Lord&rsquo;s Day morning it was announced that a young lady evangelist would be coming from Shanghai to preach the gospel. In the past I had heard older pastors or older women preach the word, but I had never seen a young lady evangelist. Therefore, I decided to attend. There were over a thousand people in the audience that day. The message spoken by the young lady evangelist was powerful; I had never heard a message as powerful as hers. I was somewhat familiar with the stories of the Bible, but I had never heard such a message. She did not speak about sin. Rather, she spoke about Satan being the Pharaoh of the present age who keeps people under his authority and about God sending Christ to release all who are kept under Satan&rsquo;s oppression, just as Moses released the children of Israel from Pharaoh&rsquo;s oppression. I was captured by her words and decided that I would no longer be under Satan&rsquo;s hand or be usurped by the world. On my way home I looked up toward heaven and said, &ldquo;O God! Save me. I do not want to be held by Satan. I want to belong to You for my whole life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I was young, I was occupied with amusements and sports. When I was older, I realized that my future would depend on my education. Therefore, I made up my mind to no longer be absorbed by amusements and sports but to pursue my education and to also diligently study the Chinese and English languages. It was at this time that I heard the gospel: &ldquo;Do not be held by Satan in the world.&rdquo; As a result, there was a definite change in my human life.</p>
<p>After I was saved, my greatest delight was to pray and to read the Bible. During one summer vacation, I spent two months to speed-read through the Bible in order to know its contents. I was determined to understand every chapter, verse, sentence, and word in the Bible. However, I realized that I did not understand the Bible. When I asked the pastor for instruction, his answers did not satisfy me. So I saved every penny in order to buy spiritual publications. I came across the Christian periodical <em>The Morning Star</em> and enjoyed reading the articles under the byline of Watchman Nee. Later, in an issue of <em>The Morning Star</em> it was announced that Watchman Nee would publish his own paper, <em>The Christian.</em> I immediately subscribed to this magazine.</p>
<p>From 1925 through 1927 Brother Nee published twenty-four issues of <em>The Christian.</em> It was read all over China by young Christians who loved and pursued the Lord. The circulation of this periodical grew to ten thousand copies every month. The primary content of <em>The Christian</em> was a meditation on the first three chapters of Revelation. Brother Nee spoke of the seven churches in Asia in chapters 2 and 3, exposing the condition of Christianity at that time. As a result of his writings, I believed that he must be very experienced. Hence, I wrote and asked him to recommend a book that would help me understand the Bible. This was the first time I corresponded with Brother Nee. He answered that, according to his knowledge, the book that would be of most help in understanding the Bible was <em>The Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</em> written by John Nelson Darby, a great teacher of the British Brethren. Brother Nee also said that this set of books was very difficult to read and that I needed to read it four or five times in order to understand it.</p>
<p>When I heard that there was a Brethren assembly in my city and that the people there were very good at expounding the Bible, I joined them. I was attracted to them. The Brethren were well known for their knowledge of the Bible. They specialized in expounding the Bible. They studied the types and prophecies in the Old Testament. In particular, they studied the great human image in Daniel 2, the four beasts in chapter 7, and the seventy weeks in chapter 9. They also studied the prophecies in the New Testament concerning Christ&rsquo;s second coming and the rapture. I treasured this Bible knowledge. I was in the golden period of my youth, and I had an alert mind. I listened to at least five messages every week, wrote notes, and kept a record of everything I heard. I listened to their Bible exposition for seven and a half years and was very satisfied.</p>
<p>At that time I always criticized other denominations for not knowing the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament or the intricate matters in Genesis and Exodus. Because I was taught in a Brethren assembly, I knew the difference between Genesis and Exodus. I also understood the significances of the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering and the significances of the feasts of the children of Israel. I committed most of the types and prophecies in the Bible to memory.</p>
<p>One day in August 1931, while walking down the street, I was deeply convicted by the Lord. He said, &ldquo;Although you have gained a great deal of Bible knowledge, you have not borne any fruit; you have not brought one person to Me. You are dead.&rdquo; I felt condemned. Other than going to work, I read the Bible, went to meetings, listened to messages, and wrote notes. I had a good income, and I did not love the world or the enjoyment in the world. Nonetheless, the Lord condemned me for being dead. Early in the morning of the next day I climbed to the top of a small mountain near my home. There I wept loudly, &ldquo;O Lord, have mercy on me! I am dead and dry.&rdquo; From August of 1931 through March of the following year, for more than half a year, I went up to the mountain and cried out loudly, prayed, sang, and shed tears before the Lord every day. As a result, I often came down from the mountain inwardly filled with the Holy Spirit. My whole being was enlivened. This was the sweetest period in my fellowship with the Lord. The things on earth had no place in my heart; I was completely gained by the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">LEVEL THREE&mdash;HAVING KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING<br />
LIFE, CHRIST, THE CHURCH, AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In the summer of 1932 the denomination that I had left accepted my proposal to invite Brother Nee to come and preach in my hometown. Prior to that time, my contact with Brother Nee was only through correspondence. Now I would contact him face to face. Meanwhile, the Lord started working in my environment. Within a few days after Brother Nee&rsquo;s departure, a brother and I began to meet together. Thus, a church was raised up in my hometown, Chefoo. I did not struggle or endeavor to raise up the church; it was the Lord who added people to us. We began meeting on a Tuesday evening, but by the Lord&rsquo;s Day of the following week, eleven brothers, who had come out of eight different denominations, were breaking bread with us. Because my home was very small, only brothers came to the meeting; the sisters did not attend due to the inconvenience. We later found a bigger house and received the sisters. The next year our number increased to around eighty. We soon exceeded a hundred.</p>
<p>As a result of my fellowship with Brother Nee, I experienced a great turning point in my spiritual life. I turned from Bible knowledge to life, Christ, the church, and the Spirit. In August of 1933 the Lord urged me to give up my occupation and serve Him full time, but I lacked faith. The Lord, however, kept urging me to serve Him. Eventually, I had no choice but to drop my occupation. Afterward, I went to Shanghai to see Brother Nee, and he asked me to stay with him for a period of time, during which I received much help from him. He led me into life, into the subjective knowledge of Christ, into the church, and into the Spirit.</p>
<p>During the few months of my stay in Shanghai, Brother Nee gave messages in the big meetings. In addition, he would sometimes fellowship with the few of us who were there to receive his help. On one occasion he spoke concerning the first man, the first Adam, and the second man, the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45, 47). He also spoke concerning the grain of wheat becoming many grains (John 12:24) and concerning God&rsquo;s only begotten Son becoming God&rsquo;s Firstborn and concerning our becoming His many brothers (Rom. 8:29). It was a long fellowship. I later went back to my room and wrote down everything I had heard. It was a definite turning point in my knowledge concerning life, Christ, the church, and the Spirit. From that day onward, I saw how God in Christ came to be life to man, how God made us His many sons through His Son, how God caused His only begotten Son to become the Firstborn and caused us to become His many brothers, and how Christ as the grain of wheat became many grains for the producing of the Body of Christ, which is the church. In that transparent fellowship I received genuine help from Brother Nee to see a clear vision.</p>
<p>Through this turning point I understood that if we want to let God in Christ work Himself into us, we must see that Christ is the embodiment of God, &ldquo;for in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily&rdquo; (Col. 2:9). The Lord showed me the vision that we must eat Him and drink Him. This is not doctrine or knowledge. I had never heard this from others, nor had I read this in a book. I saw that the fruit of the tree of life was to be eaten (Gen. 2:9) and that the passover lamb and the unleavened bread were also to be eaten (Exo. 12&mdash;13:6). Furthermore, the Lord Jesus said that He is the bread of life and that he who eats Him shall live because of Him (John 6:48, 57). I saw clearly from the Bible that in order to let God in Christ work Himself into us, we must eat the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEVEL FOUR&mdash;<br />
KNOWING THAT THE SPIRIT PRODUCES<br />
THE BELIEVERS, THE CHURCH, THE BODY,<br />
AND THE ONE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>The Lord also showed me that He is the Triune God. He is God, yet He became flesh (John 1:14) and passed through death and resurrection. In resurrection He brought the humanity, which He put on, into resurrection and uplifted it. In resurrection He also became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). This light has become clearer in me. I did not receive this light through the teaching or writings of others; it was given to me. This vision is that the Triune God became the life-giving Spirit; the Triune God put on humanity, passed through human living, entered into death on the cross, and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit. This all-inclusive Spirit, possessing divinity and humanity, produces the believers, the church, and the Body of Christ (12:13). Gradually, I also saw that it is this Spirit who produces the one new man (Eph. 2:15-18).</p>
<p>From my personal experience I saw what it is to be unsaved in Christianity. There are many such people today. We should not think that these people do not love Christianity. They love Christianity, but they are merely in religion. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy I advanced; I was saved and loved to read the Bible. I loved the Bible so much that I wore out several copies of the Bible. However, when I met Brother Nee, I advanced further to a higher level of life, Christ, the church, and the Spirit. Because I turned to these four matters, I advanced yet further and saw that the Triune God became flesh, passed through human living, died, resurrected, and became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This Spirit produces genuine believers, the church, the Body of Christ, and the one new man. This is the highest level. The believers, the church, the Body of Christ, and the one new man are in the Spirit. In the Spirit the believers collectively become the church. The church living in this Spirit is the Body of Christ, and the Body living by Christ as its person is the one new man.</p>
<p>I have given you my testimony so that you may consider which level you are in. May we all reach the highest level to see the vision of the one new man so that the Lord can accomplish His work on earth through us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">ARRIVING AT<br />
THE JOY OF THE ONE NEW MAN</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider how a person is saved, enters into the church life, experiences the Body of Christ, and arrives at the manifestation of the one new man. This is how a person gradually experiences the proper sequence of four levels of joy: the joy of salvation, the joy of the church, the joy of the Body, and ultimately, the joy of the one new man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEVEL ONE&mdash;<br />
THE JOY OF SALVATION</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s thirst indicates that he needs a source to quench his thirst. Man&rsquo;s seeking for satisfaction is proof that there is something in the universe that can quench his thirst and give him satisfaction. Man needs to know God because only God can be man&rsquo;s satisfaction. The Lord, the Creator of all things, is the unique One; there is no other God in the universe. When men do not know the true God, they replace Him with other things and establish religions. Generally speaking, there are five major religions: Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Judeo-Christian, and Islam. Confucianism teaches acceptable conduct and relationships among people; it is not about God. Buddhism is also not about God; it stresses transmigration, or reincarnation. Taoism teaches that human life is like wind and vapor; it also is not about God. Although Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism are called religions, they do not talk about God and have nothing to do with God.</p>
<p>The Judeo-Christian religion and Islam come from the same source. The Judeo-Christian religion includes Catholicism, Protestantism, and Judaism. The Scriptures, the Old Testament and the New Testament, which speak concerning God, are the basis of these three. Judaism stresses the Old Testament, whereas Catholicism and Protestantism emphasize both the Old and the New Testaments. Muhammad, the founder of Islam, referred to stories from the Old Testament and the New Testament. Judaism, Catholicism, Protestantism, and Islam all speak concerning God&mdash;the sovereign Lord who created all things in the universe.</p>
<p>One day the sovereign Lord of the universe entered into the world by becoming the man Jesus. Apparently, Jesus was merely a man, but in reality He was the omnipresent God. When a person feels that he is a sinner and that he cannot be satisfied in his human life, he can open his whole being from deep within to the Lord and call on His name, saying, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, I am a sinner; I need You to save me; I receive You as my Savior.&rdquo; Then something wonderful will take place deep within him. Jesus, the omnipresent God, will enter into him as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). The emptiness in the depths of his being will immediately be satisfied, and he will rejoice. From the day a person believes in the Lord, he has the joy of salvation. This is the first level of joy.</p>
<p>In 1938 I preached the gospel at my alma mater in my hometown. A professor who was also a judge came to listen to the gospel and was touched. He asked me to tell him how to believe in Jesus. I said, &ldquo;This is simple. When you get home, shut yourself in your room, kneel down before your bed, open yourself to God, and confess that you are a sinner. You should say, &lsquo;O Lord Jesus, I am a sinner. I know that You are the true God who came to be my Savior and that You died for me. O Lord Jesus, I believe in You; please save me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This judge was saved, and he testified that he prayed and confessed his sins to the Lord. After he prayed, it seemed as if nothing had happened. The next morning he went to the courthouse as usual. While he was walking to work, he was suddenly filled with joy inwardly. He looked up into heaven and felt that the sky was bluer. Previously, he hated dogs, but that day a dog that he saw looked lovely to him. He was smiling when he walked into the courtroom. His colleagues asked him if he was happy because he had made a fortune. He laughed and said, &ldquo;I do not know why, but my heart is rejoicing.&rdquo; He was still rejoicing when he returned home from work. He was full of joy for several days before he finally realized that he was saved. He prayed to Jesus one night and experienced unprecedented joy the next day. This is a testimony of the experience of the joy of salvation.</p>
<p>In 1940 I was preaching the gospel in Chefoo, and a good number of sisters there had husbands who worked in customs. One day after preaching the gospel, a customs officer asked me how to believe in Jesus. I told him to go home and pray. He was a chain smoker. From the time he stepped into his office until he got off work, he smoked cigarettes. Regardless of how much others advised him to stop, he continued to smoke. However, after praying that night, he did not smoke the next day. At first his colleagues thought that he was playing tricks, but they later observed that he had given up cigarettes. When he discovered that he had changed, he realized that he was saved and had the Lord&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>I believe many people can testify that Jesus is the true God, our Savior, our righteousness, and our real satisfaction. Only Jesus can fill the emptiness deep within man. Every believer has experienced the first level of joy&mdash;the joy of salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">LEVEL TWO&mdash;<br />
THE JOY OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>When we are satisfied deep within, we experience the joy of salvation. After experiencing the joy of salvation, we will sense that we have another need, and we will desire to fellowship with the branches of Christ the vine (John 15:1, 5). If we touch Jesus and meet with Him in the morning, we will go to the meeting in the evening. This is to be in the church. Those who have the joy of salvation still need to experience a deeper and higher joy, which is the joy of the church. If we do not go to the meetings to fellowship with other branches, the joy that we obtained at the time of our salvation becomes weaker, fades, and vanishes. However, as soon as we come to a meeting of the church and fellowship with other Christians, our initial joy not only returns but also becomes higher and more satisfying than it was at the time of our salvation. This is to go further to experience the second level of joy&mdash;the joy of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEVEL THREE&mdash;<br />
THE JOY OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>If we only attend meetings and fellowship with the saints, we will soon realize that there is a deeper demand within us to know the church in a deeper way, that is, to progress from the church to the Body of Christ. The church is not only an assembly of the called ones; it is also the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). If the church were merely an assembly, an organization, then we would merely be members in an outward way. Then if someone is agreeable to us, we will like him, but if he is disagreeable to us, we will dislike him. At first we will cooperate with those who are agreeable to us, but if they later become disagreeable, we will become cold toward them. Then we will find someone else who suits our taste. If this is our situation, we cannot obtain the deeper, richer joy that touches more of the Lord&rsquo;s presence. The church is not only an assembly of called ones; it is, even more, the Body of Christ. In the Body of Christ we are not merely members of an organization but members of the Body; our relationship with one another is inseparable.</p>
<p>Sometimes I do not like my feet. I need my two feet when I walk, but for some reason I do not like them when I am sitting. I am not happy with some members of my body. Nevertheless, I cannot say to my feet, &ldquo;You do not suit my taste, and you do not get along with me. Therefore, you are you, and I am I.&rdquo; The relationship between me and my feet cannot be severed, because my feet are members of my body. They cannot be separated from my body simply because I dislike them.</p>
<p>If we see the church merely as an assembly of called ones but do not recognize that the church is also the Body of Christ, then our joy in the church will not be deep or long lasting; rather, our joy in the church will fade away. I can testify that when I see that the church is not merely an assembly but also the Body, of which I am a member, then I accept the other members of the Body whether I like them or not. If we see the Body, we can neither be independent nor can we separate ourselves from those whom we dislike. This is the way for our joy to advance to the third level&mdash;the joy of the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEVEL FOUR&mdash;<br />
THE JOY OF THE ONE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>After we have seen that we are members of the Body, we will again eventually feel that something is missing. Although we have the joy of salvation and have advanced to the joy of the church, we will not be satisfied with having just the joy of the church. After we see the Body of Christ, the joy of the church will be uplifted to the joy of the Body. I believe that many brothers and sisters are saved, are in the church, and have seen and experienced the Body. However, having been in the Body for a period of time, they have a sense deep within that they still need to go forward. We are members of the Body and have Christ as our life. If we go further and take Christ as our person, the Body will become the one new man (2:15; 4:24). In the one new man all the differences and distinctions among the members disappear, and Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:10-11). The Lord wants to show us that the church is not merely an assembly of the called ones or the Body; the church is the one new man. When we see the one new man and become the one new man, our joy will advance and be uplifted from the joy of the Body to the fourth level&mdash;the joy of the one new man.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR MAJOR HISTORICAL EVENTS<br />
FOR THE MANIFESTATION OF THE ONE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>Human history is under God&rsquo;s sovereign authority. On the surface, every country is autonomous and independent, but in reality, the Bible reveals that the rise and fall of a country depends on God; it is under the sovereignty of the God of the heavens (Dan. 2:21; 4:26). Historians write history from their perspective, but we consider history from our perspective, which is the divine revelation. More than two thousand years ago, according to human history, there was not much communication between countries. Nations had different languages, and there was no advanced means of transportation. If what we now see concerning the one new man had been revealed during that time, there would have been no way for the manifestation of the one new man to be realized. However, under God&rsquo;s sovereignty, there have been four major events over the past two thousand years of human history, from the birth of Christ until today. These major events were for the producing of the one new man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The First Major Event&mdash;<br />
the Establishment of the Roman Empire</h2>
<p>In 27 B.C. Caesar Augustus officially established the Roman Empire and ruled over the entire area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. The Roman Empire made Greek the common language around the Mediterranean Sea. Hence, when the Lord Jesus accomplished God&rsquo;s salvation through His death and resurrection and the Holy Spirit sent out the apostles to preach the gospel, the language and the politics of the Roman Empire were unified, sea transportation was developed, and highways had been built throughout the land. In the apostle Paul&rsquo;s time, Greek was used in every country and city. Because the Roman Empire unified the territories around the Mediterranean Sea, Roman citizens had free access to every area. They did not need to have an identification document or passport. All these things were beneficial to the spread of the gospel. Within less than one century, the gospel spread throughout the area around the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Second Major Event&mdash;<br />
the Reformation<br />
and the Discovery of the New Continent</h2>
<p>The second major event was the Reformation and the discovery of the new continent. According to church history, the Reformation led by Martin Luther was an exceedingly great matter. Martin Luther&rsquo;s Reformation and Columbus&rsquo;s discovery of the new continent freed the minds of people who had been under the bondage of degraded Catholicism during the Dark Ages. This brought in a great leap forward in human thought and subsequently gave birth to the growth of science and the development of industry. Capitalism, socialism, and imperialism emerged one after another because of the problems caused by mass production.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Third Major Event&mdash;<br />
Britain Defeating Spain</h2>
<p>After Columbus discovered the new continent, Spain became the leading power in the world. Spain was under the influence of the Catholic Church. If God had allowed Spain to remain the leading power, the entire world might have fallen under the degraded and dark power of Catholicism. However, God raised up Britain to defeat Spain, and the entire world fell under the dominion of Britain. Consequently, Britain was able to send Protestant missionaries to preach the gospel everywhere, particularly in Africa and Asia.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fourth Major Event&mdash;<br />
the Rise of the United States</h2>
<p>God used the British Empire to maintain the world situation so that the gospel of God could be preached everywhere in the world. However, the British Empire was not faithful to God. The British Empire was significantly weakened by the two world wars, both of which were brought to an end by the United States. After World War II God raised up the United States to be the leading power in the world. Due to the inventions and advancements in transportation and technology, mankind has nearly reached the highest level. This has led to much communication between nations, involving exchanges related to culture, the military, and politics.</p>
<p>One hundred years ago it took six months for an American missionary to reach China by boat and another six months for him to return. It took exactly one year for a round trip. Today it takes about twelve hours to travel from Taiwan to the United States by airplane. The distance between places on the earth has decreased because of the modern technology of advanced transportation. Formerly, the Chinese called the Westerners &ldquo;foreign devils,&rdquo; and the Chinese were not welcomed in the United States. Hence, it was virtually impossible for the Chinese to visit the Americans. However, this situation is totally changed. There can be communication between the English, the Americans, the Germans, the French, and the Chinese. We need to see that the progress in human history is for the manifestation of the one new man.</p>
<p>We can genuinely say that in Christ, in the church, in the Body, and in the one new man, there is no East and no West. Formerly, the East was the East, and the West was the West; the two sides could not become one. But today we can say that not only have the East and the West become one, but the East, the West, the North, and the South have also become one. Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty the world situation has connected mankind through science, commerce, and culture. Hence, Christians from every continent can gather in Taiwan and declare in different languages, &ldquo;Hallelujah, praise the Lord!&rdquo; All the progress in technology and transportation is for the producing of the one new man.</p>
<p>Two thousand years ago, no one would have dreamed of the manifestation of the one new man. But today we are not only dreaming of the one new man; we are seeing the one new man. This is the age of the one new man. We see the revelation of the one new man in the Bible, and we also have the practice of the one new man on the earth. We have the joy of salvation on the first level, the joy of the church on the second level, the joy of the Body on the third level, and the joy of the one new man on the fourth level. Hallelujah!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING UP TO DATE WITH THE AGE<br />
TO PERFECT THE SAINTS</h1>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been advancing in the divine revelation. We also need to advance in practice so that we match the revelation that the Lord has shown us. In particular, the co-workers should seek the Lord regarding how to be up to date with the age and how to have an effective work for the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HOLDING ON TO THE OLD FOUNDATION<br />
AND RESOLUTELY SEEKING CHANGE</h2>
<p>God created the earth; hence, it cannot be changed by man. However, methods of transportation can change and have been advancing. In order to travel on the earth, mankind first invented wheels and then all kinds of vehicles, including the horse-drawn wagon, the bicycle, and the automobile. Today there are not only cars but also airplanes, and the manufacturing of airplanes is also improving. Likewise, the Bible has not changed in the past two thousand years, but our knowledge of the Bible is continually progressing. We cannot change the Bible, nor can we change the Lord&rsquo;s way, but our knowledge of the Bible and how we carry out the Lord&rsquo;s work should progress. If we still work in the way that we were trained twenty years ago, we will become outdated. If a military school teaches the same thing for twenty years, it will become outdated because strategies, tactics, and weapons change. Old knowledge can only serve as a foundation upon which we need to continue to study and advance.</p>
<p>Old knowledge can be useful and also harmful. Consider a young man who goes to a military school for training but who has never received a military education. His weakness is that he does not have a foundation in military knowledge, but his strength is that he can learn quickly because he is not limited by background knowledge. In contrast, a soldier who has received military education has a foundation of military knowledge. This is a strength, but if he insists on the old ways, his strength will become a weakness. However, if he does not insist on the old ways but uses this foundation as a means to learn new material, he can advance quickly.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, over the past years we have had some changes in our work for the Lord, but we are not resolute. We should be so resolute that we would willingly not hold on to the old foundation. It is difficult to completely let go of a foundation, but if we continue to rely on the old ways, they will become a hindrance to our moving forward.</p>
<p>The co-workers have not made a thorough turn. They still hold old concepts. When the age turns, whoever turns quickly will have the upper hand, and whoever turns slowly will fall behind. Because my mother received a modern education and had some knowledge of the modern age, she insisted that I learn English. My hometown was not a modern city. At that time whoever learned English was mocked as having a foreign accent. Later, however, it was acknowledged that those who speak better English have the upper hand. Those who can turn quickly and thoroughly with the age will have the upper hand.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECOGNIZING THE SITUATION,<br />
KNOWING THE TIMES, AND TURNING WITH THE AGE</h2>
<p>The present situation indicates that the Lord has turned the age. Some of the younger generation have surpassed us in their abilities. When I listen to them speak for the Lord in the meetings, I feel that the older generation lacks their portion. According to Matthew 25, the producing of the gifts is related to ability. Verse 15 says, &ldquo;To one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability.&rdquo; <em>Talents</em> refers to spiritual gifts, and <em>ability</em> refers to natural capabilities. The gifts given to us by the Lord differ according to our natural capabilities. For example, if I am dumb, the Lord will not give me the gift of speaking, because I do not possess that ability. The Chinese have a saying: &ldquo;There are only champion students but not champion teachers.&rdquo; This means that a teacher who is not a champion should not think that his students cannot become champions. Champion students are often taught by teachers who are not champions. However, teachers with champion students should not become proud. Teachers have knowledge and common sense, but their students have talent. Teachers pass their knowledge and common sense to the students, and when the students begin to apply what they learn, their talent is manifested.</p>
<p>The age is turning, the Lord is moving, the church is turning, and the young adults are rising up. What should the co-workers do? The co-workers must recognize and know the times, the trend of the age. In other words, the co-workers must know themselves and their situation. More than twenty years ago the churches in Taiwan were in a beginning stage. The churches needed trained co-workers to help them, and the co-workers were able to help the churches. This was the case in Taiwan and in other places in Southeast Asia. However, the age has turned. The co-workers need to reconsider their situation and their function. I am afraid that some co-workers still have the concept that the churches should listen to them and accept their leading because they have been serving full time for many years. Such a concept might not have been a problem twenty years ago, but it will bring in conflicts today.</p>
<p>Those who are rising up today are better than we are in many ways. If the co-workers are not up to date, they will eventually create conflicts. This can be compared to insisting on teaching an airplane pilot how to ride a horse. The co-workers have the seniority, but it is no longer the age of riding horses; it is the age of jet planes. It is useless for co-workers to give old messages. Not everyone in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is prudent, but some in the younger generation are prudent and up to date with the age. If they are learning how to pilot an airplane, we should not teach them how to ride a horse.</p>
<p>The age is turning, and we must keep up with the age. If we continue to teach the doctrines that we learned in the past, we are not up to date with the age. What we learned in the past can only be a foundation. We must keep up with the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date way in order to perfect the young adults.</p><h2 class="head1">PERFECTING THE YOUNG ADULTS<br />
TO PRODUCE THE NEXT GENERATION<br />
FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>The co-workers should not lead the church themselves, nor should they replace the responsible brothers in the localities. If we know the Lord&rsquo;s way, we would do our best to transfer everything to the younger saints. We should help them and perfect them. Eventually, they will be better than we are. We may have the experience of running a school, but if we hold that experience in our hand, the school will eventually close down. If the responsibility for running the school is transferred to some younger adults, the school will flourish. Students are happy when they are taught by younger adults. The young adults, however, must learn from the experiences of the older saints. We must perfect the younger saints, pass everything we have on to them, and let them do everything.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the co-workers&rsquo; work is related to perfecting the younger saints. The co-workers have been working for the Lord for many years. They should consider whether their work is effective. Whatever does not match the age will not be effective. For this reason we need to turn. If we turn, our work will be effective.</p>
<p>We should not merely hold on to old principles. These principles are not wrong, but holding on to these principles is not sufficient. There are many situations that need to be adjusted and overturned. For example, if the elders in a locality are eighty years old, there is a desperate need to perfect younger saints. In this situation the co-workers should recommend several younger saints and spend two to three months to perfect them so that they may progress. After a few more months these younger saints might become elders. The co-workers who do this know how to work, and they are for &ldquo;the perfecting of the saints&rdquo; (Eph. 4:12).</p>
<p>The co-workers should not hold things in their hands. For instance, the co-workers should not handle everything related to hospitality. Rather, they should hand over things related to hospitality to the local saints. The co-workers should always stand in the position of perfecting and helping others, not taking their place or replacing them. The handling of the details of the international conference held in Taipei was a great move in this direction. It is wonderful that the co-workers handed all the practical responsibilities to the younger saints. The co-workers were in the background; they only supported and guided the younger saints. This is the way for the co-workers to achieve something and to develop the function of the younger saints. A country that can bring everyone into function will be strong. Likewise, in the church we should let the younger saints develop their ability and function. If all the affairs in the church in Taipei are handled by a few elderly co-workers, the function of the younger saints in the church in Taipei will be wasted rather than developed.</p>
<p>If a locality does not have that many younger saints, those who are seventeen or eighteen years old can be brought into function. Some might feel that these ones are too young. However, whether they are young depends on the situation at the time. Suppose a grandfather and father in a family both pass away, and the eldest son is only seventeen years old. Although he is only seventeen years old, he must rise up to take care of things. If an uncle feels that the son is too young and takes care of everything for him, the uncle is replacing him, not helping him. If we do not know how to perfect the younger saints in the churches, we do not know how to work. As long as someone can be perfected in a locality, we should help him and let him function. After a period of time he will rise up.</p>
<p>While perfecting the younger saints to function in the churches, the co-workers can tell them what to pay attention to and give some tips regarding any shortage. After a short period the younger saints will be perfected. If the younger saints must get approval for every decision, even small ones, nothing will be accomplished. If the co-workers are very cautious in considering everything, matters will be delayed. Time is of the essence in carrying things out. A war may be lost because a decision is one minute late, and a war may be won because a decision is one minute early. Food can burn if it is left to cook for just one extra minute. Therefore, the co-workers should not control anything. Instead, they should perfect everyone to take the initiative in order to produce the next generation for the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING HOW TO CONDUCT ONESELF<br />
AND HOW TO WORK</h2>
<p>Having a high spiritual life and a deep knowledge of life does not mean that our work will be effective. However, an effective work requires a high spiritual life and a deep knowledge of life. An effective work also requires much learning. In 1953, while I was conducting a training in Taipei, I said, &ldquo;If you do not know how to conduct yourself, you will not know how to do things, and if you do not know how to do things, you will not know how to do a work.&rdquo; Hence, we must also learn how to conduct ourselves and how to do things. If we do not know how to conduct ourselves and how to do things, we will not be able to carry out any work. As long as we are willing to learn and to change, we will still be useful to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">EVALUATING WHAT WE CAN DO<br />
AND CONSIDERING<br />
WHO WE CAN PERFECT</h2>
<p>The co-workers must see that the age has turned. If we do not turn, we will have a fundamental problem. In our practice, however, we also need to consider how much we can perfect and whether those whom we are serving need our perfecting. We have entered into the age of perfecting. We can no longer do a replacing work; we must do a perfecting work. Our problem is that we do not know how to perfect others. It is not sufficient for a co-worker to be faithful in the Lord&rsquo;s work and diligent in his conduct. We do not know how to work if a saint can pass through our hand without being perfected. If we do not perfect others, our work will not be effective no matter how much time and effort we spend.</p>
<p>In this age those who can perfect others know how to work. Hence, our usefulness in a locality depends on whether those whom we are serving need our perfecting. If they do not need our perfecting, we should go somewhere else. If a brother can teach only junior high school and the local people are all in high school, there is no use for him to stay there. He should go somewhere else. If he is an expert in teaching junior-high students and he goes to a place where the children are all in elementary school, he will be successful. This example shows how to work. Suppose a brother does not know his ability or the level of the saints he is serving in a locality. Suppose he can teach only &ldquo;junior high school,&rdquo; but he is assigned to work with &ldquo;high-school students.&rdquo; He may spend much time serving, but he is wasting himself and delaying others. This shows that he does not know how to work. Knowing how to work involves knowing ourselves, knowing our circumstances, and recognizing the times. Hence, the co-workers must evaluate what they can do and consider the saints whom they can help. This is the way to perfect others.</p>
<p>The co-workers are still holding on to old things. We should overturn this situation so that we can perfect more saints. Perfecting the saints does not mean that we will no longer need to do anything. On the contrary, we should do more, and we can do more. We should distribute responsibilities to others and at the same time teach, perfect, and equip them. Consequently, the number of functioning saints will grow.</p>
<p>In the United States there is a pastor who is educated, eloquent, and capable. He has been taking the lead and overseeing a group for more than twenty years. Because the number of people in that group grew from forty to around four thousand, he is considered to be a successful pastor. However, the Lord is not leading us to take the way of attracting people by personal gifts but to take the way of perfecting the saints. The Lord led me to go to the United States more than ten years ago. More than thirty local churches have been raised up, and there are over six thousand saints. No matter how capable I am, I cannot take care of all the local churches by myself. Our way is to perfect many saints to function in each local church. The six thousand saints do not have the same function, because everyone has different natural abilities. When we perfect them, their function will be manifested. If we let a seed grow, its form will be manifested. When it grows, we will know whether it is a peach, a plum, or an almond tree.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO PERFECT OTHERS<br />
AND TO PROPAGATE</h2>
<p>As the co-workers are considering before the Lord how to go on in the future, they should evaluate their ability and consider the level of the saints whom they are serving. If no place needs us, we can open up virgin land. On the active side of the Lord&rsquo;s work, there is a need for propagation, but there is no need to &ldquo;put icing on a cake.&rdquo; We should not serve a dish of steamed fish after everyone at a feast has been satisfied. The steamed fish may be good, but it is unnecessary due to the timing. It would be better to take the &ldquo;fish&rdquo; to a place where it is needed. Likewise, if a local church does not have a need, it is unnecessary for a co-worker to stay there. He should go to a place that has a need. If no place has a need, then he should open up virgin land. There are still many places that are waiting to be opened up. All the co-workers should learn how to perfect and how to propagate. Appointing elders and perfecting them is for the Lord&rsquo;s propagation, because the younger saints will carry out the work when they rise up. Propagation comes out of perfecting.</p>
<p>The work of the co-workers should be based on the following points. First, we must see that the age of replacing is over. This is the age of perfecting. Second, we need to consider how many people we can perfect and whether the saints we are serving need our perfecting. If a place does not have a need, we should not stay there. We should go to a place that needs our perfecting. Third, the Lord&rsquo;s work and propagation are needed even if all the existing localities are blessed and not in need of our perfecting. There is still a need to open up virgin land. This is propagation. Therefore, the co-workers must bury the concept and practice of replacing others. This fundamental issue must be resolved so that we may consider how many people we can perfect and whether the saints we are serving need our perfecting. If we are unable to perfect others or the saints have advanced beyond our ability, we should go somewhere else. If no locality has a need, we should go to open up virgin land and start from scratch.</p>
<p>This is the age of the new man. We can no longer do a work that is limited to one place. Such a work no longer matches the age. Those in the Lord&rsquo;s work must produce a living impact that is not limited to a locality or a group of saints. Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty the emphasis in the world is on blending. Hence, we should not do an independent work. We are not working for ourselves but for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. May we all contribute to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The co-workers need to soberly consider these points before the Lord.</p>
<p>When the co-workers go to different places, we must pay attention to the new saints. Gradually, the saints will manifest their gift, and we should learn how to cultivate and perfect these saints. We should lead these ones and give them responsibilities according to the level of their growth in life. After working in such a way for a few years, these saints may rise up and do what we do. When they are all perfected, we can do other things. Otherwise, we will be doing the same thing for twenty years. Everything will still be under our control, and the saints will need to report everything to us. We should not be like that capable pastor in the United States, who worked for more than ten years only to establish one large, strong group. It would be better if those few thousand people could produce thirty or more local churches. Then everyone could function. The fundamental principle is that we must let the younger saints rise up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTION AND ANSWER</h2>
<p><em>Question: When this generation of co-workers was raised up, there were already forty local churches in Taiwan. These co-workers were cultivated in the churches or taught under the leading of the senior co-workers; hence, they do not have the experience of opening up virgin land. This is their aspiration, but they do not know how to open up virgin land.</em></p>
<p>Answer: We may not know how to do something, but we can learn while doing. We learn by doing. Riding a bicycle is an example. Even if we are not taught how to ride a bicycle, if we have a bicycle and ride it, we will know how to ride a bicycle after a few days. Of course, if no one teaches us, we will fall many times. Nevertheless, even if we fall, we will know how to ride a bicycle. There is no set way to open up virgin land. The way that I say to do it may work if I do it, but it might not work if you do it. Furthermore, when I do it, I may do something different because of the situation. The key is to receive a burden. If the localities do not need our perfecting, we need to be ambitious before the Lord to open up virgin land. We should be willing to spend a number of years to bring forth a few people.</p>
<p>Someone may go to a small locality with churches nearby. As long as he remains in fellowship, he will spontaneously receive a supply from the nearby churches. He will be connected to the nearby churches, and all the churches in Taiwan will pray for him and may even send a supply to his locality. He does not need to wait for the co-workers to hold a conference and assign someone to join him. Such a practice involves too much of the human will. The co-workers should live a life of prayer before the Lord to receive a burden from Him.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the co-workers should stop caring for the saints and venture out on their own. This is individualistic. When some co-workers open up virgin land, the nearby churches should immediately join in by praying for them and supplying them practically; this is a proper situation. The other co-workers in Taiwan should also join in by remembering them in prayer. It is not improper for the work to arrange things by determining who goes where and by requesting material offerings from the local churches for the work, but this is rigid and inorganic.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEARNING TO BE USED<br />
BY THE LORD<br />
IN THE FLOW OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we considered the age of the one new man and how the co-workers should continue to go on in the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date way. Concerning where the co-workers should go, we do not want much arrangement. The co-workers should touch the Lord inwardly to find out the area that they should have a burden for and where they should go. This does not mean that the work cannot make arrangements; however, too much arrangement may not be of the Lord. Nor does this mean that the co-workers can act independently. Acting independently will not produce results.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THINGS THAT AFFECT THE FRUIT<br />
OF OUR WORK</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider a few things that affect the fruit of our work. Some people say that we cannot evaluate the fruit of our work until the Lord comes and that only the Lord&rsquo;s evaluation counts. This may sound good, but it is not practical. When we work for the Lord, we should pay attention to the fruit of our work, because the Lord said, &ldquo;Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for by the fruit the tree is known&rdquo; (Matt. 12:33). In order to know a tree, we must look at its fruit. Our main problem is not that we bear corrupt fruit but that we do not bear any fruit. Therefore, we cannot afford to neglect the matter of fruit. There are four things that negatively affect the fruit of our work. We need to be aware of these things.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Problem of Disposition</h2>
<p>The first thing that negatively affects the fruit of our work is our disposition. Our disposition can limit and even nullify the fruit of our work. Our disposition is a stubborn enemy. Every person has a different disposition. Some people have good dispositions; others have bad dispositions. For example, some people are sensitive. This is a bad disposition. A sensitive person is self-conscious. A person cannot be self-conscious if he is to accomplish anything. If we are self-conscious when we stand up to speak for the Lord, we will not be able to say anything. We must not be self-conscious when we preach the gospel. In other words, we should preach the gospel without caring about our feelings so that our speaking will be strong and our spirit will be released. A sensitive person considers many things before opening his mouth to speak; his sensitivity kills him. Sensitive brothers should learn not to care about their feelings or others&rsquo; comments but to care only for the burden. Then they will be able to subdue their sensitive disposition.</p>
<p>Another kind of disposition involves the tendency to point out others&rsquo; mistakes. This is not a simple matter. We need to minister life before we have any ground to point out others&rsquo; mistakes. If we point out someone&rsquo;s mistakes without ministering life, we will cause damage and accomplish nothing. A mother can rebuke her child because she gave birth to the child, raised the child, and taught the child. Even if she strongly disciplines him, the child will not leave. How can someone accept our pointing out of their mistakes if we have not begotten, nurtured, and taught him? If a co-worker goes to a local church and sees that the chairs are not properly arranged, he should not be concerned. His only concern should be to minister life. Only when we minister life can people be subdued. When they are subdued, we can point out mistakes. Then, even if they do not fully agree with us, they will not oppose, and they will eventually accept the correction.</p>
<p>Hence, the ability to point out people&rsquo;s mistakes depends on how much life we minister. If we minister much life and criticize little, there will be no problem. If we do not minister much life but criticize much, we will create problems. If we do not minister life, we will not be able to perfect. If we continually criticize others, they will eventually leave. People with such a disposition easily damage others. In order to perfect others, we must first minister life. If we cannot minister life, we should not speak about perfecting others, for there is no perfecting without ministering life. If someone makes a mistake, it is his concern, not ours; we do not have the ground to interfere. A mother can rebuke her child because she gave birth to the child, raised the child, and taught the child. She cannot rebuke children whom she sees on the street. There will be problems if she rebukes them.</p>
<p>The problem of disposition exists not only in the East but also in the West. Some American brothers who were under my leading lost their usefulness because of their disposition. There is an old Chinese saying: &ldquo;It is easier for rivers and mountains to change than for a person&rsquo;s nature to change.&rdquo; A person&rsquo;s nature is his disposition. Spiritually weighty people should have great value and function, but some are peculiar by disposition, and this negates their usefulness. A person&rsquo;s disposition affects his function. Everyone who desires to be used by the Lord must go against his disposition. Otherwise, he will not be useful. Our disposition can kill our function. Hence, we must stand against it. Not going against our disposition is the reason that we lose our function.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Working with Others</h2>
<p>The second thing that negatively affects the fruit of our work is our inability to work with others. We must be able to use others and raise them up. Some co-workers have not manifested their usefulness because they do not know how to work with others or are unwilling to work with others. In the church, as the Body of Christ, there is the need for coordination. Even in the world, individualistic people are not successful. If someone wants to open a shop, he must hire employees. In northern China people say, &ldquo;It is easy to sell things; it is hard to manage employees.&rdquo; If one does not know how to manage his employees, his business will not be successful. In every occupation we need to know how to work with others. All the successful Chinese emperors knew how to work with people. They even knew how to work with those who opposed them. Working with others does not mean that we are encouraging political maneuverings. If we cannot work with others, we will not be useful. Some saints have not manifested their function because they do not work with others. Some are unwilling to work with others, and some do not know how to work with others. It is not a matter of the saints lacking talent. Everyone has a talent, but some are greater and some are lesser in measure. It is possible to make a table with top-quality wood or lower-quality wood. If top-quality wood is not available, we should use the wood that is available. It is better to have wood than to have nothing, because even lower-quality wood can be made into a table. We must be able to work with others. Otherwise, we will be useless.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Unable to Work under Others</h2>
<p>The third thing that negatively affects the fruit of our work is that we are unable to work under others, to coordinate with others. This problem will also cause us to lose our function. There is only one universal administration. This is a great principle. Hence, there can be only one head in any situation. There is only one leader in a country. There can be only one emperor or one president. This principle applies to every government agency. There can be only one head, not two. As long as someone is not the head, he should follow the directions from the head, even if he is much more capable than the head. It does not matter how capable a person is; what matters is the time and the situation.</p>
<p>When the Lord brought me to work with Brother Nee, I was clear that Brother Nee was taking the lead. He may not have been more capable than I in every area, but he was taking the lead; therefore, I gave myself to follow him in everything. If he wanted me to go somewhere, I would go because he was taking the lead. I became very useful because I was used by him in this way. If I had thought that I was wiser and was unwilling to go where he sent me, he would not have asked me to go to the places where it was proper for me to go. We must know how to work with others and how to work under others so that we may be useful. Disposition, working with others, and working under others are not spiritual doctrines, but they are related to our usefulness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Playing Politics</h2>
<p>The fourth thing that negatively affects the fruit of our work is playing politics. Although we do not have as much politics among us as other groups, we still have the residual influence of politics. We should never play politics in the Lord&rsquo;s work. When I went to Shanghai, some people thought that I was a foolish countryman because I never played politics. It was later proved that this foolish countryman was victorious. When I was young, I worked in a foreign company where, in addition to Chinese, there were seven other nationalities: British, American, French, German, Russian, Greek, and Norwegian. I worked with them for six and a half years; I was not foolish. The difference between the northerners and the southerners is that the southerners tend to play more politics. However, those who play politics will eventually be harmed by their own politics. I can testify before the Lord that playing politics is like digging a hole for one&rsquo;s own burial. Brother Nee fully trusted me because I did not play politics. Therefore, my advice is that even if someone has a history in the work, he should not play politics or manipulate things. Let our word be yes, yes, and no, no. If we do not agree, we do not need to oppose others, but neither should we play politics. This matter also has much to do with our usefulness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING USED BY THE LORD AND<br />
PRODUCING FRUIT</h2>
<p>Our disposition, working with others, working under others, and not playing politics are crucial to our being used by the Lord. I have my disposition. However, when I came into the work, I had to go against my disposition. Sometimes I failed. It is difficult to go against our disposition. However, even if we fail, we still need to go against our disposition. Beginning in 1934 I stayed in Shanghai for a long period of time. During this time Brother Nee put me at the center of the work. I can testify that I did not have any problem with anyone. I gave myself to be under others. I listened not only to Brother Nee but also to Sister Ruth Lee and Sister Peace Wang because both of them were older than I. Sister Peace Wang brought me to salvation and was six years older than I. Sister Ruth Lee was at least nine years older than I. They both knew the Lord and were useful to the Lord; they helped me greatly. Hence, I gave myself to be under them. I did whatever they said. I also learned from them how to work with others.</p>
<p>Coordination involves working with others and working under others. Two brothers in a family know who is older and who is younger. If you are older and I am younger, I will listen to you without complaint. This is coordination. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace there are no arguments or conflicts among us, nor is there anger. Nevertheless, there is still the need to accomplish things. In order to accomplish things, we need to know how to work with others. We learn how to work with others by being under others. If we know how to be under others, we will know how to work with others. Whether in the church or in the world, we cannot do a work by ourselves; we need colleagues or helpers. Recently, the church in Taipei has been flourishing. Although this is the result of many factors, we must admit that knowing how to work properly with others is one of the factors. If we do not work properly with others, we will quench their function before they begin to &ldquo;burn.&rdquo; Hence, we must learn how to work with others.</p>
<p>May the Lord deliver us from these negative items by His mercy. If the co-workers are willing to go against their disposition and learn how to work with others and how to work under others without playing politics, our work will bear fruit. We all have been in the work for many years. We cannot say that we do not know how to work. We may not have a thorough knowledge of the Bible, but at least we have a general knowledge of the Bible. We may not have arrived at spiritual maturity, but we have a certain amount of growth. However, because of these four points, our function is still not manifested. We lack those who know how to work with others. We can do things by ourselves, but we do not know how to do things with others. Hence, not many of us are used by others. As a result, our work does not yield much fruit.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT BEING DISCOURAGED<br />
OR THINKING LOWLY OF ONESELF<br />
BUT BEING FAITHFUL TO THE LORD<br />
AND CARING FOR HIS INTEREST</h2>
<p>May the Lord give us the grace to learn to go against our disposition, to work with others, to be under others, and to not play politics. The co-workers should not be discouraged or consider themselves as hopeless; neither should they think that they are too old to be useful. Even if the co-workers are fifty years old, they still have decades before them of being in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. No one is useless; everyone is useful. The younger saints have their strengths and surpass us in many ways, but this is their portion. We also have our portion. We have been in the Lord&rsquo;s work for more than twenty years; thus, we have more experience, insight, and weight. The younger saints cannot replace the co-workers, nor can the co-workers replace the younger saints. We should not be proud, nor should we despise ourselves. The older co-workers should never think that they are not needed because the younger ones have risen up. The Lord still needs every one of us. Every one of us has received the grace of the Lord. We have a portion of the Lord&rsquo;s grace, and we will give an account of this grace to the Lord. One day we will meet Him, and we will need to give Him an account of how we used our portion of grace. We need to be faithful to the church, and we also need to be faithful to the Lord. If we love the Lord, we should care for His interest on earth today. I hope that every one of us will take this way of being used by the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING THE FLOW OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In addition to these four points, the flow of the Holy Spirit is also closely related to the fruit of our work. In principle, the Lord is still working on the earth. Therefore, He must speak because He works by speaking. His speaking is His work. He created all things by speaking, and He also preached the gospel by speaking. God works by speaking (Psa. 33:9; Heb. 1:1-3). Therefore, He has been speaking in every age. In the age of Abraham He spoke through Abraham. In the age of Noah He spoke through Noah. In the age of Moses He spoke through Moses. In the New Testament age the Lord Jesus spoke. Later, the Lord spoke through the apostles. In principle, the Lord is still working on the earth today because He works by speaking. Where is the Lord speaking? Some people say that He is speaking in the Bible. This is correct because the Bible is the complete revelation of God, but what is the Lord speaking today? Furthermore, the Lord must speak in a particular place, but where is He speaking today?</p>
<p>It was the Lord&rsquo;s leading that brought me into His work. In October of 1933 I went to Shanghai to visit Brother Nee and stayed with him for a few months. One day Brother Nee said to me, &ldquo;Brother Witness, the co-workers feel that you should move your family to Shanghai so that you can work together with us. Please bring this matter before the Lord in prayer.&rdquo; When I brought this matter to the Lord, He showed me that in the book of Acts there was only one line, one flow in His move and work on the earth. This flow went from Jerusalem to Antioch and from there to Asia Minor. The co-workers who were later raised up by the Lord also entered into this flow. The Lord showed me that although I had a burden to work in north China, the work in north China should not start from north China; rather, I should first enter into the flow in Shanghai. Therefore, I felt that I could not begin anything in north China. I had to enter into the flow with Brother Nee in Shanghai. If there would be a work in north China, it had to flow out from Shanghai.</p>
<p>I respected Brother Nee not only because he was taking the lead; he was also the oracle of the Lord. At that time I understood many doctrines. I was taught and perfected in a Brethren assembly for seven and a half years, and I had learned many things concerning the prophecies and types. But what I learned was not the Lord&rsquo;s speaking at that time. The Lord&rsquo;s speaking was with Brother Nee. If I spoke what Brother Nee spoke, there was the fruit of life, but if I spoke about prophecies and types, there was no fruit of life, because the doctrines and knowledge related to the prophecies and types were not the Lord&rsquo;s speaking at that time. The messages that Brother Nee gave were the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. Whenever I spoke what he spoke, the Lord confirmed it, blessed it, and enlivened others.</p>
<p>In every age the Lord works by speaking. He does not speak through only one person. However, if He speaks through many people, they will speak the same thing. Moses was not the only person who spoke in his age, but everyone spoke the same thing that Moses spoke. In the New Testament age there have been many apostles, but they spoke the same thing in oneness concerning the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the regeneration and transformation of the believers, and the producing of the church, the one Body, the one new man. This was the Lord&rsquo;s speaking at the time. In Martin Luther&rsquo;s time, the Lord spoke of justification by faith through Luther. In the time of the Brethren, the Lord spoke through the brothers. In Brother Nee&rsquo;s time, the Lord spoke the words of this age through Brother Nee.</p>
<p>Because the Lord&rsquo;s work has not stopped, the Lord&rsquo;s speaking also has not stopped. This does not mean that I am promoting myself or that I am asking everyone to speak my words. The co-workers are free to travel to other Christian groups if the Lord is speaking there. We worship the Lord that in recent years every local church that is using the Life-study messages has been enlivened. Many messages can be given concerning the different topics in the Bible. A message can be given concerning Noah or Abraham. However, what is important is whether our messages are the Lord&rsquo;s speaking today. The Lord&rsquo;s speaking is absolutely related to His move on the earth. When we see the flow of the Holy Spirit and where the Lord is speaking today, our work will be fruitful.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">COME, GO, COME</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19-20; Acts 1:8; 13:2-3; 26:16-20; 20:24, 34-35; 1 Cor. 9:7-15; 1 Tim. 5:17-18</h1>
<p>The Bible is consistent from its beginning to its end. In order to understand the Bible, one must know the lines in the Bible, such as the line of life, the line of the kingdom, and the line of the church. In this chapter we will consider the line of &ldquo;come, go, come.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LINE OF &ldquo;COME, GO, COME&rdquo;<br />
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>There is the line of &ldquo;come, go, come&rdquo; in the Bible. The entire New Testament concerns these three words: <em>come, go,</em> and <em>come.</em> When the Lord Jesus came forth to carry out His ministry, He called people to come to Him. He said, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink&rdquo; (John 7:37), and &ldquo;Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest&rdquo; (Matt. 11:28). The word <em>come</em> almost covers the entire scope of the four Gospels. In the four Gospels the Lord repeatedly called people to come to Him: come and rest, come and drink the living water, come and be saved. The thought of &ldquo;come&rdquo; is also in the Epistles. Hebrews 4:16 says, &ldquo;Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help.&rdquo; The Lord wants us to come to Him because our experiencing grace, salvation, power, love, light, holiness, and righteousness depends on our coming to Him. When we come, we receive grace, salvation, power, love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the first word in the Lord&rsquo;s calling is <em>come.</em> Every believer has come to the Lord at least once. We cannot say that those who have come once to the Lord do not need to come to Him again. We need to come to the Lord again and again. Coming to the Lord can be compared to breathing, because no one can graduate from breathing. If someone graduates from breathing, he is finished. Likewise, we cannot graduate from coming to the Lord. In eternity we will still need to continually come to the Lord. Therefore, we have to come to the Lord day after day. We can come to the Lord numerous times in one day. We can come to the Lord in the morning, at noon, and in the evening by calling on His name so that we may receive grace, life, and the life supply.</p>
<p>After we come to the Lord and receive grace, the Lord will ask us to go. In Matthew 28:19 the Lord said, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations.&rdquo; This going may be a &ldquo;great&rdquo; going or a &ldquo;small&rdquo; going; it may be to go to a faraway place or to a nearby place. For example, after the Samaritan woman in John 4 drank the living water from the Lord, she immediately went away into the city and testified to the people (vv. 28-29). We may come to the Lord at night and go and testify to people the next morning, or we may come to the Lord at noon and go and testify to people in the afternoon, spreading the good news. To go and testify to our parents or siblings is a small going to a nearby place. To go and testify to all the nations is a great going to a faraway place.</p>
<p>The entire New Testament involves these two words: <em>come</em> and <em>go.</em> The New Testament involves coming, and it also involves going. To come is to receive grace, and to go is to impart grace into people. By our coming and going, we will eventually express a desire to the Lord. We will say, &ldquo;Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo; (Rev. 22:20). Therefore, the second &ldquo;come&rdquo; is connected to the Lord&rsquo;s coming again. Hence, the entire New Testament is concerning these three words: <em>come, go,</em> and <em>come.</em></p>
<p>The first &ldquo;come&rdquo; is continual, and the &ldquo;go&rdquo; is also continual. We continually come to the Lord, and we continually go until the final &ldquo;come,&rdquo; when we will be with the Lord for eternity and will no longer need to go. May the Lord strengthen both our coming and our going. If we daily come to the Lord in the morning, at noon, and in the evening, we will surely go and testify to people. The issue of such coming and going is that we desire and yearn for the Lord to come back.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COMING AND GOING BEING<br />
A CHRISTIAN&rsquo;S BREATHING, LIVING,<br />
AND FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>We should not understand this coming and going as something religious or organizational. After a person is saved and receives the Lord&rsquo;s life, he needs to come to the Lord daily. Our physical body needs to breathe, drink, and eat daily. Likewise, we need to come to the Lord daily. The more we come to the Lord, the more we have the burden to go. No one comes to the Lord and does not go afterward. This going is the result of receiving a commission from the Lord and going with the Lord and His salvation. In the past two thousand years of church history, thousands of Christians have had a living of coming and going. These Christians had such a walk.</p>
<p>If we come to the Lord, He will ask us to go and preach the gospel and to go and impart His grace into people. This going is not a trend or a movement; it is not a religious enterprise, an organizational operation, or a political movement. Rather, this is a person coming to enjoy the Lord, gain Him, and be filled with Him, and then going by the Lord&rsquo;s being in him, bearing him, and supporting him. Such a going is spontaneous.</p>
<p>In Christianity the Lord&rsquo;s charge to go and disciple all the nations has become a religious enterprise. Hence, Christianity organizes missions and sends out preachers to carry out a missionary work. This kind of going is an organization and a movement, a missionary enterprise. However, according to the Bible, going does not refer to a missionary enterprise, an organization, or a movement. Rather, going is as natural and spontaneous as breathing. When we breathe in, we must breathe out. To come and go is our spiritual breathing. To come and draw near to the Lord in the morning but not go and speak to people about the Lord&rsquo;s grace afterward is the same as holding one&rsquo;s breath. We must remember that to come and go is not a movement or an enterprise. To come and go is the normal spiritual life of Christians.</p>
<p>It is not right for us to come to the Lord but not go, nor is it right for us to go without coming. After we come, we must go, and if we want to go, we must come. We come to the Lord no matter what our condition may be; we may be weak, in darkness, defeated, sinful, or empty. However, we go with the Lord and His grace. We come empty-handed but go filled with the Lord. Such a coming and going is spiritual fellowship.</p><h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING &ldquo;COME AND GO&rdquo;<br />
AND HAVING THE WORK<br />
OF GOLD, SILVER, AND PRECIOUS STONES</h2>
<p>In 1949 I left mainland China and came to Taiwan to begin the Lord&rsquo;s work in Taipei, but I was not hired by the church in Taipei. Although I was sent by the work to Taiwan, I was not carrying out a religious enterprise or establishing an organization or movement. I can testify that the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s work is His doing.</p>
<p>Concerning the land on which hall one in Taipei is built, the front half was a gift to the church from two Chinese brothers, who had been living overseas and had returned to Taiwan and saw the Lord&rsquo;s need. We built a small meeting hall on that piece of land. On August 1, 1949, we held our first conference there to officially begin the Lord&rsquo;s work. Under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing, the number of believers kept increasing until the meeting hall was no longer adequate for our use. Then the Lord allowed us to purchase the adjacent piece of land at a low price. Thus, we tore down the existing small meeting hall and built a larger one. Once, when we were preaching the gospel in Taipei, some people had to sit on benches in the empty lot across from the meeting hall in order to hear the gospel, because there was not sufficient space in the hall. We later built a workers&rsquo; house on that empty lot. Years later, the government planned to expand the roads in Taipei, so we returned that piece of land to the government. Everything was according to the Lord&rsquo;s good pleasure. We are now going to build a large meeting hall, and the Lord has provided us with a sum of money.</p>
<p>We must remember that in our work we do not have an organization; rather, we live in the principle of &ldquo;come and go,&rdquo; that is, the principle of coming to the Lord and then going after receiving a burden from the Lord. Only this kind of work is worthwhile. This is neither a movement nor an organization. Any work that is a movement or an organization is wood, grass, and stubble; only the work of coming and going can produce gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12).</p>
<p>We come to the Lord, and then we go filled with the Lord&rsquo;s grace so that we may bring this grace, which is the Lord Himself, to people. The issue of such a work is gold, silver, and precious stones. My spirit is excited and revived to see that so many saints are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, because the saints are my joy (1 Thes. 2:19). Those who are in the church life can testify that what they have gained is the Lord Himself. They have received salvation and the Lord&rsquo;s love, grace, life, and light, and they have also received the Lord Himself. This is gold, silver, and precious stones, which will last for eternity.</p>
<p>Our coming to Taiwan for the Lord&rsquo;s work was in the principle of coming and going. We did not carry out the work as a movement or as an organization. In a co-workers&rsquo; meeting, Brother Watchman Nee decided that I should go to Taiwan. I went forth in faith and did not receive support from anyone. I had a family of ten plus two helpers whom I could not dismiss, and I had only three hundred dollars in my hand. Outwardly, we came to Taiwan empty-handed; inwardly, however, we came filled with Christ to share with all the people. I believe that the saints can testify that in the church we are receiving gold, silver, and precious stones.</p>
<p>Let me repeat, we do not have an organization, an evangelistic campaign, or a mission, nor do we promote any movement. We share with others the grace that we have received through coming and going. We all should be coming and going. We come to the Lord to be graced, enlightened, dealt with, purified, emptied, and filled with Him so that we may be sent forth by the Lord, and we go with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A GREAT GOING FOR FIVE ASPECTS OF THE NEED<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the Lord&rsquo;s move on the earth. Therefore, we move according to the Lord. We do not want to initiate any movement. If there is a movement, there is an organization, for these two are inseparable. We have abandoned every religious organization and movement. We only want to come and go, that is, to come to the Lord daily and to go after receiving a burden from Him. We will fellowship concerning five aspects of the need in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This fellowship is concerning great goings, not small goings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Raising Up the Young Working Saints<br />
to Continue the Eldership</h2>
<p>In the last two decades the Lord has raised up over sixty local churches in Taiwan. Some of these churches are stronger, and some are weaker, still needing help from the co-workers. The stronger churches still have shortages. For example, the church in Taipei has more than twelve elders who were appointed over twenty years ago. Some of these elders were a little over thirty years old when they were appointed but are now over sixty years old. Because the elders in Taipei are older and have such a history, the church in Taipei has a firm foundation. However, when the leading ones get older, they are not as living and fresh. Therefore, several years ago the Lord&rsquo;s leading to the churches was for a turning of the age. The goal was to replace the elders who were over sixty years old in all the stronger churches with the younger generation. This is not saying that the older elders are not qualified or have not done a good job, but if the father in a big family has worked hard since his youth, he should be discharged of his burden when he becomes old so that the second generation can pick up the burden. Then the entire family will have a future and will have hope. If the son is thirty years old and the seventy-year-old father is still busy, the son has no choice but to be a bystander, who cannot render any help but rather becomes sarcastic when he disagrees with the situation. Such a family has no future. The aged father should rest and let his young son take over the responsibility. This example may be inadequate, but it is clear. I hope that we can understand the meaning.</p>
<p>Many of the stronger churches in Taiwan have a history of over twenty-five years, and most of the elders in these churches are over sixty years of age. These brothers have served as elders for over twenty years. As such, they should be allowed to rest. However, I am not saying that they should no longer be concerned for the church. They should be concerned for the church and pray for the church, like elderly fathers who stand behind the younger generation to support and supply the family. The younger generation should rise up to meet the present need. The stronger churches in Taiwan need some strong younger ones who are raised up by the Lord to carry on the eldership.</p><h2 class="head2">Going to the Smaller and Weaker Churches<br />
to Strengthen the Testimony</h2>
<p>The second aspect of our need is for the smaller and weaker churches. There is a need for the younger generation to be led by the Lord to go to the smaller and weaker churches in order to bear the responsibility and strengthen the testimony.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Going to the Satellite Towns of Major Cities<br />
to Establish Churches on the Proper Ground</h2>
<p>The third aspect of our need is for the satellite towns of major cities. In some of these towns there are ten to twenty saints, but the church has not yet been established, because the saints are not strong enough to bear the responsibility of the testimony of a local church. The young working saints need to receive a burden from the Lord to go to these places to preach the gospel and establish churches on the proper ground in coordination with the local saints.</p>
<p>Our urgent need is to raise up younger saints to continue the eldership, to strengthen the smaller and weaker churches, and to establish churches in satellite towns. The stronger churches are normal, healthy, and stable, but the elders are older and cannot do too much; they therefore lack the strength to push forward. Hence, the younger generation needs to rise up and bear the responsibility in order to push forward the various aspects of the work. There is also the need for a group of strong and burdened younger saints to strengthen the testimony in the smaller and weaker churches. This will turn the smaller and weaker churches into stronger churches. The major cities in Taiwan, such as Taipei, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung, have satellite towns, where a small number of saints are residing. These saints love the Lord, but they are not strong enough to establish a church. Because these are satellite towns of major cities that have local churches, it should be easy for these towns to receive help and supply from the churches in the major cities. Hence, the young saints need to receive the burden to strengthen the local testimony in these towns for the establishing of churches on the proper ground.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Going to Remote Towns to Establish Churches</h2>
<p>The fourth aspect of our need is for the remote towns. According to the trend of the mobility of people in Taiwan, most students and skilled people have moved to the big cities. When we preach the gospel, we are like fishermen (Matt. 4:19). Fishermen go fishing where there are schools of fish. My hometown, Chefoo, was a fishing harbor. The wise fishermen did not usually catch big fish, because big fish are difficult to handle. The experienced fishermen caught fish that were neither too big nor too small. When they cast their net, they caught a multitude of fish. This is the wise way. Fishermen always go where there are large schools of fish. Hence, as fishers of men, we must go where there are crowds of people.</p>
<p>However, there are many small towns in Taiwan. Even though people tend to move to big cities, there are still many people in the small towns. These towns may not have colleges and high schools, but they have junior high schools. If we have insight, we will see that the most effective way to preach the gospel is to begin with the children. We need a children&rsquo;s work that begins with young children and continues to students in junior high school. It should also include students in high schools and colleges.</p>
<p>When I returned to Taiwan in 1966, I encouraged the brothers in Taipei to work with the goal of gaining ten thousand children to meet every week in the meeting halls or in the saints&rsquo; homes. These meetings do not have to be on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. They may be held on an afternoon or in the evening during the week. We should not be limited to the meeting halls. Many saints may open their homes to serve the children. Whether we teach the children to sing hymns or tell them stories, they will be happy.</p>
<p>At that time the church in Taipei had approximately twenty-three thousand saints, of which at least two thousand were young families. If each family had two or three children, there would have been five to six thousand children in the church in Taipei. In addition, the saints&rsquo; relatives, friends, and neighbors also have children. Therefore, I was confident that the number of children could reach ten thousand. If there were ten thousand children ten years ago, now they all would be in junior high school. These ten thousand students would be our gospel seeds, who can preach the gospel to their schoolmates. Every student in junior high school should be able to lead at least one schoolmate to salvation. Thus, these ten thousand students would become twenty thousand. After three years these twenty thousand high-school seniors would graduate, and at least one-third of them would go to college. Thus, we would have seven thousand brothers and sisters as gospel soldiers in all the colleges.</p>
<p>I am neither complaining nor blaming anyone, but if I were taking the lead in the church in Taipei, I would be involved with the children&rsquo;s work. The brothers who go to the small towns should receive the burden to work with the children and the students in junior high school. In order to teach in a junior high school, a person must graduate from a university or a junior college. The young working saints who have a heart to serve the Lord all have this level of education. The people in the small towns might not have graduated from a junior college, but they are simple and can accept the gospel. Because of their level of education and their character, the young working saints will be a positive influence in the small towns. In this way they will lead some children or some students in junior high school to know and believe in the Lord. Through these children and students we will be able to contact their parents and lead them to receive the gospel. This can be accomplished.</p>
<p>The saints who come to the Lord and go forth with a commission do not care for position or enjoyment. Hence, no one who goes forth for the Lord will starve to death. I hope that the younger saints will all go to the Lord and pray. The one way before us is to go to the small towns and contact the students by teaching in the elementary schools and in the junior high schools. Then it will be easy to lead children to know the Lord or to lead the students in junior high school to salvation. After we lead people to accept the gospel, we can establish a church.</p><h2 class="head2">Going to Every School<br />
to Gain People with the Gospel</h2>
<p>The fifth aspect of our need concerns the campus work in every major city. The churches in Taipei, Tainan, and Kaohsiung should have a campus work. Taipei County has approximately two hundred junior high schools, high schools, junior colleges, and universities. If there were twenty brothers and sisters in every school, there would be four thousand saints who are students participating in the church life. This may seem difficult, but it is easy to attain if some working saints would receive a burden from the Lord and be led to go to a certain school for the campus work.</p>
<p>There are a few ways for the working saints to be involved in the campus work. First, they can teach in a school. Second, they can move close to a school into a spacious house where students can be contacted, come and sit for a while, and have a snack. Third, they can contact the staff and workers in the school. Fourth, they can use every available channel to gain an entrance into the school in order to contact the students. The student work requires patience; we should not be anxious for results. Some may work for a couple of months with no result, but at the end of the semester they will see the result. From our past practice in the United States, we know that the most effective way to gain people is to preach the gospel through the campus work. I believe this also applies to Taiwan.</p>
<p>We have presented five needs in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. If the saints are willing to receive the burden and practice this fellowship, I believe that after a few years the Lord may bring us back to mainland China. Then He will be able to recover the situation in mainland China through the blessing received in the churches in Taiwan. How glorious this would be! However, the Lord may lead some of us to go to Southeast Asia, East Asia, Australia, or Europe. I believe that some brothers will go to Africa or South America. This is absolutely in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. I never dreamed that I would work for the Lord in the United States, but the Lord led me this way.</p>
<p>We have begun to take the first step, so we must be steady and go up step by step. We must receive a burden from the Lord before we take action. We need to bear the burden in the stronger churches, strengthen the testimony in the weaker churches, establish a church on the proper ground in satellite towns, pioneer the work and establish churches in rural communities, and contact students through preaching the gospel in schools. We all need to bring these five aspects of our need to the Lord in prayer in order to seek His leading.</p>
<p>We are not an organization, nor do we have someone who makes arrangements. However, we do not want to see someone act individualistically. Hence, we need to be led by the Lord, and we also need much mutual fellowship. We need to pray much before the Lord, and we also need to come together and pray. We may also need to fast and pray. In Acts 13 there were prophets and teachers in Antioch, in the local church, and &ldquo;as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them. Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away&rdquo; (vv. 2-3). This was not an arrangement according to human will. It was done in fellowship; it was not an individualistic action.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CALL FOR FULL-TIME SERVING ONES</h2>
<p>When we go and preach the gospel in different places for the Lord&rsquo;s need, we will encounter financial needs. According to the Bible, there is no such thing as professional preachers who are hired and given a salary. We must knock down such a concept. Every person who comes and goes should be an evangelist. Some may receive a particular commission. The function of their gift that is constituted with the grace of the Lord may become so great that they have no time or energy to care for other things; they care only for the things of the Lord. Hence, there is a need for them to serve full time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Scriptural Basis</h2>
<p>Even though the term <em>full time</em> is not used in the Bible, there is such a fact. First Corinthians 9:7-9 says, &ldquo;What soldier ever serves by his own wages? Who plants a vineyard and does not partake of its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and does not partake of the milk of the flock? Am I speaking these things according to man? Or does the law not also say these things? For in the law of Moses it is written: &lsquo;You shall not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain.&rsquo; Is it for oxen that God cares?&rdquo; Verses 13 and 14 say, &ldquo;Do you not know that those who labor on the sacred things eat the things of the sacred temple, that those who attend to the altar have their portion with the altar? So also the Lord directed those who announce the gospel to live from the gospel.&rdquo; These verses speak of evangelists needing the supply from others. This is proof that those who preach the gospel do not sustain their living with a job. They spend all their time on the gospel and live from the gospel. We should not misunderstand living from the gospel to mean that preachers are hired and given a salary.</p>
<p>Verse 9 says, &ldquo;You shall not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain.&rdquo; This means that an ox treading out the grain to feed others should be fed first. This verse does not refer to the giving of a salary. Verse 13 says, &ldquo;Those who labor on the sacred things eat the things of the sacred temple.&rdquo; This does not mean that they are given a salary; it means that their needs are supplied. These verses show that in the early church there were full-time serving ones who did not have an occupation but devoted their time and energy to the gospel. As a result, their needs had to be supplied by others.</p>
<p>First Timothy 5:17 says, &ldquo;Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching.&rdquo; This shows that in the early churches some elders also served full time. The word <em>honor</em> implies material supply. Some elders were apt to lead and administrate the church, and they also labored to proclaim the Lord&rsquo;s word and teach the believers. They were full-timers without an occupation. Therefore, they needed the supply from others.</p><h2 class="head2">The Way of Faith</h2>
<p>How do we carry out the support for the full-time serving ones? There is no set practice. There is only one way&mdash;the way of faith. If we love the Lord, come to Him, and receive a burden to preach the gospel in every place, we will have no way to escape. On one hand, serving the Lord brings us joy, but on the other hand, it is a heavy yoke. On the day of my salvation I was yoked to the Lord. I have wanted to escape many times, but I could not escape. Sometimes it seemed that I succeeded, but I did not feel at ease or satisfied. Hence, it is not up to us, just as we could not choose to be male or female, or Chinese or American. Similarly, becoming a Christian was not up to us; it was determined by God before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4).</p>
<p>Because we have believed in the Lord, our serving full time is not up to us. When we come to the Lord and are touched by His love, we are willing to preach the gospel. The more we come and go, the more we lose interest in other things. As a result, we might offend our parents, because they do not understand why we go to meetings all the time and have no interest in other things. It may be that we cannot explain why we have no interest in other things, but we are delighted to serve the Lord. We have been chosen, called, and separated by God. This is our destiny, and it cannot be changed. The way of faith is the only way to live such a life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Experiencing the Faithfulness<br />
of God in Our Hardships</h2>
<p>Although the way of faith is glorious and bright, there are hardships. Because I have experienced this, I can assure you that no hardship will cause you to starve to death. Every hardship is an opportunity to experience the faithfulness of God.</p>
<p>It is much easier to take this way today than it was in the past. When we took this way, it was truly difficult because this way had not been opened, and there were few churches and few saints. Today, however, this way has been opened, and there are a good number of churches and saints. The Lord can move the churches and touch the saints to care for the needs of His serving ones. Even if most of the saints are not touched, the Lord will still send people to supply us, just as He sent ravens to bring bread and meat to the prophet Elijah (1 Kings 17:2-6).</p>
<p>In 1936 I was working in Tientsin and Beijing in northern China. At the end of the year, Brother Watchman Nee called a nationwide co-workers&rsquo; conference in Shanghai because he had received new light from the Lord. (The messages released in this conference are included in the book entitled <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em>) We took a train on January 1, 1937, to Shanghai. After the conference I was invited to visit the churches in Hangchow, Nanking, Tsinan, and other places. My family was in Tientsin, while I was traveling in the south. One day my wife and children ran out of food, so they knelt down in front of the bed to pray. Before long an elderly sister knocked at the door. She was not acquainted with my wife, and she was not fluent in the northern dialect, because she was Cantonese. She told my wife that while she was at home, she did not have peace. The Lord urged her to deliver a package of food and some money to my family. This timely supply met the needs of my family.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Full-timers<br />
Exercising to Maintain Their Living<br />
and Caring for the Needs<br />
of Their Fellow Workers</h2>
<p>We need to exercise faith and to take the way of faith. However, this does not mean that the church should not pray or that the church should not make any arrangements for the support of the full-time serving ones. It is proper for the church to pray and to arrange for the support of the serving ones. Nevertheless, whether or not the church cares for the needs of the full-time serving ones, the full-time serving ones should live by faith. This does not mean that the saints do not need to receive the burden to care for the needs of the full-timers. The Lord moved that elderly sister to deliver the supply in a timely way to my family; she did not wait for a meeting to deliver the supply.</p>
<p>On one hand, the church and the saints should receive the burden to care for the needs of the full-timers. On the other hand, the full-time serving ones should be able to maintain their living. Paul said, &ldquo;These hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me&rdquo; (Acts 20:34). Paul worked with his own hands not only to maintain his living but also to minister to the needs of his fellow workers. During China&rsquo;s War of Resistance against Japan, the Chinese economy was doing poorly, and it was difficult for the co-workers to live. Brother Watchman Nee opened a pharmaceutical company to minister to the needs of many co-workers in a hidden way. But some believers criticized him for going into business. In 1948, when his ministry was resumed, Brother Nee spoke of this matter with tears in one of the revival meetings in Shanghai. He said that his going into business was like a widow&rsquo;s remarrying in order to raise her children. There were around five hundred saints in that meeting, and all wept when they heard this word. This shows how Brother Nee cared for the needs of the co-workers. We all need to learn to have faith not only for ourselves but also for others.</p>
<p>May the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood cover me to say that from 1949, when I started the work in Taiwan, until 1952 the Lord raised up nearly eighty full-time serving ones. I received a burden from the Lord to care for the living of these serving ones so that they would not be deprived of food. My ministry ministered to the needs of about one hundred eighty people every month. Because of what I had experienced, I was concerned for the new serving ones. Not many saints had been led to care for them directly, because their gift had not yet been manifested. For example, many believers might have ministered to Paul but not to Timothy. Hence, Paul had to take care of Timothy. This is the principle.</p><h2 class="head2">Exercising Faith to Believe in the Living God</h2>
<p>In order to serve full time, we must learn the lesson of faith and take the way of faith. We do not have an organization, but we have the way of faith. We need to believe that our God is living. After I went to the United States for the work, a brother said that I was able to work by faith in the United States because many churches and saints in the Far East ministered to my needs. Before the Lord, I would like to say that after I started the work in the United States, from 1961 to 1965, not one church in the Far East sent me even a penny. In 1965 I became a United States citizen and needed to pay taxes. A brother, who was an accountant, handled my taxes and found out that the support I received from the church in Los Angeles was about seven hundred dollars a year. Some people may ask how I was able to live without any source of support. My answer is that I live by faith and I take the way of faith. This is not being childish or superstitious. Every full-time serving one must realize that this way is the way of faith.</p>
<p>Those who are burdened to serve full time must be clear that no one will promise to support you. This is the way of faith. If someone cannot take this way of faith, there is no need for him to force himself. If he wants to take this way of serving full time, he must have the grace of the Lord. He may not care whether he has faith but would still willingly and joyfully take this way even if he would starve to death; this is good. When the Lord called me to serve full time, He gave me a clear word that He would care for all my needs. I dared not disbelieve the Lord&rsquo;s word, but I had only partial faith. Inwardly, I said to the Lord, &ldquo;If I will die of hunger, so be it! If I need to, I will eat tree roots and drink from mountain brooks.&rdquo; This word lacked faith. I have been serving the Lord for more than forty years, and He never allowed me to eat tree roots or to drink from mountain brooks. I have had many times of poverty, but I have also had more times of abundance. Some people know that the Lord not only cared for my needs but also enabled me to provide funds for many churches to buy land and build meeting halls. Based on my experience I can say assuredly that those who take this way will not starve to death. Some may not have faith, but as long as they have a heart to take this way whether in life or in death, they can take it, because the way of faith is also the way of being placed in death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seeking Guidance and Confirmation<br />
through Prayer to the Lord<br />
and Fellowship with the Saints</h2>
<p>Finally, what should we do practically? Those who have a heart should pray and inquire of the Lord concerning the five aspects of our need. In which aspect should you participate? On one hand, you should contact the Lord concerning whether you should serve full time. On the other hand, you should fellowship with the saints around you and ask them whether the gifts and functions constituted into you through the Lord&rsquo;s grace require you to serve full time. If the answer, after praying and fellowshipping with the saints, is positive, you should fellowship with the leading brothers concerning joining the full-time service.</p>
<p>Based on our experience we feel that this is the safest way. We do not have a rigid rule that once someone serves full time, he must do so his whole life. Full-time service is not like marriage, which cannot be changed except through the death of one party. According to the common work practice today, we can have a two-year trial period. During these two years the serving one or other co-workers will realize whether he is suitable for full-time service. It is not easy for a serving one to change his profession after twenty years.</p>
<p>The Bible shows that it is permissible for a person to take a job after serving full time for a period of time. Paul is an example. He had a great gift and the highest function, but when it was necessary, he worked with his own hands by making tents (Acts 18:3; 20:34). Hence, it is not that those who decide to serve full time cannot change but must serve full time their whole life. Some may have to take a job after a few years.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s Epistles reveal that the churches and the saints were not up to the standard. Hence, Paul had to make tents in order to meet his needs and the needs of his fellow workers. In Acts 20:34 he says, &ldquo;These hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me,&rdquo; and in 1 Corinthians 4:11 and 12 he says, &ldquo;Until the present hour we both hunger and thirst...and wander without a home; and we labor, working with our own hands.&rdquo; I hope that the churches and the saints will follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading. The Lord has blessed Taiwan. Because the average national income is increasing, we need to offer more to the Lord. I trust that the Lord will bless us even more. Then the full-time serving ones will not be forced to take a job because of their living necessities.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Needing the Full-time Serving Ones<br />
to Cooperate with Him</h2>
<p>May we all pray and seek the Lord concerning serving full time and also fellowship with one another so that the Lord may raise up at least thirty full-time serving ones. The need in the work is great; hence, there must be some strong and useful saints who are willing to offer their time, energy, and strength to meet this need. For the first few years of the work in the United States I was the only one serving full time, but now in almost every major church there, the Lord has raised up some to serve Him full time. The burden of the work is so heavy that it cannot be carried out without full-time serving ones. There is such a need.</p>
<p>There are always some saints who must serve full time because the Lord has given them a special work or commission. If these saints do not serve full time, their function will be consumed by other things. Therefore, we must bring this desire to the Lord in prayer. May the Lord raise up many full-time serving ones among us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LIVING OUT OF THE ONE NEW MAN</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider how the Lord created the one new man on the cross and how we should live out this one new man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ON THE CROSS THE LORD SLAYING THE ENMITY<br />
AND ABOLISHING THE ORDINANCES</h2>
<p>Ephesians 2:14-16 says that the Lord Jesus &ldquo;has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace, and might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity by it.&rdquo; The Lord created the one new man in Himself and slew the enmity on the cross. According to the context of these verses, the enmity is the law of the commandments in ordinances. The enmity is related to ordinances, which are the different ways of living among people.</p>
<p>For example, according to the Jewish ordinance, every male must be circumcised eight days after birth (Gen. 17:12). This occurs once in a person&rsquo;s life. The Jews also have to keep the Sabbath every seven days (Exo. 20:8-11). This is observed every week of a person&rsquo;s life. Furthermore, daily what they can and cannot eat must comply with the ordinances of the law. For example, they cannot eat fish that are without fins and scales (Lev. 11:9-12). They can eat birds that feed on seeds, that is, on life, but not birds that feed on carcasses, death (vv. 13-19; cf. Gen. 8:7 and footnote, Recovery Version). Cattle and animals that chew the cud and have a divided hoof are clean and may be eaten (Lev. 11:3). Consequently, camels, which chew the cud but do not have a divided hoof, and pigs, which have a divided hoof but do not chew the cud, are both unclean and may not be eaten (vv. 4, 7). Oxen and sheep chew the cud and have a divided hoof; hence, they are clean and may be eaten. Because of ordinances concerning circumcision, the Sabbath, and dietary regulations, the Jews do not mix with other people. However, according to Ephesians 2:15-16, the Jewish way of living according to the law of the commandments in ordinances was abolished by the Lord Jesus on the cross.</p>
<p>Most Christians know that the Lord Jesus took away the sin of the world on the cross, because John 1:29 says, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; However, concerning the Lord&rsquo;s accomplishments on the cross, the Bible speaks of five things. First, the Lord Jesus took away the sin of the world. Second, He destroyed the devil, who has the might of death (Heb. 2:14). Third, our old man and the flesh were crucified (Rom. 6:6). Fourth, the world has been crucified (Gal. 6:14). Fifth, the Lord Jesus abolished the ordinances (Eph. 2:15). Because we have seen the Lord&rsquo;s accomplishments on the cross, we are being led to advance step by step in our knowledge and experience of the Lord.</p>
<p>When I was saved, I knew only that the Lord took away my sin. One day I read that the Lord Jesus destroyed the devil on the cross. This was the gospel to me, and I received it. Thus, I advanced one step in my knowledge of the Lord. Then I read in another book that my old man was put to death on the cross. I was exceedingly joyful to learn this. I read yet another book that quoted Paul&rsquo;s word in Galatians 6:14: &ldquo;Far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.&rdquo; We do not have to make up our mind to not love the world; the world has been crucified. Why would anyone love the world that was hung on the cross and put to death? I saw a vision that day: the world has been nailed on the cross and can no longer attract me. This is the way that my knowledge and experience of the Lord advanced to another level.</p>
<p>I did not see these facts from reading the Bible myself. When new believers read the Bible, they usually ignore the deeper things, because they cannot understand the deeper things. The fallen human mind is not like fine Chinese paper that absorbs ink as soon as it is applied. The fallen human mind is like glass and marble, which cannot absorb ink. Therefore, regardless of how much we read the Bible, we cannot comprehend it fully. For this reason we need to receive help from the light that others have seen. I hope that this chapter will bring all of us to the fifth level so that we would have the further knowledge of the Lord&rsquo;s abolishing of the ordinances on the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Ordinances and Barriers<br />
Brought In by Our Ways of Living</h2>
<p>Our different ways of living bring in different ordinances that result in barriers between people. Because of their way of living, the Jews cannot associate with Gentiles. Because of differences in their way of living, even people in one county cannot associate with those in another county. In Shantung Province there are three counties: Teng County, Lai County, and Ching County. The people of Teng County will not marry someone from Ching County, and they refuse to eat pancakes because the people of Ching County eat pancakes. The people of Teng County eat large steamed bread but refuse to touch a small pancake. People refuse to associate with one another even concerning something as insignificant as eating.</p>
<p>It is also very difficult for people from northern China to marry those from southern China. The men from northern China consider the southerners as barbaric and will not take them as wives; the women from southern China consider the northerners to be boastful and will not marry them. The northerners despise the southerners for being uncivilized. The northerners always wear socks when they wear shoes, but the southerners wear shoes without socks and are therefore considered uncivilized by the northerners. If a young man from the north marries a young lady from the south, his parents will rebuke him for being rebellious and not following filial piety. Therefore, not only is it difficult for Chinese to marry foreigners, but even marriage between northerners and southerners is extremely difficult. From this we can see the barriers that have been created in human communities due to different ways of living.</p><h2 class="head2">On the Cross the Lord<br />
Abolishing the Ordinances<br />
of Human Living and Religion</h2>
<p>People in Taiwan do not understand the differences between northern and southern Chinese in their ways of living, because Taiwan is like a melting pot that blends together people from different places of China. Many students from Taiwan who study in the United States have married Caucasians or people of other ethnic groups. This is a great blending. People of different races are all blended together in the United States. On the cross the Lord Jesus abolished the ordinances between peoples, slaying the enmity and creating the new man. God is also arranging the environment for people to be blended together. Such environments are for the practical manifestation of the one new man.</p>
<p>In addition to the ordinances created by different ways of living, there are also religious ordinances. For example, some Christians favor baptizing people by immersion, but others insist on baptizing people by sprinkling. This has become an ordinance that separates Christians. Also, the way Christians practice the Lord&rsquo;s table can become an ordinance that divides the believers. We must see that on the cross the Lord abolished all the ordinances, including the ordinances of human living, culture, and religion (Eph. 2:15). The Lord&rsquo;s desire is not only for us to be delivered from sin, the devil, the old man, and the world but also for us to be delivered from ordinances. Being delivered from ordinances does not mean the abolishment of distinctions in position and age. If we did this, there would be confusion and disorder.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ABOLISHING THE ORDINANCES<br />
FOR THE CREATION OF THE ONE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>The Lord has delivered us from sin, the devil, the old man, and the world. He will eventually deliver us from ordinances for the purpose of manifesting us as the one new man. Hence, Ephesians 2:15 says, &ldquo;Abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Intention and Purpose<br />
in Creating Man</h2>
<p>We need light when we read the Bible. God&rsquo;s desire for the one new man was revealed when He created Adam. When God created man, He did not create many people. God created only one man, Adam (Gen. 2:7), but Adam was a corporate man. The Bible says that God created man in His image and according to His likeness (1:26). This means that man is a photograph of God in order to reflect God. God placed this man in a high position. God did not create thousands of men who would reflect him; He created only one man to be His reflection. However, this man was damaged by Satan. Hence, God&rsquo;s purpose to have man as His reflection was foiled. Because the first man, Adam, was damaged, the Lord Jesus came to the earth to be the second man (1 Cor. 15:47) in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s original purpose in creating man. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was the image, the reflection, of God (Col. 1:15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">All Believers Becoming<br />
the One New Man in Christ</h2>
<p>Because we have believed in the Lord Jesus, we have been regenerated in Him to become His reproduction (John 1:12; 3:6; 2 Cor. 3:18). Hence, just as the Lord Jesus is a reflection of God, we should also be a reflection of God. From God&rsquo;s perspective, believers are not individual persons; we are one corporate man. In Christ we are the one new man. Ephesians 4:24 says that the new man &ldquo;was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.&rdquo; Therefore, this new man has replaced the old man as the reflection of God. In the old man, Satan not only utilizes sin to damage man and the world to usurp man, but he also utilizes ways of living to create divisions among men. Hence, there is discord not only between countries, but even people within the same country are separated by differences in their ways of living. As a result, God&rsquo;s purpose in creating man as His reflection has been completely annulled. However, Christ, who is the image of God (2 Cor. 4:4), was incarnated. When we were saved and put into Christ, we became His reproduction. In Christ we have been delivered from sin, the devil, the old man, the flesh, the world, and the ordinances related to different ways of living and have become one new man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>Ephesians 2:15 says that the creation of the new man was accomplished by Christ in Himself, but verse 24 of chapter 4 says that the believers have to put on the new man. Although the creation of the new man has been accomplished, we still need to put on the new man practically. This may be likened to a garment that has been sewn but still must be put on. To put on the new man means to put on the church life. The living that is in human society is the living of the old man; most unsaved people live a befuddled life. Their social life is the old man, but the church life is the new man. When we put on the new man, we put on the church life.</p><h2 class="head1">LIVING OUT THE NEW MAN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Details of the Living<br />
of the New Man in Ephesians</h2>
<p>To put on the new man is to put on the church life, which is to live the church life. However, merely living the church life is not sufficient; we need to go further and live out the new man. This is my burden in this chapter. The new man has been created, and we know that we need to put on the new man, but much more we need to live out the new man. Verse 24 of chapter 4 speaks of putting on the new man. The section from verse 25 through verse 9 of chapter 6 deals with the details of the practical living out of the new man. Verse 25 of chapter 4 says, &ldquo;Having put off the lie, speak truth each one with his neighbor.&rdquo; Verse 1 of chapter 5 says, &ldquo;Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children.&rdquo; Being imitators of God is not the same as monkeys mimicking people. Monkeys do not have the human life, so they can merely mimic people. We can imitate God, however, because we have His life. God is our Father, and we are His beloved children. It is easy for children to imitate their parents because they have their father&rsquo;s life and nature. Since we have the life and nature of our Father God, we can imitate Him and live out His life.</p>
<p>Verses 7 and 8 say, &ldquo;Do not be partakers with them; for you were once darkness but are now light in the Lord; walk as children of light.&rdquo; The word <em>them</em> in verse 7 refers to people in society. We should not be partakers with them, which is to put on the old man. We were once darkness like people in society. However, we are now light in the Lord, so we should walk as children of light. Verse 15 says, &ldquo;Look therefore carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise.&rdquo; The subsequent verses describe how to walk as the wise: by redeeming the time (v. 16), by wives being subject to their husbands (v. 22), by husbands loving their wives (v. 25), by children honoring their parents (6:2-3), by parents nurturing their children in the discipline and admonition of the Lord (v. 4), by slaves being obedient to their masters and serving them with good will (vv. 5-8), and by masters treating their slaves well (v. 9). We are foolish if we do not honor our parents. Likewise, parents are foolish if they do not properly nurture their children. Husbands who do not love their wives and wives who are not subject to their husbands are also foolish. This long section concerns how to live out the new man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Expression of the New Man<br />
Being the Reflection of God</h2>
<p>When we put on the new man and live the church life, we will have the expression of the new man. This expression is not a matter of being angels or of shouting Hallelujah and Amen daily. The expression of the new man is a real human being. Man was created according to God&rsquo;s image in order to be God&rsquo;s reflection. The intrinsic element of the created human nature is close to God&rsquo;s nature. Confucius said that the way of great learning is to develop the &ldquo;bright virtue,&rdquo; the bright and shining moral virtue, which is the conscience in the human spirit. The bright virtue is also the &ldquo;innate knowledge and ability&rdquo; taught by Wang Yang-ming, a Chinese philosopher of the Ming Dynasty. Zachariah 12:1 says that when God created the heavens and the earth, He also created a spirit within man. Proverbs 20:27 says, &ldquo;The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, / Searching all the innermost parts of the inner being.&rdquo; The spirit of man is the lamp of God within man, and it has the function of the conscience, enabling man to reflect God. This function is not found in birds or animals. For this reason people say that a person who does not act according to his conscience is the same as an animal.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that the human spirit has been damaged by Satan. Nonetheless, this organ is still in man. Even if a person is deep in sin, his conscience will still tell him whether his behavior is proper. Honoring one&rsquo;s parents does not come from teaching. When a person grows up and becomes familiar with human affairs, he spontaneously has the feeling to honor his parents. This feeling comes from his conscience. The Chinese sages taught people to develop the conscience using their innate human ability. However, man&rsquo;s conscience has been damaged. Therefore, even though it still has a little brightness, it is deficient.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit of a Regenerated Person<br />
Having the Righteousness<br />
and Holiness of the Reality of God</h2>
<p>The spirit of man, which is the lamp of Jehovah, was damaged when man fell. This lamp is lit at the time of a person&rsquo;s regeneration. Regeneration is to have another life enter into us. This life is the life of God. This divine life enters into us with the divine nature to be our life so that our spirit can be regenerated. This is spoken of in Ephesians 4:24. The new man was created according to God, and in the new man there are the righteousness and holiness of the reality. Righteousness is to be according to God&rsquo;s ways, and holiness is to be according to God&rsquo;s nature. This means that the new man created by God is the same as God in His ways and in His nature. If we have God&rsquo;s ways and nature, we will reflect God.</p>
<p>Hence, what a regenerated person lives out does not originate from the innate knowledge and ability of his natural life but from the divine life and nature that he obtained through regeneration. As regenerated people participating in the new man, we need to live out this most excellent life. God did not say that a believer should separate himself from his community or from his family. Sakyamuni taught people to become buddhas, and Taoism teaches people to become immortals. However, the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is for us to be real humans reflecting Christ. After man fell, God came to regenerate man and recover man so that man might be uplifted. Confucius taught people to be proper by developing and enhancing the bright virtue within the limits of man&rsquo;s innate ability. However, the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is for man to have God&rsquo;s life and thus be uplifted. For example, all human beings have a God-created desire to honor their parents. Even before we were saved, we had this desire. Confucius&rsquo;s teachings are principles concerning human relationships that tell people to develop and enhance the bright virtue within man. Such teachings are good. However, the day that we heard the gospel and believed in the Lord Jesus, our being was uplifted, and our respect and love for our parents deepened. This is the result of God&rsquo;s life entering into us.</p>
<p>We must admit that we sometimes still live out our fallen nature even though we are saved. A sister might feel that her mother is lovable, but when her mother does or says something displeasing, the sister will glare angrily at her mother. However, because the sister is a Christian, she will not have peace in her conscience and will ask the Lord for His forgiveness and the cleansing of His blood. Furthermore, she will confess her mistake to her mother and may even cry. Many of us can testify that after believing in the Lord, our humanity was uplifted. This uplifting did not come from teaching, nor is it the result of our endeavor. Rather, the divine life has entered into us and uplifted our humanity. This is the living out of the new man as described in Ephesians.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICAL LIVING OF THE NEW MAN<br />
AND THE SPREAD OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>The revelation concerning the new man in Ephesians is high, but Paul&rsquo;s words concerning the practical living of the new man do not seem so high. For example, 4:28 says, &ldquo;He who steals should steal no more.&rdquo; Some may think that this word is quite low. However, if we examine ourselves, we will admit that we all have stolen something. Husbands often steal from their wives, and wives frequently steal from their husbands. Elementary-school students steal chalk from schools or pencils from their classmates. Stealing is prevalent in this world. Nearly every person has stolen something. For this reason, after giving a high revelation concerning the new man, Paul had to say, &ldquo;He who steals should steal no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because we are regenerated, the feeling of our conscience is uplifted and more sensitive. The conscience of a Christian is higher than that of an ordinary human being because the divine life is in us. If we have the testimony of living out the divine life before our parents, siblings, and relatives, our parents may disagree with our believing in Jesus, but eventually they will realize that we have changed. Our parents will even testify of our living to our relatives. This is a preaching of the gospel, not with words but through our living out of the new man. Such a testimony is powerful.</p>
<p>After I was saved, no one taught me how to behave, but the divine life working in me caused me to love the Lord, to read the Bible, and to pray. At that time I was nineteen years old, four years older than my brother. Formerly, we loved to play and have fun. However, after I was saved, I loved to pray and read the Bible instead of playing. I did not advise or exhort my younger brother to follow me, nor did I preach the gospel and testify to him. However, when he saw that I was praying and reading the Bible every day, he began to read the Bible too. As a result, he was also saved. Because I changed, he also changed. Consequently, my mother believed in the Lord. Formerly, regardless of how she disciplined us, she could not subdue us; we were young, strong, and fun-loving boys. However, she was amazed that we began to love to read the Bible and to pray rather than playing and making trouble. Consequently, my mother was also saved. We need such a living and testimony today. We should not only preach the gospel verbally; we should show forth a change in our living. We must live out the new man in our daily life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Preaching of the Gospel<br />
Needing the Living Out of the New Man</h2>
<p>Ephesians reveals a high vision of the Lord creating the new man and of our putting on the new man. Following this vision is the crucial matter of the living out of the new man. On one hand, the new man is universal; on the other hand, the new man is uplifted. The old man is low, but the new man is noble. Because we are the new man, our living must be higher than those who are not part of the new man. The living of the new man is to put off the old man and to continually put on the new man. Because we have put on the new man, we need to live out the new man. In order for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony to spread out from Taiwan, we need to begin to labor in the schools. Taiwan has many schools. Every school is a fishpond, and the young saints who are students are fishermen. These students should seize the good opportunity to fish and should also have the reality, the living, and the testimony of the new man. If every school has some brothers and sisters who put on the new man and live out the new man, a flourishing and glorious situation will be manifested.</p>
<p>The young working saints should receive a burden to go to small towns and work as elementary and middle-school teachers by putting on the new man and living out the new man. Then the gospel will be readily and widely accepted by the people in these small towns. If the children in the schools accept the gospel, they will influence their parents. When the parents observe that the saints have extraordinary character, speech, and conduct, they will inwardly acknowledge that the saints are noble. However, if the living of the saints who go to preach the gospel in small towns is a mess and their living, speech, and conduct are worse than that of an average young person, then our testimony will be annulled.</p>
<p>Those who go to the small towns should not be in a hurry to preach the gospel to people. Instead, they should first live out the life of the new man and let people see that they are different from other teachers. Then the people in the town will realize that our difference is because Jesus is in us, and they will be convinced. If we preach Jesus without living out the new man, our preaching will be ineffective, and we might incur others&rsquo; antipathy. This will be the result if our living is inferior to the living of those who pursue Buddhism and Taoism. Instead of being anxious to put up signboards concerning Jesus, we must first put on the new man and live out the new man.</p>
<p>Similarly, those of you who are young people should not preach to your parents merely with words. If you rush to the meeting hall every day but still live the life of the old man, you will be unsuccessful at convincing others and will also damage the testimony of the Lord. If you live out the life of the new man, your parents will eventually be convinced and sense that you have changed. When they inquire about the reason for your change, you can testify that your change is the issue of believing in the Lord Jesus. Because of their traditions and customs, they may not be able to immediately accept the Lord Jesus; they may even scold you. There is no need to argue, however, because with time they will have a change of heart. In the end you will win their heart, and they will admit that you are noble because you have more love for them and are more considerate toward them. However, this is not your work; it is the Lord Jesus who has worked this out in you. If you have such a testimony, your parents, siblings, and relatives will accept the gospel one by one. If you have such a testimony, you can lead three or five people to be saved every year and produce clusters of fruit.</p>
<p>Because I have traveled to many places in the world and contacted all kinds of people, I can say that the Chinese people have been kept by the Lord. Not many Chinese are superstitious. Although many people in Taiwan observe festivals, they are not very superstitious. The Chinese are practical. First, they pay attention to making a living so that they may live peacefully, dress comfortably, and dwell securely. Second, they pay attention to education or learning a skill so that they may make a living. Third, they pay attention to relationships and to ethics. These are good Chinese traditions. If someone becomes rich but does not honor his parents or is not generous to his siblings, he will be despised. It is easy for the Chinese to accept the gospel because they are very practical-minded and care about making a living, education, and ethics. As long as we have a good testimony before men and they see that we are studious and have good conduct, they will acknowledge that our humanity is uplifted. The way for us to preach the gospel in Taiwan is to put on the new man and live out the new man. Our parents, siblings, relatives, schoolmates, and neighbors are observing our conduct. If we live out the new man, we will be able to bear clusters of fruit. I believe that every young person can easily lead two or three persons to salvation each semester. This depends on whether the young people have the living of the new man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Constantly Fellowshipping<br />
with the Lord and with the Saints,<br />
Loving One Another, and Living Out<br />
the Testimony of the New Man</h2>
<p>God has created the new man, and we can put on the new man in the church, but we need the grace to live out the new man. Our will cannot achieve this, for to will is present with us, but to work out the good is not (Rom. 7:18). Hence, we should not make up our mind to live out the new man. The Lord&rsquo;s grace is sufficient for us (2 Cor. 12:9). If we fellowship often with the Lord and with the brothers and sisters, we will spontaneously live out Christ&rsquo;s excellent virtues from our spirit. This is the living of the new man. This is what the Lord is after today.</p>
<p>Four aspects of education are promoted in the schools: moral education, intellectual education, physical education, and social education. Although there is an aspect of social education in schools, many people cannot work in a group. In the church we do not need to teach how to work in a group, because in Christ we have become one group. When the young brothers and sisters take care of one another and love one another, their parents, siblings, schoolmates, and friends will be convinced by observing the excellent virtues that the young people exhibit as a group. These virtues are lived out by the saints putting on the new man and living out the new man. The new man is not many individual persons; it is a corporate man in Christ. This new man is the church, which is different from a social living. Society is dark, but the church is full of light. This is the testimony of the new man. The new man is a lamp shining in darkness. Many of our relatives and friends are in the darkness of society, but they will be drawn near to this brightly shining lamp, and the church will spontaneously have increase.</p></body></html>
