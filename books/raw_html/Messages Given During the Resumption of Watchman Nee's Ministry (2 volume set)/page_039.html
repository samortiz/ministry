<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINETEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THREE KINDS OF LIVES<br>AND THREE KINDS OF LIVING</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONFERENCE (4)</H1><p>Date:Evening, January 10, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</p><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THREE KINDS OF LIVES</H2><P>Last night we saw the four laws in Romans 7 and 8. Tonight, we will go on to see the three kinds of histories that go on within a saved person. First, man is a created being. Later man fell, and he became a fallen being. After he is saved, he becomes a saved person. When man was created, he had the created life. After the fall, he inherited the satanic life. After he is saved, he received God's life.</P><P>The human life is created by God, and it is good. Hence, the law within man is good. After man fell, the life he inherited came from the evil one. Hence, the law that came with it is an evil law. After man is saved, the life he received came from God. As a result, the law that came with that life is also of God. Now, man has become a complicated mixture. If I ask who you are, it will be difficult for you to answer. If you ask who I am, it will be difficult for me to answer also. Within me there is God, there is the devil, and there is also man. Within man there are three elements: the element of God, the element of the devil, and the element of man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THREE KINDS OF LIVING</H2><P>When some hear us saying that within man is the devil, they do not feel comfortable. But I have to ask this: Is there hatred in man? If there is, this hatred is surely not created by God. Surely hatred comes from the devil. We know that it is not good to lose our temper, but we lose our temper involuntarily. What is sin? The sin mentioned in Romans 5 to 8 does not refer to the acts of sins, but to a living entity. There it says that sin dwells in man. A lifeless thing cannot dwell in man. It also says that sin reigns and takes hold of us to do what we do not want to do. What we do is not of our own will, but is done by the sin that dwells within us. This proves that sin is a living thing. When Satan entered into man's life, it became sin. In the Old Testament, after the Israelites were bitten by the fiery serpents, they became poisoned with the serpents' poison. In the same way, after man fell, he inherited Satan's life.</P><P>The question today is this: By which life are we going to live? Are we going to live by the original life, the satanic evil life, or the life of God? To be a Christian is not to be an evil person, nor to be a good person. The Christian standard is not good or evil. To take good and evil as the standard is to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THREE KINDS OF GOOD</H2><P>The Bible mentions three kinds of good. The first kind is the good that was there when man was created. The life that man received at the time of creation was a good life. Hence, the law within that life is also good. The second kind of good is the good of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The life that Satan put within man causes him to sin, on the one hand, and to do good, on the other hand. A fallen man can also be humble. A proud man offends God, but a humble man offends God even more. To honor one's parents is good, but Satan instigates man to oppose God and ignore God through his honoring of his parents. This good therefore comes from the satanic life. The third kind of good is that which is produced by the life of God. This kind of good transcends man's original good. Many people cannot distinguish between these three kinds of good in the New Testament. The good works described in Ephesians 2 are different from the good which one wills to do in Romans 7. The good in Romans 7 refers to the good that was there when we were created. The good works in Ephesians 2 refer to the good that is God's life living through the Christians.</P>
