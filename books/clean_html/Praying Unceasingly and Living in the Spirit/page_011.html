<h2 class="head1">EARNESTLY PRACTICING TO LIVE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Someone once asked me, &ldquo;What do you pray for in your daily prayer time?&rdquo; I told him that I pray, &ldquo;Lord, remind me to live in the spirit. Remind me that You and I are one spirit. Remind me to speak and think in the spirit. I agree to think in the spirit and to speak in the spirit.&rdquo; I can testify that His grace is upon me. Hence, even though I rarely sin, I confess my sin every day. I confess the sin of not living in the spirit. Sometimes, immediately after talking with my wife, I say, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me. I just spoke a word of love to my wife, but I was not in my spirit. Lord, have mercy on me.&rdquo; By so doing, I turn to the spirit. My focus is not on the committing of sins but on the use of my mingled spirit. A stone does not sin, but God does not want stones that do not sin; He wants man to live in the spirit.</p>
<p>If we would see that God wants us to live in our spirit, we would care about whether we are in the spirit in our daily living, not about right and wrong. If I am in the spirit, I will not be bothered whether people say that I am right or that I am wrong; instead, I will say Hallelujah. If I am not in the spirit, my words may seem to be full of love, power, and holiness, and I might be praised by all, but I will still need to confess my sin and ask the Lord to forgive me because my words were not in the spirit; they were merely human words.</p>
<p>I have been in elders&rsquo; meetings in which at first I did not speak, because the Spirit was not present. However, because I knew the elders well, I would speak, and the elders would appreciate my words. They would even say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, your words are a great help to us. We have seen light and received the benefit.&rdquo; They did not know that afterward I had to confess to the Lord because I spoke from myself instead of from the spirit.</p>
<p>Those who are experienced know that a person can speak concerning spiritual things but not be in the spirit. We can talk about human things and about divine things without speaking from the spirit. My mouth may be full of the word of God, but I may not be in the spirit. A well-spoken message does not necessarily supply people. At best, a well-spoken message can open a person&rsquo;s mind and give him understanding. However, understanding is one thing, and receiving an inward supply is another.</p>
<p>I want people to not only understand what I say but to also touch life. When I speak, I want the Spirit to touch their spirit. The secret of being an elder is the Spirit touching others&rsquo; spirit. This is not so easy to practice. First Timothy 4:7 says, &ldquo;Exercise yourself unto godliness.&rdquo; To exercise oneself unto godliness is to exercise the spirit. We need to exercise to let the Spirit touch others&rsquo; spirit.</p>
<p>We must constantly practice to do things in our spirit. We should not speak if our words are not in the spirit, we should not entertain thoughts that are not in the spirit, and we should not express an opinion if it is not in the spirit. We should also study with our spirit. This practice is quite difficult and requires us to be exercised because besides our spirit, we also have two very active parts: our body and our soul. Unbelievers live either in the body or in the soul. They do not live in the spirit. As believers, we are often better than unbelievers, but we also live in our soul instead of in our spirit. The Lord desires that we would live in the spirit and walk according to the spirit so that the righteous requirement of the law would be fulfilled in us (Rom. 8:4). A common mistake among believers is that we only care for doctrine concerning the Spirit and statements in the Bible concerning the Spirit. However, we need to practice living in the spirit and walking according to the spirit moment by moment.</p>
<p>In order to live and to walk in the spirit, we must pray. For many years I thought that I knew how to pray unceasingly. But now I realize that to pray unceasingly is to exercise the spirit. If we do not pray, we are not in the spirit. To stop praying can be compared to turning off the light switch. When we pray, we turn on the switch. Ephesians 6:18 says, &ldquo;Praying at every time in spirit.&rdquo; Only prayer can keep us living in the spirit. Therefore, we need to practice to not do anything without prayer.</p>
<p>We must realize the glorious fact that we are saved. True salvation is our spirit joined to God and His Spirit living in our spirit. This is regeneration. Prayer keeps us abiding in the spirit, which is to abide in Christ. To abide in Christ is to remain in the spirit. The Triune God has been processed to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is the true vine, and this Spirit is in us. Hence, when we remain in the Spirit, we remain in the vine. This is what the Lord desires.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING IN THE SPIRIT BEING OUR CONTENT</h2>
<p>The way that we are taking is right, and the ground that we stand on is also right, but our content is not solid, because we are short of living in the spirit. The saints need to live in the spirit. I believe that if some saints would live in the spirit every day, the Lord would come back, because this is what He desires.</p>
<p>Because of the turmoil among the churches in the United States, over the past few years I have had a turn before the Lord. Although my ministry never deviated from the Spirit, my valuation of the Spirit and of life has greatly increased. Therefore, in message after message I am telling the saints to live in the spirit and to live out life. The work may propagate throughout the United States, but if we are not in the spirit and in life, there will be no benefit to the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. The Lord is not after the propagation of the work or an increase in the number of saints. He wants a group of people living in the spirit and living out the divine life in a genuine way. This does not mean that we should not develop or propagate but that our development and propagation should be like a vine that grows and bears fruit spontaneously. Our development and propagation should be the outflow of life and the expression of life.</p>
<p>We have seen that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the recovery of &ldquo;one city, one church.&rdquo; Although this is true, this ground must have content. Our content is our living in the spirit, living out Christ. Without this content our testimony is empty, and the Lord will not have a way. Our ground must be right, our way must be right, and our content must be solid, but we are short of content. To shout that we are living Christ is mere doctrine. If we do not touch the Spirit, there is no experience of living Christ, because the Christ whom we live out is the Spirit. If we live in the spirit, we will live out Christ practically. Therefore, we must practice to live in the spirit every day. The Lord is the Spirit. He is the Triune God who has been processed to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit in order to live in our spirit. We need to remain in our spirit so that we may fellowship with Him and live Him out. This is our present need. Holiness is to live in the spirit, spirituality is to live in the spirit, victory is to live in the spirit, and the church is to live in the spirit. Living in the spirit produces the reality of the church, which is a miniature of the New Jerusalem and the testimony of the Lord. Living in the spirit will bring the Lord back.</p>
