 <h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2>
<p>Light never waits for man! We should go to the Lord and beg like those who beg for bread. We should never presume that we have it already. This is a very serious thing. We have to see the seriousness of this matter before the Lord. We have to see that God has His work on earth today. The line of God&rsquo;s work has never stopped; it is forever going on. Those who have eyes will see the line of God&rsquo;s work; they will know what God is doing today. Once we stumble, we will fall behind and will not see. Once a man is prejudiced, he will not see. If twenty years ago we were behind in what God was doing then, we can only be further behind today. We should never allow ourselves to be left outside this line. This is the reason we have to humble ourselves. One thing is certain: God is going on now. He is going on step by step. We should be those who follow Him year after year. If the Lord will keep us in a spirit of humility and meekness, we will touch something. But if we are proud, arrogant, and self-justifying, we will find ourselves set aside by God. If we are willing to be a proper audience of the word, that is, if we are willing to receive the word and not give resistance to God&rsquo;s word, we will touch something in the ministry, and God&rsquo;s blessings and light will shine on us. Some, however, have already fallen by the wayside! May the Lord be merciful to us so that we will humble ourselves before Him.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4 tells us that the church will arrive at the fullness of perfection. It seems that God is raising up the standard of His own ministry today. Some have touched higher things; these are not ordinary things. But some have to wait for ten or twenty more years before they know or touch these higher things. Many things can only be seen after a period of time, and we are still quite a distance from them. We have to ask for God&rsquo;s mercy so that we will see something solid and real. May the Lord grant His church the ministry, and may we learn the lessons that we should learn.</p>
