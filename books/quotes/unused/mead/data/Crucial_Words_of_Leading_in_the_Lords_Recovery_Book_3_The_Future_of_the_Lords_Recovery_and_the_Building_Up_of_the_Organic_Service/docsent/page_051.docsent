   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Leading and Managing the Small Groups</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church in Taipei of approximately six hundred saints has been formed into districts by joining fifty or so small groups together.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we want the condition of every small group to be the same, every saint to be equal, and every household to be alike, the co-workers need to advance this practice among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The full-time co-workers are not here to lead the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They should exercise to advance the practice of the groups in every district.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every district probably needs four to six co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before the full-time co-workers encourage the saints to be in the group meetings, there is a need for training.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We now have saints who have consecrated themselves to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They can be compared to newly recruited soldiers who need training.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot arm newly recruited soldiers with rifles and send them off to war without training them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If they do not know how to hold their weapons properly, they will lose whatever battles they fight.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, we need to plan a training program so that we can train the saints, just as soldiers are trained.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to train the saints in such things as how to use the Bible, how to speak the word, and how to care for people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All these matters require training.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church in Taipei has already been divided into more than four hundred small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These groups can be formed into eight districts of approximately fifty groups each.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If every district should have four co-workers, we need at least thirty-two co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These co-workers must serve full time; otherwise, they will not have the time to encourage the saints to practice the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The full-time co-workers should bring business to the fifty small groups in a district.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A co-worker can be compared to a manager who is over several stores.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the stores do not make a profit, it would be better for them to shut their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The full-time co-workers must bring business to the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even though every group meeting is coordinated by the saints, if they do not know what to do when they come together, they will sit and look at one another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Someone may eventually suggest that they sing a hymn, but the saints do not know which hymn to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After two or three of such meetings, I am afraid that the coordinators will be absent from the meetings; the saints will not come, because they will feel that such meetings are a waste of time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this reason, the co-workers need to give the saints business and help them run their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The co-workers can gather the six hundred saints and tell them what to do in a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must encourage the saints not to worry but to invite people to the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should tell them that we guarantee that everyone will be fed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Of course, we cannot merely say these things without keeping our promise.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every co-worker must prepare material to help the saints do business.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For this reason, it is a great responsibility to form the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The co-workers should train the full-time serving ones by having them serve with them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The co-workers can be compared to leaders in an army, who lead the soldiers in their squads.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The squad leaders must take the lead to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Encouraging the Service of the Small Groups</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The co-workers who help the small groups in the districts should encourage all the saints until every household is preaching the gospel and every saint is serving and functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This type of encouraging requires some ability.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If after one year of serving a co-worker is unable to help the saints in this way, we should consider whether or not he should continue to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In today s society, people who work for corporations must be competitive and do their best to improve; otherwise, they will not have a future.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even preachers hired in denominations are under a contract system.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who are employed by contract must produce results; otherwise, when their contract expires, their employer will not hire them again.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The full-timers among us should not think that they have a secure job or that they do not need to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is not appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Doctors in America must take an exam at least once every two years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even if they have their own clinics, they still have to take an exam.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If they do not pass, they lose their license.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even if they have been practicing medicine for more than twenty-five years, they must still take an exam.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is because medicine in America is improving daily.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One s experience is not the sole basis of his qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even a doctor who graduates from a famous medical school must keep up with the advances in medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, numerous government agencies in America hold examinations for their employees every few years.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If an employee cannot pass the examination, he will not get a promotion, and he might even lose his job.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, the ones preparing to serve full time must be trained, and after they have served for some time, they should be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They will be tested on their performance in the training and on the effectiveness and result of their service.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some saints might ask whether it is scriptural to do such things and whether Paul ever gave Timothy a test.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Several verses indicate that Paul expected those who served with him to be effective 1 Tim 3:15; 4:15; 6:14, 20; 2 Tim 2:2-7; 3:10, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On one hand, we need to be trained, and on the other hand, we need some testing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>People should not need to feel a whip before they make progress.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There are many things for the full-timers to do.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Two to three hundred full-timers might not be enough to encourage the saints who meet regularly in the church in Taipei to function.</S>
