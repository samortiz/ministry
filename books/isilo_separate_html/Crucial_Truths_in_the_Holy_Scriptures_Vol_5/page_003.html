<p>The third aspect of the reward is to obtain authority. This also is a promise from the Lord Himself.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;To him I will give authority over the nations; and he will shepherd them with an iron rod&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 2:26-27).</p>
<p>This reward will be given to believers who overcome by obeying the Lord&rsquo;s commandments to the uttermost. During this time of desolation in the church and opposition from the world, some believers will steadfastly obey the Lord&rsquo;s commandments and become overcomers. When the Lord comes to rule the world, He will give them authority over the nations, and they will rule and exercise authority with Him.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Have authority over ten cities&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 19:17).</p>
<p>In the future the Lord will reward those who work faithfully for Him today. He will give them authority over ten cities.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Reigning</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, the fourth aspect of the reward is to reign.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;We will also reign with Him&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 2:12).</p>
<p>If we suffer hardships for the Lord and endure them today, we will reign with Him. This is a reward that the Lord will give us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Reign with Him for a thousand years&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:6).</p>
<p>All those who have faithfully witnessed for the Lord throughout the ages, even to the extent of being martyred for Him, will reign with Him for a thousand years and rule the nations during the millennial kingdom. This is a reward that the Lord will give in the future.</p>
<p>The reigning aspect of the reward shows that the preceding aspects of obtaining the crown, of being enthroned, and of obtaining authority are all related to reigning, because a king must have a crown, a throne, and authority. The Lord rewards overcomers with a crown, a throne, and authority to reward them with reigning.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being a Priest</h2>
<p>The fifth aspect of the reward is to be a priest. This also is revealed in the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Priests of God and of Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:6).</p>
<p>Those who faithfully witness for the Lord today, even to the extent of giving up their lives for Him, not only will reign with the Lord but also will be priests of God and of Christ. In the millennial kingdom the Lord will give them double honor and qualify them to be both a king and a priest. To be a king is to represent God to man and to bring God&rsquo;s authority to man; to be a priest is to represent man to God and to bring man&rsquo;s service to God. To be a king is to participate in God&rsquo;s ruling, carrying out God&rsquo;s administration; to be a priest is to participate in God&rsquo;s life, obtaining God Himself and enjoying the greatest blessing in the universe&mdash;God Himself. The Lord will give these two honorable blessings to the overcoming believers in the future.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REQUIREMENTS FOR OBTAINING THE REWARD</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Righteousness&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:8).</p>
<p>Although the Lord saves us according to grace, He will reward us according to righteousness. We can freely obtain God&rsquo;s salvation by grace, but we must pay a high price to obtain God&rsquo;s reward according to righteousness. God&rsquo;s grace does not require us to do anything, and it is freely given; however, God&rsquo;s reward requires us to expend our strength and to pay a price in order to receive it.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;According to his own labor&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 3:8).</p>
<p>The Lord will reward us according to our own labor and His righteousness. After our salvation, if our labor before the Lord is of gold, silver, and precious stones, the Lord will reward us. However, if our labor is of wood, grass, or stubble, the Lord will not only refuse to reward us but will also cause us to suffer loss.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;To each one as his work is&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 22:12).</p>
<p>In the future the Lord will reward us according to the true condition of our work. Although we do not need works to be saved, we need works for the reward. However, whether or not we obtain the Lord&rsquo;s reward depends upon the Lord&rsquo;s assessment and pleasure with our works. The extent of our reward will be determined by the extent of the Lord&rsquo;s pleasure with our works.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Love your enemies, and do good and lend, expecting nothing in return&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 6:35).</p>
<p>The Lord will reward us even for works such as loving our enemy, doing good, and lending without expecting anything in return.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Work from the soul as to the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 3:23).</p>
<p>The Lord will reward us for working faithfully even for those who are our masters according to the flesh.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Gives to one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 10:42).</p>
<p>We will receive a reward for the seemingly insignificant deed of giving a believer a cup of cold water.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Give alms...in secret&rdquo;; &ldquo;Enter into your private room, and shut your door and pray&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 6:3-4, 6).</p>
<p>We will be rewarded for our righteous acts, including giving alms, offering money, and praying, as long as they are done secretly before God and not in an open way to obtain praise from men.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Preach the gospel...of my own will&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 9:16-17).</p>
<p>If we preach the gospel for the Lord out of our own will, we will receive a reward.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;Run in this way&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 9:24).</p>
<p>In a track meet, those who run the race run in order to obtain the prize. After we are saved, we also must run in the Lord&rsquo;s way in order to be rewarded by the Lord. Running in this way is a requirement for obtaining the reward.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;Do not cast away therefore your boldness, which has great reward&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 10:35).</p>
<p>We will obtain the reward if we have boldness in following the Lord in His way.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;Unless he contends lawfully&rdquo;; &ldquo;Everyone who contends exercises self-control&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 2:5; 1 Cor. 9:25).</p>
<p>If we want to obtain the Lord&rsquo;s reward, we must act according to the Lord&rsquo;s regulations, have self-control, and be restricted in everything. This is an indispensable requirement for us to obtain the reward.</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;When they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me...your reward is great in the heavens&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 5:11-12).</p>
<p>If we are reproached, persecuted, and evilly spoken of for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, we will be rewarded, and the reward will be great.</p>
<p><strong>13. &ldquo;Faithful unto death&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 2:10).</p>
<p>If we are faithful to the Lord unto death and do not care for our life, we will obtain a reward from the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>14. &ldquo;Overcomes&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 3:21).</p>
<p>Overcoming spontaneously causes us to obtain the reward, so it is a requirement for being rewarded.</p>
<p><strong>15. &ldquo;Those who have loved His appearing&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:8).</p>
<p>Diligent students are happy on the day of a big test because if they do well on the test, they will receive a reward. In contrast, lazy students are afraid of a test. In the same way, those who love the Lord and have given up everything for Him love His appearing because they will receive a reward from Him; those who do not love the Lord but love the world and sin will be afraid of the Lord&rsquo;s coming. Thus, loving the Lord&rsquo;s appearing is a proof that we love the Lord and live for Him today; therefore, this is a requirement for obtaining the reward.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
