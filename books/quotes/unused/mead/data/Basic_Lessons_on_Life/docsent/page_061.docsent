   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Romans 8 reveals the divine life dispensed into the three parts of man.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 2a speaks of the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 6b says that the mind set on the spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 10 says that if Christ is in us, the body is dead but the spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then verse 11 says that the Spirit of the One who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life to our mortal body through His Spirit who indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, verse 2 speaks of the divine life, verse 10 says that our spirit is life, verse 6 says our mind can be life, and verse 11 says that even our body may be given life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 8 speaks of God, verse 9 of the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ, and verse 10 of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to read these verses to the saints to show them that the Triune God is dispensed into the three parts of man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While we are reading, it is always profitable to point out the crucial points in every verse.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I. THE DIVINE LIFE A. The Spirit of Life</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Romans 8:2 speaks of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"The Spirit of life" is a phrase of apposition, and actually means that the Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Bible there are a number of phrases like this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the Bible says "the Spirit of God," that means the Spirit is God; when the Bible says "the life of God," that means the life is God; when the Bible says "the Spirit of Christ," that means the Spirit is Christ; and when the Bible says "the love of God," that means love is God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, we know that if there is no Spirit of God, surely there is no life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Revelation 22:1 there is a picture of the river of the water of life, and that river is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This river flows out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This shows how God in Christ as the Spirit flows Himself into His redeemed people to be their life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The river is the flow of life; it is life in motion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is like the current of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, the current itself is electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not something separate from electricity; it is electricity itself in motion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When electricity flows and is in motion, that is the current of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The current of electricity can be compared to the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit of life means the Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Spirit is life in motion, the Triune God in motion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>B. In Christ Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This life is of the Spirit and is also in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Romans 8:2 speaks of the Spirit of life "in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The phrase "in Christ Jesus" is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I believe this phrase will need eternity for us to understand adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today we understand a little.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But when we enter into eternity, we will be freed from so many limitations, and then we will realize what it means to be in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In giving such a message, you have to define who Christ is and who Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The constituents of these two titles are profound.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have a life that is in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The life is in such a One who is not only God and the Spirit but who is also Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ Jesus, this wonderful person, is constituted with many excellent elements.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is the One who has divinity and humanity, who has passed through so many processes, and who has accomplished so much.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The life we are enjoying today is a life in such a realm and sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This realm and this sphere are an unlimited person, Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Romans 8:2 the Spirit of life is in Christ Jesus, not in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The life is in Christ and it traces back from Christ to Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to let the saints know that "in Christ Jesus" is not an empty term.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If it were an empty term, Paul would not use it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Surely this means a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must tell the saints that the very divine life today is not only of the Spirit but is also in such a marvelous, unlimited person as its realm, its sphere.</S>
