   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TIME OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is the most crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although the Bible says that the Lord Jesus once offered up the sacrifice for sins, it points out that "having offered one sacrifice for sins, He sat down forever..."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Heb 10:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word "one" means that the Lord's sacrifice for sins was perfect; He only needed to redeem man from sins once.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, this sacrifice for sins is forever.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is an eternal sacrifice for sins!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that not only is the effect of this sacrifice for sins eternal, but the sacrifice itself is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although Christ has resurrected and is living forever, it seems that His cross continues to exist!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>May we realize the timelessness of the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not a past event of nineteen hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It remains fresh today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Revelation 13:8 says, "The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our Lord is the slain Lamb from the foundation of the world until now and forever.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To Him, the cross is not merely an event of a certain time, on a certain date of a certain month of a certain year.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, it is something that has existed since the foundation of the world until now.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When He created man, He already foreknew the price of the coming redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He created man with His power.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the same way He redeemed man with His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is as if He was crucified from the beginning when He created man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For thousands of years He suffered the prolonged suffering of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The one death on Golgotha merely signified the grief God's Spirit had borne for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What grace this is!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What wonder this is!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have no words to express the meaning of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before the Lord Jesus left heaven, and while He was still in glory, He knew the suffering of the cross already.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He knew during the thousands of years before He came.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He knew this at the time of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since eternity past, the cross has been in God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we consider how in eternity past God knew that He was to create man and that man would become fallen, we realize how His heart, humanly speaking, must have grieved over it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because He so loved men, He ordained before the foundation of the world that Christ would die on our behalf 1 Pet 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although Christ only appeared once in the last times for our sins, through His love for the world He has been grieving and aching since the foundation of the world, as if He has been crucified a thousand times already!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What a pity that many people are now still grieving Him, as if crucifying Him afresh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we realize such love of His, we cannot help but marvel and stand in awe before Him!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is God's heart!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we realize this, will we not love God all the more?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, humanly speaking, those in the Old Testament believed in a coming cross, while those in the New Testament believe in a past cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually, there is no distinction of time and period.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The cross of the Old Testament is a present one, and the cross of the New Testament is also a present one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May the Lord open our eyes to see that the cross is timeless.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE ETERNAL FRESHNESS OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those in the Old Testament have died.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We shall, therefore, pay attention only to those in the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many people push the cross back nineteen hundred years and consider it as old, outdated, and obsolete.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although it is true that world history considers Christ's Golgotha a historical event, in the believers' spiritual experience the cross of Christ is still a fresh event.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not old, outdated, or obsolete.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can consider a few verses.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hebrews 10:19 and 20 say, "Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to understand these two verses, we have to understand the things mentioned in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the ancient times, the tabernacle was divided into two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first section was called the Holy Place, and the second section was called the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The two sections were divided by a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those entering the Holy of Holies had to pass through the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God's glory was manifested within the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No ordinary person could enter the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only the high priest could enter it once a year.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Before he entered it, he had to first offer sacrifices and make atonement for himself and the people and had to go in with the blood of bulls and goats.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For us now, we enter the Holy of Holies through the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This signifies the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Formerly the high priest entered the Holy of Holies only once a year.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now, through the cross of the Lord Jesus we can enter the Holy of Holies any time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What is the meaning of entering the Holy of Holies?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It means that we can come to God to confess our sins, fellowship with Him, and be in His presence.</S>
