<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>PRACTICING THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY<br>AND BEING RESCUED FROM<br>THE PAPAL AND CLERGY-LAITY SYSTEMS</H1><P>Over the course of the past seven and a half years, I have nearly exhausted sharing concerning the truth of the God-ordained way. In this training, I do not want to repeat what I have already shared in the past. The verses in the Scripture concerning the God-ordained way have been repeatedly quoted to us again and again. I still have a heavy burden to have some practical fellowship concerning our experience and practice of the God-ordained way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD'S RECOVERY BRINGING US OUT OF<br>THE PAPAL AND CLERGY-LAITY SYSTEMS</H2><P>The God-ordained way as revealed in the Bible is the proper practice of the church life against the papal and clergy-laity systems. The papal system is the system of the pope in the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church is called "The Mother of the Prostitutes" (Rev. 17:5). Out of this impure, dirty mother, another system was produced&#151;the clergy-laity system. The clergy-laity system, as the daughter of the papal system, is the system of Protestantism. The Bible reveals the God-ordained practice to encounter these two systems. The Bible has its own practice and principle. The biblical practice and principle are always being put down by the papal and clergy-laity systems. The goal of the papal and clergy-laity systems is to annul the Body of Christ and replace it with a religion. The intention of God's economy is to have an organic Body built up for Christ. But after nearly two thousand years of church history, what is prevailing today on this earth is an organized religion, comprising Catholicism and Protestantism.</P><P>When we left the divisions, we left the papal system with the clergy-laity system, but not many among us know what we have done or what we are doing here today in the Lord's recovery. The Lord's recovery has been lowered down by this ignorance. There are those among us who think that there is not much difference between us and the denominational churches. This kind of thought among the brothers and sisters may be because our testimony has been somewhat weak. Our testimony may not have been strong enough to bear the particular significance of the Lord's recovery to the ones who have been with us for a number of years, including all the ones who have made or caused division in the past seventy years of our history. During the time of my ministry outside of mainland China in the past forty years, there have been at least three divisions caused among us. Every division showed that those who participated in them did not have a clear view about the recovery.</P><P>What is the recovery according to the Lord's mind? It is to get His believers out of the papal system and the clergy-laity system. We should not forget that the intention of these two systems is to build up a religion, including Catholicism and Protestantism, to replace and put down the Body of Christ. Those who have made divisions in the Lord's recovery did not clearly see this. Even I am concerned that we ourselves might not be so thoroughly clear about this. We left the denominations, the divisions, but we did not fully give up the papal and clergy-laity systems. We have outwardly come out of the Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations, but we still carry and walk in these two systems.</P>
