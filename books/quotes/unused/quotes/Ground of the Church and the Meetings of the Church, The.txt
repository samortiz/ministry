The content of the church is Christ, not merely in teaching or doctrine, but in practice, reality, and experience
Christ as the very life, content, and everything for the church is the basic, main, and first aspect of the church life
He must decide in what place, on what ground, he will build, whether on a mountain, by a river, or in the plain
There is another entity called the Presbyterian Church that makes the same claim, that it is built upon Christ as the foundation
The Baptists, the Methodists, and the Episcopalians also claim the same thing, that Christ is their cornerstone and foundation
The Presbyterian Church also claims to be a building upon Christ as the foundation, but this building is upon the ground of the presbytery
All are so-called churches with the same foundation, that is, Christ; however, all are built upon different grounds
Apollos went there also, but neither did he set up a church with Christ as the foundation and Apollos as the ground
In the same way, Peter did not set up a church with Christ as the foundation and Peter as the ground to establish a Petrine church
In Corinth there was only one church, built with Christ as the unique foundation and located in the city of Corinth as the unique ground
Paul did not say To the churches of God which are in Corinth but To the church of God which is in Corinth the one church singular in number
Some free groups do not have a written, declared, or designated ground, but they have some kind of ground that is understood
By the grace of the Lord we are endeavoring to give up any other kind of ground and take the unique ground of oneness the ground of locality
The oneness of the church can also be seen in the testimony of the physical universe, and it can be seen in the New Jerusalem
Since the church is the Body of Christ, and Christ is the one Head, so the church must be one, and the church is one
That is why Ephesians 4:4 through 6 speaks of one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father
In the universe the church is one, but the expression of the church is on this earth and among the human communities
In one city there is an expression of the church, which is called the local church, the church in a certain city
By this we can see that in the universe the church is one, and the expression of the church in each locality is also one
In the whole world there is only one United States, and anywhere there is an expression of the United States, that expression must be unique
When a person in Jerusalem was saved, he did not need to ask what church he should join, because there was only one church in Jerusalem
Perhaps they are in one brother's home tonight and another brother's home the next night, but it is still one church
Again in Ephesus, the meeting of the church one night may be in one home and the next week in another home, but it is still one church
In Corinth, likewise, there is no need to consider whether the 'Pauline' church is better than the 'Petrine' church
Again, if the brother were to transfer from Corinth to Rome, it would be the same; there is only one church in Rome
Everywhere-in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Tokyo, Taipei, and Hong Kong-people ask, 'Are you a Christian?
An American brother may say I am of the Church of England even though it seems foolish for an American citizen to be in an English church
Is a so-called church built upon the British ground, another built upon the Chinese ground, and another built upon the Swedish ground
Neither does he like the Chinese, thinking they are too concerned with money, and he also does not like the Swedes and the Japanese
Because he likes only his countrymen, the Greeks, he will look for the Greek Orthodox Church, the church built upon the Greek ground
All these small circles become many different grounds upon which many different kinds of churches are built up
According to the prophecy in the New Testament, the denominational grounds will remain until the Lord's coming
Not only is there no possibility of actually tearing them down; even the Lord Himself has no intention to get rid of them
The Lord will tolerate all these things, let them remain until He comes back, and then put them all under His judgment
Because of this, the new brothers may decide to have a separate meeting in their home where they can speak in tongues
If we do, we will create a division, another small 'circle,' not being limited by the Lord's ordination and decision
Some may say that this concept is very good but too difficult to practice if there are thousands of believers in many meetings in one city
In the same way, there can be many meetings in one city, yet all the meetings are of one church, which is still the church in Los Angeles
On the Lord's Day in Taipei there are up to forty meetings for the Lord's table, all meeting at the same time in the same city
If someone goes to Taipei, he may attend home meeting number one or home meeting number forty, but he is still attending the same church
If the fifty states of the United States were divided, the impact, the strength, and the power of this country would be lost
It seems that it is not something related to the gospel, the inner life, the growth of life, or the Lord's glory
When we deal with anything, however, we need to have the insight to look into it, not only outwardly but even at its root
Throughout all the past years he has been frustrating, blinding, and distracting God's people and even making many counterfeits
God began this work after the resurrection and ascension of Christ, and He will realize it on this earth in this age
Before that time however Gods intention is to have a living expression of His Son in this age here and there in all the cities on this earth
Regrettably, though, many Christians are not willing to be clear about this because they are preoccupied and distracted by something else
From the beginning of the church life, the enemy came in to frustrate, damage, distract, and make counterfeits of God's plan
The book of Colossians, however, was written because at that time human philosophy had become a substitute for Christ
The apostle Paul told the Colossians that Christ is the allotted portion of the saints and that Christ must be all in all to us
A mother's intention may be to give medicine to her child, but the naughty child may care for the bottle, not the medicine
His intention is to work Christ into His chosen people, but the enemy of God utilized Judaism to replace Christ and substitute for Him
Similarly, Galatians was written because at that time the Judaizers were utilized by the enemy to make the law a substitute for Christ
In 1:22 and 23 Paul said, 'For indeed Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified'
All these things-philosophy, religion, law, and gifts-were substitutes for Christ in the first century of the church
Today in the so-called Christian churches there are choirs and solos, and there are also certain sinful things
Satan does not care what kind of substitute it is; as long as he can distract us from Christ, that is good enough for him
According to history Satan not only used many substitutes to replace and usurp the place of Christ but he also invented the clerical system
Satan's first frustration is to kill the life of the Body, which is Christ, by substituting many other things for Christ
He has replaced Christ by usurping His ground and place, killed the functions of the members, and divided the Body
The enemy works in our reasoning, but regardless of the reasons, as long as we are isolated, this is good enough for the enemy
They said that the Lords work among us is good but the matter of the church is like dead flies that cause the perfumers ointment to stink
When we changed the title to The Glorious Church, there were no further sales, even though it was the same book
The proper ground is the ground of the locality, the local ground, the unique ground of the oneness of the church
The one who is saved should try his best to find other believers in his city, and he should meet with them, help them, and be helped by them
If any others who are in the 'small circles' of divisions realize that they have to give up the circles, they should do it
There are many unsaved ones to whom we can testify, minister Christ, bring to Christ, and bring into this proper church life
If this brother one day moves to another city, he should first realize that he is simply a brother in that city
He should do his best to find others there who take the same standing of the local ground, the ground of oneness
If in that city there is already a group of believers standing on this proper ground the brother has to be willing to submit himself to them
Certain brothers heard about our meeting in Los Angeles and came to us imagining that we must be something in the third heavens
If someone does not care to meet with the church on the local ground, he should not raise up another meeting in this city
When he gets to that city, however, he may find that there is already a group of people standing on the proper ground
If he tries to move away to yet another city, he still must take the standing of the proper ground in that city
When God brought all His people into the land, He chose Jerusalem as the unique place for them to come together to worship Him
It is by the unique center for worship that the oneness of the twelve tribes was constantly kept throughout all the centuries
When the time of the feast came however both he and his neighbor as males of the people of Israel had no other choice but to go to Jerusalem
Not only did they have to go to that place; they also had to worship God by offering the peace offering and sharing it with one another
Ninety percent of the produce that they reaped from the good land they could enjoy in any place of their choice at any time
To enjoy that portion of the rich surplus of the land, they had to go to the only place chosen and appointed by God
As long as we are going to have the church life to enjoy Christ in a corporate way as a worship to the Father, we have no choice
The people of Israel did as God commanded, but once they were captured, they went into exile in Babylon and other places for seventy years
When this small number returned to the place of oneness, spontaneously they separated themselves from those who did not return
Someone who remained in the exile might have said, 'Ezra and Nehemiah, you preach that we have to keep the oneness of the people of the Lord
Who are the ones in division, those who went back to Palestine to form the nation of Israel or those who are in New York?
Some would prefer to assemble in another hall, some in a dormitory, some in their small rooms, and some outside
One of the other meetings may have twenty thousand students, but they are still a division because their ground is wrong
We may start another meeting in another place and feel that there is no difference between the two places of meetings
If we all realize the proper ground and have the vision, the light, concerning the church ground, we will be limited
If someone desires to stay in the denominations, there is no need to argue with him or to try to convince him to come out
Some may think that we should go to the denominations and fellowship with them so that they can see what we have
People used our writings on the gospel, edification, and life, but in one matter-the church-they could not get through
People came to us secretly to buy our books; they liked those books and they used them, but they would not take the way of the church
It seems that 1 Corinthians 14:26 is the only portion of the Word in which we can find instruction on how to have our meetings
Not long after that, according to what we can read from their writings, they received light on 1 Corinthians 14:26
Rather, all the brothers had to share the responsibility of the meeting, following the Holy Spirit to share something with the others
Strictly speaking, it is hard to find any passage in the New Testament giving us an instruction for the way to have our meetings
We Christians may give up any kind of meeting, but one meeting we should not give up is the meeting for the Lord's table
If all the brothers and sisters did not pray in their daily life, we could not come together to have a good prayer meeting
The proper meeting to study the Word of God must be a corporate expression of the individual Christian life of studying
We have to love the Lord with our heart and be renewed in our mind, but we are never told to walk in the mind or live by the mind
The last verse of the book of Philemon says the same thing: 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit'
Day by day we experience Christ in our spirit, and day by day we live in our spirit and learn how to walk in the spirit
It is too much by the self, that is, by the soul, not by the exercise of our spirit, that we have sincerity and honesty
When all these peculiar self- realizing people come together, they will have a peculiar self-realizing Christian meeting
If we realize that to have a proper Christian life we must daily experience Christ, we will not care about our honesty and meekness
We will constantly have many experiences of Christ as our meekness, Christ as our sincerity, and Christ as our everything
We can come to the meeting full of Christ, with the full, rich experiences of Christ and with a strong, living, active, and positive spirit
The worship mentioned in John 4, when the Samaritan woman spoke with the Lord, is not the individual worship but the corporate worship
Whenever all of Israel came together, they came with a certain amount of the surplus of their produce to offer to the Lord
If at that time we could have been in that meeting, we would have seen an exhibition of all the rich produce, the surplus, of the good land
God enjoyed those offerings, and all the worshippers also enjoyed those offerings with God, in the presence of God, and with one another
The Lord Jesus told her, 'An hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father'
We must reap many riches of Christ for us to live on and to have a surplus to bring to the meeting for worship to God
The way for the people of God to meet together is to bring the surplus of Christ to the meeting to offer to God by exercising our spirit
Regardless of what kind of meeting we havefor the Lords table for prayer for study or for a messagewe almost always sit and wait for a hymn
Because we do not take the responsibility, the so-called responsible brothers are forced to act as the 'clergy'
The right way to meet requires that we have a proper daily walk, have an adequate experience of Christ, and exercise our spirit
Many riches of Christ will come out and be offered to God for His satisfaction and for our enjoyment in the presence of God with one another
For many old Christians, though, it is very hard to function, because they have too much influence from their background
We must try our best to drop our backgrounds and learn to live and walk in the spirit by enjoying and experiencing Christ in a practical way
If we have a failure, we should come to the meeting with a contrite spirit to repent and confess before the Lord
We can exercise our contrite spirit to offer a prayer to the Lord for confession, repenting and applying the cleansing of the blood of Jesus
Many may follow to pray, 'Lord, we do thank You that we have the experience of You being our trespass offering'
Verse 21 of chapter ten says You cannot drink the Lords cup and the demons cup you cannot partake of the Lords table and of the demons table
It is not our own word to say that we partake of the Lord; in the Bible we have this phrase: partake of the Lord's table
In 1 Corinthians 11 there is eating and drinking, and in chapter ten there is the table and the partaker of the table
Rather we partake of the Lord enjoy Him once again eat and drink of Him and sit at His table with the saints to share Him one with another
Even though the Lord set up the table before His death, it was something done in anticipation of His resurrection
The way we come to the Lord's table to partake of the Lord, that is, to eat and drink of the Lord, is by exercising our spirit
To come to the Lord's table is to partake of the Lord, to enjoy the Lord, to eat and drink something of the Lord
To this we can add John 4:24: 'God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness'
Whenever we come to the table, we have to prepare ourselves by opening to the Lord from our spirit, from the very depths of our being
We may compare following the flow in the meeting to serving a feast, which requires that we know the proper way to serve
In basketball, the five members of the one team do not play with more than one ball; they play with only one ball
If one person in a basketball game plays with a football, and others play with many different kinds of balls, that game will be a mess
Although it seems that there is not much wrong with our Lord's table meeting, the tide of the Spirit is sometimes too low
Just as we have the real sense that two or three more prayers will bring us to a climax, our mouths can be shut by the wrong hymn
We must sense the flow, and then we should exercise our proper knowledge to do things in an adequate, proper way
To always say that after four or five prayers a hymn is needed to match the prayers is to act according to mere knowledge
After we have experienced the Lord, the Son brings us to the Father to praise the Father in the midst of His brothers
After partaking of the Lord, then the second part of the meeting is a time to worship the Father, following the Lord as the firstborn Son
Neither the Catholic Church nor the so-called reformed churches pay attention to these matters when they have the 'holy communion'
We have to prepare our spirit, to cleanse ourselves, and to exercise the spirit to contact the Lord and enjoy Him
We learn the technique of how to sense the present atmosphere of the meeting and follow the flow in the meeting
We put so much stress on the Lord's table meeting because it is very important and means very much for the church life
In order to have a proper church life, we must learn to care for these practical matters, even though they are small
If there is not much exercise of the spirit, if the spirit of all the attendants is dormant, we can all sense it
The shortcomings in the table meeting are due to the silence of those who should be bearing the responsibility
If those brothers who should bear the responsibility do not do their duty, that becomes the weak point of the meeting
The two feet have to function, but if the feet do not function, the two ears will take the responsibility to walk
The biggest mistake in the Lord's table meeting may be that many who should share the responsibility do not do their job; they just 'retire'
At least a few minutes before the scheduled start of the meeting, the brothers should start to pray rather than announce a hymn
We need not start the meeting with a hymn, according to a regulation; rather, we should start it in a living way
It is easy to start a message meeting by announcing a hymn, but it is hard to start the Lord's table meeting with a hymn
We must learn to start the table meeting by prayer, unless someone has the assurance that a certain hymn is right to start the meeting
We may have the sense that the first hymn chosen is wrong, but we may not do anything to help the beginning of the meeting
In such a case, some may still have the boldness to express something, but they may not have the flow or direction
Corinthians 11:26 says, 'For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord's death until He comes'
At the Lord's table, therefore, we always eat and drink the Lord to enjoy Him, and we display the death of Christ
To call a hymn on the Lord's coming without the flow is merely a legality; it is like serving a cold dish of food
After singing such a hymn, the right thing to do is to have some prayers in order to seek for the Lord's guidance
We may not be assured about the direction of the meeting, so we simply come to the Lord to seek and feel for the direction
At this point, to call the wrong hymn will bring down and disturb the meeting, and the saints will not know which direction to go
After we sense something, we can exercise our knowledge to either express a prayer or choose a hymn to fit what we sense
We may use the temperature of the air to illustrate the exercise of the sense followed by the exercise of knowledge
Some may move according to the teaching that we have to keep the same subject in the meeting, without checking with the inner sense
We may spontaneously have the deep feeling to say, 'Lord, Your glory today reflects Your sufferings in the past'
In this case, we will not be able to follow the hymn with prayer, because we do not have this kind of concept and understanding
When we announce and sing this kind of hymn right away we will have many prayers to follow it and to analyze enlarge and develop its meaning
While we are in the section of the remembrance of the Lord, for someone to direct a prayer to the Father is a disturbance to the flow
In order to practice the church life, we must learn how to meet together; otherwise, the church can never be built up
We all have to endeavor by the grace of the Lord to bear the responsibility for the meeting by exercising our spirit
