   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE TWO THE LOCAL CHURCHES OUTLINE A local church is the God-called-out people gathered together in a locality a city, a town, or a village.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the local churches are the one Body of Christ separated by the localities of their existence, but still expressing the same one Body, not respectively but corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The local churches are autonomous in business affairs but not in the testimony for Christ and in the fellowship of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The testimony for Christ and the fellowship of the Spirit should be not only local but also universal.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In such matters all the local churches are identical in nature and in function, as illustrated by the seven golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, the neighboring local churches should be clustered as much as possible in the blending way for the spiritual benefits in the mutual building up of the Body of Christ, as the Lord Jesus clustered the seven neighboring churches in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such clustering stirs up the neighboring churches in mutual love, mutual care, mutual intercession, and mutual shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such clustering renders a stronger testimony for Christ by the churches in the eyes of the unbelievers, thus speeding up their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A local church should be under the leadership of the elders and should be ministered to by all the gifted saints, such as the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints that they may participate in the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, all kinds of the members of Christ can be useful in the building up of His Body, and not one will be rejected or left idle in the house of God and in the Body of Christ.</S>
