   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONTENTS OF THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Christian meeting is a meeting gathered in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church is the ekklesia, which means "the called-out assembly."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A congregation of pew members is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such a congregation only provides a taste of a Sunday- morning worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Unfortunately, I think the meetings in Hong Kong somehow have developed such a taste.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps Hong Kong has picked up the tradition of the past generations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes its meetings are almost the same as a congregation of pew members.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the reason we have to change the Lord's Day morning meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not allow the brothers and sisters to sit quietly in the meetings; this is the same as not coming to the meeting at all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the meetings, it is true that the brothers and sisters should not express their own opinions, but neither should they wait for someone to come and help them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everyone should remember when they come to the meeting that they are coming to serve the Lord and serve the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They should not come with an attitude of only listening to a sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Next, you have to help many people to function.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everyone should use his one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not wait for a strong speaker to come.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, when a church is weak, it hardly matters whether or not there are strong speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only when the functioning ones in the church are so few does everything depend on speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All we need is a strong bread-breaking meeting and prayer meeting; there is no need to always have speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The issue is what takes priority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The speaking platform is clearly not the priority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How the next generation fares depends on how this generation behaves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If God has a way among us, those who will be saved will not be like the ones we see today; they will be better.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you are faithful in Hong Kong, you will make the believers in Hong Kong the same as those in Kuling.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Kuling, unless one sheds tears and gives up his worldly possessions, he is not considered genuinely saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The important thing is not how others criticize us, but how we are before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every Lord's Day morning we should preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This should last for only thirty or forty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The gospel message should be short.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once it is long, there will be no time to draw the net, and the fish will all jump out of the net.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to capture the listeners with the Spirit of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who only have a burden to explain doctrines are in the realm of the mind; they cannot break down the strongholds in others' minds.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In our preaching we speak to men's minds, yet our main goal is to capture them with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You can follow the Kuling training in many things, but never in the length of its messages.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You should not think that you can extend your time indefinitely as long as you are explaining the teachings clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You have to learn to subdue and conquer others with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you are merely speaking to others' minds, you will waste much time, and the result will not be that good.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The rest of the brothers and sisters also should learn to support the preaching with the release of their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The bread-breaking meeting should be conducted in the districts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more we divide, the easier it will be to grow, and the more opportunity there will be for others to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do not subdivide our meeting into districts, the priesthood will be confined to just a few people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is the need of a new believers' meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the saints should be treated as new believers in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Give them lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a brother or sister cannot come, someone has to go to him or her to make up the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If no one makes up the lesson with them, they will not be sustained.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In making up the lessons, be thorough and careful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not be careless.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You have to speak in such a way that they will want to come the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Unless you can do this, they will think that coming is optional, and your work will be very loose.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The workers should be careful and diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is especially true in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we are not careful, we will not get anywhere even if Hong Kong is blessed with many people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The present condition in Hong Kong is very precarious.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The condition of the gospel is not proper, and the condition of the church is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Consider, for example, the way the new believers' meeting is conducted.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not serious enough.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You are happy as long as the message is released.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How can others receive the blessing if this is the way you work?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do you expect to see any fruit at all?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you want remaining fruit, you have to labor in the new believers' meeting in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Everywhere in China the new believers' meeting is the strongest meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Hong Kong it is the weakest meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hong Kong should be a place to produce people and money, but it seems that we have labored in vain here.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Neither people nor money have been produced.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is because we have neglected the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our words and our actions do not match.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Some are able to preach a message on consecration, but they are not able to take the lead in consecration themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You have finished your fifty-two lessons for new believers already.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What can you give to the new ones next time?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>May the Lord pardon our shortcomings, and may He shine on us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>May He grant us sufficient grace to offer up everything we have to secure His blessing.</S>
