   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SELF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the self, something deeper and more hidden than the love of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The self is more hidden and subtle than our love for our family and our children.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We know that the self is in the soul, but how is the self expressed?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We return once again to the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The self in the soul is mostly expressed by our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our concepts and opinions inevitably express the self in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Peter said, "God be merciful to You, Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a concept, an opinion, a good idea toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This opinion, however, exposed the self of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This self is the very element of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may also turn this statement around and say that the element of Satan is the self.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever we express a dissenting thought or a differing opinion, we express the self.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE MIND, SELF, AND SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Matthew 16 the Lord Jesus rebuked Peter saying, "Get behind me, Satan."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then the Lord told Peter that his mind was not set on the things of God, but on the things of men.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Following this, the Lord Jesus said that those who come after Him must deny the self.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By this we can see that Satan, the mind, and the self are three things in one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Satan is in the mind, and the mind is in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The self is in the mind, and the mind is in Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These three are indivisible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is difficult to separate the self from the mind or the mind from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Self is subtle and hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may think that our concepts are merely concepts and our ideas simply ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But actually, our concepts and our ideas are our self.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Perhaps we have never realized that our ideas and dissenting thoughts are expressions of self and that our self is one with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all need to be crossed-out people, having no dissenting thoughts or concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not a matter of who is right and who is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Strong concepts are the expression of self.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The self is always one with Satan in the soul, and the self is inevitably expressed in the concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This does not mean we should no longer have any concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to have concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are not a chair or a table.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Tables and chairs have no concepts, but as human beings we must have concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to have concepts, but everything depends on whether or not the self is contained in the concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Is self expressed in the concepts?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although it is true that many concepts are the expression of the self, many times we may have a concept without any trace of self in it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The self has been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the leadership and responsibility of the church life, we need to fellowship together about many things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, we need some concepts about what time the meetings should be and on which days they should be held.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we come together to fellowship we need to speak something.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must understand that it is not a matter of the concept itself, but what is behind or within the concept.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The self that is hidden within the concept must be dealt with, because that self is one with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, do not take this as an excuse to have many concepts; it is better not to have many concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we continually express our concepts, we will express our self.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What kingdom are you in?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It all depends on whether or not the soul has been crossed out.</S>
