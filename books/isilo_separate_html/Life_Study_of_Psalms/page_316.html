THE PRAISE OF THE SAINTS<br>IN THEIR GOING UP TO ZION CONCERNING<br>JEHOVAH'S CARE FOR AND BLESSING TO HIS PEOPLE</H2><P>Psalm 127 is the praise of the saints in their going up to Zion concerning Jehovah's care for and blessing to His people. This Song of Ascents was written by Solomon.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah's Care for His People</H2><P>In verses 1 and 2 we see Jehovah's care for His people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Jehovah Building the House<br>and Keeping the City</H2><P>"Unless Jehovah builds the house,/Those who build it labor in vain./Unless Jehovah keeps the city,/The guard watches in vain" (v. 1). This is a comforting word, especially for the elders and for those who consider themselves guards protecting the church. Unless the Lord builds the church, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the Lord keeps the city&#151;that is, keeps the church as the kingdom&#151;those who guard the church watch in vain.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. It Being Vain to Toil for Bread</H2><P>"It is vain for you to rise up early,/To lie down late,/To eat the bread of toil;/All the same, He gives to His beloved while they sleep" (v. 2). This indicates that if the Lord does not do anything for us, whatever we do will be in vain. Instead of toiling and striving in ourselves, we need to trust in Him, for He gives to His beloved even while they sleep. Do you believe that what you do means something? We need to realize that whatever we do without trusting in the Lord means nothing. If we realize this, we will rest in the Lord.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_315.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_317.html">Next</a> </body></html>
