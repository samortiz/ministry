<P>Nevertheless, some people think that it is easier to make a clear-cut move and to die for the Lord once for all. They think that it is too difficult to suffer daily for the Lord, to bear misunderstandings and opposition for the sake of obeying the Lord and His word and for the sake of pleasing the Lord's heart. However, if one cannot live as a martyr for the Lord, he cannot die as a martyr for the Lord. If a man realizes the heart-rending pain a martyr faces at the point of death, he will not consider it an easy thing to die for the Lord. If the Lord Jesus with His perfect humanity would need to have the prayer at Gethesemane, how about the ordinary man? The life of a martyr is a life of death. If one does not live a life of death in his daily life, it would be difficult (except by the Lord's grace) to expect him to be an unretreating martyr. The Lord desires that we be living martyrs, that is, "living dead ones." Daily we are living martyrs. When the time comes for us to testify our faith with our blood, we will be able to face death readily through His grace. Towards our own fleshly life, we should always have the attitude that we are living as those who are dying, so that we would not be dominated by this life. The life that the Lord has called us to live is a life of "the living dead." If we truly have the cross working in us, we will consider this life in death as something precious, because it is this life that pleases the Lord.</P><P>The scheme of Satan is to threaten us with the fear of death and to discourage the believers with the prospect of the losing of life. He causes the believers to weigh the advantage of serving the devil against the cost of obeying the Father, and he makes them feel that one is sweet whereas the other is bitter. It is not easy for the fleshly man to be delivered from glory, position, fame, human relations, and financial losses. These things alone are enough to cause his heart to ache. If in addition to this, one is told that the giving up of life is a price to be paid for believing in the Lord, everyone would shrink and would try to escape. It is human nature to covet life and loathe death. Within every natural man, there is the ant-like nature of craving for a mere existence. Satan knows us more than we know ourselves. He knows that our weakness lies in our craving for life. At critical moments, he would make the preservation of life to be a price he will offer for us to forsake the truth. The one necessary condition to win the war with Satan is a will to defy death. "And they overcame him [Satan] because...they loved not their soul-life" (Rev. 12:11). Those saints who battle with Satan in prayer often have the experience of Satan threatening them with the losing of their life if they persist in opposing him. Hence, for one not to love his own life is the prerequisite to his war with the enemy. He is the roaring lion, who is out to make us tremble at his bearing. What he wants the saints to do the most is to drop their weapon of prayer and to stop the war. Actually, Satan and the saints can never come to peace one with another. If we have a death-defying heart, and if we will not care even if we are slaughtered and killed, Satan will have no way with us. What he is doing is to cause us to love ourselves and have pity on ourselves, so that we would not need to pay too great a price to obey the Lord; he is causing us to shed tears in secret, to have pity on ourselves and to wallow in our own sorrow during difficult times, sufferings, and dangers. If we would not love our life, how can worldly gains move our heart? If Satan cannot tempt us with anything in the world or in us, how can he exercise his maneuvering over us? In this way, we will surely win the victory.</P><P>"I will give you the crown of life." At present we are living in a time of peace. When we look back at the suffering of that day, we cannot help but tremble. However, we can see God's Spirit of glory descending on these suffering brothers. Although they suffered much for Christ, they were comforted much by Christ. It is better to have the Lord's comfort through suffering than to have neither suffering nor the Lord's comfort. Who can exhaust the sweetness of the Lord's comfort? The saints in Smyrna had heard the Lord's word to them: "Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life" (Rev. 2:10). This crown is the crown of victory, because the condition for receiving this crown is to have the experience of victory. "And everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; they then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible" (1 Cor. 9:25). The world awards its contending athletes, but our Lord rewards the overcomers who go to war with Satan and his army. However, one has to exercise self-control, that is, to keep God's "rules," before he can win the reward. Otherwise, he cannot overcome, and even if he does overcome outwardly, such a victory does not count. This is because "if anyone contends in the games, he is not crowned unless he contends lawfully" (2 Tim. 2:5). Obedience to the word of God is the first step to victory, and it is the condition for receiving the crown. Actually, the chief condition for receiving the crown is suffering. Only those who suffer for the Lord have the possibility of receiving the crown. We can see this from the history of the Lord Jesus. "But we see Jesus, who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor"; "You have made Him a little inferior to the angels; You have crowned Him with glory and honor and have set Him over the works of Your hands" (Heb. 2:9, 7).</P><P>James also talked about "the crown of life" given to those who are faithful in trials. "Blessed is the man who endures trial, because when he has become approved by testing, he will receive the crown of life, which He promised to those who love Him" (James 1:12). Those who suffer trials for the sake of loving the Lord will receive the crown of life as the ultimate reward. Satan threatens with death, whereas Christ promises life. Satan casts man into prison, whereas Christ gives to man the crown of life. Resurrection is the destroyer of the fear of death. Those who will lose their life for Christ's sake will find it in resurrection. All those who die for the Lord will reign with Him in the millennium (Rev. 20:4). The Lord grants special crowns to those who do special works. In the Bible, there are recorded three kinds of crowns. Here the crown of life is one of them. The crown in 1 Thessalonians 2:19 is a term, whereas the crown in 1 Corinthians 9:25 speaks of the nature of the crown. These two instances do not speak of two different kinds of crowns. Peter told the elders who faithfully care for the flock: "And when the Chief Shepherd is manifested, you will receive the unfading crown of glory" (1 Pet. 5:4). Paul mentioned other kinds of crowns: "Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, with which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will recompense me in that day, and not only to me but also all those who have loved His appearing" (2 Tim. 4:8). The crown of life is given to those who suffer for the Lord and who overcome all the attacks of the enemy. The crown of righteousness is given to those who love the Lord's appearing. The crown of glory is given to those who work faithfully for the Lord, who are often despised by man and are hidden.</P><P>But what does a crown mean? On the one hand, I believe the crown mentioned here is a real crown, and that there is indeed such a thing. Everyone who fulfills the condition for receiving the crown will receive it. Just those who contended in the games received a crown on their heads, in the same way, there will be real crowns upon the bloodstained heads of the saints. Our unadorned head will one day shine with the splendor of glory. On the other hand, I believe there is hidden meaning behind the crown. A crown implies the sense of being a king. When a prince is crowned, he is henceforth a king. If the saints are crowned without any sense of reigning or ruling, of what worth is such a crown? Will the Lord attract the saints to give up their lives for Him with a mere physical crown? Although the saints' hearts are for the Lord and for pleasing Him, and although their goal is not the reward, yet the Lord will not reward in a common way. If the Lord desires to give a reward, such a reward must be of great value. According to the Bible, such a crown must refer to reigning with the Lord.</P><P>One cannot separate the crown from the reigning. It is difficult to imagine a person receiving a crown without reigning as a king. We can see this from the testimony of the Scripture: "And he took their king's crown from off his head" (2 Sam. 12:30). "Thou settest a crown of pure gold on his [the king'sâ€”v. 1] head" (Psa. 21:3). "Behold king Solomon with the crown" (S.S. 3:11). "And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, Thus saith the Lord God; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown" (Ezek. 21:25-26). As the Lord was the King of suffering and wore the crown of thorns, in the same way, He is the King of glory wearing the crown of glory. Even the book of Hebrews links His crown with the ruling over all things (2:9). From the clear evidence of the Bible, we can see that the crown is a symbol for kingship. In this way, we see a very important principle: not every believer will receive a crown. In the same way, not every believer will reign with Christ. Not every believer who is qualified to receive a crown will receive the same kind of crown. In the same way, not all believers will receive the same position in glory. There are believers who will not receive any crown, and there are believers who will not reign. The losing of one's reward of reigning and the differences in glory are an important doctrine of the Bible. Those who suffer will receive the crown of life, and those who die will resurrect to reign (Rev. 20:4). Salvation may be the same for two persons, but their position in the millennium may not be the same. Those believers who will not receive a reward and who will suffer a loss are still saved (1 Cor. 3:15). There is no distinction between the grace that saved the thief on the cross and that which saved Saul of Tarsus. However, we cannot say that the reward of these two in glory is the same. Although there will be a distinction between the great vessel and the small vessel, both will be filled with the same joy and blessing. At present, of course, we see a difference in the level of spirituality among the believers. However, in that day, there will be a difference even in the position in the millennium. When we arrive in glory, there will of course be no more testings. But our present faithfulness and suffering will determine our future position. In spite of this, we cannot, of course, annul God's supreme sovereignty.</P>
