<h1 class=msg>QUESTION FOURTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>CONCERNING CHRIST AND THE LAW</h1><p>Did Christ keep the law for us? Does our salvation have a direct relationship to His keeping of the law?<h2 class=head1>ANSWER</h2><p>Christ did not keep the law for us. What saved us is God’s righteousness, not Christ’s righteousness.<p>Christ kept the law in order to be righteous in Himself and to be qualified as the Savior. There is only an indirect relationship between Christ’s keeping of the law and our salvation.<p>Christ can save us because He received the punishment of the law, which is death, not because He kept the law. What has saved us is Christ’s death and the righteousness accomplished through His death, not the righteous acts of Christ. The righteous acts of Christ are His own.
