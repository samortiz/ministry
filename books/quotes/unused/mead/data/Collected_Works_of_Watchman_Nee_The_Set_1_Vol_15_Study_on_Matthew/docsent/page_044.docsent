   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In world history the church today has only the Roman Catholic Church, the state churches, and the private churches.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Roman Catholic Church says that all believers in the world are under her regardless of the country in which they live.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The state church, such as the Anglican Church, claims that every citizen of that nation belongs to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Due to the dissatisfaction with the state churches, there are also the private churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As far as the outward appearance, or boundary, is concerned, if someone claims to be a Christian, we cannot cast him out of the kingdom of the heavens, because the Lord has not permitted the collecting of the tares today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, in the bread breaking meeting, the church may have an unsaved person or an evil person removed 1 Cor 5:2, 11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the kingdom of the heavens in its outward appearance may include unsaved ones, just as the state churches do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, for the church meetings, it is permissible not to receive an unsaved person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This shows that the kingdom of the heavens in its outward appearance and the church are two completely different spheres.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There may be tares in the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, but there cannot be any unsaved person in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who are not saved cannot enter into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The parables in this chapter may be divided into several sections: 1 The parable of the sower is the introduction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2 The parable of the wheat and the tares is in contrast with the parable of the good species and the foul species.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just as there are good wheat and bad tares, there are also good species and foul species.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>3 The parable of the mustard seed is in contrast with the parable of the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The mustard seed is outward, whereas the leaven is inward.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>4 The parable of the treasure is in contrast with the parable of the pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The treasure refers to the outward, whereas the pearl refers to the inward.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To show contrast is not to repeat; it is for emphasis, because one refers to the church and the other refers to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>5 If the word concerning the new and old treasure is also considered a parable, it is in contrast with the first parable, the parable of the sower.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 3:"And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this parable the Lord did not say, "The kingdom of the heavens is or, has become like...," because the work of sowing the seed was done by the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The kingdom of the heavens in its outward appearance or sphere did not begin until the Lord was rejected and the disciples began to work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This parable speaks specifically of the result of the work of the Lord Jesus on the earth, which is a matter before "the kingdom of the heavens is or, has become like...."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we want to be strict in our interpretation, we must interpret it in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verses 24-25 a "man" and "men" are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The man refers to the Son of Man; the men refer to the Lord's servants.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The sowing was done by the Son of Man alone; no one else had any part in it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How many kinds of seeds are there?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is only one kind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that all the seeds are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But what about the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are four kinds.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The seeds refer to the word of the kingdom of the heavens, the earth refers to the heart of man, and the sower is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Went out to sow."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If this is not the beginning of a new dispensation, then it must be the preparation for a new dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Old Testament God planted Israel as a vine Jer 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The vine is planted in the vineyard, and the roots of the vine constantly absorb the moisture from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, the vine typifies God's earthly people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the children of Israel went to Canaan, the first evidence of what the good land was like was the grapes from the Valley of Eshcol Num 13:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The blessings of the Israelites are always on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To sow the seed is to sow wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After the season is over it is reaped when it has dried.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This refers to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although the Old Testament mentions the fig tree, it does not use the fig tree to represent the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, it uses the vine to represent the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, the New Testament uses the fig tree to represent the children of Israel Matt 24:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Luke 13 a fig tree was planted in a vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because the children of Israel were not good, God put them aside from their chosen position.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The fig tree had not produced fruit for three years, but it was to be kept to see if it would produce fruit in that year.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, the vine is a permanent representation of Israel, whereas the fig tree is a temporary representation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Here in Matthew 13 what is presented is the sowing of seed; it is neither the permanent representation nor the temporary representation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What does "beside the way" refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>1 The "way" is land that has never been tilled, and it has the most traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That is, it is a place that has not been dealt with by God or sown by men.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the place where the evil spirits dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The field signifies the world, so the place "beside the way" must be the air.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>2 The place "beside the way" is not the way itself; it is close to the way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This shows that it is a place that is especially close to the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is probably very corrupt in morality.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>"When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the evil one comes...</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the one sown beside the way" v. 19 . A person's rejection of the Lord is due to the unwillingness of his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is just Satan blinding the eyes of man's heart to keep the glory of Christ from shining in 2 Cor 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In Matthew 5 7 the Lord presented the word of the kingdom of the heavens in a way that cannot be any more clear.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But the people were not able to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It does not say that they did not believe, but that they did not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This word was spoken especially to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Jews do not believe because they do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This corresponds to the word spoken in verses 13 through 15 concerning not being able to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, the Lord said that they are neighbors to the evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>People of this kind are not saved.</S>
