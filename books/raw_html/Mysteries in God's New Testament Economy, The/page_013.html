<H1 CLASS=TITLE>ADDITIONAL WORD</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(1)</H1><P>While I was listening to your pray-reading this morning, I had a feeling within me. We began to practice pray-reading in 1966. By now it has been twenty-four years. This does not mean that we have graduated already. We still have to learn to pray-read better. In our pray-reading, we did not have an adequate digestion of the Lord's word. In particular, the rich flavor that is in the Lord's word did not come out through our praying and digestion. Pray-reading is like eating; one cannot do it hastily. This is especially true with rich meals. We have to eat slowly before we can sense the taste and assimilate the riches. We have to learn to do this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RAISING THE LEVEL OF SPIRITUALITY</H2><P>You who are sitting here can be considered as the cream of the Lord's recovery in Asia. I would take this opportunity to fellowship with you a word from my heart. According to my observation, during the past few decades, we seem to have stopped advancing in the Lord's recovery. Our spiritual level has not progressed that much. It seems that we are still at the elementary school age. We know some basic truths. But concerning matters such as the mysterious revelations in God's New Testament economy, we still do not know that much. During the past forty years, although I have borne the responsibility in the release of the truth, there are few among us who can be considered as university graduates spiritually. For this I feel indebted to you.</P><P>This time I came with an intention to fellowship this matter with you clearly. At least I should tell you honestly that we are not up to the standard. We have to have the self-realization that we are not up to the standard. Do not talk about the right and wrong things anymore. They are not worth our mentioning at all. What is worth mentioning is our knowledge concerning the truth. We have to realize that at least fifty percent of our work in the church is in education. If this aspect is conducted poorly, we come short and have failed. For this reason, from now on, we must strive and pursue toward this point.</P>
