   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In view of this, we know that a person who is a new creation in Christ is not recovered in this life to the position of Adam before his fall, simply because of, not to mention other things, the fact that his body has not been redeemed Rom 8:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Even a man in the new creation still has a sinful nature and still has the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometimes his feelings and his desire are not perfect and are mostly more base than those of Adam when he was sinless.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Unless man's flesh has been rooted out from within man, he can never have the perfect feeling, desire, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man can never reach the position of having no possibility of sinning because the flesh still exists.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a believer does not walk according to the Holy Spirit and still gives ground to the flesh, the flesh will exercise its dominion again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, we should not despise the salvation which Christ has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are many places in the Bible which tell us that whatever is born of God cannot sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that whoever is born of God and filled with God has no inclination to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It does not mean that there is no possibility of sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we say wood cannot sink, it means that wood has no tendency to sink rather than that wood has absolutely no possibility of sinking, because if wood is soaked in water for many days, it may sink.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The hand of a child may also cause it to sink.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the nature of wood is that it does not sink.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the same way, God saves us to the degree that we have no inclination to sin but does not save us to the degree that we have no possibility of sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the believer is still filled with the intention to incline to sin, this proves that he is still fleshly and has not obtained full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus will cause us not to incline to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Meanwhile, we still need to be watchful because, if we are contaminated by the world or tempted by Satan, there is still the possibility of sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A believer should realize that, on the one hand, he is a new creation in Christ, having the Holy Spirit dwelling in his spirit, having the death of Jesus working in him, and having the sanctifying life, but that, on the other hand, he still has the sinful flesh and can still sense the existence of the flesh and its filthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He has the sanctifying life because he, by the Holy Spirit with the death of the cross, puts to death the practices of his members so that the flesh cannot act, not because he has no flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After seeing the fact that a believer passes on his sinful nature to his children, we know that what we have obtained is not the natural perfection of Adam when he was sinless.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We also know that the existence of the flesh does not cause the believers to become no more sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the believers should admit that even those believers who are the most holy also have times of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sinful thoughts may enter into their mind unintentionally, words may come out of their mouth unconsciously, they may feel that it is hard to surrender their will to the Lord, and they may have confidence in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All these are works of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a believer is under the control of Christ and does not make provision for the flesh, he will have a lasting experience of overcoming the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, a believer should know that the flesh may regain its power at any moment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The flesh has not been eradicated from the body, but, because we have presented ourselves to the Lord Rom 6:13 , the body has left the control of the flesh and has come under the control of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a believer walks according to the Holy Spirit this refers to the attitude of not letting sin reign in our body v. 12 , no matter what sin devises, it cannot cause the believer to stumble.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather he is always free.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way the body is not reigned over by the sinful nature and is free to be the temple of the Holy Spirit and to do the holy work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The way the believer obtains his freedom is the way he keeps his freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because the believers answer God with the vital "yes" and answer the flesh with the vital "no," accepting the Lord's death, they obtain freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore in this life, before the separation from the body, this "yes" to God and "no" to the flesh have to always continue.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not one believer at this time can reach a position of not being tempted.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, good discernment, watchfulness, prayer, and sometimes fasting are necessary that he may know how to walk according to the Holy Spirit.</S>
