   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE NINE THE MINISTERS OF THE NEW COVENANT 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:1-7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 3:12-18 we have the first aspect of the description of the ministers of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The ministers of the new covenant are constituted by and with the Lord as the life-giving and transforming Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Chapters four through seven are a further description of the New Testament ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to 4:1-6, they conduct themselves for the shining of the gospel of the glory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, the second aspect concerning the ministers of the new covenant is how they conduct themselves, the way they behave.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>CONDUCTING THEMSELVES FOR THE SHINING</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>OF THE GOSPEL OF THE GLORY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before we consider how the ministers of the new covenant conduct themselves, let us first see the goal, the aim, and the purpose of their conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Their conduct is governed and controlled by a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This purpose is to shine the glory of the gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They conduct themselves in such a way that the gospel of Christ may shine through them and out from within them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the goal, the purpose, of their living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They do not merely preach the gospel they shine out the gospel of the glory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The gospel preached by Paul was a gospel of glory, a gospel full of light and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This glory cannot be conveyed just by speaking, by preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It must be expressed through shining.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, this shining must be the living of the New Testament ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Their living is the very shining of the gospel they preach.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For them, the gospel is not merely a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no need for a doctrine to have any shining.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the gospel they preach, the gospel of glory, is full of shining.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This glory is God Himself, God embodied in the gospel they preach.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the gospel preached by the ministers of the new covenant is not a theory, a philosophy, or a mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the embodiment of the God of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This gospel cannot be carried out simply through preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There must be shining.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The ministers who carry out this gospel of glory are luminaries; that is, they are shining ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As luminaries, they themselves do not have light, but they have the ability to reflect light that comes from another source, just as the moon reflects the light of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The gospel can be compared to Christ shining forth as the sun, the God of glory embodied in His redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all need to understand the gospel in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not regard the gospel as a philosophy or a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No, the gospel is the embodiment of the very God of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This gospel needs many shining ones, many luminaries, to reflect its light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Reflecting the light of the gospel of glory is the living of all the ministers of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This reflection is the conduct of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verse 4 Paul uses the word illumination.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Deep in his spirit, Paul considered himself and his co-workers luminaries.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today we also need to be such luminaries reflecting the glory of the gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The goal, the aim, and the purpose of the living of the New Testament ministers is to shine in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The goal of Paul s conduct was to shine out the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He and his co-workers, ministers of the new covenant, conducted themselves for the shining of the gospel of the glory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A. Their Conduct</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 4:1 Paul says, Therefore, having this ministry, as we received mercy we do not lose heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In 3:12-18 the apostle depicts how the ministers of the new covenant are constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this chapter, he goes on to tell, from verse 1 through 6, how they as the ministers of the new covenant conduct themselves for the carrying out of their ministry, and, from verse 7 through 18, what kind of life they live.</S>
