<h2 class="head1">BUILDING AND MEETING<br />
ACCORDING TO THE UNIQUE DESIGN</h2>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s new move we must practice to have four things&mdash;the home gatherings, the truth lessons, the full-time workers, and the spreading of the gospel. These are the life-pulse of the Lord&rsquo;s present move. The first thing we shall fellowship about is how to have the home gatherings. In order to see this matter we must first see the basic principles of meeting.</p>
<p>Every denomination has its own constitution, its by-laws, or creed, in which they declare what they believe, how they practice, how they are organized, how they receive members, and how they meet. These creeds, constitutions, or by-laws of the denominations are their &ldquo;design.&rdquo; A design is a pattern of the building to come. Based upon such a design, they go on to build. From the very beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, Brother Nee declared that we do not have any creed. We only have the Bible. The Bible is our creed. In other words, the Bible is our design. This is why to take the lead in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not a light thing. To do this you must know, not in a shallow way, at least the entire New Testament. You must understand what is in Matthew, especially in chapters five, six, and seven, as well as chapters thirteen, twenty-four, and twenty-five. Then you must know what is in chapters fourteen through seventeen of John. Likewise, you surely must know what are the real contents of the Epistles of Paul and of John as well as the book of Revelation. If you know all these things, then you will know how to produce a design.</p>
<p>A crucial, practical part of this design is the way to meet. Every denomination has its own way to meet. The Greek Orthodox have their Greek Orthodox way. The Catholics, the Presbyterians, the Baptists, and the Pentecostals have their own particular way to meet, but in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we must come back to our creed of the entire Bible and, in particular, the New Testament. We have spent a great amount of effort to study the different ways of meeting in the different Christian groups, but we would only take what is revealed in the unique design. In this chapter we will consider five principles which cover the New Testament way for God&rsquo;s people to meet on this earth.</p>
<p>If we have different ways to meet, the Lord&rsquo;s move will be weakened among us, and this will annul the morale. We will have no impact to carry out God&rsquo;s work and to fight the battle. This is not a small thing. What we do is not up to our concept. It is not up to the American brothers&rsquo; way, nor the Chinese brothers&rsquo; way. All the different races have their own way to gather people. Some Christian groups meet according to the natural, social way which is not according to the design in the Bible. If we take this way, we will cause division, and this will weaken the Lord&rsquo;s move. This will weaken the recovery. In our own history, some among us secretly changed the way to meet. They even changed the nature of meeting. That kind of leadership was not the proper leadership. That leadership led people astray into a wrong way and caused division. Some were corrupted, distracted, and even to some extent ruined through that way. This kind of leadership surely is not the proper leadership, and this is not the design of a wise architect such as the Apostle Paul (1 Cor. 3:10). Therefore, we must come back to the New Testament to pick up the basic principles of meeting. For us to pick up these principles depends upon how much we know the contents of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. According to the revelation of the New Testament economy, there are five basic principles of meeting.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
