   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Fifth Year</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ezekiel goes on to speak of the fifth year.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whereas the thirtieth year was counted from the year of his birth, the fifth year was counted from the year of captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why did the visions come in the fifth year of captivity and not in an earlier year?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The visions did not come earlier because the people were not ready and Ezekiel himself, being under the age of thirty, also was not ready.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that seeing the visions recorded in Ezekiel requires that we make ourselves ready.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since Ezekiel was thirty when he saw the visions, in the year of captivity he was only twenty-five.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Numbers 4:2-3 tells us that the priests began their ministry at the age of thirty, but Numbers 8:24 says that the Levites began to serve at the age of twenty-five.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reason for the difference here is that the priests needed five years of apprenticeship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They could not come into the priestly service immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, they needed to be trained and disciplined for five years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the beginning of the captivity, Ezekiel was an apprentice priest, a learner.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He did not yet have the maturity required for seeing the visions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that in spiritual things there is the need of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Due to the lack of maturity, some among us cannot see the visions which the Lord intends to show us from this book.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot see certain spiritual matters when we are young.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, we need to look to the Lord that He would grant us the maturity in life that we may see, accept, receive, and take in all the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The fact that the visions came in the fifth year indicates that not only Ezekiel but also the people had been made ready.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The number five signifies that man is graced by God to bear responsibility toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even though God s people were in captivity, they still had some grace from God, so when the time came, they could bear responsibility before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The fifth year of king Jehoiachin s captivity indicates that the time had come for the people of Israel to bear responsibility toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When this captivity began, Ezekiel began learning to be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even in captivity God gave him grace that he might learn to be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At the time of the fifth year, both Ezekiel and the people were ready.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, Ezekiel, having reached the age of thirty, could officially minister as a priest before God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the other hand, the people could now bear their responsibility, and God came in to speak to them concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before a child s parents can speak to him about a particular responsibility, the child must be the proper age to receive such a speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A child must reach a certain age before his parents can ask him to bear a certain responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The situation is similar with God s speaking in the book of Ezekiel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God did not speak until the fifth year of their captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before Ezekiel reached the age of thirty, God did not give him the responsibility of speaking for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Likewise, before the fifth year of the captivity, the people had not received the sufficient grace to bear the responsibility of what God would speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But by the time of the fifth year, the people had sufficient grace, and Ezekiel had enough learning and could now bear the responsibility of speaking for God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, in the fifth year God wanted Ezekiel to bear the responsibility to speak to the people of Israel and He wanted Israel to bear the responsibility of listening to His words.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We cannot speak concerning the things in the book of Ezekiel to those who have just been saved, for they cannot understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, when someone reaches the fifth year of his salvation, God may want to speak to that one in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Likewise, as one who speaks for God, I could not speak of these things until I had reached the thirtieth year.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now that I have come to my thirtieth year and others have come to their fifth year, I am able to speak to them regarding the visions in Ezekiel, and they are able to receive this speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Both the one speaking and the ones listening must bear their responsibility toward God.</S>
