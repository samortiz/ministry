Last May most of the brothers and sisters moved to inland areas. In September a few saints returned to Changchow and resumed meeting. Thank the Lord that we have been preserved in everything. Presently, we have gospel meetings or mutual edification meetings every Lord's Day afternoon. We break bread in the evening, and we have the prayer meeting on Thursday.</p><p>The present responsible brothers in the Lord,<br />Wu Feng-yuan and Dai Jen-tsia, June 13</p><h2 class="head2">Thailand</h2><p>Thank and praise the Lord for bringing two useless ones like us to Pu-Ji. When we first arrived, we did not meet any brothers or sisters in the Lord, and we had no place to meet. All the neighbors are idol worshippers, and the environment is dark. We felt very lonely and did not know how to tell these superstitious ones about their false gods or about the Lord Jesus' gospel of salvation. We could only pray daily for the souls of the men of Pu-Ji and ask the Lord to grant them His grace. Although we had written to Brother James Chen and invited him to come, he did not come. We can only ask the Lord to do His own work in Pu-Ji. Thank the Lord that He has heard our prayer and has done a particular work among a group of young women. Two formerly devout Buddhist worshippers have believed in the Lord. One went home and immediately removed all her Buddhist idols after hearing about the Lord's love and about the fact that God is the true God. We marvel at the Lord's grace! There are now six sisters who have confessed Jesus as their Savior. Thank and praise the Lord. Glory to Him. Presently, we teach them to read the Bible and sing some hymns every Lord's Day afternoon at one o'clock, hoping that this will help them know more about the Lord. Although they are all Chinese, they speak Thai at home. We hope to help them read and speak a little Chinese from now on. May the Lord continue with His work.</p><p>Weak sisters in the Lord,<br />Chai Lan-jen and Huang Hwei-min, June 11</p><h2 class="head2">Manila, Philippines</h2><p>Thank the Lord that we are forever joined together in Him, even though we are an ocean apart. We often remember the brothers and sisters and especially the co-workers in China. We believe that the Lord will surely protect all of you and grant you His peace. Although we have been preserved in safety in a foreign land, our heart has not ceased to remember the saints in China who are in tribulation. Enclosed please find X dollars, which is an expression of concern in the Body of Christ by the saints meeting in the Lord's name in Manila. Please wait on the Lord's leading with two or three brothers and distribute it to the workers in China, to the saints in need, and to the publication of The Open Door and The Christian. Brother Philip Luan and Sister Peace Wang passed by here on their way to Singapore a little while ago. The brothers and sisters received much help from them on the Lord's Day. I hope that they can stay a longer time on their way home so that the believers can receive more help.</p><p>The church in Manila,<br />Hwang Ho-seng, Chai Wen-bin, and Lin En-hung, June 29</p><h2 class="head2">Makassak</h2><p>Enclosed please find X dollars. Please give it to the responsible brothers for distribution, according to the leading of the Lord's Spirit, to the saints in tribulation or in poverty or for other uses.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Yao Ke-ju, August 16</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_116.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_118.html">Next</a> </body></html>
