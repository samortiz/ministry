<h1 class="title">THE PRACTICE OF MEETING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>In this chapter and in the next two chapters, we want to see some crucial points concerning the practice of meeting. There are a few points we need to take care of when we speak in our meetings. We must always take care of others when we speak. We have to consider whether or not people can hear our voice. We should not speak too loud or too low. Nor should we speak too fast or too slow. Furthermore, when we speak, we should do our best not to overlap others&rsquo; speaking. While someone else is speaking, we should wait until they are finished before we speak. We do not need to strive or compete with others. Our speaking corporately should have a good continuation and maintain a proper order. We also need to avoid telling stories. When we share in the meetings, we are not giving a message. If a person is giving a message, he may use stories and illustrations; but in the church meeting our time is limited, and we want many to share something. We need to limit our sharing to two or three minutes so that many others have the opportunity to speak. We come to the meeting to minister Christ to others. Our speaking in the meetings must be like a composition spoken by all the attendants.</p>
<p>Our desire is that the saints and the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery would be brought into a way of meeting that corresponds to the ordained way in the Bible. The practice of Christianity is traditional and follows the customs of the nations. The Bible tells us that when the church comes together, &ldquo;each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:26). If we enter into the genuine practice of meeting revealed in the New Testament, our entire meeting will cover some subject or subjects that will build up the saints, the local church, and the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>It is difficult for a family to move to another country and change their native language. But when a family has this language laid as a foundation, all the little children in the family will spontaneously speak this language without any accent. We need to hold a strong learning spirit to learn a &ldquo;new language,&rdquo; that is, to learn how to meet in the new way. We need to practice all the points of fellowship in this book so that our meetings can reach the goal of God&rsquo;s economy to build up the church.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been among us for over sixty years, and during this time, we have learned two secrets. First, the thing that damages the meetings is our desire to &ldquo;save our face&rdquo; or to get some kind of glory. This is the most damaging thing and it is also deadening. If we take care of our face, we are deadened. Second, pride is a great damage to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, there are not many capable persons. Most capable persons would not come the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery because this is the way of the cross. It is a narrow and lowly way. Everyone who wants a name, a position, or a rank would not come this way. While the Lord Jesus was on this earth, He told the unbelieving Jews that He did not receive glory from men (John 5:41) and that they received glory from one another but they did not seek God&rsquo;s glory (v. 44). To seek man&rsquo;s glory is to seek some kind of rank or position. When Paul wrote his first Epistle to the church in Corinth, he addressed this matter. Corinth was a great, luxurious city in Paul&rsquo;s time, but Paul said that among them there were &ldquo;not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many wellborn&rdquo; (1:26). It is the same with us today. The church of God is composed not mainly of the upper class, but of the lowborn of the world and the despised. Once one is used by the Lord, pride can come in. Actually pride is continually crouching there. If one is not a capable person, pride will not be crouching to possess him. Pride is crouching in order to gain and spoil the capable persons.</p>
<p>Thus, you have to put your face under your left foot and your pride under your right foot. Do not uplift your face or your pride. Put them under your feet. If these two things are under your feet, you are a victor, an overcomer. To be an overcomer, you have to overcome your face and your pride. Be careful. Once you are used and you become useful, pride is crouching there. Without the Lord&rsquo;s mercy in the past fifty-five years, I would have been killed by pride many times.</p>
