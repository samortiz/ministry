<h1 class="title">GOD CAME AS MAN&rsquo;S RIGHTEOUSNESS&mdash;<br />
THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Jer. 23:5-6</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God came as a man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Point out that the &ldquo;Righteous Branch&rdquo; mentioned in Jeremiah 23:5-6 signifies the Lord Jesus incarnated in the flesh to be the Son of Man.</li>
	<li>This Branch of David is Jesus Christ, who is God coming as a man.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The only righteous man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>All of Adam&rsquo;s descendants are unrighteous. Neither Adam nor any of his descendants are in one accord with God.</li>
	<li>Only the Branch of David is called a Righteous Branch by God. In the New Testament He is called &ldquo;The righteous One.&rdquo; Only Jesus Christ is righteous among men and before God. His nature and His behavior are in one accord with God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The union of Christ and man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is the very God become flesh to unite with man. He put on human nature and became one with man.</li>
	<li>He was made sin in man&rsquo;s behalf on the cross. Man is unrighteous. Man is sinful. When He became one with man, He was made sin, and as sin He was judged on the cross.</li>
	<li>He resurrected from the dead and released His life to man so that man can be one with Him.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ has become the righteousness of man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Before God, man is sinful and Christ is righteous.</li>
	<li>Christ resurrected that man might have His life, which is just Christ Himself.</li>
	<li>Christ Himself is righteousness. Hence, if a man receives Christ, he receives Christ as his righteousness. The one who receives Him receives righteousness, and this righteousness is Christ Himself.</li>
	<li>Christ becomes man&rsquo;s righteousness not only that man may be justified, but also that man may become righteous. Justification is a matter of outward position. Righteousness is a matter of inward reality.</li>
	<li>To receive Christ as our life is to let Christ become our righteousness. Hence, this righteousness is something living. It not only gives us the position of being justified, but also implants within us a righteous life to live out righteousness.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to receive Christ as righteousness
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Confess that you yourself are unrighteous.</li>
	<li>Receive Christ as the Savior of righteousness. He is the One without sin. He bears our sin and enters into us to become our righteousness.</li>
	</ol></li>
