   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EVERYONE BEARING THE BURDEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE ADVANCE OF THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The spread of the Lord s recovery overseas began from Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I brought my family of twelve to Taiwan, I only had three hundred dollars, which was enough to support us for only three months.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since then the Lord has blessed us, and we cannot forget His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to spread the gospel and not keep our money in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It does not matter whether our homes are large or small.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It would be wonderful if by reducing the size of his home, a person could offer one thousand five hundred dollars for the spread of the gospel and the support of full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If five souls can be saved through this offering, it is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Luke 16:9 the Lord said, Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord is keeping an account for us in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we enter into the eternal tabernacles, the people who are saved through our giving will greet us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is what the Lord Himself taught.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First Timothy 6:8 says, Having food and covering, with these we will be content.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many brothers and sisters, however, earn three or four times more than what they need for food and covering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What is the purpose of keeping the extra money?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not want the full-timers to experience a lack in their living, nor do we agree that the saints should continue increasing their standard of living without restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The saints are wasting money on food, drink, and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If everyone saved one dollar for the Lord every day, in one month they would have thirty dollars, and in one year, three hundred sixty dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are fellowshipping these things so that our fellowship concerning gospelizing Taiwan and begetting, nourishing, and teaching would not be empty words.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Begetting new ones costs money.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The new ones need to be nourished, and nourishing also costs money.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Teaching is even more expensive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The emphasis of our burden is not the full-timers going out to spread the gospel but every brother and sister bearing the burden to gospelize Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have four directions in the gospel: the campuses, the neighborhoods, every level of society, and every town and village.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may not be able to go to the towns and villages to preach the gospel, but we cannot say that we do not have neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Most people today live in high-rise apartments and have neighbors who live above, below, to the left, and to the right of them; hence, it is easy to preach the gospel to people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But since our concept and our taste have not changed, we still emphasize the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must understand that the big meetings are for the occasional worshippers who have not been completely gained by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should continue the big meetings for such people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These meetings are not for us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should each have a home meeting in our home.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>PREPARING APPROPRIATE MATERIAL</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>FOR THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I believe that we have all tasted the benefits of the home meetings that cannot be found in the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After seven or eight people meet together three to five times in a home meeting, the saints will know each other.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They will then be able to help each other.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a strong point of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are no famous people giving messages in the home meetings, and the co-workers or elders do not need to prepare a long message.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every meeting needs only a short portion of the ministry as the material for the home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, the book The Living Needed for Building Up the Small Group Meetings is very good material.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first chapter speaks of A Living That Is out of the Holy Spirit and through the Human Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The elders can choose four or five pages as the content for the home meetings and ask the brothers and sisters to read the material on their own before the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They can then read it together in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The saints do not come to the home meetings to listen to a message; they come to read a message together.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we read, we should not be formal.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must all exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then we will absorb all the nutrients in the message.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The elders and co-workers in the localities cannot merely speak about the home meetings without giving the saints material to read in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In a meeting hall of three hundred people two or three full-time brothers can spend time to pray and seek the Lord in order to prepare material for the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have many books that can be used.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Inviting a famous person to speak does not necessarily make the meetings richer or more enlightening than reading material from our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Why should we give up the supply that we have?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Why do we not use the material that is already prepared?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our problem is that the brothers and sisters are used to the big meetings, not the home meetings, and the elders and co-workers are not used to leading the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The best material for the home meetings is the Life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The elders and co-workers must learn how to prepare simple, home-cooked, healthy meals for the home meetings, not big feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we can prepare material for three hundred sixty-five days and distribute it to the saints, they will have nourishing food to eat when they gather in their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The result will be that everyone will have a good appetite, and they will be nourished.</S>
