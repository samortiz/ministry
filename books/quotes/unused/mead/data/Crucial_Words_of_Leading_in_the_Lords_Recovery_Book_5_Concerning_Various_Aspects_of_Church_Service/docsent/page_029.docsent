   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHILDREN S WORK HAVING MANY ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is not a definite way to take care of the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There should not be only one aspect to the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There should be many locations for the children s work, meetings can be held at different times, and we can use different methods to conduct the children s meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There should also be many goals.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The teaching material should also cover many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Having Many Locations</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Having a children s meeting only in the meeting hall will be a great hindrance to its further development.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The children may not all be able to travel to the meeting hall, and the meeting hall may not have sufficient space for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the church in Anaheim there are more than ten rooms for children s meetings, but the space is still not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, the rooms are used only for a few hours every week and have no other use.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not cost efficient.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even if we have many rooms, it will not be easy for all the children to come to the meeting hall for a scheduled meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Their meetings must have many locations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to our study, the most effective way is similar to the way we propagate the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every saint should open his home and have a children s meeting in his home.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a home has no children, then it is up to the individual saint to decide whether he would open his home.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, it is best to have the burden to open one s home for the children.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Most of the older sisters are burdened for the children.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If their children are abroad or married and their circumstances allow them, they should open their home for a children s meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They can invite five or six children from the neighborhood to have a children s meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They do not have to worry about how to have the meeting, because the church will prepare material for them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Having Material</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have considered using videotaped material, which some localities use.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Texas some of the children s meetings watch videotapes prepared for the children.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We want to produce a video that shows children from various countries wearing their traditional dress and singing the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There would be Japanese children wearing the kimono, Korean children wearing the hanbok, Chinese children wearing Chinese quilted jackets, and Indonesian children wearing the sarong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The children would enjoy watching such a video.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After watching the video, we can help the children identify the different nationalities and then say something concerning God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Having Many Purposes</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can open our homes once or twice a week, even on Saturday afternoons and during vacation time, to invite children to our homes to have a children s meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can also contact the children s parents and preach the gospel to them and to their relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the principle of our gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more people we contact, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way, over a period of time there will spontaneously be an effect.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We believe that out of every ten children we care for, three or four will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They might not get saved at this time, but at a later time in their life they will remember something and return to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It will be easier for these ones to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Having Many Ways</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The households with children can take the initiative to open their homes and ask their children to invite other children in the neighborhood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The children can watch the children s videotapes, sing children s songs, or listen to a story.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the way to have a children s meeting once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have about five hundred fifty children among us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The children between the ages of six and twelve come from roughly four hundred families.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If each of the four hundred families opened their home for a children s meeting with ten children, there would be four thousand children meeting in four hundred homes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we include the homes of the saints who do not have children but are willing to open their homes, it will be easy to reach a total of ten thousand children.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is one of the many ways we can use to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is also the way to gain something long-term.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We hope that the whole church will hear this fellowship and take action.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The meeting hall also has its use, but that might mainly be to babysit children.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We will not be able to separate the children into smaller groups, because of a lack of rooms and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the saints come to a meeting, their children can watch a videotape, sing, and be spiritually cultivated.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Having Different Meeting Times</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Furthermore, it is best to have different meeting times for the children s meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The schedule should be flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The meetings do not have to be on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Saturday afternoon is also a good time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to utilize the time when the children are out of school to have children s meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>CRUCIAL MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The way to carry out the children s work depends on the brothers taking the lead in the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They should determine how to contact the opened homes and how to lead the saints to receive a burden and be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If every home can open to invite children, we will have enough meeting places and manpower.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Furthermore, if some saints are designated to prepare teaching material, the saints will not need to labor that much.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We can give only some principles related to the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is up to the saints to carry them out.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We also need the elders to promote this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we are diligent, we will gain many people year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The children s work will become one source of increase.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is worthwhile for the elders to promote the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should not make any special arrangements to get teachers for the children s meetings in the meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Rather, we should find a number of younger brothers and sisters who meet regularly to be the teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Children of various ages can be gathered into one room, and two or three younger saints can tell them stories, sing songs with them, or let them watch a video.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This kind of service does not require much manpower.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The saints who are between the ages of twenty and thirty can take care of the children.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In order to reach the goal of having a large number of children, we need to mobilize the entire church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All the saints need to function for this to prosper.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We need to prepare material for the children s meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should not have children s meetings without preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The brothers taking the lead in the children s work need to write and compile material.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They need much prayer and fellowship to know the content and write lesson plans.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We need to prepare material, but the saints can decide the best way to use it.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The meetings should not be monotonous; they can be conducted in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>NEEDING THE PRAYER AND</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>COORDINATION OF THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The children s meetings should be in many locations, at different times, and use different methods.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Moreover, the teachers must have a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We should be open.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We are taking this way to nourish our children and gain many more children so that the gospel can be preached to their unbelieving families.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There are many benefits.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We hope that all the saints will pray concerning this matter and not take it lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We especially hope that the older sisters can open their homes and gather some children to have children s meetings once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It should not be too difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>There will be results.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This requires everyone s cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The saints who serve either full time or part time and are under thirty years old should not excuse themselves from teaching in the children s meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>As long as there is no conflict in their schedule, they have an obligation to serve as teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is in addition to their gospel work in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The serving saints who are over thirty years of age need to strengthen the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>There are saints who are assigned to work with the small groups, but also everyone should participate and become pillars in the small groups to strengthen the meetings.</S>
