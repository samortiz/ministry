   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. As the One Grain of Wheat</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Bearing Many Grains</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In His resurrection Christ, as the one grain of wheat, bore many grains John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through Christ's death and resurrection the one grain, Christ, became the many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a single grain of wheat is sown into the earth, it grows and eventually produces many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In a sense, the original grain ceases to exist; it becomes the many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the many grains together equal the original grain.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since Christ is in us, the many grains, He is wherever we are.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, He has become us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is the aggregate grain, and we are the many grains produced by His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To Be His Increase</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The many grains produced by Christ's resurrection are His increase John 3:30a .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Farmers make a living by the increase of their seed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They sow a relatively small quantity of seed into the earth, and after three months they reap a large harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That harvest is the increase of the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Jesus was on the earth traveling in the holy land, He was the unique grain.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But today, consider how many "Christs" there are on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are not only thousands but millions around the globe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the vine mentioned in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This great vine covers the entire globe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church, which is Christ 1 Cor 12:12 as His increase, is the true vine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This too is a product of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is Christ's increase, propagation, and surplus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fourth stanza of Hymns, #203 reads:</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We're Thy total reproduction,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thy dear Body and Thy Bride,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thine expression and Thy fulness</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For Thee ever to abide.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are Thy continuation,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thy life-increase and Thy spread,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thy full growth and Thy rich surplus,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One with Thee, our glorious Head.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this verse a number of words are used to express the fact that the church is Christ's increase and expansion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As the Components of His Body</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>the One Bread, the Church</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, the many grains as the increase of Christ are the components of His Body, that is, the one bread, the church Eph 1:22-23; 1 Cor 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every Lord's Day we take the Lord's table to participate in the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That bread signifies, first, Christ's physical body, which He gave up for us on the cross, and, second, Christ's mystical Body, which is the one bread, the church.</S>
