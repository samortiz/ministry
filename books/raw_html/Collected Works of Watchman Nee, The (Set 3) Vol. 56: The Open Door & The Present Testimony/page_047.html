<h2 class="head2">Serving Diligently (Changchun)</h2><p>By the Lord's mercy, Brother Zuo-xin and I went to Talien, Shenyang and held ten-day conferences. The Lord gave us grace, and His word made the way clearer. We really could not meet the need in each place, but could only humble ourselves at God's feet and ask for more bread for our friends in the way. We are weak, but zealous, and we are prepared to serve diligently at any time. We have lost too much in the past. Now we are repaying our debt in sackcloth and ashes. We seize the opportunities to set the way before many people.</p><p>Hua Tien-min<br />December 8, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">The Way of Unity (Peking)</h2><p>The table meeting to remember the Lord was started in Shijiazhuang on the eleventh of this month. In the first bread-breaking meeting there were more than forty brothers and sisters who had come out of the China Inland Mission and the Assembly of God. If the Lord gives us mercy, most of the brothers will be happy to go in the way of unity. There has been a beginning in Changxindian recently. Although there have not been many people saved in the Congregationalist Church and the Assembly of God, they are all willing to come this way. They have seen God's blessing in the gospel. They have seen that God is going on in this way in unity. We can only give praise, thanks, and glory to the God whom we serve.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Caleb Yen<br />February 21, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">May We See and Follow (Hankow)</h2><p>During the few times of fellowship with the brothers, we all tasted the sweetness of the Lord's love and saw the living stones that had passed through carving.</p><p>Today we had a meeting with the leader of the Jesus Family and a few brothers from the Assembly of God and the Lutheran Church. Some professors from the United Seminary also came to the feast. We had good fellowship. May we see what the Lord wants to do in the church today, and may we follow in the way in which we are supposed to go.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Hou Song-san<br />January 31, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">Dongxiang, Anyang</h2><p>After returning from Shanghai, I realized that the Lord has lit the gospel fire in the villages, especially in Dongxiang, Anyang. Every day many people repent and receive the Lord in some villages, and they are all clearly saved. The Lord has given us grace in our environment, so the brothers' hearts are filled with praise and thanks, and they are full of joy. The newly saved brothers are all burning. They are very fresh and living. Therefore, I feel more and more deeply that we need some older brothers to come give us much help.</p><p>With regard to the matter of unity, I have been asking the Lord to open the door. Most of the people in the denominations here have already turned to come this way. The rest are not clearly saved, and it is very difficult to talk with them. It is a real problem knowing whether or not they will accept the Lord. May the Lord have mercy on them.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Philip Gao<br />January 2, 1951</p>
