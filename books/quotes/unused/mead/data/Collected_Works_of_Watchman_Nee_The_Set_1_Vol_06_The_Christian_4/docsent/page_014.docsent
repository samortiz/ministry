   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE FIVE WHY GOOD MEN GO TO HELL Issue No. 9 Scripture Reading: Luke 18:9-14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This portion of the Bible is a parable told by the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He said that two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, one of the best of persons, and the other was a tax collector, one of the worst of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus said that as a result of their prayers, the wicked tax collector was justified and the good Pharisee was not justified.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What does "to be justified" mean?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To be justified is to be declared innocent in a law court.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To not be justified is to be declared guilty and to receive punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"Justified" is what believers usually mean by "saved."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Making it more plain, "to be justified" is to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To not be justified is to perish and go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus said that a good person goes to hell and a wicked person goes to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A good man goes to hell!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And a wicked man goes to heaven!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yes, this is what the Lord Jesus said.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all think that the good person should go to heaven and the wicked to hell, but the Lord Jesus said that the good person would go to hell and the wicked person to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not be surprised and think that this is new or strange.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If any person is going to heaven, he must be a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In heaven you cannot find a good person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In heaven everyone is a sinner!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What about hell?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are plenty of good people in hell!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not think that you will not go to hell because you are good.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let me say that there are plenty of people in hell just like you!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some are even better than you!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By themselves, those who are both wicked and good should go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By believing in the Lord Jesus, however, good men can go to heaven and wicked men also can go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this parable, our Lord Jesus Christ told a story of a good man going to hell and a wicked man going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who label themselves as a righteous person and think of themselves as an excellent man among men, please listen to the Lord Jesus' words: good men may go to hell!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who humble themselves and confess that they are sinners, judging themselves not worthy to be saved, should not be discouraged because wicked men may go to heaven!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to consider the good man, whom the Lord talked about, who was perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We want to see how good he was, and if he was a good man, why he would still go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 10 says that he was a Pharisee.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Very often we think that Pharisees were hypocrites, the worst people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But this was not always true; they had many good qualities.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Pharisees zealously kept the law Phil 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They were not like the modernists, the Sadducees, who did not believe this or that.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They believed in God's Word and kept God's law and dared not doubt one word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even so, the Lord Jesus said this Pharisee perished!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christians, when coming to revival conferences and walking on the street, often feel shameful when they are seen carrying a big heavy Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We would rather leave it at home and come to the meeting without a Bible or with a small New Testament to avoid men's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are afraid that people will call us superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are afraid of being ridiculed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But it was not so with the Pharisees: they wrote Scripture on the fringes of their garments, they were not afraid of being ridiculed, and they were bold to confess to everyone that they believed in God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I know of many Christians who dare not pray and give thanks for the meal before men when they go to an unbeliever's home or an unbelieving friend comes to their home for a meal!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since their consciences bother them if they do not give thanks, they pray to God in their heart with open eyes!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How shy they are!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How timid!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They dare not admit that they are Christians before others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This was not the situation with the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They would pray at the crosswalk.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Let us not mention what kind of motive they may have had; their outward performance alone was much higher than that of ordinary Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, the Lord Jesus said that this Pharisee was fallen and would go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Pharisees were high class people in the society of those days.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They were a very gentle, noble, and cultured people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But God does not care for social status.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is righteous; He will not regret sending you to hell if you deserve it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not say in your heart, "Is it possible for people like me so fine, so gentle, so smart with a Ph.D. degree, and so rich to go to hell?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Let me say that there are plenty of people just like you in hell, even some wiser, prettier, richer, and gentler than you!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A person is never too good to go to hell!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord Jesus said that this Pharisee would perish.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although he was one of the high class, he would perish.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>So please do not depend on your social status.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When this gentle Pharisee came to pray at the temple, he prayed, "God!"</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Luke 18:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Please listen to this word, "God."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He was neither an atheist nor a fool, since he did not say that there was no God; neither was he a wicked person doing evil and abominable deeds Psa 14:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He believed that there was a God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even though he could not see Him, he knew that God is clearly seen since the creation of the world Rom 1:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He was not an unreligious person; he believed that there was a God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In spite of this, he still was not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He could not avoid going to hell and perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He was a very pious and religious man; he came to God's presence and prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He was a good man.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Nevertheless, the Lord said that this pious, good man was going to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Please remember that a good man, who even believes that there is a God, can go to hell!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What will happen to those who do not believe!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Pharisee prayed, "God, I thank You that I am not like the rest of men," and then he named many types of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He told the Lord that he was not evil like the rest of men, that he had not committed as many sins as others and that he was among the best of men, unlike others.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Indeed, this Pharisee was a good man!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He was rare among men!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Yet the Lord said that this unusually good man would go to hell and perish forever.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You may think, "Perhaps this Pharisee was going to hell because he was a hypocrite.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If he was genuinely good, he would surely go to heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But there is no indication that he was a hypocrite.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I can tell you that he was indeed rare among men, yet there are other people who are also moral.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He was truly a morally perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He prayed saying that he did not sin as others and had many good points.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Lord did not deny this; He did not say that the Pharisee's words were false.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>For this reason we know that he must have been a good person.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Furthermore, in verse 9 the Lord indicated that he was "righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This proves that he was an ideally good man.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But good men go to hell, and good men should go to hell!</S>
