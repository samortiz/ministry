   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONENESS IN THE MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, this is still in the realm of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To have the practice of the new man we must know who Christ is and where Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ today is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 and He is in our spirit Rom 8:16; 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The life-giving Spirit, Christ, is now in our spirit, and these two spirits mingle together to form the spirit of the mind Eph 4:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians 4:23 says that we are being renewed in the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our minds are being renewed through our realization that Christ as the life-giving Spirit is mingled with our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is uncommon today to hear a message concerning the mingled spirit or on being renewed in the spirit of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some who have never heard of the mingled spirit may teach that it is sufficient for us to read the Bible, win souls, and glorify God by our good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, Ephesians 4:23 is vital and crucial to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The key to putting off the old man 4:22 and putting on the new man 4:24 is in being renewed in the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brothers who live together could not always be happy with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1935 I was placed with some other co-workers who stayed together with me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After only two or three hours I became unhappy with one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although I would have reacted in a wrong way, the Spirit within constrained me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even when I was unable to be pleasant, the Spirit within me was able.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do have such a wonderful Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are all one only because Christ as the life-giving Spirit is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We love Him and we live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we live by Him, we are happy with all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After this incident, I praised the Lord and gave Him all the thanks for these wonderful co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They all became lovely and pleasant to me because I was in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is in the spirit that we are one, and it is in the spirit that we are in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord desires to show His lovers that He does not care that we have anything but Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is our life, He is our person, and He is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What He wants is that we would live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this we will have the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In every nation there will be so many small groups living together by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These will be the local churches which are composed into the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the new man is brought into full existence, we will not speak of the differences between the churches or of the jurisdiction and autonomy of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time we will all be living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only Christ will be among us and only Christ will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you go to Brazil, you will see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you go to Britain, you will see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you go to Italy, France, Japan, China, Korea, or the Philippines, you will see nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There will be no need to say that we all are one Christ will be each one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is with you, Christ is with me, Christ is with every believer, and Christ is with every local church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There will be no need to merely speak about oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We will simply live out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This will be the ultimate church life, a universal new man living out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This will conclude this age, usher in the kingdom, and bring Christ back.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually this new man will become the loving bride to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some will take the ecumenical way, tolerating each other amidst many differences, but at the same time the Lord will be working out everything to gain the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All the saints in many countries throughout the world will speak the same thing 1 Cor 1:10 , the unique Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We will only speak Christ because we will be living Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is our life, and He is our person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is the life-giving Spirit within our spirit, and all the time, in everything, we are turning to our spirit and growing into this unique Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What is here in the Lord's recovery is nothing but Christ, and this Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You cannot be an individual believer, and you cannot keep your local church separate from all the others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today is the day to have a new man constituted with all the local churches, including all the saints as one in Christ, who is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This vision will rescue us from all things other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you have seen this vision, you will count all things as refuse compared with Christ Phil 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You could not care for anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As we all live Him out, we will see the perfection of the new man on the earth.</S>
