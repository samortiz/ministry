   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD IS WILLING Issue No. 31 Scripture Reading: John 3:16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Most people in this world do not like to be misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometimes good intentions can be misunderstood as bad intentions, or love can be misunderstood as hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are many undesirable things in this world, and being misunderstood is certainly one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the most misunderstood One in the whole world is God!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The misunderstanding we experience is only a fraction of what God experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is the most misunderstood One in the whole world!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I read a story in the newspaper a few days ago.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There was a so-called pastor who was a very aged man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One day he met a young man on the street who said, "Oh, a terrible thing has happened to me!"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While he was speaking, tears began to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The pastor asked him what was the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He replied, "Terrible!" and then he cried.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the young man was asked again, he brought out a letter from his pocket and said, "This was mailed to me from a lawyer."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The pastor asked, "Have you read it?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He answered, "Not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I dare not read it because I am afraid something unusual has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lawyers' notices never bring good news."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The pastor replied, "Read the letter, and find out what has happened."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The young man answered, "It is bad luck for anyone to receive a letter from a lawyer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I do not like to receive a lawyer's letter."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The pastor offered, "Well, let me read it for you."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The young man agreed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After the pastor read the letter, he asked the young man, "You really have not read this letter?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The young man replied, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The pastor then told him, "This letter is to notify you that one of your relatives has died and left you an inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The executor is at a certain place now, and you may go there and receive more than twenty thousand dollars."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brothers and sisters, our attitude toward God is just like this young man's. When we hear the name God, we do not like it and feel uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It seems as if God is hard to deal with and does not have good intentions toward men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are two groups of people sitting here today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One group has heard about God and believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The other group has not believed in God and in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I know that those who have believed can give a testimony that before they believed in God, the very name God or Jesus would make them unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They were like the young man who did not want to read the lawyer's letter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But after they truly believed, they all wished that they had believed earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The profit one receives in believing in Jesus is far better than receiving an inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What God has said is much better than what the lawyer said to the young man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God's Word tells us that those who believe in the Lord Jesus will go to heaven and have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I also can give the same testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today the first thing I will exhort you to do is not be afraid of hearing about God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not think that God has bad intentions toward you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you are willing to listen and if you hear what I say, you will know what kind of God He is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A number of years ago, as I was preaching in Southeast Asia, I met a child.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I told him to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He said, "Mr. Nee, I can be friends with you, but believing in Jesus is not a good thing to do." When I met him the second time I again asked him to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He answered me the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I then asked him why he thought this way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He said, "I had a brother who believed in Jesus when he was six years old, and then he died.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If I believe in Jesus and then die just like my brother, what good is it to me?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Oh, he misunderstood God!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How did he misunderstand God?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He misunderstood God's heart!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Please close your eyes and think for a moment about how you view God?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You may think God has a black face and is evil and strict.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You may think that God wants to see man sin and go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What is your idea about God?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Once I met a relative of mine.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He had a Ph.D. and was a professor at Manchuria University.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I exhorted him to believe in the Lord Jesus at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He said, "Your God is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Your God does nothing good in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>From heaven He records the evil deeds of this person and that person.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He does it like bookkeeping, and He uses this book to judge and condemn people to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Your God does not have a good heart.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All He does in heaven is record the evil deeds of all kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His heart is very devious, and He wishes men to go to hell."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Oh, he misunderstood God!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He misunderstood God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You may think, "God hates me.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He does not want me to be saved; He is anxiously waiting to condemn me and bring me to perdition; He wants me to go to hell."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, I must tell you today that I know my God!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>My message today is to tell you one thing; if you really understand the message, you will not give up this God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Now I beg you to listen to the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world"!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Please pay attention: God is love!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is so wonderful that God is not only thinking about you, caring for you, paying attention to you, and being merciful to you, He also loves you.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A few days ago I was strolling in a park and met a classmate of mine.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I asked him to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I continually exhorted him, but he would not accept.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the end I almost burst into tears.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If he only knew how loving God is toward him!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Men very easily misunderstand God's love!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You might think, "What kind of God is this God?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Does He want to save me?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Can He save a person like me?"</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Men are always full of doubts.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But God not only is merciful toward you, He not only cares for you and pays attention to you, He also loves you.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Throughout the ages, the most difficult thing God has done is love men.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>After man sinned, the first thing God did was love.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>God is full of good intention toward men.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He is anxious for men to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>You may think that He is fierce and vicious and that He likes to see you far away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But God gave us this book, the Bible, the Word of God, which tells us that God is love!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Even though you are a sinner, God loves you.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Even though you are far away from God, He loves you.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Time after time, God sent His servants to tell men about His intentions.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>He said, "Can a woman forget her nursing child, / That she would not have compassion on the son of her womb?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>/ Even though they may forget, / Yet I will not forget you" Isa 49:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Oh, He so loved us.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He once used a good illustration: "If a man divorces his wife / And she goes from him / And becomes another man's wife, / Will he return to her again?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>/ Will not that land be / Utterly polluted?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>But you have committed fornication with many lovers.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>/ Yet return to Me" Jer 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Oh, God is so willing to accept sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>But men do not believe that God loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>They always doubt that God can be so nice.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>But I have to say that God is love!</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>God so loved the world that He decided that He Himself would come to the earth and become flesh in order to show men His love.</S>
