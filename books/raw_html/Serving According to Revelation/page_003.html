        <h2 class="head1">NATURAL SERVICE</h2>
<p>Natural service does not depend upon fellowship with the Lord, and it can be carried out without any inward sense or burden. For example, some responsible brothers may make arrangements to visit the brothers and sisters, and we may visit them because we do not want to feel bad. This, however, is an indication that we do not have a burden from the Lord. Our visitation, thus, will be related only to outward arrangements and outward needs, not to an inward burden. In other words, our service does not come out of contacting God but from the influence of an outward situation. This kind of service is natural.</p>
<p>Sometimes when we hear that a brother or sister has grown cold and is no longer meeting with the church, we consider visiting them out of a sense of duty. Even though this sense of duty is better than merely accepting the arrangement of others, such a service is still natural. It is not according to revelation; rather, it is based on outward situations, not inner revelation. Similarly, we may hear that a certain brother is sick, and we visit him only because we have some sympathy for him. Such a seemingly good intention is still natural; it is not based on revelation. Whatever has not passed through God or does not come from our contacting of God is merely natural service, no matter how good or necessary it may seem to be; it is not service according to revelation.</p>
<p>When we act without contacting God or letting God touch us, that is, when we act according to outward needs, a sense of duty, or good intentions, the result may seemingly be good, but it will, in fact, be quite different in nature from what comes out of contacting God. One result involves inward shining, whereas the other does not. One result is according to revelation, whereas the other is natural. One result comes out of contacting God, whereas the other comes out of environmental influences.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXAMPLE OF ABRAHAM AND LOT</h2>
<p>Abraham&rsquo;s service to God was according to revelation. He left Ur of the Chaldeans and journeyed from Haran to Canaan. There he pitched his tent and built an altar to serve God. His actions were the result of the God of glory appearing to him. He met God and received revelation from God (Gen. 12:1-8; 13:1-4, 14-18; Acts 7:2-3). All his actions came out of God&rsquo;s appearing and revelation. All his actions were governed by God&rsquo;s appearing and revelation.</p>
<p>Lot, however, did not have God&rsquo;s appearing or God&rsquo;s revelation. All his actions were governed by Abraham&rsquo;s moves, not God&rsquo;s revelation. When Abraham went out of Ur, Lot went with him (Gen. 11:31). When Abraham went out of Haran, Lot again went with him (12:4). When Abraham went to Canaan, Lot went with him to Canaan as well (v. 5). Lot never met God; he only followed a man.</p>
<p>Many brothers and sisters serve God as Lot did. They have not contacted God or received revelation from Him; they have been influenced merely by men, and they are following men and imitating men. When others serve, they serve. When others preach the gospel, they preach the gospel. Such service has little spiritual value, and it will not last long or stand when tested.</p>
<p>Abraham&rsquo;s service came out of meeting God and receiving revelation from God; hence, his service was able to stand. Even though he went down to Egypt in a moment of weakness, his service was still recovered before God (v. 9&mdash;13:4). Lot, however, did not meet God or receive revelation from God; his service was based on his being influenced by another and his following after another. Therefore, it could not stand the test and did not endure. Once Lot entered Sodom, he could not recover his service to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVING ACCORDING TO REVELATION</h2>
<p>Our service must come from meeting the Lord, seeing light, and receiving revelation. We should not do something simply because others are doing it. If we meet the Lord and receive revelation, we will be unable to not do as the Lord desires. Consider the matter of visitation. We should not regard the arrangement of the church merely as a routine and visit the saints accordingly. We still need revelation in order to know how to carry out the matter of visitation and to know what to say when we see the brothers and sisters. In this way our visitation will not only be according to the arrangement of the church but also according to an inward burden and revelation. Apparently, it is the arrangement of the church, but actually, it is related to the burden that comes from revelation. Sometimes, the church may not even have an arrangement, but we still have a burden that comes from revelation. Only this kind of service has spiritual value, and only it will be able to stand the test and endure. We must pay attention to this very important matter; otherwise, our service will be empty and short-lived.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING REVELATION</h2>
<p>Some may ask, &ldquo;How can we receive revelation?&rdquo; On the one hand, we need God&rsquo;s mercy, but on the other hand, we also must bear the responsibility to seek the Lord&rsquo;s shining and revelation. We must remove everything in us that covers the light and hinders us from receiving revelation. We must condemn our natural zeal, reject our natural service, and turn our heart to the Lord. Then we will receive light and revelation.</p>
<p>In order for a person to have revelation, he must meet God, contact God, and touch God. God is light (1 John 1:5), and in the universe, only God is the source of light. All light and revelation come from Him. When we meet God, we will see light and receive revelation. Revelation is man meeting God; it is God shining His light into man and causing man to see.</p>
<p>In order for us to meet God, we must turn our whole heart to the Lord, wanting nothing more and nothing less than His will. Second Corinthians 3:16 says that whenever our heart turns to the Lord, the veil that covers us is taken away. Matthew 5:8 says that the pure in heart will see God. Hence, absolute consecration and thorough dealings are necessary. Whatever is not purely for God, is not out of God, does not come from meeting God, or is not done through contacting God must be dealt with and rejected. We must desire nothing apart from God, have no veil covering us before God, and have no barrier between us and God. Then we can see God face to face, be shined upon, and receive revelation from Him. When we turn to Him, draw near to Him, and fellowship with Him, it will be easy for Him to anoint His heart&rsquo;s desire into us and give us a sense and a burden. This sense and burden become our revelation.</p>
<p>Natural service can be done according to prior knowledge and past experiences without contacting the Lord. Service according to revelation comes from the immediacy of our fellowship with the Lord in His presence. Once we lose our fellowship with the Lord in His presence, the shining of light and the receiving of revelation are lost as well. Service according to revelation requires that we abide in the Lord, fellowship with the Lord, and seek, look at, and depend on the Lord. Everyone who desires to serve according to revelation must live in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, abide in the Lord, and contact the Lord.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
