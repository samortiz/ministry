   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FELLOWSHIP BEING NEEDED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In coordination, the first matter is authority, and the second matter is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Co-workers Being Those to Whom</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We Can Open Up Our Heart</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A basic need among co-workers is that they be ones to whom we can open up our heart and with whom we can have fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Coordination opposes individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Coordination is for the service of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is we who serve, but we serve according to the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we need the mutual fellowship, having our hearts open to one another and helping one another.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a member rejoices, the entire Body rejoices.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a member suffers, the whole Body suffers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a member is sorrowful, the whole Body is sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is called coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Two Persons Being as One Man</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Several people living together is not necessarily coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose a brother has a very thick, heavy, solid outer shell; whether he lives alone or with ten people, he remains an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not coordination, and he is not in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many people, whether they are alone or with ten people, pray, seek God, speak to God, and seek the will of God as individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How can we say that this is coordination?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Putting two people together as co-workers does not mean putting two individuals together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do we see this?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must not have the misconception that this is coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Formerly, we worked by ourselves; now two are working together.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If one person is working alone, he is working individualistically.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If two persons are working together as two individuals, there is still no coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is useless if one person is an individual or if two persons remain as individuals!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Formerly, one person was working, but now two persons need to work together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When two or three get together, what should they do?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They need to be in one accord!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that before God we are able to open up to our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Needing to Disclose Our Affairs</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>to the Co-workers</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many brothers cannot pray with other brothers at all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No one knows their affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They cannot open up to other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many people can bear their difficulties alone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They will not consult with other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They may have many difficulties, but when they encounter problems, they still hold on to their individualism, thinking that they can handle their own problems and solve them before God by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please remember, we may live among brothers, but our spirit may not be with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our body may be among the brothers, but we may not live like a member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to coordinate we need to recognize authority, and we absolutely need to know what fellowship is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To fellowship, one should be able to open up to others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such a one has several co-workers by his side; they are the ones to whom he opens his affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He can say to them, Brothers and sisters, I cannot get through in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How should I take care of it? or Brothers and sisters, I cannot get through in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Can you pray together with me?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Please remember, people who cannot bear others burdens cannot coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>People who cannot open up their heart to others, also cannot coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Needing to Bear Others Burdens</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some people are full of their own burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is absolutely no way for them to bear anyone else s burden because they only think about themselves day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever someone asks them to pray for him, they do not pray.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever someone asks them to pay attention to a certain matter, they do not take care of it; rather, they leave that matter uncared for and unattended.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you ask them how this matter should be handled, they have no heart to pay any attention to it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is no coordination with them whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They still strongly hold on to their individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although they are members of the Body, they still act independently.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For example, if I cut off my finger and leave it in Nanking, it would be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Likewise, if I sever my leg so that it loses its oneness and fellowship with the body, it would be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The basic principle of the Body is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, the basic principle of the work is also fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are used to accommodating ourselves, bearing our own responsibilities, and not paying attention to others affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today we need to learn to bear the burden of others and to bear the burden with others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may feel that this is very difficult; we may feel that it is hard to obey others, and we may even feel that it is hard to fellowship with others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Needing to Seek For Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I do not mean that some among us should not be responsible before God for our own affairs and that we should just cast these affairs upon other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The word I have spoken is not to those who are lazy before God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It does not mean that we need not be desperate before God and that we need not seek and ask before God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It means that we are still responsible toward God, that we still draw near to the Lord, and that we still seek after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should not cast our responsibility on others without bearing any of it ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It means that when we bear our responsibility, we always seek fellowship with other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When I see that there are important things that are very much related to my future, I need to say, Brother, would you have some fellowship with me, consider with me, and seek together with me how I should handle this matter?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Would you wait on the Lord together with me?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should take up our own burden and also coordinate and fellowship with other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We need fellowship and coordination not only in our daily living but also in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We need to learn to be an open person.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Many brothers and sisters can open up only after others open up.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is not easy to ask them to be an open person.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Many people will open up only when others open up to them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is good to have someone open up to you first, but you should also open up.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You need to learn to be an open person.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Brothers and sisters, I can tell you this, that one day when you are really clear about the principle of fellowship, you will be amazed at how some Christians whom you consider not so capable can render you such great help.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Those members whom you consider not very useful can strengthen your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is something that you would never have thought of, something completely outside of your expectation.</S>
