   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-TWO IN ADAM AND IN CHRIST Date: October 18, 1936, evening</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Kulangsu</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 5:17 OUR INHERITANCE IN ADAM The Power to Sin</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's way of redemption is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man thinks that he has to do something before he can be saved, but God does not want us to do anything in order to be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God does not do anything in man; He does everything in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Satan's work was concentrated in Adam, whereas God's work is consummated in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to understand one thing before we can know God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do you know how man sins?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Does he have to make up his mind to sin?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Friends, what do you have to do to lose your temper?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do you have to think about it for a night, saying, "I will lose my temper tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Tonight I do not have the strength to lose it; I am too weak.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I wish I could lose my temper tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I will make up my mind to lose my temper tomorrow"?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Is there such a thing?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One does not need to make up his mind to lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no need to exert any effort for he can lose his temper effortlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no effort involved in committing sins; it only takes effort to try to not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can illustrate this by considering light and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The electrical power company helps us to remove darkness by supplying us with light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But it is interesting that there is no darkness company.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to pay for light, but there is no need to pay for darkness; it comes by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you need some darkness in your home, do you have to buy it from a darkness company?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No, darkness comes spontaneously; there is no need to exert any effort.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, if you want the light, you will need to exert some effort; you will need to pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the same way, there is no need to exert any effort to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But it takes much effort to try to not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Nature of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Man does not need to pray, make up his mind, or exert any effort to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He sins easily.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no need to prepare for it; it comes spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why does a man not need to try to sin?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why is it so easy for man to sin?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is because to sin is natural.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Doing good is not easy; it is not natural.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why is it so unnatural for man to do good?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible clearly tells us that man has the Adamic nature in him, and the Adamic nature is a sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Romans 5:12 says, "Through one man sin entered into the world."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sin came in through Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who are in Adam have inherited his Adamic sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why it is so natural for us to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Satan wants to see the whole world sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if he induced every individual to sin one by one, it would take too much time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What did he do?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He put the poison in the "fountainhead."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Consequently, everyone who drinks the water will die.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He put the poison in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After Adam sinned, everyone who belongs to Adam spontaneously sins.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It does not take any effort for me to sin today; I do not have to think about it or make up my mind to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As long as I am related to Adam and belong to him, I spontaneously sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, I have inherited the Adamic nature and power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Inheriting Everything that Adam Had</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For this reason, we should not be surprised by what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since the world has such a relationship with Adam, it is natural for the whole world to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is most natural for us to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we want to lose our temper, we can do it in two seconds; there is no need to consciously try.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have inherited the power, mind, and mentality to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because we are in Adam, we inherited everything in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All of Adam becomes all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have nothing; Adam has everything.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are born of him and belong to him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is as if Adam wrote a will for us and gave us all his inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We do not have to learn to commit Adam's sins; we commit the same sins and have inherited the same sins.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Bible says that everything we have is inherited from Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What does it mean to inherit something?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How does an inheritance pass from one person to another?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Suppose you are a father and have earned and saved a great deal of money.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You have a son that you love very much, and you bequeath all your money to him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The money has not been earned by your son; it was earned by you through hard work.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Now you bequeath all of this money to your son.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is an inheritance, and this is what Adam did.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He bequeathed everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We can say that Adam bequeathed much "grace" upon us; there is no need for us to do anything to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Christ has bestowed grace upon us, and it is free.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Adam has bestowed sin upon us as a kind of "grace"; it is also free.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Everyone who is born of Adam has received from him the free "grace" to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hence, we are all sinners today.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>No one needs to make up his mind to sin, yet everyone sins.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We were born sinners, and we sin spontaneously and effortlessly in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Sinning is natural as well as habitual for us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is our inheritance in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He made us a sinner free of charge.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When we are in him, he freely bequeaths to us his power and nature to sin.</S>
