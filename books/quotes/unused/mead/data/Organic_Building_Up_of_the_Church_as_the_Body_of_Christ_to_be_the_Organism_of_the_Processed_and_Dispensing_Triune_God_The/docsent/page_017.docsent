   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Unique Fellowship of the Apostles,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Which Is Uniquely and Universally</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of All the Members of the Organic Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The intrinsic fellowship of the churches is the unique fellowship of the apostles, which is uniquely and universally of all the members of the organic Body of Christ Acts 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The flow was first the fellowship of the divine life of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then this fellowship was passed on to the apostles, who were among the first group of believers on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, this flow became the fellowship of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All of the early apostles were in the flow of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, in those early days, all the believers continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There was only one teaching and one fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The apostles did a wonderful work to impart the divine life into people and bring them into the flow of this divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This flow, this fellowship, became the new believers fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their fellowship was the fellowship of the apostles, and the fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Three of the Godhead are fellowshipping among Themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This fellowship among the Three of the Triune God is with the apostles, and it is also with us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must realize that today in the universe, there is a flow which is just God Himself as the water of life flowing out of the Triune God through the apostles and into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He not only flows into us, but also through us into new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we preach the gospel and the ones to whom we preach receive the Lord Jesus, we are giving them an injection of the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When they receive the water of life, they are brought into this wonderful fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may not fully understand this fellowship, yet it is a wonderful fact.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever we meet a genuine believer, no matter what nationality or race he may be, something jumps within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This experience may be compared to what happened when Mary, the mother of Jesus, went to see Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Elizabeth heard Mary s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb Luke 1:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Something within her was leaping.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John the Baptist exulted v. 44 upon meeting the Savior, while both of them were still in their mothers wombs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may say that there was a fellowship between John the Baptist and Jesus Christ even before they were born.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today we are the mothers who have the Lord Jesus within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we Christians meet one another, something within us jumps.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to go along with the jumping within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That inward jumping is the intrinsic fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This intrinsic, unique fellowship is among all the members of the Body of Christ to make them one, regardless of their outward differences in race or culture.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I was a youth, the Chinese people hated the Japanese because they had invaded China.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I was brought up in that atmosphere, but the Lord saved me, and in 1933 I was called by the Lord to quit my job and serve Him full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The same day that I dropped my job, I received an invitation from Manchuria, inviting me to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>While I was speaking there, some Japanese believers came to me, told me that they were Christians, and invited me to come to their place to share with them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I went to their place and met with them according to their custom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even though I had grown up in an atmosphere in which there was much hatred for the Japanese people, something was jumping within me as I met with them because they were my Christian brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I loved them, and I was so happy to meet with them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My love for them was something in the flow of the divine life, the fellowship, within me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we follow the intrinsic fellowship, there will be no problems between us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we are centered on the outward things, trouble comes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In some places in the United States, the white people and the black people would not meet together to worship the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is because of their centering on outward things rather than on the intrinsic fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Problems among the saints are also due to focusing on something outward rather than on the intrinsic fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christians love one another until they focus on outward things such as what group they meet with or what doctrines they agree on.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One Christian may believe in pre-tribulation rapture, while another believes in post-tribulation rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They may argue and fight over their doctrinal disagreements.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As long as we are centered on doctrines, there will be division.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are many doctrines, but there is only one intrinsic fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we only care for the intrinsic fellowship, the flow of the divine life, which is like the blood circulation in our body, we will be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must limit ourselves to the flow, the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should live in and care for this intrinsic fellowship, which is of the Triune God, of the apostles, and of all the believers.</S>
