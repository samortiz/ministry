	<h2 class="head1">ASSURING THEM THAT THEY ARE SAVED<br />
BY CALLING ON THE LORD</h2>
<p>After they pray, you must have the boldness to assure them with a verse that they are saved, and the best verse is Romans 10:13&mdash;&ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo; You have to give them this verse and assure them with this verse that they have been saved. Do not ask them if they are saved. If you ask them, they would probably say that they do not think, believe, or feel that they are saved. Your responsibility is to assure them that they have been saved. Let them read Romans 10:13.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIRECTING THEM TO BE BAPTIZED</h2>
<p>Then read to them Mark 16:16 which says, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; After they pray and have been given the assurance that the Lord Jesus lives in them, you need to say, &ldquo;Let us be baptized.&rdquo; Do not ask them if they would like to be baptized because you would receive no for an answer most of the time. This is why I say to direct them to be baptized.</p>
<p>According to our experience in Taipei, by using these principles the saints were successful eighty percent of the time. Generally, your contacts will follow your directions. You may be speaking to the husband of a family concerning getting baptized, and at the same time direct the wife to fill up the bathtub with water before he has even decided. Sometimes the wife would even tell the husband to be baptized even though she has not yet decided to be baptized. In Taipei the saints always went out in groups of three or four. While two or three would be baptizing the husband, a sister would be fellowshipping with the wife. After the husband was baptized, then she would say to the wife, &ldquo;Let us be baptized.&rdquo; Most followed this direction. You may be concerned about bringing in some false ones. But you must realize that at the beginning everyone seems to be false. After you preach the gospel to a person, after he believes and is baptized, and after some prayer, this false one becomes a real believer. He is now one with you.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE CHANCE<br />
TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THEM<br />
FOR THE NEXT MEETING</h2>
<p>After you direct someone to be baptized, take the chance to make an appointment with them for the next meeting. Do not ask them if you can meet with them again. This gives them the ground to refuse you. You need to talk with them to induce them to meet with you again. Many times they would ask you if you would come back again. Take this opportunity to make an appointment with them that fits in with their time schedule. When you visit them the next time, you will present more truths and they will get more help. Eventually, you can take the opportunity to make appointments for regular meetings in their homes weekly. Some of the homes that you visit will have already been prepared by the Lord just as the Lord prepared the house of Cornelius (Acts 10:17-33). When Peter went to Cornelius&rsquo;s house, everything was ready. From the time that you knock on the door until you make an appointment for another meeting should take about twenty minutes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOCKING ON DOORS<br />
FOR THE INCREASE OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>I would propose to all the churches that the leading ones should take the lead to practice this, to get some experience either in some homes or in the meeting hall. Then based upon what you have learned in this practice, go out strictly according to all these instructions. I believe that you will &ldquo;close many deals.&rdquo; Go and do it!</p>
<p>We expect all the full-time trainees to go out every day to knock on doors. We are also expecting them to baptize one person a week as a result of this labor. Fifty door knockers will bring in two thousand six hundred yearly. If you do not practice what I am fellowshipping with you, this may seem like a dream. But if you practice this, it is not a dream. Twenty full-timers who knock on doors every day of the week should bring in about one thousand a year. After my study and investigation, I have the full assurance that this is workable. Ten full-timers could bring in forty every month and four hundred eighty new ones in an entire year. It is worthwhile for some to drop their jobs to be the &ldquo;door knockers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would also like to say a word to the elders. Do not merely be an elder in the church service office. Go out to knock on the doors. If a full-time elder would take my word to knock on doors every day, he could bring in fifty-two a year. Suppose you would go seven days a week for about two hours every day. Within these two hours you could knock on at least ten doors. Out of these ten doors perhaps five will open to you. This means thirty-five doors will be opened to you per week. Out of these thirty-five, you can surely baptize one.</p>
<p>We must admit that in the past we had the wrong way, so we wasted much of our time. We had big gatherings for gospel preaching. We labored much and invited people to gospel feasts. When someone came to our feast, this was a great gift to us. We were so grateful that they came, but eventually they disappeared. There was not much increase in the past due to our way. Again I say, if you drop your job to go knock on people&rsquo;s doors for one year, you will bring in fifty-two. I am hoping that in 1987 we will have five hundred full-time workers in the United States. With each one of these full-time workers knocking on doors for two hours each day, seven days a week, within one year we can have an increase of over twenty-five thousand in the United States. We need the persons, and we need the right way. What I am fellowshipping with you is the right way to practice to get the increase. May we all go to practice this.</p>
<p>Not everyone can drop their job, but everyone should be able to go out two hours a week. Seven weeks of this kind of labor equals one full week of a full-time worker&rsquo;s labor. Through this kind of labor, you could bring in at least one every seven weeks. This amounts to a brother bringing in seven every year. If you went out two hours every week, every year you could bring in seven. This means that the churches will have a sevenfold increase. If there were one hundred saints in your locality willing to practice this, you could have seven hundred new ones after one year. With the money-making full-timers there could be a sevenfold increase, and with the job-dropping full-timers we could have a fifty-two fold increase.</p>
<p>As a conclusion to our fellowship in this chapter, it would be good to sing <em>Hymns,</em> 473. We all need to take the charge in stanza three of this hymn to rise up and strike the holy bargain&mdash;the fragment for the whole. &ldquo;All things are yours when you are His, and He and you are one.&rdquo;</p>
