   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Knowing the Spiritual Stage of the New Ones</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in Order to Help Them in a Particular Way</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we do not know where we are or where those whom we contact are, our fellowship with them will be very general.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Of course, this is better than nothing, and for the first few contacts this may be good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For the long run, however, we need further learning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then we will know where we are, and we will know where others are.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We will know what we are short of, and we will be able to help others to the extent of our own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then the whole church will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Otherwise, we will simply meet together in a general way without being clear or knowing what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not only the service groups but also every local church with an adequate eldership must help the saints to go on in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At first, the church life may be only in the sixth grade, but after a few years we will advance to junior high, high school, and eventually college.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the same time, some of the new ones will still be in junior high and even in nursery school.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a whole, however, the church will be at a higher level of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This requires us not merely to give messages week after week.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, we must know how to help the saints at every level, just as in America today we have all the different levels of education.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because of this, to be an elder in the proper church life is not an easy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must all see that this is the proper way of shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Otherwise, we will not be clear what we are doing for the long run.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must know people s spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we will know where they are and what they need.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We will realize whether or not we can afford them what they need, and we will go on to experience something further.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what it means to shepherd people according to the experiences of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is a very definite and particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I took this way for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that time, I had no desire to speak concerning other things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I was burdened only to help each one whom I contacted.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I would either pray with someone, give a testimony about a particular experience, or read a portion of the Word or a few pages of a book with him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes I would ask two other brothers to come with me to help a certain person, or I would invite him to dinner for the purpose of helping him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After a few weeks like this, I could see that the new one received a particular and definite help.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should both bring the new ones into the present flow of the church in a general way and render them the help they need in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not all the new ones are able to enjoy whatever the church is enjoying at the present time, although they can enjoy it to some extent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, we should realize their real situation and discern their real need.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we can minister to them what they need.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The new ones are like the patients of a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They do not know their real condition, but the doctor should know.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then he can determine the kind of dose or treatment they need.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sometimes patients do not understand what the doctor is prescribing to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A good doctor does not always explain the treatment to people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He may simply give the patient a good-tasting medicine and let it work on the patient.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In a general way, we should keep all the saints in the present flow of the church, but in particular, we should know what someone s real need is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we can supply that particular need to each particular person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>HELPING PEOPLE TO COME INTO</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE GENUINE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must always help people to come into the genuine experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In principle we all know this, but this is a matter of experience, not of knowing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How much we can help people depends upon how much we have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we have not experienced much of Christ, we will not be able to help others experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must all realize that today Christ is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Certain ones advised me not to minister concerning Christ being the life-giving Spirit, saying that people will be offended and not receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Nevertheless, I have received a vision from the Lord, and I must tell people that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is not a mere doctrine; it is for people to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I was in Christianity for many years, and I heard much talk concerning Christ being our life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, not many people experience this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we would ask what people mean by saying that Christ is life, how Christ can be our life, and where Christ is our life, almost no one will be able to answer properly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In John 15:4, the Lord said, Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Andrew Murray wrote a book entitled Abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I read this book, and I have read portions of it several times.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This book may be considered a marvelous masterpiece.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, it does not tell us the particular way to abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hudson Taylor also experienced abiding in Christ according to John 15, and we received help from him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Still, our own experience and practice show that without Romans 8, the way to abide in Christ is vague.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Romans 8:6 says, The mind set on the spirit is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>By this we can know who Christ is and where He is.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Forty years ago I was groping for the way to experience Christ, but now we have found the switch in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The way to experience Christ is to build up a habit of remaining in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must realize that today our Christ is the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life, dwelling in our spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>2, 11, 16; 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This Spirit of life is none other than Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now we must have the definite particular experience of living in our spirit, which is life Rom 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For many years I knew Galatians 2:20, which says, It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, I did not know how Christ could live in me.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The way to experience the Christ who lives in us is by realizing that He is the life-giving Spirit and that we have a human spirit that has been regenerated and enlivened by Christ and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is no limit to this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Even when he was older, the apostle Paul still longed to know more of Christ Phil 3:8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To know Christ and the power of His resurrection is without limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>More than thirty years ago I received help from a certain elderly sister.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When I went to visit her, she testified that something serious had happened to her and that when she went to the Lord to inquire about it, the Lord spoke, To know Him and the power of His resurrection v. 10 . The next time I visited her, she testified that something even more serious had happened, but when she went to the Lord to inquire about it, He again spoke the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I received much help and was built up by her testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Because she herself had received the experience of Christ as resurrection power, she knew that I was short of it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This was her way of shepherding me.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>To experience Christ in this way is a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>On the one hand, I am very happy with what the Lord is doing today, but at the same time my heart is aching over the present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There are thousands of Christians who know almost nothing about how to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They know how to be excited, sing, and praise in a general, emotional, and religious way, but when we try to fellowship with them, we realize that they have little actual experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is the poverty of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We ourselves must not think that we are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Whether or not we are rich depends upon how much experience of Christ we have.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is a great need today.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We all need to learn the real experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Then we will have something solid and rich with which to supply those who are under our care.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Otherwise, we are only carrying out a religious work to bring people to the meetings and the service without much of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This is merely a religion, something godly without the presence of Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is a great matter that requires our continual exercise.</S>
