Christ&#8217;s living in us also enables us to be found in Him, who has become the realm in which we live and our unique expression. Christ&#8217;s living in us also enables us to count all things as loss and refuse that we may gain Him. All things, such as religion, philosophy, and culture, and other worldly, material things, can hinder and frustrate us from partaking of and enjoying the unique, excellent Christ. He also causes us to know Him, that is, to know and enjoy Him in our experience; to know the power of His resurrection, that is, the resurrection life that raised Him from the dead; and to know the fellowship of His sufferings, that is, to participate in Christ&#8217;s sufferings. Furthermore, Christ&#8217;s living in us causes us to be conformed to His death, that is, to be molded by His death into the form of His death, so that we do not have our natural life, our old man, or the activities of our self. Moreover, when we are suffering persecution, encountering afflictions, and even suffering martyrdom because of our loving Him, He infuses and dispenses all His riches into us that we may be strengthened to overcome and thus delivered from every evil work. He also enables us to enjoy Him as our sufficient grace and overshadowing power, overshadowing us in our weaknesses.<h2 class=head3>QUESTIONS</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly explain the meaning of being found in Christ.</li><li>Why is it that in order to gain Christ we must count all things as loss and refuse?</li><li>What is the difference between having the excellency of the knowledge of Christ in Philippians 3:8 and knowing Christ in 3:10?</li><li>What is the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, and how can we know and experience it?</li><li>How can we be conformed to Christ&#8217;s death?</li></ol><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth Lessons, Level 2, Vol. 4 &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
