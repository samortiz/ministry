<h1 class="title">RELYING ON THE SPIRIT<br />
TO CARRY OUT THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD THROUGH PRAYER</h1>

<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE SPIRIT<br />
IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE GOD</h2>
<p>Throughout the generations, those who have truly known the Lord and touched life have acknowledged that in order to know the Lord we must know life and experience life. However, in order to experience God as life, we must know the Spirit. Regrettably, our knowledge of the Spirit is deficient. Even those who carry out the ministry of the word do not know and speak of the Spirit in a complete or accurate way. There are thousands of books in Christianity, but it is rare to find a message on knowing the Spirit in our experience. However, according to the structure of the Bible, the speaking concerning the Spirit increases as the divine revelation unfolds.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN CONCERNING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Coming as the Spirit</h2>
<p>John 14 marks a turn in the revelation of the Lord&rsquo;s coming in the flesh to His coming as the Spirit. Verses 2 and 3 say, &ldquo;I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be.&rdquo; There is much debate in regard to this verse. Some expositors think that <em>coming again</em> refers to the second coming of the Lord Jesus at the end of this age. This is not accurate. <em>Coming again</em> refers to the Lord Jesus coming as the Spirit to enter into the disciples after His resurrection.</p>
<p>Verses 18 and 19 say, &ldquo;I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you. Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.&rdquo; The time between the Lord&rsquo;s going and His coming is only &ldquo;a little while,&rdquo; and even though the world could not see Him, the Lord promised His disciples that they would see Him. According to these verses, the Lord&rsquo;s going and coming again did not involve centuries or even decades; rather, it was only a matter of three days and three nights, the period after His death and before His resurrection. After His death and resurrection, He came back to be with His disciples. On the evening of His resurrection, the Lord came into the midst of His disciples, and when the disciples saw Him, they rejoiced (20:19-20). This fulfilled the Lord&rsquo;s word in 14:18-19: &ldquo;I am coming to you...The world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me.&rdquo; His coming was His coming as the Spirit (v. 17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Having a Spiritual Body<br />
after His Death and Resurrection</h2>
<p>Some say that on the evening of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus came only with a resurrected body because He allowed one of the disciples to touch the mark of the nails on His hands and put his hand into His side (20:27). Because He came with a resurrected body with flesh and bones, they are unwilling to admit that the Lord Jesus came as the Spirit.</p>
<p>Although He came with a resurrected body, He is the Spirit in resurrection. A brother who could not understand this point once asked me to explain. I replied by asking, &ldquo;Brother, is the Lord Jesus living in you?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Of course, He lives in me.&rdquo; Then I asked, &ldquo;Is the Lord Jesus who lives in you the resurrected Lord?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yes, He is the resurrected Lord.&rdquo; Finally I asked, &ldquo;After the Lord Jesus was resurrected, did He have a body with flesh and bones?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;According to Luke 24:39, when the Lord appeared in the midst of the disciples, He had flesh and bones.&rdquo; So I said, &ldquo;Then the Lord Jesus who is in you as the Spirit must have a resurrected body.&rdquo; He had no answer.</p>
<p>On one hand, the Bible clearly says that the Lord Jesus has a resurrected body, but on the other hand, it tells us that the Lord Jesus lives in us as the Spirit. If we consider this matter only with our mind, it is beyond our comprehension. Just because we cannot comprehend something with our mind, however, does not mean that it is not possible. Even with all the theories and proofs that the scientists have concerning the universe, there are numerous unsearchable mysteries about the universe. While we cannot begin to comprehend God, it is even beyond our comprehension to understand the universe created by God. If we would acknowledge that our understanding of such matters is limited, we would be able to declare that the Lord is both the Spirit and has a resurrected body with flesh and bones. The Lord Jesus, who came as the Spirit in John 20, appeared with a resurrected body with flesh and bones. Even though this is beyond our understanding, it does not change the fact that the Lord Jesus came as the Spirit.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Leading the Young People with the Word and the Spirit &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
