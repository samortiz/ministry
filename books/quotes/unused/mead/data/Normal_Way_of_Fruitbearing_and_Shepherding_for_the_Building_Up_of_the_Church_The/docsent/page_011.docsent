   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING CARED FOR BY CARING FOR OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the divine economy of the Bible, if we desire to receive, we need to give.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we water others, we ourselves will be watered, and if we desire to grow in life, we need to help others to grow Prov 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we help others to grow in life, we ourselves will have the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The way to receive is to give, and the more we give, the more we receive Luke 6:38; Acts 20:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we should not believe our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our situation with respect to whether we are good or bad, useful or not useful, is a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not say that we can do nothing and are not useful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, we need to say, Satan, get away from me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I can do something, I have something, and I am useful in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should declare this to the whole universe, not by feeling or according to our situation but by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we will all declare this, our whole situation will change.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In contrast, the more we say that we have nothing and can do nothing, the more our usefulness is killed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The liar Satan works subtly to produce many liars John 8:44b .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Satan may use even a wife to tell her husband that he is useless, and he may use the husband to say the same thing to the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Satan may use even the children to say, Don t go to the meetings so much.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What use can you be to the church?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to speak against the lie, saying, I do have something, and I can do something.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we say we do not have, we lose what we have, but when we say we have something, we add to what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, we should endeavor to water others and care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although the Lord promised a child to Abraham, the child did not come for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord even put Abraham into a situation in which he was forced to pray for the household of Abimelech so that they could have children Gen 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we were Abraham, we might have found it difficult to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We might have said, I am too pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have been praying for myself for many years, yet I have not received a child.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How can I pray for them?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, when Abraham prayed, God answered the prayer not only for Abimelech but also for Abraham 21:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we turn our prayer from ourselves to others, we will receive what we desire Job 42:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is because we are too self-centered in our prayer that the Lord needs to teach us a lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we water others, we will be watered, and if we care for others, we will be cared for.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>SPENDING AND BEING UTTERLY SPENT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>ON BEHALF OF OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The apostle Paul said, But I, I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls 2 Cor 12:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This passage has the sense of sacrificing one s wealth and one s life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Spend refers to the spending of Paul s possessions, and be utterly spent is the spending of what he was, referring to his being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we have a spirit to spend whatever we have and to be spent, to sacrifice whatever we are, we will have a great increase each year.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the present time, our rate of increase is very low.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is because we have not adequately spent what we have and what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have reserved our spending and preserved our self.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is impossible to have a higher rate of increase under this condition.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we pointed out in the previous chapter, the Boxers in China had a slogan: Kill all the Westerners and their followers, except Mr. Corbett.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is because that missionary spent everything and was spent for the Chinese people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever any poor ones came to him, he would give them something, such as dinner or lodging.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He reserved nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, when he himself was short of something, the people knew it was because he had spent it on them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul was this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He always spent and was spent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He meant business with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was on earth for nothing else but to gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, he also said, To the weak I became weak that I might gain the weak.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To all men I have become all things that I might by all means save some 1 Cor 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some in the church life are too strong in their disposition to be touchable in this way; it seems that no one can cause them to be shaped.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul, however, seemed to have no disposition of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was simply like a piece of wood that could be cut into any shape.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because his disposition was fully dealt with by the Lord, it was soft, bendable, flexible, and applicable to any situation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In my training in Taiwan in 1954, I told the serving ones that they should have a character and a disposition like paste, that can be applied to any kind of surface.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the contrary, some of the brothers and sisters are like pieces of hard rock that cannot be applied to any situation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This kind of rock is good only for beating others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some may even feel good about this and say that a hard piece of rock was useful to the Lord to kill the Philistine giant 1 Sam 17:49 , but it is pitiful to think in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the one hand, we need to be strong, but on the other hand, we should not be hard.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to be soft, flexible, and applicable, good for any situation we are placed in, able to fit into every bend and corner.</S>
