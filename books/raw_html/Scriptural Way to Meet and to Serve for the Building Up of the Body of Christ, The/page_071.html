<h1 class="title">THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MEETINGS<br />
ACCORDING TO THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Kings 17:8; Eph. 4:12-16</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to see the characteristics of the meetings according to the God-ordained way. The outward expressions of the inner essence, substance, and nature of a certain thing are its characteristics. God&rsquo;s ordained way, His new way, has its own inward, intrinsic, and divine essence, substance, and nature. With its essence, substance, and nature, there are some characteristics.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING THE BELIEVERS LIVING</h2>
<p>The first particular characteristic, or expression, of the proper Christian meetings according to God&rsquo;s ordained way is that they make the believers living. You may come into this meeting as a dead person, but when you leave the meeting, you leave as a living person. After you go to the meeting and return home, your spouse may tell you that you are a different person, that you are living, new, and fresh. These are expressions of the inward, intrinsic essence and nature which you received from attending such a meeting. Whether or not a meeting is according to God&rsquo;s ordained way depends upon whether or not it makes people living. If a meeting does not make people living, it is off the central lane. If it does make people living, this meeting is on the right track, the track of life. This requires all of us who attend the meeting to be living and full of life.</p>
<p>A very calm, quiet Christian meeting can be likened to a cemetery. I told people in the past that one of the quietest places in Los Angeles was Forest Lawn Cemetery. Everyone there is not only dead but also buried. This is why a cemetery is such a calm and quiet place. Sometimes we may have a meeting that is like a cemetery with all the attendants sitting there so calm and so dead. Some might say that it is better to be calm than noisy. But God in His Word charges us to make a joyful noise (Psa. 66:1; 81:1; 95:1-2; 98:4, 6; 100:1). The Word does not tell us to make a joyful voice. A voice means that the sounds are arranged in a proper order. A noise has no order and no arrangement.</p>
<p>Do you like a quiet and calm meeting or a noisy meeting? We need to have a proper noise in our meetings where everyone speaks, everyone prays, everyone praises, and everyone gives thanks. To be noisy is better than being calm and silent because calmness and silence signify death (Psa. 115:17). Nothing that has life is quiet; everything with life must act. As long as a person is living, it is impossible for him not to move at all. Only a dead person has absolutely no movement. We can recognize living persons because they are moving. The first characteristic of our meetings is that they must make the believers living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEVELOPING THE ORGANIC ABILITY AND FUNCTION<br />
OF THE LIVING MEMBERS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Another characteristic of the meetings according to the God-ordained way is that they develop the organic ability and function of the living members of Christ (Eph. 4:16). The old way of meeting is not the right way because, instead of developing, it annuls the organic ability and function of the members of the Body. Many who have attended the so-called services in Christianity week after week have had their ability and function annulled. By birth a small child has all its organs&mdash;organs for eating, digesting, seeing, listening, smelling, speaking, and walking. But suppose a child&rsquo;s parents practiced a way that prevented the child from having any kind of movement or function for twenty years. Because the child&rsquo;s walking ability had not been developed, he would not be able to walk. In Christianity, after a person&rsquo;s new birth in Christ, his regeneration, he is put into a situation where he is prevented from functioning in a normal way. The newborn ones have hardly any way to exercise their spiritual eyes, ears, nose, or feet. They have hardly any way to develop any kind of organic ability or function.</p>
<p>By our spiritual birth we have many divine, organic functions. But after we were regenerated, we were put into an environment in which our functions were being annulled. This annulling goes on under the best pretense, a pretense of feeding, teaching, edifying, perfecting, and helping people to grow. But these so-called feedings and teachings are doing a unique work to annul the members of Christ. The situation in Christianity is one of little development of the abilities or functions of the saints. Instead there is the annulling.</p>
<p>In all the local churches, we have to reconsider our way. It is easy, in a sense, to keep people by having a big meeting with a good speaker. But for the long run, all the seeking ones will grow tired of listening to the same kind of messages year after year. In the beginning, the new ones may be happy with the new and better terms we use in the recovery, such as <em>dispensation, dispensing,</em> and <em>transformation,</em> but after listening to messages from a brother for six months, they will become bored.</p>
<p>Certain co-workers and elders have been assigned in the past to take care of giving a message in the Lord&rsquo;s Day message meeting. For many of them Saturday was a &ldquo;sad day&rdquo; because they had to prepare for their sharing the next day. The new way releases the brothers from this kind of suffering and releases the saints to develop their organic ability and function. In the old way there is not much enlivening or developing. Instead there is much deadening and annulling. The proper meeting must bear the particular characteristic that it develops the saints&rsquo; ability. After meeting in the proper way for half a year, one will have much ability to speak, to preach, to pray for others, to touch people&rsquo;s hearts, and to get them fully saved. The new way will enable all the saints to be the real ministers, the ministers of the new covenant.</p>
<p>In certain ways, the sisters are more skillful than the brothers. If their abilities are annulled, this will be a great loss to the church. In the sisters, there is a great spiritual, divine, asset. We must develop that asset. The sisters must be free to function. In this sense, they need to be emancipated. In the Recovery Version, I pointed out in note 1<sup>1</sup> of John 12 that in the house in Bethany, as an early figure of the model church, there were more sisters than brothers (vv. 2-3). In a typical church, there are more sisters than brothers, and the sisters should be free to function. Let Martha be Martha. Let Mary be Mary. If the sisters are very active, you will have a living church.</p>
