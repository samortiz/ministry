EATING AND DRINKING THE LORD IN JOHN 6</h2>
<p>In John 6 the Lord Jesus mentioned some crucial points concerning our eating and drinking Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Being the Bread of Life</h2>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life...This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die&rdquo; (vv. 48, 50). The Lord is the bread of life; hence, there is life within this bread. Those who eat this bread receive His life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Flesh Being Bread</h2>
<p>There is a turning point in verse 51. In this verse the Lord said, &ldquo;The bread which I will give is My flesh.&rdquo; Here bread becomes flesh. Bread comes from the vegetable life, but flesh comes from the animal life. In verse 51 the Lord turned from bread to flesh; that is, He turned from vegetable life to animal life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Blood Being True Drink</h2>
<p>The Jews did not understand what the Lord said; hence, they asked, &ldquo;How can this man give us His flesh to eat?&rdquo; (v. 52). The Lord Jesus then said, &ldquo;My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink&rdquo; (v. 55). In this verse the Lord spoke of His blood. The Jews should have understood the Lord&rsquo;s words because of their knowledge of the passover. During the passover every Jewish household killed a lamb, put the blood on the doorposts and the lintel, and ate the flesh of the lamb (Exo. 12:1-8). When the Lord spoke of flesh and blood, the Jews should have remembered the story of the passover. However, what the Lord said in John 6:55 went further than what the Jews did during the passover, because the Jews ate the lamb; they did not drink its blood. But in this verse the Lord said, &ldquo;My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order for the Lord to be our food, He cannot be merely bread, which is of the vegetable life. If we had not sinned, it would have been sufficient for Him to be of the vegetable life. He would not be able to solve the problem of sin if He were merely of the vegetable life. God has ordained that without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness (Heb. 9:22). If the Lord were merely bread, there would be no shedding of blood, and as a result, our sins would not be forgiven. Unforgiven sins are a barrier that keeps us from contacting and enjoying the Lord. In order to deal with our sins, the Lord could not be merely bread. He had to be a lamb in order to be slain for the shedding of His blood. His blood had to be shed in order to wash away our sins. Then His flesh could be given for us to eat as our true food.</p>
<p>During the passover in Exodus 12, the children of Israel killed the passover lamb, ate its flesh, and put its blood on the doorposts and the lintel. The children of Israel ate the passover lamb with unleavened bread (v. 8). In the Bible leaven denotes sin (1 Cor. 5:6, 8). Eating unleavened bread signifies enjoying the Lord&rsquo;s sinless life. The Lord died and shed His blood to wash away our sins so that we may eat Him as the bread and thus enjoy His sinless life. Hence, eating the passover lamb with unleavened bread signifies eating the Lord&rsquo;s flesh and drinking His blood. It is important to see that in John 6 there is a turn from the vegetable life&mdash;wheat bread&mdash;to animal flesh. Only the animal life can shed blood, which is needed to solve the problem of our sins so that we can enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Every time we come to enjoy the Lord and sense our sins, we must realize that the Lord is not only bread but also a slain lamb. His blood solved our problem of sin so that we could eat His flesh. We must be clear that when we eat and drink the Lord, we are enjoying the One who was slain, whose blood was shed, and whose life was given for us. He said that His flesh is true food and that His blood is true drink. By His death and the shedding of His blood, He accomplished redemption and solved the problem of sin. Now He can be our food and our supply.</p>
<p>The first thing that we sense whenever we come to enjoy the Lord is our need for the cleansing of His blood. If we enter into His presence in the afternoon, we need the cleansing of His blood, even though we were cleansed in the morning. When we come before Him again in the evening, we need the cleansing of His blood yet again. We can come forward with boldness to contact and enjoy the Lord because He died, shed His blood, and gave His body for us.</p>
<p>We should always remember that we are still fallen sinners and that we have a fallen nature. If the Lord were merely the bread of life and not the Lamb of God who shed His blood, sinners such as we would not have the way to eat Him as bread. Our sins can prevent us from enjoying Him, but we thank and praise the Lord that He is not only bread but that He is also the Lamb that was slain for us. His blood was separated from His flesh; now He can say to us, &ldquo;My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
