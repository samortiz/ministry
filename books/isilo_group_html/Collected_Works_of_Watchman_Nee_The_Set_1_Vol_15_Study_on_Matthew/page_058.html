The Lord went first to the Jews, then to the land of the Gentiles, and then back to the midst of the children of Israel. The Jews need to repent and the Gentiles need to believe. This portion is a type of the beginning of the millennium. At that time the Lord will return to the midst of the Jews. Realizing that they are sick, the Jews will come to the Lord. Then the Lord will heal and save them. (Healing is a manifestation of the power of the millennium.) The children of Israel will glorify God because of the Lord.</P><P>Verses 32-39:In the preceding passage what the woman ate was crumbs. But now the Lord was preparing a feast, signifying the grace and riches in the kingdom. There is not one age in which the number of saved ones is greater than during the millennium. Five thousand is the number of responsibility. Four (signifying the created man) comes from three (signifying the Creator). This means the creatures come out of the Creator. Four thousand represents a great number. "Five loaves" is the number of responsibility; "two fish" signifies testimony. "Seven loaves" is the number of completeness; "seven baskets" signifies great abundance. There is another precious and significant thing, and that is that the Lord Jesus was also without anything to eat for three days. The Lord knew how to stand on the same position as man. We may listen to the Lord's speaking for three days and not feel hungry; the Lord can speak for three days and not feel hungry. For others, after three days He performed the miracle of multiplying the loaves. However, for Himself, after forty days of not eating He would not make the stones become loaves of bread (Matt. 4:2-4). In caring for others we should have compassion and put ourselves in their position. However, toward ourselves, we should be strict and exercise selfrestraint. Whether the Lord would or would not do something, both were miracles. He did not want to see the people go away hungry.</P><P>At present there are two kinds of people. One is the kind who are given to social service. The other is the kind who care only for spiritual needs. Both are wrong. The latter kind are the ones spoken of by James, who have faith only, but no works. It is most natural to have a compassionate heart, unless, as John said, one shuts up his affections (1 John 3:17). Therefore, to help the brothers in material things is something that every believer should endeavor to do. Those who say, "Where can we get so many loaves?" (v. 33), are people who look at circumstances. The first lesson of faith is to remove doubts. Not one prayer of faith ever asks such a question. As long as God has spoken, that is good enough. The loaves given by the Lord to the disciples signify resurrection life. The loaves of bread originally in the disciples' hands would never have increased, but after they were broken by the Lord, the leftovers filled seven baskets (seven being the number of greatest abundance). When life is dealt with by the cross, it is no longer natural but supernatural, and it is multiplied.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 15: Study on Matthew &nbsp; pg 58</div><br></body></html>
