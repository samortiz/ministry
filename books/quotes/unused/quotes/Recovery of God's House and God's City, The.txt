In order to understand the recovery of God's house and God's city, we must look back into the history of the people of Israel
We all know that the Old Testament is a book of types, and the greatest, all-inclusive type is the history of the people of Israel
They were in Jerusalem, gathered and centralized, but later they were scattered and carried away to many places
Negatively, to be recovered means to be brought out of Babylon, and positively, it means to be brought up to Jerusalem
Jerusalem became the center for God's people to worship Him, and this unique center kept the unity of the people of God
They had revival, but they still did not have the genuine unity, because the unity in Babylon is still the unity of division
Our experiences while we are going up must be the experiences of Christ and His redemption and of God and His divine nature
It is so interesting that this part of the Word only gives us the names of two kinds of vessels: the platters and the bowls
We must go up to the church life with plates and with bowls to serve others with food that they may be nourished and supplied
History tells us that only a small number of the captivity went back to Jerusalem; the majority remained in captivity
We know that besides the temple in Jerusalem, there has never been another temple built up by the Jewish people in the entire earth
They have not dared to build up a temple, because they know too well God's commandment in Deuteronomy 12, 14, 15, and 16
If we only rise up, yet we do not go up to the church life, we may serve God, but we will only serve God in a synagogue
After their spirit was stirred up, they rose up to go back to Jerusalem, bringing with them vessels of gold and silver
The seventh month was come, and although the people of Israel were in the cities, no oneness had yet been realized
Nothing will be according to you or me, but according to Jerusalem, for Jerusalem is the unique center and the unique ground for oneness
We have no different opinions, we have dropped all the Babylonian concepts, and we have gathered together as one
If we are going to realize the church life, we must forget about all the dissenting teachings and opinions we have received in the past
Christianity has many Bible studies, Bible classes, and Bible institutes, but they are nearly all in the dead letters
May the Lord have mercy upon us that we may forsake all of those teachings, regardless of whether they are right or wrong
Based upon these Scriptures we have told people that they must realize that Christ is not only the Redeemer but also the lifegiving Spirit
We do have this last book of Revelation, and it tells us that the Spirit of God is not only one Spirit, but seven Spirits
According to Haggai, Zerubbabel was the governor of Judah, and if we trace his genealogy, we see that he was the descendant of David
For the building of the tabernacle, Moses represented the kingship and the authority, and Aaron represented the priesthood
For the building up of the temple, Solomon represented the kingship, and the high priest represented the priesthood
They thought that when they came back they could use a certain way to practice the church life, but it did not work
We need the priesthood in order to have a real contact with God, that our whole being may be saturated with God
In the Lord's recovery, there is the need of the priesthood and the kingship; then there will be something recovered
In other words, we must put all that we have, all that we are, and all that we can do on the altar for God's satisfaction
The problem is that we have come back from Babylon to Jerusalem, yet at Jerusalem we still keep many things for our own interest
If they mean business with the Lord, they will be desperate to pray, 'Lord, give us an increase; otherwise, we will die'!
After we have returned to Jerusalem and have claimed the proper ground, the urgent need is to lay the foundation
They simply do not care about bringing people into the presence of God to help them contact the Lord and be possessed by the Lord
Be sure that a great teacher will bring great troubles, a small teacher will cause only small troubles, and no teacher produces no trouble
When we read the New Testament, we see that all the disciples and early believers were built up together because they were foolishly one
In the beginning it seemed foolish-there was no teaching, and they did not call the congregation together to give them instructions
They sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the Lord; because He is good, for His mercy endureth forever toward Israel
All the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid
When Christianity is going to build a church building, they have a certain kind of celebration to lay the foundation
We all know that according to history, the Hebrew people were so religious, but according to this record, there was not much religion
When they laid the foundation, they shouted and wept so much that they could not discern who was shouting and who was weeping
In the past years we also have heard this kind of saying again and again: 'Brother, let us work together with you
We cannot work together with others who are very close, yet so different, because the Lord's recovery is unique
You would even speak to others and ask, 'What are we doing here when there are so many dear ones who are not in Jerusalem?
One brother might say, 'Praise the Lord, these people are not in Syria, or in Egypt, or Babylon, and they are so close to us
If you are not on the proper ground, regardless of how broad and all-inclusive you are, you are still sectarian
As long as you are in Babylon, no matter how broad you are, you are divisive because you are standing on divisive ground
As long as we are on the proper ground, we are standing for the unique unity which is for all the children of God
The elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo
In the normal situation there is no need of the prophets, but just the priesthood and the kingship-these two are sufficient
In all the books of God's recovery, you will find that there is not much teaching or different kinds of opinions and concepts
Because they were weak and related to the world, they needed the help of the prophets to be strengthened and separated from the world
We must leave the teachings and simply come together under the divine authority to lay the foundation of the unique Christ
Something deep within you tells you that there is something missing until the day you come to the local church
You may say that it is rather difficult to work together with them and that it is better to start another meeting
They did not know anything and they did not care for anything but the recovery of the building up of the house of God
We do need this kind of saturation, fellowship, and oneness with God for the building up of the local churches
We do not need the knowledge of the teachings, but we do need the saturation, the oneness, the fellowship, and the living contact with God
In the local churches the government must be the divine authority which is the headship of Christ, the kingship with divine authority
He said that in all the church services, conventions, and conferences, the headship of Christ is not recognized
For the raising up of the tabernacle, Moses represented the divine authority, and the high priest, Aaron, represented the priesthood
The brothers and sisters know how to contact the Lord and to have a living fellowship with the Lord day by day
For the building up of the house of the Lord, we have the ministry of the priesthood as well as the ministry of the kingship
For the building up of the churches, we do need the ministry of the priesthood and the ministry of the kingship
Many times in the churches, those who can speak take over the position of the priesthood and the kingship to build up the church themselves
Regardless of how strong their ministry is in speaking, they should not replace the others and occupy their position
Ephesians 4:12 tells us very clearly that the gifted persons such as the apostles and prophets do not build the church directly
The gifted persons should not replace the saints; they should only perfect them so that they themselves can build up the Body
We all must experience the ministry of the priesthood and the kingship so that we all can rise up to build the house of God directly
They put an advertisement in the newspapers in huge characters, announcing the preacher of world fame who was coming to speak
He said that when he asked our people in the different halls who was going to speak that night, they did not know
In the summer of 1968, over one hundred and forty brothers and sisters went from the United States to visit the churches in Taiwan
During the baptism, an American missionary came to the hall and began to speak with some of the American brothers
If we are on the proper ground and mean business with the Lord for His recovery, the dew will fall from heaven when we are in need
Of course, we do not have the time to cover it entirely, but no other book of the Old Testament tells us so much about Christ as this one
Isaiah has sixty-six chapters, and Zechariah has only fourteen, yet Zechariah tells us more concerning Christ than Isaiah
The fourteen chapters of Zechariah are divided into two sections: the first eight chapters are one section, and the last six are another
The Spirit of God again stirred up the spirit of the governor, the spirit of the high priest, and the spirit of the remnant of the people
Haggai also points out that if the recovery of the building of the Lord's house is prevailing, Christ will come
Due to the degradation of Gods people they were carried away from the land of Canaan to Syria and Egypt with the majority going to Babylon
All the people of God had been carried away, and if none returned, how could Christ be born of the people of Israel at Bethlehem?
It is so clear in Haggai that the recovery of the building up of Gods house has much to do with Christs coming as the Desire of all nations
We know that He did come, not to those who remained in Babylon, but to those who returned to the land of Israel
We need the prophets who are the real priests, who have living contact with the Lord and who know something of Christ
The angel of the Lord acted to change the clothing of Joshua, because Joshua's clothing, the basis for Satan's accusation, was so dirty
Today we rarely hear the voice of Zechariah, because it is mysterious; it is something which is not according to human concept
We need the heavenly vision to see the things concerning Christ related to the recovery of the building of God's house
The myrtle trees are the people of Israel, and at this time they were really in the bottom, for they were in captivity
You may think that Babylon is good, but you must realize that Jerusalem is on top and Babylon is in the bottom
In the past years, when those working in the denominations came to talk with us, they always sounded as if they were low
Even when they say we are wrong, we can sense in their speech that they know we are on top and they are in the bottom
In the second vision, God raised up four horns and four carpenters to work out the situation for the captives to return
Christ was interceding for the captivity, and the Father answered by causing the king of Persia to send the captives back to Jerusalem
Christ interceded for the return of the captivity, and the Father answered by raising up the horns to make the return possible
In the third vision, a measuring line was put upon Jerusalem so that once more it might be possessed by the Lord
Christ today is not only the life in the recovery of the local churches, He is also the Sender and the Sent One
He sent Himself to come into the situation to work out everything so that the local churches might be recovered
The fourth vision shows Joshua, representing the priesthood, standing before the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him
In some places the Lord's people have taken the ground of the church, but they have still kept the old teachings and old ways
It was after this that Joshua was in a position to bring forth the branch, which is also Christ as the producing One
It is at this time that the declaration is made: 'Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts'
He is the foundation for the building of the local churches, and He is also the topstone of the local churches
There were some evil things among the people, and this vision was given for the purpose of dealing with these things
After this is the vision of the ephah, telling us that there were still many Babylonian things among the returned captives
These two visions show that in the Lord's recovery all the sinful things must be cleared up, and everything of Babylon must be sent back
He is the branch, the foundation stone, the topstone, the King for the kingship, and the Priest for the priesthood
Haggai helped the people to be strong to work, while mentioning a little about Christ as the Desire of all nations
The ministry of the prophet Zechariah is a ministry concerning Christ, showing that in God's recovery, Christ must have the first place
These six chapters may be divided into two subsections, chapters nine through eleven and chapters twelve through fourteen
In the first subsection, Zechariah prophesied concerning Christ as the anointed King, Who was rejected by the people
We must not only tell that Christ has first place in God's recovery, but that He has two comings, the first and the second
If we read Matthew 16:21, we see that these three shepherds are the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes
These were the three kinds of shepherds among the people of God when the Lord Jesus came to the earth the first time
He was betrayed for thirty pieces of silver by men, but following that, He was smitten on the cross by God Himself
Until you come into the recovery, that is, the local churches, you can never understand; there is always something hidden
Zechariah tells us that Christ came as a man to be the Shepherd to feed the flock of God so that we could enjoy the grace and have the unity
He was abhorred by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and therefore betrayed and sold for the price of a slave
He did not use the word cross or crucifixion, but such words as wounded, a fountain opened, and whom they have pierced
In the whole Bible, there is not another book which gives such a wonderful and lovable picture of Christ's death
He came to be the Shepherd to feed the flock of God with grace for unity; yet He was abhorred by the false shepherds
He was wounded in His hands and side in the house of His friends so that He might open a fountain for the cleansing of sins
He puts a little piece here and a little piece there, and it takes a real revelation from the Lord to put them all together
These verses tell us that He will come with all the saints to fight, and He will stand upon the Mount of Olives
At that time, the Jewish people will be surrounded by their enemies, just as they were at the side of the Red Sea
We all must be clear in the Lords recovery of the local churches that we are for Christs first coming and we are also for His second coming
According to the books of the recovery, the history is like this: First, the return of the captivity was begun
Throughout this history of the recovery, six names stand out: Zerubbabel, Joshua, Haggai, Zechariah, Ezra, and Nehemiah
Zerubbabel was the governor of the province of Judah, representing the kingship, and Joshua was the high priest, representing the priesthood
The stirring up of the spirit of the people only requires two chapters, while all the things of Christ require fourteen chapters
The remnant of the people who returned was still small; the number needed to be increased, so Ezra brought back a good number
They were saved in the denominations, but they were not saved for the denominations; they were saved for the Lord and His recovery
Ezra gave us a record of the silver, the gold, the vessels, and the basins which he brought back to the temple of God
Ezra was one who brought many people into the recovery to strengthen it and many vessels of gold and silver to enrich it
When the silver and gold are brought back to the house of God at Jerusalem, it is not only good, but also right
Not long ago, the Stream Publishers received a letter from a pastor telling how he appreciated the pray-reading
He asked us to send him many copies of The Stream in order that all the members of his church could learn to pray-read
It is not so good, but it is better than nothing; so we sent them all the copies to help them get the silver and gold
How we need the Ezras today to strengthen the numbers and to enrich the recovery with the silver and gold from Babylon
The prophet is one who speaks directly from God, and the teacher is one who teaches the things spoken by the prophet
A priest is one who is mingled with the Lord, saturated with the Lord, feeding upon the Lord, and breathing Him in all day long
Some people have a certain amount of knowledge, and they like to teach what they know, but they themselves are not that kind of person
He was in a position to ask the king for an army to protect him while returning to Jerusalem, but he did not do it
In the Lord's recovery, there is the need of purification to separate the holy seed from anything that is heathen
Do not bring into the local churches the things that you did in the denominations, no matter how good they are
He not only purified the people after the building up of the temple, but he purified them again for the building up of the city
In the local churches, we must have the house of God, and we must also have the city of God, which is the kingdom
The house of God depends mostly upon the priesthood-to contact the Lord, to be saturated with the Lord, and to be one with the Lord
Eventually the house, the temple, will be mingled with the city in the New Jerusalem, providing protection for eternity!
The temple is complete; it is the place of the Lord's presence, where we meet and serve the Lord; but it needs protection
We know what Christ is, and in a sense we all know what the church is, but not many are familiar with the city
The mingling is of four figures The first is God the second is Christ the third is the church and the fourth and final is the local churches
If we have the revelation of this mingling, the whole Bible will become transparent from the first page to the last
The New Testament first tells us that Christ is our life, but eventually it says that Christ is our Head and we are His Body
If we only experience Christ as life, yet do not realize Him much as our Head, we only have the church as the house
When we realize that Christ is not only our life, but also our Head, then Christ will have the second step of enlargement
The enjoyment of Christ as life is comparatively easy to experience, but to realize the headship of Christ is not so easy
The Gospel of John speaks of Christ as life, and the Epistles, especially Colossians, tell us that Christ is also our Head
You will not feel so happy with some of the brothers, and the local church will not be such a joyful place to you
If they realized that they are not only in the marriage life, but also under the headship, there would be no divorce
In the church if we are only in the life of Christ, but know nothing of the headship of Christ, there may be breaches in the wall
We may build up the church as the house in the life of Christ, but to have the church as the city, we must realize the headship of Christ
To have a church not only as a house, but as a city for protection, we must go further to take the headship of Christ
We all need to have our will exercised, renewed, and transformed so that it will be under the headship of Christ
As members of the Body, which is expressed by the local church, we must be willing to be under the headship of Christ
With the building up of the wall, the work is mainly with the stronger ones because this is a matter of fighting
If we have seen the local church as the expression of the Body, then we must see that the Body is under the headship of Christ
In Genesis 2, there was a garden without a wall, so it was so easy for the enemy, the creeping one, to creep in
The more we are transformed, the more we are separated, and the transformation eventually becomes the separating line
We should not have any regulations in the church concerning how long our hair ought to be or whether our members should shave or not
Today there is quite a discussion not only among Christians, but also among unbelievers about the length of the ladies' garments
In the wall of the New Jerusalem, there is nothing of regulation, but there is the building of the transformed precious stones
Everyone must keep his position for the building up of the wall and must learn how to work with one hand and fight with the other
When Nehemiah returned the last time and discovered that one of the adversaries was dwelling in a chamber of the temple, he kicked him out!
After the building up of the house, we need purification, and after the building up of the city, we need to be purified again
