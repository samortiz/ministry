[1]  CHAPTER ONE CONTACTING THE LORD THROUGH THE WORD Scripture Reading: John 15:7-8; 17:17; 6:63; 2 Tim 3:16-17; Eph 5:26 ABIDING IN THE VINE
[2]  In John 15 the Lord says that He is the true vine and that we believers are the branches.
[3]  He goes on to say that we need to abide in Him that He may abide in us vv.
[4]  As branches in the vine, we live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ.
[5]  Although 1 Corinthians 6:17 says that we are one spirit with the Lord, in our daily experience we are often not one with the Lord.
[6]  The Lord s living and solid word is contained in the Bible as the written word of God.
[7]  The Bible is not merely a piece of literature; it is the word of God, which is the very embodiment of the mysterious and abstract Christ.
[8]  That the Bible is a unique book is proven by the fact that anytime we come to the Bible with a seeking heart, we immediately have the sensation that we are in the presence of God.
[9]  Perhaps before we even open the Bible or read from it, as soon as we pick it up, we have the sensation that we have come into the presence of God.
[10]  When we come to the Bible, our psychology is involved in receiving the sensation that we are in the presence of the Lord, but this sensation is based on the fact that we are indeed in His presence.
[11]  The Lord said, It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life John 6:63 .
[12]  The written word is outside of us, but when the word is spoken into us by the Lord, it immediately becomes the Spirit within us.
[13]  Reading the Word of God is a necessity of life.
[14]  We have two lives, the physical life and the spiritual life, and we must take care of both.
[15]  If we do not take care of the physical life, we will be weak and dying physically.
[16]  Question: What is the best way to spend time in the Word in the morning?
[17]  Answer: From our experience we have learned that there are two profitable ways of handling the Bible the way of being nourished and the way of reading.
[18]  CHAPTER TWO THE PROPER CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: Col 1:12, 15-19, 27; 2:2b, 6-7, 9, 16-17; 3:4, 10-11; 1 Cor 12:12-13; Phil 1:21 THE CHURCH BEING CHRIST
[19]  In this chapter I am burdened that we would see the truth of what the church is.
[20]  We may know that the church is the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23a , the fullness of the One who fills all in all v. 23b , the mystery of Christ 3:4-6 , the household of God 2:19 , the one new man v. 15 , the testimony of Jesus Rev 1:2 , and the kingdom of God Matt 16:18-19; Rom 14:17 . These are all wonderful definitions of the church, but we need to see that the basic factor of the church is simply Christ.
[21]  Neither could it be the fullness of the One who fills all in all, the mystery of Christ, the household of God, the new man, the testimony of Jesus, or the kingdom of God.
[22]  However, although many Christians know that the church is the Body of Christ, they do not realize that the church is Christ.
[23]  They hold the illogical concept that the church is the Body of Christ but that it is not Christ.
[24]  Perhaps even some of us have thought, To say that the church is the Body of Christ is right, but to say that the church is Christ may be heretical.
[25]  However, this thought is illogical because the fact that the church is the Body of Christ inherently implies that the church is Christ.
[26]  First Corinthians 12:12 says, Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.
[27]  According to our concept, after this verse begins by describing the physical body with its many members, we would expect the verse to conclude by saying, So also is the Body of Christ.
[28]  We say that the church is the Body of Christ, but here the Word says that the Body is Christ.
[29]  Hence, the church being Christ is not my teaching but the clear teaching of the Bible.
[30]  We became the church after being regenerated because in regeneration Christ came into us, and in baptism our original old man was crucified and buried with Christ.
[31]  The old I was not Christ because Christ was not in us, but now Christ is in us.
[32]  Every time new believers are baptized, we need to repeat this truth to them, telling them that the church is Christ and that their new I is Christ.
[33]  God s eternal purpose is simply to gain a church for Christ that has Christ as its life and content, a church that is Christ Himself.
[34]  We will all come to the meetings with Christ, in Christ, and for Christ.
[35]  When we are void of Christ, we will have many preferences, but if we are full of Christ, we will bring only Christ when we come together.
[36]  When our vessels are empty, void of Christ, all kinds of peculiar things will come in. Therefore, in order for us to have the proper church life, we must have adequate experiences of Christ so that we may be filled with Him.
[37]  Colossians 2:16-17 says, Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath, which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ.
[38]  Thus far in this chapter we have seen mainly the truth in doctrine.
[39]  First, we need to see what the all-inclusive Christ is today; we need to see the nature of this Christ.
[40]  Because Christianity is void of Christ, many things other than Christ, such as rules and regulations, have come in. If we are filled with Christ, we will have no rules and regulations.
[41]  If we walk in Christ and live Christ day by day, we will be saturated with Christ, possess Christ, and be full of Christ.
[42]  Question: Is walking in Christ related to contacting the Lord through the Word?
[43]  Answer: Yes, in order to walk in Christ, we surely need to come to the Word daily, even a few times a day, because Christ is embodied in the word of the Bible.
[44]  I never knew a Christian who walked in Christ without daily contacting the Word.
[45]  Question: Since the proper church meeting is an exhibition of the Christ we experience, if we have failed to live Christ during our daily life, should we still come to the meeting?
[46]  AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22; 1 Cor 11:3a; 12:28; Matt 23:8, 10; 1 Pet 5:3, 5; Acts 2:14; 15:13, 19; Gal 2:9-14; Heb 13:17
[47]  This chapter concerns the headship of Christ and the constitution of the church.
[48]  This organization claims that the pope represents Christ, but this is actually a subtle way of putting Christ aside and denying the headship of Christ.
[49]  God needs a man to fulfill His eternal purpose to mingle with man and to defeat and destroy His enemy.
[50]  Thus far we have seen that the headship of Christ was not completed in the Old Testament because at that time He was not a man and had not accomplished redemption or defeated God s enemy to fulfill God s eternal purpose.
[51]  In Matthew 23:8 the Lord said, Do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.
[52]  If the older brothers have learned the lesson to honor the headship of Christ, when a brother opens to them in this way, they will immediately say, Brother, we cannot tell you what to do because we are not the Head.
[53]  Moreover, the local churches should not all be organized into one unit.
[54]  If the local churches are organized into one unit, this organization will lead to hierarchy, and hierarchy is an insult to the headship of Christ.
[55]  Question: Could you comment further on what a husband should do to honor the headship of Christ if his wife asks him to make a decision?
[56]  Answer: When a wife comes to her husband regarding anything, the best way and the proper way for the husband to respond is by referring the matter to the Lord by prayer.
[57]  It is quite strange that when we want to know the Lord s will right away, the Lord often will not let us know, but when we say, Lord, I want to wait to be clear concerning Your will, the Lord will make us clear right away.
[58]  IN THE HOUSE OF GOD Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:3-7; 3:15-16; 4:6-8; 6:3 FOUR CRUCIAL MATTERS
[59]  In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul says, If I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God.
[60]  Second Corinthians 4:1 says, Therefore having this ministry as we have been shown mercy, we do not lose heart.
[61]  In this verse the subject we is plural, but the object ministry is singular.
[62]  First Timothy 1:12 says, I give thanks to Him who empowers me, Christ Jesus our Lord, that He has counted me faithful, appointing me to the ministry.
[63]  For many years I have spoken the same thing that all the riches of the Triune God are embodied in Christ, that Christ today has become the life-giving Spirit, and that the life-giving Spirit dwells in our spirit so that the Triune God can dispense Himself into us.
[64]  God s economy is God s arrangement, God s administration, to dispense Himself into His chosen people.
[65]  The New Testament ministry, the ministry, always ministers God s economy, which is God dispensing Himself into His believers to be their life, nature, and being to produce the church, the Body of Christ.
[66]  In his article The Waning Authority of Christ in the Churches, A. W. Tozer asks, What foreign mission board actually seeks to follow the guidance of the Lord? Tozer concludes that although many are working for Christ, the headship of Christ is entirely set aside and denied in all of Christianity.
[67]  We need to honor the headship of Christ and respect Christ as the unique Lord by telling the brother, Brother, I dare not tell you what you need to do, even if I know, because I am not your lord.
[68]  We need to see the difference between doctrines and the truth.
[69]  When we come to the table, we see the wine separated from the bread, which displays the death of Christ by symbolizing the separation of the blood and the body of Christ in His death.
[70]  Yes, Christ is the manifestation of God in the flesh, but today the church is also the manifestation of God in the flesh.
