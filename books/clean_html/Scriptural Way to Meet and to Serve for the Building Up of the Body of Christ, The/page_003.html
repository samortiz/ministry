<h2 class="head2">For the Heading Up of All Things in Christ<br />
through the Church as the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is for the heading up of all things in Christ through the church as the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:10). As we meet we are taking step after step to lead all the created things toward one direction, that is, to be headed up in Christ. Do we have such a consideration when we come into a Christian meeting? Our meeting today directs us toward the goal of all things being headed up in our Head, Christ. While we are singing, praising, and testifying, we declare that we are taking the lead as the firstfruit of His creatures (James 1:18) to lead all the creatures to the point of everything being headed up in Christ. Today the whole universe is in disorder and chaos, with no heading up. But one day the church will bring all the created things to one direction, that is, to the heading up of all things in Christ. If we repeat the following sentence five times, we will be different persons: the Christian meeting takes the lead to bring everything to the direction of all things being headed up in Christ.</p>
<p>It is very difficult for a young lady, after being married, to submit herself to her husband, taking the male as her head. Quite often the wives may argue with their husbands and say, &ldquo;Why do you have to be over me?&rdquo; They may not know the answer, but we know the answer. God created us this way. Paul tells us that &ldquo;the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God&rdquo; (1 Cor. 11:3). Between the wife and the husband, one must be the first. No one can change God&rsquo;s invention. All the sisters should say &ldquo;amen&rdquo; to their subjection. But today in the whole universe there is no such &ldquo;amen&rdquo; in God&rsquo;s creation. God is waiting to lead all His creatures into such a subjection through the church.</p>
<p>In our meeting have we been led into such a subjection to have all of us headed up in our Head, Christ? By His mercy and grace, we all have to say, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Are you dear saints who are the members of the church in your locality headed up in Christ? If you say &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; how do you express your being headed up? We express this by our meetings. Look at our meetings. Our Christian meeting is a meeting altogether headed up into our Head, Christ. Every time we meet, we must have a clear understanding that our meeting today is linked to the heading up. The day will come when the entire universe is the same as our meeting today. Our meeting is a model, a miniature, of that day when all the created things in this universe are headed up in Christ for the believers&rsquo; universal meeting in the new heaven and new earth. Our Christian meeting is not a small thing. It testifies and declares that we are taking the lead in all of God&rsquo;s creation to reach the goal of the heading up of all things in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO HAVE THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Church Being Redeemed<br />
by the Death of Christ</h2>
<p>In order to have the church meetings, we must first see that the church has been redeemed by the death of Christ (Eph. 5:25b; Acts 20:28b). The church is a group of extraordinary, peculiar people (Titus 2:14), a people privately possessed by God as His peculiar treasure (Exo. 19:5), His own possession (1 Pet. 2:9). We have been redeemed but the worldly people have not. To be redeemed is a particular characteristic of the church. We are the redeemed people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Church Being Produced<br />
in the Resurrection of Christ</h2>
<p>As descendants of Adam, we were born in our natural birth into Adam. But as the church, we all have been produced in the resurrection of Christ (1 Pet. 1:3; Eph. 2:6). We are now a group of people in resurrection, not in our natural being. We have been redeemed and produced.</p>
<p>In the resurrection of Christ, we are no longer merely the descendants, the sons, of Adam. In Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, we believers have been made the sons of God (Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10a). This changes our nature, our being, our status, and our position. We are not merely the sons of man. Today we are the sons of God, not according to our natural birth but in the resurrection of Christ. We are a group of resurrected people. We are the descendants of God in resurrection. The Body of Christ is not composed of different races such as American or Chinese, but it is an aggregate of the sons of God. Every time we meet, we need to remember that we are coming to meet as sons of God. Then we will begin our meeting with the sonship in resurrection. In some so-called Christian meetings, people were fighting with one another. I heard of one meeting where a person threw his Bible at someone. They were fighting because they were meeting there not only as the sons of Adam but also as the sons of the Devil. We need a vision that we are meeting as the sons of God.</p>
<p>Today we have God as our Father with His life and nature, just as Christ has (John 20:17). When Christ was walking on this earth, He was walking as one who had God the Father in Him, with His life and nature. Thus, whatever He did was a manifestation of God the Father. Whenever He spoke, He spoke out God the Father (John 14:10, 24). We must come to the meeting with such an understanding. We are coming to the meeting as sons of God, having God the Father with His life and with His nature; therefore, whatever we do in the meeting should express our Father. Some brothers may have quarreled with one another in some meetings because they forgot that they were meeting as sons of God. They forgot their status.</p>
