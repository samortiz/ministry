   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>As far as we are concerned, the situation in Taipei a few years ago was just about the same.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We frequently had large meetings with just a few people doing everything.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This kind of condition made me very concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, I received a burden from the Lord and saw that we must overturn these things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first thing we must do is to overturn the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, I do not have the intention of entirely stopping the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Changing the system should not be like jumping from the seventh floor straight to the ground floor, without using stairs at all; that is to commit suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, for the past two years we have been changing the system and simultaneously building a staircase on which all the saints can walk down properly instead of lingering on the seventh floor with a wait-and-see attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What we have seen before the Lord is that one day in the Lord's recovery there will be mostly home meetings and not many big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Perhaps once or twice a month the whole church will come together for a meeting like the one mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That will be such a glorious situation!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the past we had a meeting at a big stadium with ten thousand people, which was marvelous and impressive.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, if there were no home meetings as supporting pillars, that kind of big meeting would not be a glory but a deformity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must have home meetings before we can have big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our labor is not in the big meetings but in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is only after we have constantly labored in the home meetings that one day we can have a big meeting as a harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the same as the children of Israel celebrating the Feast of Tabernacles after laboring throughout the entire year to obtain a harvest which they enjoyed as a feast before God when they came together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is also like the American Thanksgiving Day which was originally celebrated after the harvest was taken in; the families gathered together to enjoy the fresh produce in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps we could follow the children of Israel to have three big meetings in each year of labor and work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These would be times of joy and exultation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why we must change our concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I say again that we are not jumping off a building and committing suicide; rather, we are willing to turn around and walk down the stairs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead of finding excuses for yourself, you should follow everyone else down the stairs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Chinese all used to wear long gowns, but today it is difficult to find anyone in a gown, because everyone is now wearing Western clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This proves that people can change.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even though it is difficult to come down the stairs, as long as we are willing to walk, we will be able to slowly get down to the ground floor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we are to walk, however, we must change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the past our Lord's Day meetings had two or three hundred people, and the speakers were all experienced and spoke every sentence well and in a touching way, so that even the gospel friends were helped.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now as we are changing the system, the big meetings have become small and the saints are scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moreover, our baptisms are not what they used to be, with baptism interviews to determine if the candidates are clearly saved before we baptize them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we just need to preach The Mystery of Human Life to them, lead them in prayer, and baptize them in the bathtub after they have believed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It seems that the change in system is turning the church into a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Please do not be worried.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, you must wait patiently.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I believe that after three to five years many homes will have been raised up as the supporting pillars of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Things in the physical world are symbols of things in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A country's strength and a society's health are entirely determined by the strength and health of the families.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the Chinese tradition, the children are raised by the parents in the homes; they are taught, they live, and they grow up at home.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then after they are married, they do not need to ask an expert on "family-forming" for guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They know spontaneously how to form a family and build up a career.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is because they have been with their parents since they were small and therefore have a thorough understanding of what a family is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is just what we have seen before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Christian "society" the church is not composed of church buildings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, it is constituted with households.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The household is the basic unit of salvation and service, and it is the constituting element of the church.</S>
