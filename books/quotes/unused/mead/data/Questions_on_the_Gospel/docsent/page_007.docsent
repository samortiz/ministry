   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION THREE CONCERNING ROMANS 4:7-8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Is there any difference between "blessed" in Romans 4:7 and "blessed" in verse 8?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If so, what is the difference?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is a difference, and this difference is related to the forgiveness of sins and justification.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word blessed in verse 7 refers to a negative aspect; whereas the word blessed in verse 8 is speaking of a positive aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 7 says that God forgives man's iniquities and covers his sins, while verse 8 says that God works to such an extent that a man can be regarded as though he had never sinned: "by no means account sin."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is to be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What then is the difference between forgiveness and justification?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Forgiveness means that even though you have sinned, God has forgiven your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Justification means that you are regarded as a righteous person that has never committed a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Suppose a man is judged by the court and found guilty; therefore, he should receive a punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Later, he may be granted amnesty and released by the court.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is receiving forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But being justified is like going through the court and being declared not guilty.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is being justified.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord saved us not only to forgive us but also to justify us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is grace!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The shedding of the blood of the Lord Jesus has completely solved our problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since we were resurrected together with Him and in Him, God sees us as if we had never sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God, in Christ, has worked to such an extent that we are as complete as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Colossians 2:10 says, "And you have been made full in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God sees us the same way He sees Christ, and He loves us the same way He loves Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God sees us as being complete in Christ.</S>
