   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 The Father's Beloved</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Joseph, the one with the shepherding aspect, was also his father's beloved 37:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Likewise, Christ was the Father's beloved Son Matt 3:17; 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only that aspect of us that is constituted of Christ is beloved in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Praise the Lord that we have Christ's constitution within us!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This part of us is beloved of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You can testify that at times you have had the deep sense that the Father was present with you, and you could sense Him saying, "This is My beloved."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The words spoken of the Lord Jesus at His baptism and on the Mount of Transfiguration have also been spoken to you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have had the deep sense that God the Father was present.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever you have this sense, it is a proof that you have the constitution of Christ, which is pleasing to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of that part of your being the Father will always say, "This is My beloved."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although you may be young in the Lord, I believe that you have experienced the Father God in heaven being very happy with you and pleased with you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, now you may not be pleased with yourself, considering your shortcomings and faults.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The reason for this is that we have two constitutions, the constitution of Christ and the constitution of the old Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When you are with the constitution of Christ, you can hear a heavenly voice saying, "This is My beloved," because God the Father is pleased with you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when you are with the old constitution, the constitution of Adam, not even you are pleased with yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, you hate that aspect of your being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Joseph represents the very constitution of Christ in the matured life of Israel, that part which is called by the Father, "My beloved."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>3 Ministering to the Brothers according to the Father's Will</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 37:12-17 we see that Joseph ministered to the brothers according to his father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this matter also Joseph was a type of Christ, for Christ came down from heaven to do the will of the One who had sent Him John 6:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is not a word in the Bible saying that Joseph was a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, if you read this section of the Word, you will admit not only that Joseph was a type of Christ, but that his biography is virtually the biography of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Joseph's life was a copy of Christ's.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At this point I would like to say a word regarding allegorizing the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some Bible teachers say that we should consider as types only those things in the Old Testament that the New Testament specifically says are types.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I followed this teaching for a number of years, but I was eventually released from it, having realized that it went too far.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although there is not a word in the New Testament saying that Joseph was a type of Christ, no one in the Old Testament was a more exact type of Christ than Joseph was.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates the fact that some things in the Old Testament are types which are not referred to as types in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because of this fact, I no longer hold this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Joseph was a shepherd, the father's beloved, and the one sent by the father to minister to his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In all these aspects he was the same as Christ.</S>
