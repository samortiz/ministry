   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT THE NEW JERUSALEM ITS THRONE Scripture Reading: Rev 22:1-3, 5c; 2:7; 22:14, 17; John 7:38-39 THE THRONE OF GOD AND OF THE LAMB</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The last item that is recorded in the section concerning the New Jerusalem is the throne of God and of the Lamb Rev 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The throne, of course, is for God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is the One who had a purpose and who made a plan in eternity past and who created all things for the fulfillment of His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lamb is the One who redeemed us, the One who has accomplished a full redemption to fulfill God s plan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, the throne of God and of the Lamb denotes that this throne is to carry out God s plan through Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both God s plan and Christ s redemption are being carried out through this throne.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The throne is the very source from which the river of water of life flows, and it flows with the tree of life growing in it 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The throne for the accomplishment of God s eternal purpose is to flow out God Himself that by this flow of life His purpose could be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A LITTLE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we get into the full record concerning the New Jerusalem, we will spontaneously understand that this is fully related to our personal experiences of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not think that the New Jerusalem is merely something objective in the future for a certain group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to realize that what is recorded in Revelation 21 and 22 should be experienced by us today in a very personal way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Experientially speaking, every proper and normal Christian is a little New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whatever is ascribed to the New Jerusalem corporately should be experienced by us individually and personally.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With and in each one of us are the three gates of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, in each one of us there must be the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must enthrone Him in our heart and in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, in the very center of our being there should be the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the end of the record of the New Jerusalem the unique item is the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE CENTER OF OUR CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In our Christian experience the unique item should be the throne of the One who purposed and of the One who redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Such a throne must be set up in our entire being and this should be the center of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that we would accept the God who purposed and the Christ who redeemed us as our Head, Lord, and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should be willing to subject ourselves to such a headship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We adore Him as the Lord and we take Him as our authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We enthrone Him in our being and in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In our Christian life the center is the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are not here living for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are living and existing for the accomplishment of God s purpose, to carry out what Christ has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we experience the One on the throne in His headship and lordship, and we submit ourselves to such an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In our daily life, in our family life, in our marriage life, in our business life, and in our church life the center must be God s throne.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everything should be subjected to His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All of us have experienced that whenever we would subject ourselves to this headship, we immediately sense something full of God s riches flowing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the flow of the Triune God as life, life supply, and everything to our being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Within us we sense such a flow, and this flow is from the throne of God and of the Lamb as the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE FLOW OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Revelation 22:1 we see the flow of the divine Trinity God, the Lamb, and the water of life the Spirit .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to John 7:38-39, the water of life refers to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God was the One who purposed, He became the Lamb who redeemed John 1:14, 29 , and finally became the life-giving, flowing Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God flows in the water of life, the Lamb flows in the water of life, and the Spirit flows as the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, this is the Triune flow, the flow of the divine Trinity as the very life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This should not be taken as a theological teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to our daily experiences, we Christians should experience the flow of the divine Trinity every day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every morning after rising up we need to say, Lord, thank You for a new day for me to take You as my Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I subject myself under Your headship for the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Lord, set up Your throne in my life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Set up Your throne in the center of my being.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Lord, bring my whole day with my daily life under Your throne.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you would offer such a prayer to the Triune God every morning, from that moment you would have the living water flowing within you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This living water flowing is the flow of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not a small thing that the Triune God flows in you today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He flows in you as the One who purposed, as the One who redeemed, and as the One who is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This One is the very consummation of the Triune God reaching us as the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Such a subjective revelation has been missed by many of today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I hope we all would realize in our experience that whenever we subject ourselves to the Triune God, taking Him as our Head, we enjoy a flow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thank the Lord that in the Lord s recovery, day after day, month after month, year after year, and time after time, what is stressed is the unique flow.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have given message after message which tells us that the Triune God is flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There are also many hymns in our hymnal concerning this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The first two stanzas of Hymns, #12 say:</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>O God, Thou art the source of life,</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Divine, and rich, and free!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As living water flowing out</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Unto eternity!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In love Thou in the Son didst flow</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Among the human race;</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Thou dost as Spirit also flow</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Within us through Thy grace.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many times in the Lord s table meeting, we all sense the flow of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our Father is the very God who had a purpose and who purposed to accomplish His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Son as the very Lamb is also flowing to dispense what He has accomplished on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Whatever was accomplished on the cross was objective, and this has to become subjective to us by the flow of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even the Lamb is flowing in this divine flow because this flow proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This means that the water of life flows out of God and out of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We do not only have such a vision and revelation, but we have this experience day by day and even moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I can testify that without such a divine flow I cannot live, I cannot minister, and I have nothing to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But praise the Lord, this divine flow is always availing in our life and in our being.</S>
