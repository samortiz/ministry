BEING CHANNELS OF LIFE</h2><p>After our regenerated spirit is strengthened by calling on the name of the Lord and by praying to contact God, to enjoy God, to fellowship with God, and to absorb God, as well as to bind the devil and loose people and situations for God&#8217;s economy; after we are enriched and equipped with the Word by means of pray-reading, reading, studying, and memorizing, we have to learn to speak the word of Christ in spirit. In previous lessons we have seen that life is God the Father in Christ Jesus the Son as the Spirit flowing into, through, and out of us. By calling, praying, and handling the word we receive God as life into our being. By speaking the word of Christ, we allow God to flow through us and out of us to be life to others. We are channels of life for God&#8217;s economy. In Acts 5:20 we are charged to go &#8220;and speak to the people all the words of this life.&#8217;&#8217; On the receiving side, we need to be open to receive the Lord through His Word; on the dispensing side, we need to speak to dispense the Lord in our speaking. To bear fruit of people is to receive the life supply from the Lord through abiding in Him and to dispense the life through speaking the gospel to our friends. If we do not speak, we will stagnate like the dead sea. Therefore, in John 15, after the Lord charged His disciples to bear fruit, He warned them that they would be cut off from the enjoyment of life if they did not abide in Him and did not bear fruit (vv. 2, 6). We must be faithful enjoyers of God as our life and dispensers of God as life to others around us.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_082.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_084.html">Next</a> </body></html>
