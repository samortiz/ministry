        <h2 class="head1">TWO KINDS OF WORK</h2>
<p>Matthew 7:21-23 says, &ldquo;Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens. Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power? And then I will declare to them: I never knew you. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness.&rdquo; The kingdom people must take care of their living and also their work. In verses 13 through 20 the Lord spoke concerning the principles of their living, but in verses 21 through 23 He spoke concerning the principle of their work.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of work that we can do for the Lord: One work is according to man&rsquo;s will, and the other work is according to God&rsquo;s will. Both kinds of work are for the Lord, but the source is different. One work is done according to the will of man; the other work is done according to the will of God. Furthermore, both works have different results. The Lord said, &ldquo;Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens&rdquo; (v. 21). Whoever works according to the will of man will not enter into the kingdom of the heavens. Only those who work according to the will of God will enter into the kingdom of the heavens. Hence, there is a great distinction between these two kinds of work.</p>
<p>The believers who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today will enter into the coming manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. The believers who work according to the will of man will not enter into the coming kingdom of the heavens, because they do not live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens or allow the kingdom of the heavens to exercise authority over them today. Believers who work according to the will of man work according to their own will and preferences. These believers are full of their own will and preferences and are not ruled by the heavens. The ruling of the heavens does not give ground to the will of man or to human preferences. Therefore, when a person is ruled by the heavens, his will and preferences are cast out. Those who are ruled by the heavens do not have their own will or preferences in the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Some may ask, &ldquo;How is it possible for the element of the human will to be mixed into the Lord&rsquo;s spiritual work? Would such a work be spiritual?&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s word, however, clearly reveals that human will and preferences can be mixed into the Lord&rsquo;s spiritual work. The Lord said, &ldquo;Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power?&rdquo; (v. 22). These people prophesied, cast out demons, and did many works of power. They truly did these works; otherwise, they would not dare to say this before the Lord, because they know that He is omniscient. It is possible to deceive man, but it is not possible to deceive the Lord. Moreover, when the Lord rebuked them, He did not deny what they did. The Lord acknowledged that they did indeed do those things. Therefore, they were doing the Lord&rsquo;s work, a spiritual work.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Lord rebuked them, saying, &ldquo;Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness&rdquo; (v. 23). <em>Lawlessness</em> here does not refer only to evil things; it also refers to good things. For example, a school dormitory may have the rule that students must switch off the lights at ten thirty at night. If a student studies past ten thirty, he is lawless. Studying is a good thing, not an evil thing, but studying after the lights are supposed to be turned out is lawlessness. Similarly, prophesying, casting out demons, and doing works of power are all good; however, if they are done according to the human will, not the will of God, they involve lawlessness.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters may ask, &ldquo;How is it possible for a person to cast out demons and do works of power if he is lawless?&rdquo; This is not difficult to understand. Everything in the universe has a law. If the law is fulfilled, there will be a result. For example, even though a school says that the lights should be switched off at ten thirty, the electrical current does not cease to exist after ten thirty. As long as there is a law of electricity, the lights will work if they are switched on after ten thirty, just as they will work when they are switched on before ten thirty. This also applies to studying. A student can understand and remember what he studied after ten thirty, just as he can understand and remember what he studied before ten thirty.</p>
<p>Another example is the law of having children. Children can be born to illicit unions, just as they can be born to lawful marriages. Having children depends on the fulfillment of a law, not on whether it is lawful or lawless. Another example is sowing seeds. When seeds are sown into the ground, they grow. Seeds that are stolen will grow, and seeds that are purchased will also grow. Many matters concern the fulfilling of a law, not to lawfulness or lawlessness.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to God&rsquo;s work. If the gospel is preached according to God&rsquo;s will, people will be saved. Conversely, if the gospel is preached according to man&rsquo;s will, people will still be saved. Preaching the gospel depends on the fulfillment of a law. The Scriptures are God&rsquo;s word and can give man life. This will not change. Whether someone preaches the gospel according to God&rsquo;s will or man&rsquo;s will, people will receive life from God&rsquo;s word if they receive the gospel. Hence, it is not sufficient to look merely at the fruit in measuring a believer&rsquo;s work. The Lord warned us in this section that His judgment would be based on whose will worked according to the Father&rsquo;s will; His judgment will not be according to the fruit of our work.</p>
<p>Almost everything in the Old Testament is a type. For example, Abraham&rsquo;s begetting of Isaac typifies man accepting God&rsquo;s promise by faith, and Abraham&rsquo;s begetting of Ishmael typifies man fulfilling God&rsquo;s promise by his own strength (Rom. 9:7-8; Gal. 4:22-23). Lot&rsquo;s begetting of Moab and Ben-ammi (Gen. 19:30-38) typifies the lawless preaching of the gospel. The sons of Lot were not begotten according to the accepted code of human conduct or law. The way that many preach the gospel is not according to spiritual regulation. People can be saved even if the gospel is preached lawlessly, but those who are saved in this way are like the Moabites and Ammonites.</p>
<p>In Philippians 1:15 and 17 Paul says that &ldquo;some preach Christ even because of envy and strife...The others announce Christ out of selfish ambition, not purely.&rdquo; Such preaching of the gospel surely saved some; perhaps a very large number were saved. But the ones who were saved in this way were like the Moabites and Ammonites. Moab and Ben-ammi were born, and God recognized them as human beings. Likewise, people believe in the gospel, and God recognizes that they are saved. However, those who preach the gospel in such a way will not be approved; instead, the Lord will call them men of lawlessness. This is a serious matter.</p>
<p>According to the context of Matthew 7:21-23, being called lawless by the Lord is the issue of not doing the will of the Father. Any work that is not the will of the Father who is in the heavens is a work of lawlessness. The Lord&rsquo;s work is being done everywhere on the earth, but is this work lawful in the eyes of God? This is a great question. Many works and activities among Christians are not according to the Father&rsquo;s will. I am afraid that one day the Lord will say to such workers, &ldquo;Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness.&rdquo; Is our work lawful or lawless? On the surface our work may not be a problem, but we should not stop there. We must have the assurance that our service is according to God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>In order for our work to be according to the Father&rsquo;s will, we must deny the self. If we are not subject to the authority of the heavens or restricted by the heavens, having our own will and preference, our work will lack the element of the Father&rsquo;s will. As a result, our work will produce Moabites and Ammonites. When the Lord rebuked the men of lawlessness, He said, &ldquo;I never knew you. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness&rdquo; (v. 23). Some say that these men of lawlessness are false Christians, because the Lord said that He never knew them. The words <em>never knew</em> mean &ldquo;never acknowledged, never approved.&rdquo; Hence, the Lord was saying that He never acknowledged or approved these lawless men. It is right to prophesy, cast out demons, and do works of power, but the Lord did not approve of their doing these things. The Lord told them to depart from Him. Since the Lord is in the kingdom, this means that they will not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>According to verse 21, those who do the will of the Father will be able to enter into the kingdom of the heavens. To do the Father&rsquo;s will is to work according to God&rsquo;s will. Believers who prophesy, cast out demons, and do works of power according to God&rsquo;s will are under the governing of the heavens. Verse 21 refers to the one &ldquo;who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens.&rdquo; This proves that these believers work by the Father&rsquo;s life under the ruling of the heavens according to God&rsquo;s intention. They are under the authority of the heavens and live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. Therefore, they will be able to enter into the kingdom of the heavens at the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>Matthew 7:21 through 23 reveals that the work of the kingdom people should be based on God&rsquo;s will, not on prophesying, casting out devils, or doing works of power. Such a work demands that we set aside our will, our feelings, and our preferences in order to learn to live by God&rsquo;s life in us, that is, to live under the authority of the heavens and to be restricted and ruled by the heavens. This is the way for us to know God&rsquo;s will and to know what we should and should not do.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is a good example of doing the will of the Father. When the Lord was on the earth, He sometimes healed the sick and cast out demons, but at other times He did not (Luke 4:23-27). Sometimes He performed miracles, such as feeding the five thousand with five loaves and two fish, but at other times He did not (Matt. 14:19-21; 12:1). Even when He did not perform a miracle, He was under the restriction of the heavens. He had the authority and the ability to do many works of power, but He did not abuse His authority or ability. He carried out God&rsquo;s will both in His performing of miracles and in His not performing of miracles. Therefore, He could say, &ldquo;I have come...to do Your will, O God&rdquo; (Heb. 10:7). People say that the Lord prophesied, cast out demons, and did works of power, but the Lord would say that He was merely carrying out the Father&rsquo;s will. Prophesying, casting out demons, and doing works of power require only that we have a gift, but carrying out the Father&rsquo;s will requires that we live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, being governed and restricted by the heavens. Only when we live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and are governed and restricted by the heavens can we know and do the Father&rsquo;s will.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO KINDS OF FOUNDATIONS</h2>
<p>Matthew 7:24-27 says, &ldquo;Everyone therefore who hears these words of Mine and does them shall be likened to a prudent man who built his house upon the rock. And the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and they beat against that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not do them shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand. And the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and they dashed against that house; and it fell, and its fall was great.&rdquo; In His conclusion the Lord spoke of two kinds of foundation. One foundation is upon a rock, which can stand the test. The other is built on sand, which cannot stand the test. The rock refers to the Lord&rsquo;s word. In particular it refers to His teaching on the mountain. If we accept His teaching and live by it, we are building a house upon the rock. The Lord&rsquo;s word is the foundation.</p>
<p>The foundation of sand refers to not living by the Lord&rsquo;s words. It also refers to human methods, opinions, and ways, which are outside the Lord&rsquo;s teaching. If a person hears the Lord&rsquo;s teaching but does not live by it, his living and walk will be based on his own method and opinions. These methods and opinions are all sand. If he remains in his methods and opinions, he will build a house upon the sand.</p>
<p>The word <em>house</em> may refer to human life, that is, our living and work. If we hear the Lord&rsquo;s teaching and live by it, we are building our life on the Lord&rsquo;s word as the eternal rock, and our life has an eternal foundation. If we hear the Lord&rsquo;s teaching but ignore it, we are building our life on the will of man. Such a life will not stand the test of time but will fall, and we will suffer loss.</p>
<p>No matter what our foundation is, our life will be tested. There are three kinds of tests. One test is the descending of rain from above. This refers to the trials that God gives us. Another test is the coming of rivers from the earth. Water refers to the corrupted people of the world, whom Satan uses to attack and destroy us. The third test is the blowing of winds in the air. This refers to the attack of Satan and his angels. If our life is based on the methods and opinions of the world, it will fall as soon as we encounter any of these three tests. However, if our life is based on the Lord&rsquo;s word, it will be unshakable and immovable no matter how it is tested.</p>
<p>There are four principles for the living and work of the kingdom people. The first principle is to enter the narrow gate and take the constricted way. The second principle is to discern the fruits of a person&rsquo;s living before accepting his leading. The third principle is to work according to the will of the heavenly Father. The fourth principle is to have our living and work according to the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>These four principles will test our living and our work. If we have these four principles, we will let the heavens govern us, and we will be under the ruling of the heavens. Furthermore, if we have these four principles, we will deny ourselves, reject our flesh, and not live according to our own will. However, if we do not have these four principles, we will not be under the authority of the heavens, we will not let the heavens rule, and we will be full of the self and the flesh. As a result, we will live according to the self.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
