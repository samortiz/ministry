   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A SIMPLE WAY TO BEAR REMAINING FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would like to present a simple way to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, you should make a vow to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You can pray, "Lord, as one of Your branches, I realize that I must bear fruit according to Your charge in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If I cannot get one sinner saved within a year, this is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, every week I will spend two or three hours to contact people for their salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This does not mean that you have to spend two or three hours at one time in one day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may spend some time in the morning to consider how to contact and save your unsaved relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You may spend twenty-five minutes to pray and make a record of these relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These twenty-five minutes should be reckoned as part of your two to three hours of labor in the gospel every week.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the evening you may write a letter to one of your relatives to find out how he is doing, opening the door for you to have further contact with him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The time spent in writing this letter is also a part of your gospel labor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let us suppose that you have five unsaved cousins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you labored three hours a week on these cousins in a concentrated way for one year, surely at least one of them would be brought to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to be fruit-bearing branches of Christ, we need to be revived by the Lord day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our publication called The Holy Word for Morning Revival has been a help to the saints to be revived by the Lord every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The most effective way to live the Christian life is by having a vital, living, active morning watch with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should get two verses from the Scripture to live on every day and then contact people for the Lord in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In addition to this, we need to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The reason why we do not bear fruit is because we do not practice contacting people directly, personally, and faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I would beg you elders to learn to have a start in this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You yourself have to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not expect others to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You yourself do this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Practice personally contacting people every week.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Contact them individually.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You can contact your relatives, friends, neighbors, colleagues, classmates, etc. You need to plan and schedule your time so that you contact two or three individuals every week.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You should pray, "Lord, I do not want to contact them in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not want to have natural talk when I meet with them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Lord, show me the vital way, the living way, to bring them to You."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you pray such a prayer, the Lord will show you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today there is the need of some faithful doers in the practice of fruit bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to practice contacting people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may contact someone without any success or result.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then we can go to the Lord to repent and open to Him for His adjustment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He will impress us to go back to them in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we follow the Lord to contact people according to His way, they will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As we go out to contact people one by one, we will find out the proper way from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We will also find out the right persons to visit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We will learn not to waste our time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have found that just to knock on doors in a general way can be a waste of time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must look to the Lord to get a proper candidate for our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then we need to work on him in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the successful way to labor in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The ones on whom we labor should be those with whom we are acquainted, either directly or indirectly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this way the time we spend will be worthwhile.</S>
