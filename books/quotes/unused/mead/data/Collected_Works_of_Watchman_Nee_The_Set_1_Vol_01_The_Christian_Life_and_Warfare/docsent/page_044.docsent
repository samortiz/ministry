   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The Release of the Captives</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Who delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love" Col 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ has overcome, and He is still overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are now in His kingdom, having been transferred out of the authority of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we firmly remember this fact and fully believe in it, the authority of darkness will not be able to come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The best way to maintain ourselves in this position is to periodically declare our position by faith and by our will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>E. The Victory of the Christians</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is the Overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we are in Christ and are joined to Him, we will also be the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can overcome every day because the Lord has said, "Behold, I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy...The spirits are subject to you" Luke 10:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"In My name they will cast out demons" Mark 16:17; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Acts 16:18; 19:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Apart from the Lord, we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should abide in the Lord all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we do everything in the Lord's name, Satan will be defeated continually.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE DECEPTIONS OF THE TEMPTER</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although Satan has numerous deceptions, "we are not ignorant of his schemes" 2 Cor 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If so, what do his deceptions accomplish?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Unfortunately, though some of us know his deceptions, our intention is not to guard against him!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can know all things in the Lord through the Holy Spirit; hence, none of Satan's deceptions can escape our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, when we trust in the Lord's strength, Satan's deceptions will become useless.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A. His Plot against the Unsaved Ones</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some unsaved ones love to listen to the Word, but Satan will rob them by stealing away the word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Those beside the way are those who heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they would not believe and be saved" Luke 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The devil is afraid of the Word, but he is not afraid of talk concerning the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we preach, we must not speak rashly and lose our spiritual power, for the devil will snatch away the word once he sees it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who are unsaved, those who are about to believe and be saved, and those who are not interested in the Word at all, have their minds deceived by the devil already.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"In whom the god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine on them" 2 Cor 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should pray that the eyes of the unsaved ones would be opened to receive the Lord's word and that this word would grow and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>B. His Deceptions against the Saved Ones 1.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Keeping Them from Being Absolute</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>in Their Consecration to God</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Acts 5:3</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is a jealous God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He demands man's total consecration, and He charges man to love Him with all his heart, all his mind, all his strength, and all his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He expects man to be selfless and to keep nothing back for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, Satan is the most afraid of man's absolute consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For man to do this causes Satan to lose his field of work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"Why has Satan filled your heart...to put aside for yourself some of the proceeds of the land?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Acts 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This couple was filled in their hearts with Satan; they kept something for themselves, yet they said that they were fully consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Most believers today consider it wrong not to consecrate at all, yet they consider that the price of consecration is too high.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As a result, they often deceive themselves and others by keeping back a portion for their own use.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The rest they consecrate to God in the hope that they will gain for themselves the appearance of total consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Little do they know that Satan has filled their hearts already!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who read this should ask themselves whether or not they have fully consecrated themselves.</S>
