   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He often gave alms to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He prayed to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord heard his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the above five points prove that Cornelius was a good man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, he was not a saved man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Emphasize strongly that he was a godly man, but he was not saved.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He always gave alms, but he was not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He prayed to God, and God heard his prayer, but he was not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why he was not saved He was a good man, but he was still a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Emphasize strongly that a good man is still a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was a good man; he had all the preceding five good points, but it cannot be said that he had no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A man is not without sin just because he honors his parents, is honest, meek, merciful, and compassionate.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was a good man but would still die.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A man who goes to the Sunday service, contributes regularly, and fears God will still have to die someday.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All his goodness, fear of the Lord, and giving of alms were of his own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since he did not have the life of God, he needed to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The gospel of salvation The gospel of salvation is not man s invention.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Cornelius thought that as long as he had good behavior and was a godly man, he would be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The gospel of salvation is a revelation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While Cornelius tried his own way to touch God, God appeared to him in a vision saying, go get Peter, he will show you the revelation of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only that kind of revelation can save you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The revelation of the gospel is to show that Jesus is the Lord of all, and that He is God come as man to be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The gospel is to show people that Christ died and resurrected to be the Savior of mankind, to forgive sins, and to be life for man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How can a good man be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A good man as well as a bad man needs to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A bad man has to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A good man also has to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A bad man may have a hundred sins to confess, and a good man may have at least ten sins to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, a good man also needs to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Just as a bad man needs Jesus to be his Savior, so also a good man needs Jesus to be his Savior.</S>
