   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CAPTAIN OF SALVATION A. He, as the Forerunner, the Pioneer,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Having Entered into Rest and Glory</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The anointed Heir of God, as the Captain of salvation, has entered into rest and glory through death and resurrection 6:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He did this as the Pioneer and Forerunner.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He took the lead to pass through the pathway of the cross and entered into rest and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is now sitting at the right hand of God 1:3, 13 crowned with glory and honor 2:9 to be the qualified Captain of our salvation that He may bring us through the pathway of the cross into the good land of rest and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>B. We, as His Partners, Sharing with Him</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>in What He Has Attained and Obtained</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In His foresight, God decided that this unique Heir needed a group of joint-heirs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God decided that it was not good enough for Christ to enter into the good land alone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God wanted this unique Heir to enter into the good land of the glorious expression of the Divine Being with a group of joint-heirs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more joint-heirs there are, the more glory there is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Consider Joshua s entering into the good land with the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Certainly God was able to bring Joshua alone into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose Joshua, a single person, marched into the good land, saying, I have come here by the Almighty God to take over the land.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although that would have been possible, it would not have been glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Joshua took the lead to enter into the good land, at least two million people marched after him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That frightened all the Canaanites to death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was not a single heir who entered into the good land but an army of joint-heirs.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all know what happened at Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God could have performed the same miracle with just Joshua, but if He had done this, there would have been no glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>An army marched around Jericho, and all the demons were terrified.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That was the glorious taking of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The entrance into the good land was a glorious entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are going to march into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have a Captain, the real Joshua.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all must be His partners in taking the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before we can be His partners, we must firstly be His partakers enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we enjoy Him and partake of Him, His title is not Christ but the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are partakers of the Holy Spirit 6:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But when He is the Captain, He is Jesus Christ, not the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When He is our enjoyment, He is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When He is our Captain, the One leading us, He is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not be bothered by all these different titles.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As I have showed you already, in the first two chapters of Hebrews we see that the very God is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This Son of God is also the Captain and the High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is similar to Zechariah 2 where we see that the Lord of hosts sent the Lord of hosts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord of hosts is both the Sender and the Sent One.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Likewise, in the first chapter of Hebrews we are told that God has spoken, that God has spoken in the Son, and that, eventually, the Son is addressed, O God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Following this, we are told that He is the Captain of our salvation and our High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How wonderful and marvelous this is!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As our Captain, He is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As our enjoyment, He is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When He takes the lead to march on, He is our Captain.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When He comes into us to be our enjoyment and nourishment, He is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are Christ s partakers and partners.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we enjoy Him, we are His partakers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we follow Him, we are His partners.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Are you a partaker of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that even in troublesome times we enjoy Him, partaking of His riches and nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After we have enjoyed Him in such a way, He becomes the Captain who takes the lead, and we follow Him as His partners.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When He marches, we march with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is the Captain and we are the army.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By this, we shall enter into His rest 4:8-9 and be brought into His glory 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>TODAY S JOSHUA AND CALEB</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ, the Captain of salvation, is the real Joshua leading God s people to take and possess the land.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We, His partners, are the real Calebs sharing with Him in the taking and possessing of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to spend much time to consider this matter of taking the good land, for it is not as clear as it should be.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The lowest view of the good land is that when a saint dies he crosses the river Jordan and enters the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many songs speak about crossing the cold waves of Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even John Bunyan interpreted the good land this way in Pilgrim s Progress.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The inner life people, the so-called spiritual people, say that Canaan is not the third heaven, because Canaan is filled with demons, giants, enemies, and Canaanites.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Since there are no enemies in the third heaven, the inner life people rejected the low concept of the good land being heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But the inner life people did not tell us clearly what Canaan is.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some of them say that Canaan signifies the air, the heavenlies, where the principalities, powers, and evil spirits are.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>From my youth I was not satisfied with the concept that Canaan was heaven, but as a young seeker of the Lord I did accept the concept that Canaan was the heavenlies full of Canaanites, principalities, and powers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, after a certain period of time, I began to doubt this.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If Canaan is the heavenlies where the wicked spirits are, then where is the rest?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>My point in mentioning this is that Christ s operation is to gain and possess the good land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Without the good land of Canaan, God s purpose cannot be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Christ s enterprise is to take the good land of Canaan, possess it, and build God s house in it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The good land is the fulfillment of God s purpose in Christ, which is to have a full expression of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>For this, Christ is the Operator, and we are His partners.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are His partners in this enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have been inaugurated with Christ for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We have been inaugurated with Christ to share His office that, with Him, we might take the land, possess it, and build the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Eventually, this will be the land of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Praise the Lord that we are His partners.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Being a partaker is for the purpose of being a partner.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We are not only partakers of Christ but also His partners!</S>
