 <h2 class="head1">ENJOYING ETERNAL LIFE IN ETERNITY</h2>
<p>The enjoyment of eternal life in eternity in the new heaven and new earth is the full enjoyment of God&rsquo;s salvation, which all the saved ones will share in eternity.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (John 4:14).</p>
<p>The water the Lord gives is His life. This life will become a fountain of water in us, springing up and flowing us into eternal life. Thus, we will enjoy the blessing of eternal life in eternity.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Enter into it, but only those who are written in the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:27).</p>
<p>The full blessing of God&rsquo;s salvation is the coming New Jerusalem, which is given to all the saved ones for their enjoyment in eternity. All those who have the Lord&rsquo;s eternal life and whose names are written in the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life will participate in this blessing. All those who have received eternal life by faith will enter into the New Jerusalem based on this life and enjoy the blessings of eternal life.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:6; see also 22:1).</p>
<p>All the saved ones will enjoy the blessings of eternal life in the New Jerusalem, and one of these blessings will be the water of life. This water flows out from the throne of God and refers to God&rsquo;s ever-living life. All the saved ones will eternally drink of this water of life and eternally enjoy God&rsquo;s ever-living life.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;They may have right to the tree of life&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 22:14).</p>
<p>All the saved ones will enjoy the blessings of the New Jerusalem, including another blessing&mdash;the tree of life. The water of life indicates that the life of God will eternally quench our thirst, and the tree of life indicates that the life of God will eternally satisfy our hunger. Therefore, in eternity future we will enjoy God&rsquo;s ever-living life, causing us to never hunger or thirst. This will be our enjoyment of eternal life in eternity.</p>
<p>In this age we obtain eternal life as soon as we believe. After obtaining eternal life, we can enjoy it and live by it. If we live for the Lord today by the power of this eternal life, we will be overcomers. Then during the coming kingdom age, we will reign in life together with the Lord, we will enjoy the glory of life, and we will have a foretaste of the blessings of eternity. Finally, when eternity arrives, we, who have received eternal life through salvation, will enjoy the blessings of eternal life in the New Jerusalem for eternity.</p>
