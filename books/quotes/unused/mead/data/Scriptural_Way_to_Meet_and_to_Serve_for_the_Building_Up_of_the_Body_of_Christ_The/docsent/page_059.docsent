   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Through the Hymns</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To increase our knowledge and experience of the word, we also need to study and use the proper hymns Eph 5:19; Col 3:16b .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Any writing that we use apart from the holy Scriptures must be based upon the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The hymns in our hymnal were altogether based on the Scriptures when they were written.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to read and study the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The table of contents in our hymnal is a very good chart with all the items of the proper theology.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By studying the hymns and learning to speak them, we will gain more knowledge of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through the singing, reading, and speaking of the hymns, we will also gain the experience of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many verses of the Bible may be hard to understand without the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many hymns are expositions of certain chapters or verses of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we get into one of these hymns, we will be able to understand the portion of the Word concerning which it was written.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to use the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through the Publications in Life</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can also let the word of Christ dwell in us richly through the publications in life 1 Thes 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have many publications in life among us, especially the Life-study of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Life-studies are a storehouse of the riches of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I charged the young full-time trainees in Taipei to spend from two to four hours every morning in the Life-studies for two to four years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some of the young people did this and finished reading all the messages and also all the footnotes of the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When these ones stand up to speak, their speaking is rich because they have gained much knowledge and experience of the word within their being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When they speak, the riches flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord may afford some among us, especially the young people, the opportunity to study the New Testament in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need some who can do this in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Most of us may not be able to make it through the Life-study of the New Testament in two to four years, but we can all get into the Life-study messages according to our time and capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Within the Limits of the Healthy Words</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>of the Apostles, Which Are the Contents</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>of the New Testament and of Our Faith Belief</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can gain the knowledge and experience of the Lord s word based on the Scriptures, through the hymns, and through the publications in life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This knowledge and experience that we gain must be within the limits of the healthy words of the Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching of the apostles, which are the contents of the New Testament and of our faith, our belief 1 Tim 6:3; Acts 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The entire Bible, especially the New Testament, is very profound.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many things are covered in the Bible, but if we pay too much attention to certain matters, we will be distracted from the healthy words of the Lord and from the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why 1 Timothy 1 tells us that Paul told Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To teach differently is to teach things different from the healthy words of the Lord Jesus and from the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we are willing to be limited in this way when we come to the Bible, we will gradually discern what things are healthy and what things are not so necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we read the Bible, it is easy for us to be biased according to our personal preference.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some Christians emphasize tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The matter of speaking in tongues is mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we study these chapters in an unbiased, fair, and objective way, however, we will see that Paul wrote them not to encourage tongue-speaking but to adjust and limit the Corinthian saints because of their abuse of tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul s spirit and attitude toward speaking in tongues in these chapters is negative, not positive.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This indicates that speaking in tongues is not crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In our sixty-six year history in the Lord s recovery, we attempted to practice the so-called miraculous Pentecostal things, including tongue-speaking, and we discovered that they were altogether unprofitable.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the beginning, these Pentecostal things seemed good to stir up the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But eventually the outcome was a damage to the church life and a destruction to the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After the third attempt among us to practice these things, the leading ones and especially the co-workers kept their hands off the Pentecostal practices.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We spontaneously dropped these things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We found out that they did not work to properly edify the saints and to build up the Body of Christ in a very positive way with the proper life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul wrote 1 Corinthians 12 and 14 to deal with the abuse of tongue-speaking, and he wrote chapter thirteen on the need of love in order to balance the Corinthians by turning them to care for the Body and not for the outward gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Foot washing is another practice that has been overemphasized by some, thus distracting them from the central lane of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One brother who was very much for the practice of foot washing, which is mentioned in John 13, asked me if we practiced foot washing before the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I told him that we have practiced foot washing occasionally in the past but that we did not practice it in a legal way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This brother then told me that our way to practice the Lord s table was not scriptural because we did not practice foot washing with it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To pick up a practice such as foot washing and not be restricted within the limits of the teaching of the apostles is altogether not healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some also overemphasize the teaching concerning head covering in 1 Corinthians 11.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We were the first Christians who practiced head covering in mainland China, but we did not practice it in a legal way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some Christians were influenced by us to pick up this practice, but they practiced it legally.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They established ordinances concerning what kind of head covering the sisters should wear.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These ordinances stirred up arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Their legality in this matter issued in fighting over doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To overemphasize such a teaching is altogether not healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must increase our knowledge and experience of the healthy words, which are the contents of the teaching of the apostles, and what we gain from the word and speak should always be within the limits of the apostles teaching.</S>
