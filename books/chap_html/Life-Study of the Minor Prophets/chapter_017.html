<h1 class="title">THE INTRODUCTORY WORD,<br />
JEHOVAH&rsquo;S JUDGMENTS<br />
ON THE SURROUNDING NATIONS,<br />
AND<br />
HIS JUDGMENTS ON JUDAH AND ISRAEL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Amos 1:1&mdash;2:16</h1>
<p>The book of Amos, as one of the Minor Prophets, also covers the chastisement of Israel and the punishment upon the nations to bring in the manifestation of Christ, issuing in the restoration, which consummates in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</p>
<p>In this message we will cover three matters: the introductory word, Jehovah&rsquo;s judgments on the surrounding nations, and His judgments on Judah and Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE INTRODUCTORY WORD</h2>
<p>The introductory word is in 1:1-2.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of the Name Amos</h2>
<p><em>Amos</em> in Hebrew means &ldquo;burden bearer.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Time of Amos&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>The time of Amos&rsquo;s ministry was about 787 B.C. (1:1a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Object of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The object of his ministry was the northern kingdom of Israel (1:1b).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Place of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The place of his ministry was Bethel in the northern kingdom of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of the book of Amos is Jehovah&rsquo;s judgments on Israel and the surrounding nations, with the issue of restoration.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The central thought of the prophecy of Amos, which is nearly the same as that of Hosea and Joel, is that Jehovah punishes the nations, taking Israel as the center, that the age of restoration (Matt. 19:28) may be brought in for the kingdom of David&mdash;the kingdom of Christ (Rev. 11:15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Revelation concerning Christ</h2>
<p>In the book of Amos the revelation concerning Christ is implied in the tabernacle of David, the kingdom of David, which is a type of the kingdom of Christ (Amos 9:11-12; cf. Acts 15:16-17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Sections</h2>
<p>The book of Amos has five sections: the introductory word (1:1-2); Jehovah&rsquo;s judgments on the surrounding nations (1:3&mdash;2:3); Jehovah&rsquo;s judgments on Judah and Israel (2:4-16); Jehovah&rsquo;s contending with the house of Jacob (3:1&mdash;9:10), including Jehovah&rsquo;s three reproofs to Israel (3:1&mdash;5:27) and the plagues of the five signs seen by Amos (6:1&mdash;9:10); and the restoration of the house of Israel, with the rebuilding of the fallen tabernacle of David for the kingdom of Christ (9:11-15).</p>
