<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. An Organism Constituted with His Members</H2><P>The Body of Christ is an organism constituted with His members (Rom. 12:5). As the members of the Body of Christ, we are the living parts of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Built Up:</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. With the Unsearchable Riches of Christ</H2><P>The Body of Christ needs to be built up with the unsearchable riches of Christ through the divine dispensing (Eph. 3:8-11, 2). This is the stress, the emphasis, of the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. By the Gifted Members and by Each One Part</H2><P>The Body of Christ is built up through the divine dispensing by the gifted members as the joints of the rich supply and by each one part operating in its measure (Eph. 4:16). The gifted members must be active, living members. They dispense the rich supply, which is the supply of Christ. Each one part also needs to operate in its measure. We may feel that we are not the gifted members, so we are not needed. But all of us are parts of the Body, and we need to operate according to our measure. We should not merely function, but function in fullness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Through the Growth in Life of the Body</H2><P>The Body of Christ is also built up through the growth in life of the Body, holding Christ as its Head (Eph. 4:15-16). Through the growth in life, the church is built. To build anything, we first need the material. The material for the building of the church is the riches of Christ. In order to build, we also need the skill. In the church we need "smiths," that is, skilled people. Gifted persons are "smiths" and the operating parts are small "smiths." We also need a way to be built up, and the way is to grow. If we do not grow, there is no church building. The church building is constituted with the riches of Christ, by the gifted persons and the operating parts, and through the growth in life of all the saints.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. For Christ to Head Up All Things in Himself</H2><P>Eventually, such a built up church is for Christ to head up all things in the universe in Himself (Eph. 1:10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The House of God</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Composed of the Many Sons of God<br>as the Many Brothers of Christ,<br>the Firstborn Son of God</H2><P>The church is also the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15-16). The house of God is composed of the many sons of God as the many brothers of Christ, the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10-12). We are the Body with Christ as the Head. We are also a house with Christ as the firstborn Son among many sons, His many brothers.</P>
