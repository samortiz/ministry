[1]  CONTENTS Christ as the Content of the Church for His Expression Christ as Everything to the Church in the Epistles to the Romans and the Corinthians Christ Being the Content of the Church Typified by the Tabernacle Christ as the Offerings for the Church Meetings Christ as Grace and Reality The Tabernacle and Its Covering Typifying the Church as the Expression of Christ
[2]  We are for ministering and imparting Christ into people and for bringing people into the Body of Christ to be built up as a living expression.
[3]  The church should not be the expression of any teaching or gift but just the expression of Christ.
[4]  This is because the church is the expression of Christ not of Christ in doctrine, but of Christ Himself.
[5]  CHAPTER TWO CHRIST AS EVERYTHING TO THE CHURCH IN THE EPISTLES TO THE ROMANS AND THE CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: Rom 12:6; 1 Cor 15:45b; 6:17; 2 Cor 12:7-10
[6]  Now we come to the last part of Romans chs.
[7]  This shows us that we will be built up together as the Body of Christ, the church, to express Christ.
[8]  We express Christ because Christ is wrought into us.
[9]  A certain amount of Christ has been wrought into him, so gradually he has the burden to give material things to others v. 13a . In his giving you can sense the flavor of Christ, the reality of Christ, and the presence of Christ.
[10]  Thus, the whole book of Romans shows us that Christ must be wrought into us as our life and content and the church must be the expression of Christ.
[11]  The end of Romans reveals the church as the Body expressing Christ, but the church in Corinth was expressing something else.
[12]  The church must be the expression of Christ as revealed in the book of Romans.
[13]  CHAPTER THREE CHRIST BEING THE CONTENT OF THE CHURCH TYPIFIED BY THE TABERNACLE
[14]  In the outer court Christ is seen as righteousness for us to enjoy.
[15]  We have to put on Christ as our righteousness.
[16]  In the outer court, we see that Christ is expressed as righteousness before God and man.
[17]  We do not merely put on Christ as our righteousness, but we also eat Christ as our spiritual food so that He can become our very nature John 6:57 .
[18]  Eventually, our natural man including the will, the self, the flesh, the "I" must be broken.
[19]  When we are walking in the spirit and not in our natural life, we will enjoy Christ as the glory of God in the Holy of Holies.
[20]  We will have Christ expressed among us and through us as the glory of God.
[21]  In this chapter we want to see the revelation concerning Christ as the offerings for the church meetings.
[22]  CHRIST AS THE REALITY OF THE WAVE OFFERING AND THE HEAVE OFFERING
[23]  According to Numbers 18, all the things offered by the people of Israel were referred to as wave offerings and heave offerings.
[24]  The wave offering signifies the resurrected Christ, and the heave offering signifies the ascended Christ.
[25]  Whenever we have something of Christ to bring to the church meeting to express Christ, this is always something of resurrection and ascension.
[26]  When we learn to live by Christ, to take Christ as our life, the indwelling Christ will enable us to live a life absolutely for God and not for ourselves.
[27]  Now we come to the experience of Christ as the peace offering Lev 3:1-17; 7:11-21 .
[28]  When we have Christ in our living, this Christ who is practical to us will be our fellowship with God and others.
[29]  Regardless of how much we live by Christ and enjoy Christ, we still have our flesh and our sinful nature, so we need Christ as our sin offering to deal with our sinful nature.
[30]  If we daily labor on Christ, we will have something of Christ to bring to our church meetings to contribute to others and offer to God so that we can enjoy Christ with God for the exhibition and exaltation of Christ.
[31]  We have seen that the offerings in the Old Testament are types of Christ as the reality and content of the church life.
[32]  In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus told the Samaritan woman that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship in spirit and in truthfulness, or truth.
[33]  The entire Old Testament presents a full picture of what Christ is to us, showing us how we have to enjoy Christ, experience Christ, and partake of Christ.
[34]  Exodus 26:1 says, "Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work shalt thou make them."
[35]  According to the type of the tabernacle, we experience the work of Christ and what He has accomplished for us in the outer court.
[36]  Then we enter into the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies where we experience Christ Himself as everything to us.
[37]  We experience Christ as the supply of life, the light of life, the resurrection, and the all-inclusive One so that He may be wrought into us.
[38]  Christ is wrought into us gradually and progressively as everything so that we may grow in Christ, by Christ, and with Christ.
[39]  We must uplift Christ, exalt Christ, and express Christ as the only roof covering us.
[40]  The church is the issue of Christ being wrought into a group of people, and all of these people uplift Christ, exalt Christ, and put on Christ to cover them and protect them.
[41]  CHRIST TYPIFIED BY THE TABERNACLE'S FOUR LAYERS OF COVERING Fine Twined Linen
[42]  Now we want to consider the tabernacle's four layers of covering.
