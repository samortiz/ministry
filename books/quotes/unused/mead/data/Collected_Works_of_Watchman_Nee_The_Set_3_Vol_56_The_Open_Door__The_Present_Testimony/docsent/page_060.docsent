   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Two Principles of Christian Living</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Here, I would like to add another principle for living: the principle of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You could say that everyone in the world can live according to at least three principles: they can live by sin, or they can live by right and wrong, or they can live by life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people live on earth by following the lusts of their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are sons of wrath who are bound by the fashions of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They live and act according to the operation of the evil spirits in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Their principle for living is that they live by sin Eph 2:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This morning I do not want to speak about this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I believe that many among us have already left the principle of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What we will consider this morning is apart from the principle of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These two trees represent two principles of living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After becoming Christians, some people live by the principle of right and wrong, while others live by the principle of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In speaking about this matter, I am making the assumption that we have already left the principle of sin and are walking before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we would consider a little, we would see that some people live according to the principle of right and wrong or good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Please remember that the principle of right and wrong, the principle of good and evil, is not Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christianity is a matter of life, not of being according to a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christianity speaks of life, not of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christianity teaches life, not right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are many young brothers and sisters here this morning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I would like to tell you that after you received the Lord Jesus and gained a new life, you gained something marvelous inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You obtained another principle of living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if you do not know about it, you will set the principle of life aside and begin to follow the principle of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Meaning of Following</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>the Principle of Right and Wrong</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is the principle of right and wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If our conduct is controlled by the principle of right and wrong, then we ask if something is right or wrong whenever we have to make a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Would it be good to do this, or would it be evil?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we ask whether it is good, we are, in effect, asking ourselves, "Am I right to do this or not?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many people consider much whether something is good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They consider whether they can or cannot do a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They ask, "Is this right or wrong?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As they carefully consider a certain matter, being Christians, they determine whether it is good and right to do that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By taking care to decide whether or not something is good and right, they consider themselves to be good Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's Word says, "The tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" Gen 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the most, this practice is only a discerning of good from evil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At best, it is merely choosing and rejecting choosing good and rejecting evil.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christianity does not have an outward good and an outward evil.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It does not have a definite standard in place.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I may choose something good and reject something evil today, but this is not Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is the Old Testament, the law, worldly religions, human morality, and human ethics, but it is not Christianity.</S>
