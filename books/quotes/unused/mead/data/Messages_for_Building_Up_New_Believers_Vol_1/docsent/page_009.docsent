   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Believing Being on the Positive Side,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Baptism Being on the Negative Side</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What then is baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Baptism is a deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Believing is on the positive side and baptism is on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Baptism delivers you out of that corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many people in the world may say that you are one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the moment you are baptized, they will realize you are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The one whom they have known for years is now saved and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Your friendship with them is terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You are in the tomb; you have reached the end of your road.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You already know that you have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now that you are baptized, you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From now on, everyone knows that you are the Lord s and that you belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is true because once a person believes and is baptized, everyone will know where he stands.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without believing, there is no inward reality, and what one does will be nothing but an outward display.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With believing, there is inward reality, and if one takes a further step to be baptized, he will be separated from the world, having terminated his relationship with it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Baptism is a separation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It separates us from others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus word is quite clear.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It goes on by saying, He who does not believe shall be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Unbelief alone is sufficient for condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As long as a person belongs to that corporate body, his unbelief is sufficient for condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if one has believed, he still needs to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If he is not baptized, he still has not made an exit outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A Very Amazing Thing in the World</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A very amazing thing in the world today is the attitude of Judaism, Hinduism, and Islam toward baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Any Jew who embraces the Christian faith in secret will not be persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many Jews believe in the historical record concerning the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Their greatest hurdle is not in believing in Him but in baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once they are baptized, they are cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some sisters were poisoned by their fianc after they were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such things happen even in civilized communities like London and New York.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is all right for a person to believe in his heart, but once he is baptized, others will persecute him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In India, no one will do anything to a believer if he is not baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But once he is baptized, they will cast him out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is all right for one to believe in the Lord, but he cannot be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The reaction of the Muslims is more violent.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Someone once said that it is difficult for a Muslim believer to remain alive.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As soon as he believes, he will die.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Dr. Swema is the first person who succeeded in working among the Muslims.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He said, My work will never grow, because once a person believes in the Lord, he has to be sent away immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Otherwise, he will die within two or three days after his baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This condition is prevalent even among Muslims today.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Baptism is an open declaration that one has come out.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should never consider the salvation here to mean a personal salvation of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the Bible, salvation signifies a deliverance from the world, not deliverance from hell.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>B. Baptism Being for the Forgiveness of Sins</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the day of Pentecost, the apostles told the Jews, Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins Acts 2:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Protestants have difficulty accepting this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But this verse is the plain word of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is strange that the emphasis of the apostle s word is not upon faith but upon baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Was the focus of Peter s message in Acts 2 on persuading men to believe?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No. Does this mean that Peter s preaching was inferior to ours? The Bible tells us that the most crucial thing concerning salvation is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How could Peter have left this out?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perhaps he could ignore other doctrines in his message, but how could he not speak about faith?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Nevertheless, he did not speak about it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Instead, he spoke about baptism, and the Holy Spirit pricked the heart of those who listened.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What about us?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We say that faith alone is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We think this is orthodox Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Yet Peter said, Be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Peter spoke only of baptism because those who listened to him were the ones who had killed the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Fifty days prior to that, they were crying, Take this man away.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>These were the same people who were shouting and crying in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Now they needed to be separated from the rest of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is why it was not necessary to speak to them about believing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They only needed to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>That would be sufficient for them to get out.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As soon as they were baptized, their relationship with that corporate body would be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As soon as they were baptized, they would leave that corporate body and their sins would be washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They would no longer be part of that corporate body; they would be out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is why Peter said, Be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The act of baptism brought them out.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>As soon as they came out, all problems were solved.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You need to realize that you were originally in the world and that you were an enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Since you have come out, you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You need to confess before God and before men that you have come out and have nothing to do with that corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You are through with it.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This was the main teaching on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>At this point your mind needs to be directed by God s Word, not by Protestant theology.</S>
