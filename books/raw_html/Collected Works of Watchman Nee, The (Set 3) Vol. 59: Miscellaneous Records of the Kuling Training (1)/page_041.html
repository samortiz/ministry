<h2 class="head1">THE LAWLESSNESS OF HAM</h2><p>Today we will mention a few clear cases of lawlessness in the Old Testament. These are all familiar stories to us. First, consider the rebellion of Ham against Noah, which is found in Genesis 9:20-27. This passage gives a record of the first slave in the entire Bible. If we read it, we will find out how slavery came into existence. Noah took the lead to do something wrong. He drank of the wine in the vineyard, became drunk, and was naked in his tent. Noah's younger son, Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father's nakedness in the tent and went out and told his two brothers, Shem and Japheth. As far as the fact is concerned, Noah had disgraced himself; he should not have become drunk. But there was a spirit of rebellion in Ham. He did not remain under his father's authority. When he saw his father's mistake, he went out and told his brothers immediately. Ham did not see how serious authority is. He did not see that his father was his authority. A man should not be tempted in his words or deeds to trespass against God's deputy authority. He should not give up his fear of God or his respect for deputy authority.</p><h2 class="head2">A Rebellious Man Rejoicing<br />in the Humiliation of Authority</h2><p>A fleshly person always rejoices in the humiliation of deputy authority, and the one with a rebellious spirit will always rebel. The absence of authority means freedom for the flesh. This is the reason so many people enjoy seeing authority fall into disgrace. Ham was Noah's son; he was put under Noah's authority. After Noah became drunk and naked, Ham was tempted to rejoice and make fun of his father's stumbling. He immediately went to his two brothers and told them about their father's action. This shows that he had a spirit of rebellion within him. The first result of the flesh's rebellion against authority is a disrespectful attitude. The next result is transgression in words. Ham was rebellious in his attitude; he enjoyed seeing authority in disgrace. When he saw his father's humiliation, he went out and told his brothers. His brothers, however, were different in attitude; they did not rejoice. They considered it a grievous, sad, shameful, and dishonorable thing. They took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders, walked backward, and covered the nakedness of their father. They did not see the nakedness of their father because they walked backward.</p><h2 class="head2">The Result of Rebellion&mdash;Slavery Forever</h2><p>When Noah woke from his sleep, he found out what his younger son had done, and he prophesied. This is the first recorded prophecy of man in the Bible. In Noah's prophecy both Shem and Japheth were blessed. Our Lord Jesus was a descendant of Shem. In other words, Shem ushered in Christ. The blessing which Japheth received related to expansion. For the past two thousand years the spreading of the gospel has been done mainly through Japheth's descendants. Japheth ushered in the preachers of Christ. Ham, however, received the curse. His son Canaan was to be a slave to Shem and Japheth. The result of rebellion to authority is perpetual slavery and perpetual subjection to authority. The beginning of slavery in the Bible is with Canaan. Being a slave means being under others' authority and losing one's freedom perpetually.</p><p>We have to see that the first man, Adam, fell through disobedience to God's word and by acting according to his own will. He ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and was cursed. After the flood Noah became drunk and exposed his nakedness. However, this incident exposed Ham's rebellion, and he came under a curse which lasts even until today. The first person to be cursed after the flood was Ham. I have a heavy burden within me to say a word to everyone here: If we aspire to serve the Lord, we all must allow the Lord to bring us to a point where we experience authority in a drastic way. We have to allow God's authority to cut through our whole being, even our very constitution. We have to meet authority in a drastic way. If a person only sees Noah as a man and nothing else, he has not touched authority. But if a person touches the authority behind Noah, he will not be rash and careless. We have to touch authority before our service to God will be acceptable to Him. We cannot serve God under the principle of lawlessness or in the spirit of lawlessness.</p>
