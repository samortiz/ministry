   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Triune God Being Available to All People</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The three gates on each side signify that the Triune God Father, Son, and Spirit work together to bring people into the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is indicated in the three parables in Luke 15 and implied in the Lord s word in Matthew 28:19.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The three parables in Luke 15 concern the shepherd and the lost sheep, the woman and the lost coin, and the father and the returned prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The shepherd refers to the Son; the father, of course, to the Father; and the woman signifies the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order for a sinner to be brought back to the Father s house, there is the need of the Son, the shepherd, to bring back the lost sheep; there is the need of the Spirit to enlighten the hearts of people that they may repent; and there is the need of the Father to receive the returned and repentant prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the Triune God is the entrance into the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fact that the Triune God is working to bring people into the holy city is also implied in the Lord s word in Matthew 28:19.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be baptized into the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is the entrance into the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the Father, Son, and Spirit are the three gates on each side of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The three gates are not on three sides respectively; rather, there are three gates on each of the four sides repeatedly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The gates on any one of the sides are exactly the same as the gates on the other three sides.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that the Triune God is available to people in all four corners of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The three gates indicate that the Triune God has come to reach us and to bring us into His eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The three in the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, have come out in God s economy to reach us and to bring us back to His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A number of verses in the New Testament speak of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, in Ephesians 3:14 through 17 Paul said, I bow my knees unto the Father... that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man; that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In these verses we see the Father, the Spirit, and Christ, the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Second Corinthians 13:14 also unfolds the Triune God: The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this verse the three of the Godhead are for His dispensing, for His going out and coming in, that is, for His spreading out and our entering in.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first mention of man in the whole Bible speaks of him in relation to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Genesis 1:26 says, And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The us in this verse refers to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, in the verse where man is first mentioned, God is alluded to as being triune.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If God were not triune, He would not be able to dispense Himself into us, to work Himself into us, and to mingle Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But because God is triune, He can enter into human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way, the Triune God comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Mingling of the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>with His Creature, Man</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Three gates on each of the four sides, constituting the number twelve, also imply the mingling of the Triune God with man, God s creature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The number four signifies the creature 4:6 , and the number three, of course, signifies the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The number twelve does not denote addition but multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Three times four indicates that the Triune God mingles Himself with His creature, man, to produce a composition, a compound.</S>
