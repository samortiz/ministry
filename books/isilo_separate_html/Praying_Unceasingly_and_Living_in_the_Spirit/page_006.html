<h1 class="title">DRAWING A PICTURE VERSUS<br />
LIVING A REALITY</h1>
<p>Christian knowledge concerning the Holy Spirit has advanced gradually through the ages to what the Lord has shown us in these years. In the nineteenth century the Brethren saw some light concerning the Spirit, but the light that they saw cannot compare to what we have seen. The light that we have seen is very clear.</p>
<p>The Lord has shown us that He wants to gain the church as His expression. God created man in His image and according to His likeness so that man could express Him. God wants to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life so that He and man may be joined as one in life. Then God will be the life and content of a group of people, and they will be His expression. We know this truth, and we can speak it. If we liken this truth to a tiger, then every one of us is able to draw a realistic picture of a tiger.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PICTURE IN THE BIBLE NEEDING<br />
THE SPIRIT FOR REALITY</h2>
<p>We should not despise pictures, because the Old Testament is a picture. However, the reality of the Old Testament pictures is with the Spirit. With the Spirit the pictures in the Bible have reality and life, but without the Spirit the pictures are empty and dead letter. We are clear that the Spirit is God. To have the Bible without the Spirit is to have the picture without life. Hence, even though we speak the truths in the Bible and have seen much light, without the Spirit we have mere doctrine, a picture, and in principle we are no different from the Old Testament. Since the time of the apostles, countless spiritual men have touched the Spirit and have written about what they touched for later generations to read and experience. Without the Spirit, these spiritual men would have merely &ldquo;drawn pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the past we made the grave mistake of regarding the Old Testament and the New Testament as merely pictures. We must admit that we also regarded the truth and spiritual literature as pictures. Ninety-five percent of our reading of the Old Testament, the New Testament, and various spiritual publications has been a picture because we may have touched the Spirit in only five percent of our reading. Regrettably, instead of touching the Spirit, we received doctrines, testimonies, knowledge, methods, and practices. Hence, all these have become pictures.</p>
<p>We probably pay more attention to the Spirit than other Christian groups do. However, we have the Spirit five percent of the time, and the remaining ninety-five percent of the time we mainly have doctrines from the Bible, from the truths we have received from the Lord, and from spiritual practices. The Lord said, &ldquo;You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me. Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life&rdquo; (John 5:39-40). This word clearly shows that it is one thing to search the Scriptures and another to come to the Lord and receive life. If our reading of the Bible can be unrelated to life, then our reading of other spiritual publications can be as well.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TURNING FROM DOCTRINE TO REALITY</h2>
<p>We are skillful in our &ldquo;drawings.&rdquo; The trainings in Taiwan began in 1952, and we held numerous trainings in 1953 and 1954. These trainings brought in considerable blessings. However, we spent ninety-five percent of our time &ldquo;drawing pictures.&rdquo; It would be marvelous if ninety-five percent of our living, our work, and the testimony of the church were in the Spirit. However, perhaps less than five percent of our living, work, and testimony were of the Spirit. Everything we did was mainly related to &ldquo;drawing a picture&rdquo; because it was without the Spirit.</p>
<p>In 1958 we began to speak of eating the Lord, drinking the Lord, and enjoying the Lord, because we felt the futility of doctrine, knowledge, and philosophy. The Lord is the Spirit; hence, we must touch the Spirit. In 1960 we spent the whole year learning to exercise our spirit and to blend in the spirit. The <em>Supplement of Eighty-five Hymns</em> was written in early 1961 in Chinese. Christ, the Spirit, and the church are the three important items in these eighty-five hymns. One of these hymns is &ldquo;Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #499). Everyone liked to sing these hymns, but they merely appreciated the hymns without touching the Spirit. We sang many hymns concerning the Spirit, but I am concerned that we did not touch the Spirit.</p>
<p>After October 1961 I went from Taipei to Manila and then to the United States. I remained in the United States for about a year. In October 1962 the brothers in Taipei wrote to me and asked me to return to Taipei for a conference. However, I was clear within that I should accept the burden to remain in the United States and not return to Taipei. So I cabled the brothers and told them that I could not return to Taipei. Hence, we began the work in the United States at the end of 1962.</p>
<p>The work in the United States began in the Spirit. Therefore, after a short period of time there were obvious results related to exercising the spirit. What we were unable to do in Taiwan in 1960 and 1961, we achieved in the United States. In the United States we emphasized the Spirit more than the truth. Hence, there was the supply of life that brought in the blessing. In 1970 we spontaneously began to migrate. That year there was an international conference in Los Angeles with an attendance of twelve hundred. At that time there were about fifteen hundred people in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the United States. After the migrations began, we increased to over six thousand in two years, that is, by the end of 1972.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
