<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Fleeing to Egypt</H2><P>Christ was found in Bethlehem. This discovery of Christ created trouble. God used this trouble to bring the young child out of Bethlehem to Egypt (Matt. 2:13-18). Hosea 11:1 prophesied that Jesus would be called out of Egypt. Without the trouble that occurred after Jesus was found in Bethlehem, there would have been no occasion for Him to flee to Egypt.</P><P>This is very meaningful. The wise men made a great mistake, but their mistake offered God the opportunity to fulfill His prophecy. But do not make mistakes purposely. That will not work. Try your best to do things right. Nevertheless, no matter how hard you try to be right, eventually you will make as big a mistake as the wise men did. Never say, "Let us do evil, that good may come." If you do evil, good will not come. However, if you try to be right but still make a mistake, that mistake will offer God a chance to fulfill His purpose.</P><P>Because Joseph fled with Mary and Jesus into Egypt, the young child Jesus escaped the first martyrdom, the martyrdom caused by the mistake of the wise men. Satan is always busy, waiting for an opportunity to cause martyrdom. However, God is sovereign over all, even over Satan, to preserve His dear ones from the enemy's wiles. By God's sovereignty the young Jesus was preserved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Raised in Nazareth</H2><P>At this point I need to present a little history. Although you know the story, you may still need more light. Mary conceived a child in Nazareth (Luke 1:26-27, 31). According to the prophecy in Micah 5:2, however, Christ had to be born in Bethlehem. Under God's sovereign arrangement, Caesar Augustus ordered the first census of the Roman Empire (Luke 2:1-7). This forced all the people to return to their native places. Mary and Joseph were forced to return to Bethlehem, their hometown. Immediately after they arrived in Bethlehem, the child Jesus was born. The mistake of the magi aroused the hatred and jealousy of King Herod, who was angered that a kingly child had been born. Then Joseph received guidance in a dream to take the child to Egypt (Matt. 2:13-15). This enabled God to fulfill the prophecy of Hosea 11:1. After Herod had died, Joseph received word in another dream to return to the Holy Land (Matt. 2:19-20). When Joseph had returned and had learned that Archelaus, the son of Herod, was in power, he was afraid to remain in the territory around Bethlehem. Therefore, he went to Nazareth, where Jesus was raised (vv. 21-23). For this reason Jesus was called Jesus of Nazareth.</P><P>What does all this mean? It means that when Jesus was born into the human race, He appeared in a way that was somewhat hidden, in a way that was not open or evident. Sometimes I have even used the word "sneaky" to describe it. Everyone called Him Jesus of Nazareth, for He was a Nazarene. But the Bible said that Christ would be born in Bethlehem. The hidden way of Christ's birth bothered all the religious people. When Philip met Jesus, he realized that Jesus was the Messiah. Then Philip went to Nathanael and told him that he had met the Messiah and that He was the son of Joseph, a man of Nazareth. Immediately Nathanael said, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" (John 1:45-46). Did Philip give Nathanael the wrong information? It is difficult to say. Philip only knew that Jesus was the son of Joseph and that He was a Nazarene. Although Jesus was from Nazareth and was a Nazarene, He had not been born in Nazareth, but in Bethlehem. Nathanael was troubled. However, Philip did not argue with him; he simply said, "Come and see" (John 1:46).</P><P>On another occasion, Nicodemus, who had come to know Jesus, tried to argue with the Pharisees concerning Him. The Pharisees asked him, "Are you also from Galilee?" (John 7:52). Galilee was a Gentile region, and the Bible says "Galilee of the nations" (Matt. 4:15). The Pharisees seemed to say to Nicodemus, "Are you from Galilee? We know that Jesus came out of Galilee. But out of Galilee there comes no prophet." Apparently, Jesus was from Galilee, from Nazareth; actually, He was born in Bethlehem. That was His somewhat hidden and secret way of appearing to people.</P><P>The principle is the same today. I refer you to the type of the tabernacle. The tabernacle was covered with rough, tough badgers' skin; outside, it did not appear to be very attractive. Inside, however, was fine linen, gold, and precious stones. The spiritual principle of the church is the same. Do not look at the church from the outside. You need to come inside the church. I am sure that if the Apostle Paul would come to visit you, you would be surprised. You would ask, "Are you Brother Paul? I thought that the Apostle Paul would be like a shining angel. But what are you? You are just a small man without a comely appearance."</P><P>We should never make a display of ourselves; neither should we ever know others according to the outward appearance. We must know them according to the inward spirit. In appearance, Jesus was a Nazarene, but within Him there was gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Within Him there was the glory of God. Second Corinthians 5:16 says that we should not know Christ or any man after the outward appearance. Rather, we must discern the inward reality of Christ.</P><P>We must keep this principle today. In order to find Christ, we must have the shining star. We must not go according to the outward appearance, but according to what is within. If you would know the church or the saints, do not be bothered by the outward appearance. Do not give any value to outward things, such as huge cathedrals, large church buildings, or pipe organs. Forget all that. Jesus had nothing outstanding outwardly. He was a little Nazarene, One who grew up in a province that was called "Galilee of the nations" and who was raised in a city despised by people&#151;"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" But if you "come and see" and get into Him, you will appreciate Him and be caught by Him. Likewise, you need to come into the church and stay with the church for some time. If you do, you will find something precious. The same is true with the seeking saints. The more they seek the Lord, the more they hide their experiences of spiritual things. You need to go to them and stay with them. Then you will get into them and find the riches that are within them. You will see the frankincense, the myrrh, and many other precious treasures. Then you will be attracted and caught. This is the way to find Christ and to appreciate all He is and all His precious items, the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh.</P><P>Matthew 2:23 says, "He shall be called a Nazarene." Some have guessed this word Nazarene refers to "Nazarite" in Numbers 6:2. Others have guessed that it refers to the Hebrew word for branch, netzer, in Isaiah 11:1. But I do not think that we have to guess that much. We know that in appearance Jesus was a Nazarene. This was spoken by the prophets.</P>
