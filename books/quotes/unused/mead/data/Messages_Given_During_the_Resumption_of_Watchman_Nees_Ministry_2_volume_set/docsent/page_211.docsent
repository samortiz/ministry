   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Need to Know the Body</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The consciousness of sin comes from knowing God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the same way, the consciousness of reviling words comes from the knowledge of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Reviling words are opposed to the testimony of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Learning Not to Be the Head Submitting to the</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Authority of the Head, and Being</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>the Authority One to Another</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The head manifests itself as the head by its ideas and proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The meaning of submitting to the authority of the Head is that one does not need to make many proposals and will not have many ideas of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A Christian who lives in the Body is a most simple person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is a basic difference between a Protestant's understanding of the Bible and a Catholic's understanding of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Catholics think that the Pope is the only one who can make decisions on the interpretation of the Bible and that no ordinary person can interpret the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Pope's decision is the only decision.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From this doctrine, many kinds of idolatry were developed, including the worship of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Protestantism is more advanced than Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It claims that as many Christians as there are, there are that many popes, and that everyone can read the Bible and interpret it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we have the light, we will see that both of them are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Body, the Lord has only arranged for certain members to have the authority to make judgments on the interpretation of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, do not try to be a pope in haste.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, the Lord has raised up some brothers among us to help us concerning the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If any of the brothers have any question concerning the way of life, they can go to these brothers to seek for help.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Body, there is not just one brother, but many brothers who can supply us life in many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you want to receive help from them, you have to realize that they have the ministry and that they have the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have to submit yourselves to their authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This authority is given to them by the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If any member of my body argues with my mouth or my eyes, it is arguing with the head who establishes those ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a member does not submit to the function of these members, it is not submitting to the head.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A rebellious person first demonstrates his rebellion through his words, then through his thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more simple you are, the more you can be one with others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It does not mean that when you submit to others, you do not have a ministry any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Body, we are authorities one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ministry Being Authority</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ministry is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Lord gives a ministry to a person, He is giving authority to that person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many people are worried about many problems, but as a member we have to learn to remove our own heads.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the meaning of the sisters' covering of their heads.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Head covering means that only the Lord is the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This of course does not mean that the responsible brothers can make any proposal they want.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A person who has been dealt with is one who does not like to interfere with others' affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only after we become a person who has no interest in interfering with others' affairs can we be the authority; only then can we bear responsibility before God, and only then can we manage the affairs of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THOSE WHO</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>ARE IN AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>NOT INTERFERING WITH OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God never interferes with man, nor did He ever force man to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The garden of Eden was not fenced with barbed wire, and hell does not have any fences either.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a man wants to go to hell, he can go in easily.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All roads lead to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today, in the twentieth century, man has invented the electric fence, and has installed twenty volts or sixty volts of electricity to these fences.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But our God never interferes with man, nor forces man to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All those who by nature like to meddle with others' affairs must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those who by nature like to control others can never be the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who are the authorities should let others know that they do not like to control others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They speak only because they have received authority from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A man who has been taught and who has learned to be an authority will not answer questions in a light way.</S>
