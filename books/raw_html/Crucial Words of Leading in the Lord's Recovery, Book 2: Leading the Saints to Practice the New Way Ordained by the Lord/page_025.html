 <h2 class="head1">ELDERS NEEDING TO LEAD THE NEW ONES<br />
TO JOIN GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Those Who Take Care of Meetings in the Homes<br />
Needing to Establish Group Meetings<br />
at Any Time and at Any Place according to Need</h2>
<p>In the past, group meetings were established through arrangements made by elders, but it does not have to be this way. Those who take care of the home meetings usually take care of several such meetings. These ones should gather together several neighboring homes whose condition is not bad and meet with them. Group meetings can be established at any time and at any place according to need.</p>
<h2 class="head2">There Being No Regulations or Forms,<br />
with Everything Being Done<br />
according to Environment and Need</h2>
<p>For the group meetings we do not need any kind of regulation or form; rather, we should do everything according to environment and need. The meeting does not have to start at 7:30 P.M.; if some want to come earlier, they can come at seven o&rsquo;clock; if some cannot come early because they need to take care of matters at home or get off work late, they can come at eight, eight-thirty, or even nine o&rsquo;clock. Once there is a form and a set time for meeting, few will come. Therefore, we need to be flexible with the time and lead them gradually to be consistent; sooner or later, they will be on track.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Those Leading the Group Meetings<br />
Needing to Exercise to Direct the Content<br />
of the Meeting, and There Being a Need<br />
to Have Some Ministry of the Word Each Time</h2>
<p>Those who take the lead in the group meetings need to exercise to direct the meeting, that is, to bear the responsibility for the meeting. They need to give the brothers and sisters freedom, yet at the same time they need to know inwardly to what extent they should give the saints the freedom. They should be in control of the &ldquo;rudder.&rdquo; If they give the saints too much freedom, the saints may begin chatting about all sorts of subjects, and there are many conversations that may not be appropriate. Hence, we must &ldquo;hold the reins&rdquo; and &ldquo;direct the rudder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meeting we should not stop or rebuke others; these matters all depend on how we lead. If at a certain point we see that the meeting is going off track, we may read a portion in the Scriptures, pray, or even choose a short hymn to sing; in this way, we prevent the meeting from going off track. Habitual control puts people under bondage. It is best if we can let the brothers and sisters meet together spontaneously, while we are &ldquo;directing the rudder&rdquo;; this is not easy to do and requires much learning. I hope that all the trainees will learn how to do this. If they do not learn this, they will not be able to lead the group meetings successfully, and it will be even more difficult if we later want to hand over the meetings to the local brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Often in group meetings there are two different views of the situation. On the one hand, those who are older or who follow strict regulations may feel that the meeting is nonsensical and inappropriate if everyone is chatting aimlessly and there are no limits that control the situation. This kind of view is not good, because it nullifies the purpose of group meetings. On the other hand, some immature saints may join in the chatting because they may feel that it is quite good. Eventually, everyone is chatting. This view is also not good, because it too causes the group meetings to lose their purpose. Hence, we all need to be exercised in this matter. On one hand, we should not control the brothers and sisters, and on the other hand, we need to learn to &ldquo;direct the rudder&rdquo; in the meetings.</p>
<p>To direct the content of a small group meeting requires having something of the Lord&rsquo;s word to minister at every time. Regardless of how long the speaking may be or how it is carried out, we need to hold to this principle. Every time we have a group meeting, we need to have some amount of the ministry of the Lord&rsquo;s word. Only the Lord&rsquo;s word is able to supply people, even if it lasts for just five or ten minutes, because only the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit and are life. Every time the Lord&rsquo;s word enters into people, it is like sowing seeds or injecting medicine. When people come to our meetings, we need to inject them with the &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; they need so that they may be supplied and healed. If there are &ldquo;germs&rdquo; within them, we need to consider all the more how to inject them with the proper &ldquo;medicine.&rdquo; In this way we will be able to kill the germs and supply them with the necessary nutrients. We must have a firm grasp of the truth.</p>
<p>All the brothers and sisters should diligently learn how to take care of home meetings and lead group meetings. We need to learn to &ldquo;direct the rudder&rdquo; and meet the need. In this way, every time we meet with the new ones, they will receive the benefit. Otherwise, we may visit the new ones and meet with them many times, yet they will be the same as before. If we visit and meet with the new ones for three months consecutively and they remain the same, this means that we have not met the need and that we have labored in vain. We all need to exercise in this matter. The elders in all the churches should also learn this, and at the same time, they should take the lead to train the saints in their localities and let them know that it is not enough to simply spend time to visit people but that the saints need to lead the meetings properly. Otherwise, not only will the saints be discouraged, but others will not want to come to the meetings anymore. Therefore, we all need to realize that this is not merely a matter of directing the meetings but also a matter of doing it well. If we are able to do it well, the new way will surely work.</p>
