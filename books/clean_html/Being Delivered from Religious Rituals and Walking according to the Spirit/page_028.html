<h2 class="head2">Being Quiet or Calling Loudly</h2>
<p>Worshipping quietly has become another regulation. Many saints prefer to be quiet in the meetings; they do not like to call loudly. This is a religious concept from Sunday worship in Christianity because a person who enters a chapel has to be quiet.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:1-2 says, &ldquo;Concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant. You know that when you were Gentiles, you were always being led away to dumb idols, whenever and however you were led.&rdquo; Before we were saved, we served dumb idols, and as a result, we were also dumb; that is, we did not speak. Dumb people worship dumb idols, and their worship is dumb worship. Now that we serve a speaking God, we must open our mouth and let our voice be heard. The concept of having quiet Sunday worship is a Christian tradition. Today the Lord is taking the way of recovery. May we all receive mercy to drop our ordinances.</p>
<h2 class="head1">METHODS IN OUR SERVICE</h2>
<p>We often want to use methods in our service. These methods are ordinances. The co-workers often ask me for methods. We do not want to base our service on methods. Even though it seems that we cannot do anything without a method, we need to give up and drop the methods.</p>
<p>It is difficult for us to come out of our fallen situation, because we are always looking for methods in whatever we do. It seems as though we do not care for anything other than having a method. Many saints want to visit the church in Los Angeles because they want to see if there are any good methods there. We should never bring a method back to our locality and expect the church to follow it. We must have a change in our concept. Our service is not a matter of methods but of the Spirit. The Lord is the Spirit, and our spirit is our most precious and valuable possession. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; Our service is altogether a matter of the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EMPHASIZING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>This does not mean that we do not use methods. In these meetings there are rows of benches. The sisters sit on one side, and the brothers sit on the other. We also have a podium with a microphone, and behind the podium is a blackboard. These items can be considered as methods, but we do not focus on them. Our main purpose is to have a training meeting so that the saints may learn to exercise and release their spirit and thereby grow in life. In order to meet this need, we have to put the benches in rows, prepare the microphone, and clean the blackboard, but we do not meet for these things. We can forget about them, but we must know our spirit. If instead of exercising our spirit, we focus on whether the writing on the blackboard is neat or whether the saints are sitting in an orderly manner, the cart is pulling the horse.</p>
<p>Some brothers may say that if we should give up methods, we do not need the elders and deacons anymore. Dropping methods does not mean that we do not need the elders and deacons. This is the age of the stars, and we should all be stars. Every saint can be a star. The elders will not stop the saints from being shining stars. We still need the elders and the deacons. If there are no elders and deacons, who will make arrangements for the meetings and who will give announcements? We thank the Lord that there are elders and deacons in the churches who make arrangements for the church and announce things. If the elders and deacons do not shine brightly, the saints should be strengthened and shine in their spirit.</p>
<p>May the Lord change our concept from emphasizing arrangements to emphasizing our spirit. This does not mean that we should reject or oppose arrangements. A person who is against outward things is not in the spirit. When a person is in the spirit, the outward things do not matter to him. The stars in the sky do not care whether the earth is flat or has valleys or whether the mountains are high or low. The stars care about whether they shine in the sky. The stars shine whether or not the earth is flat. Even if there is a storm, the stars still shine. Nothing affects them; they simply continue to shine. In the same way, we should not care for any methods or regulations; rather, we should care only for our spirit being strong, fresh, and living. We should transcend the earth and shine like a star. Others may be in darkness, but we shine forth light. No matter what the condition of the elders is, if a brother releases his spirit in a meeting, the sky will be clear, and the other saints will all begin to shine. Then that brother is a star. This is the age of the Spirit, and God cares for the Spirit. We should not focus on whether or not we should be quiet in a meeting or whether we should be baptized once or twice.</p>
<p>The ordinances belong to the Old Testament. Circumcision, keeping the Sabbath, and dietary regulations belong to the Old Testament, not the New Testament. When the Lord Jesus came, He did not keep the Sabbath. In Acts the Lord led Peter to give up the ordinance concerning dietary regulations. In the Epistles Paul put aside circumcision.</p>
