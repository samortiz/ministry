   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. In Exodus God's Salvation and the Building of His Habitation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Exodus reveals God's salvation and the building of His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yes, the man created by God fell, and the man selected and called by God also fell.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But God is God, and He was not disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nothing can stop Him or annul His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After man had fallen to the uttermost, God came in to rescue fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After redeeming His fallen people, God brought them to a point where He built them together to be His dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus in Exodus we see two main things God's redemption and God's habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word exodus means "the way out."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What we see in the book of Exodus is the way to get out of man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Genesis ends with man in a coffin in Egypt, but in Exodus there is the way out of this coffin, the way out of this box of death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This way out involves God's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's redemption is to bring us out of the coffin and back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Exodus those who had been brought back to God were charged to build a tabernacle, a dwelling place, for God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that God is able not only to bring fallen man out of death but also able to use this man to build a dwelling place for Him on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whereas at the end of Genesis there is a coffin containing a dead body, at the end of Exodus there is a tabernacle containing the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What a great advancement this is!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Genesis we have God's creation and man's fall, and in Exodus we have God's redemption and God's habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We praise the Lord that because of God's redemption we are no longer in the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through redemption we have been brought into God's habitation, which for us today is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The tabernacle as God's habitation in Exodus typifies the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's habitation today is the church, and we are in it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Exodus 40 speaks of the tabernacle, but Leviticus 1:1, which is the continuation of Exodus, speaks of the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These two terms refer to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The tabernacle is a dwelling place, and the tent of meeting is a meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The tabernacle is for God's habitation, for.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His dwelling, and the tent of meeting is for the meeting of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The tabernacle is God's habitation, yet this habitation is also the center where God's people meet.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, it is called the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The tent of meeting is a place for the meeting of God and His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today the church is the tabernacle and the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God has a dwelling place on earth, and this dwelling place is also a meeting place for us to meet with one another and to meet together with God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church is the meeting of the saved ones with the saving God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As soon as the tabernacle was built and set up, God came to dwell in it Exo 40:2, 33-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The God who indwells the tabernacle has become the God dwelling among men.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is no longer merely in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is impossible for us to go to the heavens to meet with God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But God came to tabernacle among us John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that God became incarnated to be a man, and this man became God's tabernacle on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God came down from the heavens and took on the form of man, and now God can be touched.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The four Gospels reveal that the God who was in the heavens and who was untouchable one day became a tabernacle, a man on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Having come down to earth, He presents Himself to us not in the form of God but in the form of man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Who is this One?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Is He man or is He God?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our God today is not only in the heavens as God, for He, the God-man, came to earth in the form of man to be a tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The tabernacle in Exodus was enterable.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By being incarnated our God not only became a man; He also became an enterable tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God destined all the children of Israel to be priests Exo 19:6 that all might have the right and the privilege to enter the tabernacle, that is, to enter into God and dwell in God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Old Testament the priests could enter the tabernacle, and today we, the believers in Christ, can enter into God and dwell in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The New Testament speaks of abiding in God 1 John 4:15, 13; 3:24; 2:6 .</S>
