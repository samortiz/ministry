   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE HOUSE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The house of God John 1:51 signifies Christ increased with the church built up with the believers as stones and with the life-giving Spirit as the oil to be the enlarged house of God Bethel for the fulfillment of Jacob's dream Gen 28:10-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the universal ladder, Christ brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven and thereby makes God and man one for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jacob's dream is being fulfilled today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We in the church are experiencing the fulfillment of this dream.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have Christ in His humanity as the universal ladder joining earth to heaven and heaven to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Him God and man become one for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 1:42 reveals that the believers are stones, and verse 51 refers to the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are not only individual stones we are a part of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This requires that we be built up together as God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is your situation with respect to the building of God's house?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Are you scattered, piled up, or built up?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be scattered means that we do not come together with the believers in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be piled up together means that we do nothing more than come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The gathering of building materials is for the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, several years ago we bought a great many materials for the building of this meeting hall in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First those materials were piled up on the building site.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But after several months, those materials became the building.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we no longer have materials piled up we have a building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is an illustration of the fact that in the church life we should not be only a pile of materials, but materials which have been built together into God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE SIX SIGNS COVERING BOTH THE SPAN AND THE SCOPE OF THE CENTRAL LINE OF GOD'S ENTIRE ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The six signs in John 1 cover both the span and the scope of the central line of God's entire economy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's economy is the universal story, a story that involves a number of great mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first of these mysteries is the universe itself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The vastness of the universe is beyond measure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may say that the measure of the universe is Christ Himself, for in Paul's words, Christ is the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth Eph 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our human mind is not able to comprehend such vastness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this vast universe there is an economy, a divine operation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's economy as the universal story is fully embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the beginning of both his Gospel and his first Epistle, John speaks concerning the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As the story of the universal economy, the Word is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although the Triune God is mysterious, He is nonetheless embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Word denotes the definition, explanation, and expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Triune God embodied in the Word is explained, defined, and expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, the Word is the definition and expression of the mysterious and invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Word is the wonderful, all-inclusive, divine Person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is both God and man, both the Creator and a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He includes all the divine things and all the divine matters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This Word is revealed and developed in the writings of John in his Gospel, Epistles, and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to John 1:14, the Word as the embodiment of the Triune God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This flesh is the tabernacle, God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the four Gospels we see a portrait of the tabernacle in motion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When Christ was on earth, He was a living and moving tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He could travel from Galilee to Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He could stay for a while in Jerusalem and then go to Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, we may say that He was a traveling tabernacle.</S>
