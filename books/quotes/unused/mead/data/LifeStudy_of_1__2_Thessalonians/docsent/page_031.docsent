   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE NINE THE CHURCH BECOMING THE EMBODIMENT OF THE TRIUNE GOD 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 1:1; 2:12; 3:12; 4:7; 5:23-24; 2 Thes 1:3, 5, 10; 2:13-14, 16; Col 3:10-11; Rev 1:11-12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have emphasized the fact that in 1:1 Paul says that the church is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have considered what it means for the church to be in God the Father and also the significance of the church being in the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, although we have emphasized the Father, the Lord, and Jesus, we have not explained fully what it means for the church to be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the name Jesus is used in the New Testament, it primarily refers to the Lord in His experiences on earth from His incarnation to His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jesus is the name of the Lord with respect to His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, this name denotes His life experiences and the things He passed through before His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is a divine title that mainly denotes the Lord's experience, position, life, and actions after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This title refers to what the Lord is after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The life of the Lord Jesus Christ may be divided into two sections: the section before His resurrection, and the section after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Resurrection, therefore, is a dividing line, a boundary line, of the Lord's life and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The four Gospels may be regarded as biographies of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These biographies tell His life story between His incarnation and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This period of time is, for the most part, represented by the name Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we speak of Jesus according to the biblical use of this name, we mainly refer to His experience between incarnation and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After resurrection the life of the Lord Jesus is altogether in another sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today, however, many Christians are not clear in their understanding concerning Jesus and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some believers, especially those in Pentecostalism, say "Praise Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the Bible, it is better to say "Praise the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is much more common for Christians today to say "Praise the Lord" than it was twenty years ago, when the Lord's recovery came to this country.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This may be due to the influence of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In any case, it is more fitting to say "Praise the Lord" than to say "Praise Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the New Testament, the title Lord applies to the entire life and ministry of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that the title Lord is an all-inclusive title.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the name Jesus refers to the Lord in His humanity and to His human life prior to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ, as we have seen, refers to the resurrected Christ in ascension.</S>
