   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH THE PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 23 is familiar to us, but perhaps we have not noticed what is stressed at its end. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever v. 6 . We know that this Psalm starts with the green pastures and continues through the paths of righteousness and the battlefield, until the Psalmist eventually comes to the point where he dwells in the house of the Lord forever.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The goal of this whole Psalm is that of dwelling in the house of the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying, Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?</S>
