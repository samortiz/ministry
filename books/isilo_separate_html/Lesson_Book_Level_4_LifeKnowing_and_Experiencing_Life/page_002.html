THREE GREEK WORDS FOR LIFE</h2><p>There are three Greek words denoting the English word life. One word is zoe, denoting the divine, eternal, uncreated and indestructible life of God. Every man should have this life in his God-created spirit. The second word is psuche denoting the God-created human soulish life. The third word for life is bios which is the God-created physical life of man.
