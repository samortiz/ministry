   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE SEVEN THE VITAL GROUPS IN THE CHURCH LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: Acts 2:46-47; Eph 4:12; Acts 13:52; 4:31b; John 13:34-35</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer: Lord, thank You for Your recovery on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do burden us to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Give us the utterance, and save us from ordinary prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We desire to pray something living, even to pray Your prayer with Your utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, do cleanse us with Your precious blood and anoint us with Your ointment that we may enjoy You.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You are the real revival, every day aspiring within us to be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, we do beg You to stir up our spirits, and we also want to fan our spirits into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE ABNORMAL SITUATION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the time of the apostles the church became abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the reason that we must move to form the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church today is below the normal level.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brother Nee gave a series of messages which he published in a book entitled The Normal Christian Life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He gave those messages in order to uplift the situation among Christians back to the normal level.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a Christian is uplifted and lives a life at the level portrayed in Brother Nee s messages, he is no longer abnormal but is a normal Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must admit honestly and with repentance that our church s situation is below the normal level.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we must do something to uplift the level of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The matter of increase has become a bothersome problem among us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For a long period of time the rate of increase among us has been low, especially among the typical American people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The United States was established mainly by Caucasians from northern Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These Caucasians may be considered as the typical Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I first came to America, I had no intention of doing a work among the Chinese people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I had been given a commission from the Lord to bring His recovery to this country, and I made a determination not to do a particular work among the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today, however, the situation in the churches has been damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I began the work in the United States, two-thirds of the saints were Caucasians, and one-third were from other races.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That situation was very normal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1970 approximately three hundred saints migrated out of Los Angeles to several large cities in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those migrations were a prevailing success.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before the migrations began, people outside the recovery paid little attention to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But two years later, in 1972, the number among us began to increase.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This caused some outside the recovery to be stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord s recovery began in the United States in 1962 with about twenty-five saints meeting in a home.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eight years later, in 1970, we met with over one thousand saints in the Embassy Hotel in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was the year that we had the migration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By 1972 our number went up to about twelve hundred, and we realized that we could no longer meet in the Embassy Hotel, because our number was too large.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>So we prepared ourselves to meet in the Los Angeles Convention Center, which had a meeting capacity of three thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The next year, in 1973, we met in the Convention Center, and our number was over three thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In those meetings we had several overflow rooms with television monitors.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was an indication of how the Lord s move in His recovery had become prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At that time the outsiders, stirred up by the devil, began to oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At first, some distributed mimeographed leaflets in order to smear us, damage us, and defame us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, the opposers published two evil books, The Mindbenders and The God-men .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After we moved from Los Angeles to Orange County in 1974, two large Christian organizations in Orange County began to oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although we responded publicly to the accusations made against us and were successful in getting the two defamatory books removed from the bookstores, our name had already been spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To some extent the opposers succeeded in blockading us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For approximately ten years, from 1976 until 1986, it was difficult for us to gain any Caucasians, especially in Orange County.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The rate of increase in other parts of the United States has been better, but in Orange County the rate of increase has been very low.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the past forty months, from April 1989 until today, very few Caucasians have been gained, and a number who were gained have been damaged by the opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This situation has caused me to ask myself, Is there no way?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>My answer to this question has been, I do not believe that there is no way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is a way, if there is a will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Where there is a will, there is a way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In October 1984 I purposely went to Taipei to study our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As I studied with the other brothers, the Lord showed us the biblical way, the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But not until these recent days did I feel burdened to directly practice this way myself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In these days the Lord has led me to make a strong decision to practice the new way directly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to thank the Lord that He has preserved His recovery and strengthened the churches to go on in spite of the turmoil caused by the opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although the churches are going on well, the condition and morale are still not up to the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, I am not content.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to step out of the blockade.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I do not believe that we have to remain here.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the contrary, I believe that through the Lord s mercy and by His grace and in His power, there is a way for us to leap over the blockade.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our intention in forming the new groups is to have groups of overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the reason that the groups are called the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We do have some groups already, and we honor them, but there is still the need for some vital groups to fulfill the purpose of the groups and to discharge our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The groups that are up to the standard should be up to the normal level revealed in the Bible.</S>
