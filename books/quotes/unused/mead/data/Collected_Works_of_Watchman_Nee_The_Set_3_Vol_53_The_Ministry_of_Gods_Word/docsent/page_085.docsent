   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CULTIVATION OF TENDER FEELINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should not merely know how to apply our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We also should know how to take the right way to acquire feelings that are proper and usable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This leads to a consideration of our basic experience, which is the breaking of our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the previous discussion of the minister as a person, we paid special attention to the breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Unless the outer man is broken, the Lord's word cannot be released.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Unless the outer man is broken, a great part of it can never be used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to repeat this point.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to see how the Lord breaks our outer man and how He prepares our feelings for the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God deals with a man by arranging all kinds of circumstances to buffet him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This buffeting naturally produces wounds and pain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When a man receives wounds and pain, his feelings are hurt, and they become more tender than before.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man's feelings are the tenderest part of his outer man; this part is more tender than the will or the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet even this tenderness is not enough for God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not tender enough to satisfy the demand of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order for God's word to be released through us, we must be full of feelings for His word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order for God to use us to be ministers of the word, our feeling has to match the word's feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The feeling of every minister of the word must match the word he ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every minister of the word has to be equipped with such feelings feelings the word demands.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The feelings for the word must be rich enough.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A speaker must have the sense that when God's word is released, his person is released as well.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Otherwise, the word will not be powerful in others, and it will not be powerful in him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After one goes through God's dealings, he realizes how crude his feelings are in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although the feelings are the most tender part of a person, these feelings are still crude and are useless in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If our feelings are not tender enough when God's word is released through our mouth, we will find that some of it is padded with feelings, while some of it is void of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In painting, a painter has to mix the paint powder well.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the powder is not well blended, some areas will be left untouched.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the paint is well mixed, the whole surface will be evenly covered.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is true of the feelings of the minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those whose feelings are crude will miss the mark in eight out of ten sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those whose feelings are fine will match every word with their feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Bible the Lord's life is typified by fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that our Lord was very fine in His feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is a horrible thing when brothers say things without having any feeling about them at all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Their feelings are unusable.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Their feelings cannot match their words; they are not fine enough.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Their feelings hardly are expressed in one or two out of ten sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to remember that unrefined feelings cripple the release of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need the Lord to work on us until our feelings are fine and tender.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must be broken before our feelings can be tender before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Bible we find the writers of the Scripture not only full of experience of life and thoughts of the Holy Spirit but full of spiritual feelings as well.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The ministers of the word in the Bible released their word with much feeling for the word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today in serving as ministers of the word, we have to release the word with feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If our feelings cannot match our word, our audience will not take our word seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If God's hand has never touched us and broken our outer man, naturally our feelings are not tender in the eyes of God; we do not have any wound or hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are sensitive in a certain matter, it means that we have a wound and a hurt in that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The grains of wheat must be ground into powder before they can be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must have wounds and hurts before our feelings can be tender.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more wounds and hurts we have, the tenderer we become.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As the pressure is applied, the one grain is enlarged to three, five, seven, or one hundred grains.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The feelings become finer.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should not expect to be fine in our feelings if we have not suffered any wound or bleeding from God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is not such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must have wounds, and we must go through dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As soon as we touch some brothers, we know that the Lord's work is not deep enough in them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If a brother is disciplined and has learned to walk somewhat properly, has advanced somewhat in his conduct, and has made progress in the study of the Scripture as well as in other areas, yet has failed to become tender in his feelings, he is missing something before the Lord; there are still some parts in him that God cannot use.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No matter how much a person's outward behavior changes and no matter how much light he sees within, his training is still too superficial and shallow if he is lacking in feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When a man touches the work of the Lord's cross, his entire person is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>His strong will is no longer stubborn, his arrogant mentality is no longer arrogant.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>His will is broken, and his arrogant mind is also subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At the same time, his feelings become more and more refined.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord can deal with a person's will with one great shining of His light.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A man may think that he is clever and resourceful, and the Lord can bring down his exalted mind in one great shining.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, the feelings cannot be dealt with through one shining.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Tenderness in one's feelings is the result of an accumulation of countless numbers of dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>One's feelings do not become tender until he has passed through certain circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we are sloppy in certain matters, the Lord will arrange circumstance after circumstance to deal with us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After one circumstance goes away, another one comes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Time after time, we are ground and pressed like grains in a mill. Eventually, we will be pulverized into fine flour.</S>
