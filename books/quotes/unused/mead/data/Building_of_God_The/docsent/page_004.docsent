   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEW JERUSALEM AS THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION OF THE MINGLING OF DIVINITY WITH HUMANITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the church, God's building becomes the New Jerusalem Rev 21:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Noah's ark, the tabernacle, the temple, Christ, the church, and the New Jerusalem are all God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, these are all different aspects of one building, not many buildings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the New Jerusalem we can find items related to Noah's ark, to the tabernacle of Moses, and to Solomon's temple with the old Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can certainly see Christ as the house and temple of God, and we can also see the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the New Jerusalem is the ultimate expression and consummation of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The New Jerusalem contains the names of the twelve tribes of Israel and the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>12, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The twelve tribes of Israel are the representatives of the Old Testament saints, while the twelve apostles are the representatives of the New Testament saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows us that the New Jerusalem is a living composition of all the saints in the Old and New Testament times.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, God is the light of the New Jerusalem, and Christ is the lamp v. 23 . God is in Christ, and out of God in Christ flows the Spirit as the river of water of life 22:1 . God the Father is the light, God the Son is the lamp, and God the Spirit is the river of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From the throne of God and the Redeemer at the center, the Triune God flows throughout the entire city for the mingling of God with His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the real meaning of the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the New Jerusalem is a living composition of all the redeemed ones throughout the generations with God in Christ through the Holy Spirit as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is a universally great corporate man mingled with God to be a living Body and a built-up city.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The New Jerusalem is a full picture of the mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed creatures, the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now God is no longer merely a God outside of man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is a God within man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Besides this one building, there is not another building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God has only one building in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why then did the Lord speak of "many abodes" in John 14:2?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 2:16 the Lord clearly indicated that the Father's house is the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What then is the Father's house in 14:2?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This verse says, "In My Father's house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How can we fit this verse into God's building?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When some preach the gospel, they tell people that if they do not believe in Jesus, they will go to hell, and if they do believe, they will go to a heavenly mansion, or a heavenly hall.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Should we believe that today, while God is building His church, He is also building "mansions" in heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many times I have been condemned for preaching that there are no "heavenly mansions."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My intention, however, is not to preach away the heavenly mansions but to help the children of God know what the real building of God is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The real building of God is not a heavenly hall but the mingling of Himself with man, His creature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Certain hymns contain the thought that God is a God in heaven and that someday we will go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not think that I do not believe that there is a heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I certainly believe that there is a heaven and that God is in the heavens, but heaven where God is now is not the eternal habitation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can prove this with Revelation 21:2, which says, "And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In eternity God will dwell in the New Jerusalem, which comes down from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may have the thought to go to heaven, but God has the thought to come down from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The habitation of God in eternity is His divine building, the New Jerusalem, the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
