ON LIFE AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John shows that the first step in God coming to be man&rsquo;s life involves His being mingled with man; the last step involves the building of a dwelling place for God. John wrote not only the Gospel of John but also Revelation. His Gospel is the beginning of his writing, and Revelation is the completion of his writing. In the beginning of his Gospel, John spoke of life and of the Lord coming so that man would have life (John 1:4; 10:10), but he did not speak clearly of the reason that the Lord wanted man to have life. The last section of Revelation, however, shows that the issue of life is a built-up city (21:2). John&rsquo;s speaking shows that God came to be man&rsquo;s life for the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<p>Not long after I was saved, I realized that John speaks particularly of life. However, as I have mused upon God&rsquo;s Word and touched God&rsquo;s Word in recent years, I have seen much more clearly that life is for God&rsquo;s building. John speaks not only of life but also of building. John&rsquo;s ministry is a ministry of life and building. Formerly, I could only say that God entered into man so that we could live a holy life, live a life of faith in God, and even live a life that lives out God, but now I can tell people with assurance that God enters into us as life for the sake of His building. The Word became flesh in order to tabernacle. When the Word became flesh, God entered into man as life. The issue of the Word becoming flesh, however, is tabernacling. John uses the word <em>tabernacled</em> to indicate that God came to be man&rsquo;s life for the purpose of building.</p>
<p>In our human life we all feel that we are capable and able to stand on our own. Even the most foolish person often has no sense of his need for others; rather, he is under the impression that he can do everything in an independent and individualistic way. However, when we see a vision concerning God entering into us to be our life, we will stop ourselves and begin to live by Him as our life practically, and we will have an immediate sense that our independence and individualism are not matters to be praised. The more we are in ourselves, the more we feel that our individualism is justified, but the less we are in ourselves, the more we turn away from our individualism. If we live according to ourselves, even exhortations to be humble, to receive help, and to fellowship with others will be of no value, because there will be an element of pride in our accomplished humility, and our inward independence and self-justification will remain.</p>
<p>I know about these conditions because prolonged illnesses often make one a good doctor. I also know how to treat this illness. The more we live by ourselves, the more we will despise others, distrust others, disrespect others, and have no need of others. However, the more we live in God, the more we will need the brothers and sisters, and the more we will see that every brother and sister is capable of rendering help to us. This is the principle of coordination, the principle of building. This is the Word becoming flesh and tabernacling among us. Wherever the Word becomes flesh, God is mingled with man, and wherever God becomes man&rsquo;s life, the tabernacling, the building, is manifested.</p>
<p>John spoke not only of life but also of building. John tells us that God came to be man&rsquo;s life for the purpose of building. The Word becoming flesh was not only so that God could enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life but in order to erect a tabernacle, to build a dwelling place, among men. At the end of all his speaking, John says, &ldquo;Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men&rdquo; (Rev. 21:3). In Revelation the tabernacle is a city built of many precious stones with the twelve names of the twelve apostles inscribed on its foundation and the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel inscribed on its gates (vv. 12, 14). This means that the city is built through God&rsquo;s life with the redeemed from both the Old Testament and the New Testament.</p>
<p>The Lord passed through death and resurrection to produce a building. In John 2 the Lord did two significant things. First, He changed water into wine in Cana (vv. 1-11), and second, He cleansed the temple (vv. 12-17). John did not write of these two things in a random way; instead, his arrangement shows great significance. The order of these events, which are connected with the words <em>third day</em> and <em>three days</em> (vv. 1, 19), is significant. The Lord Jesus came to Cana on the third day (v. 1), and after the Lord cleansed the temple, the Jews asked, &ldquo;What sign do You show us, seeing that You do these things?&rdquo; Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (vv. 18-19). The water was changed into wine on the third day, and the Lord said that He would raise up the temple in three days. Both events involve three days, which always implies resurrection. In His resurrection the Lord changed the water of death into the wine of life for the sake of the building, which also was raised up in three days. The temple that the Lord raised up is the temple of His body (v. 21), which is also the tabernacling Word in 1:14. The tabernacle in 1:14 is the temple in 2:21. The temple of His body was killed on the cross, but the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;In three days I will raise it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Lord resurrected from death, His body in the flesh was enlarged into a mystical Body, which includes not only Himself but also all those whom He regenerated and saved. Resurrection enlarged the temple of His body. Originally, His body, which was the temple of God, was a single grain of wheat; but when His body was killed on the cross, this grain of wheat was resurrected in three days as many grains (12:24). What was built up in resurrection was not only the body of Jesus of Nazareth but also the mystical Body of Christ, consisting of myriads of people regenerated through His resurrection. With our considerations of space and time, it does not seem as if the Body of Christ was built, but God has no considerations of space and time. In God&rsquo;s eyes a universal dwelling place was built when the Lord resurrected from the dead. In our experience the Lord Jesus is still building His mystical Body in resurrection today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>I long that more and more of God&rsquo;s children would have a vision to see the matter that touches God&rsquo;s heart the most, which is to let Him enter into us, to be mingled with us, and to be our life. What matters is not our work for Him, our zealousness for Him, our help to the poor, or our preaching of the gospel. There is only one matter that can satisfy God&rsquo;s desire, which is to be mingled with God so that He can be our life and living. By His mercy, we can stop ourselves and let Him be our life even in such practical things as our getting dressed, our eating a meal, and our work and family situations. Nothing touches God&rsquo;s heart more than this. He delights in the Word becoming flesh so that He can mingle with us and be our life in our daily living.</p>
<p>When we experience being mingled with God, we will have a strong sense that we cannot be individualistic but, instead, that we need to coordinate with the brothers and sisters to be built together. Then our condition will express God as our life for the sake of His building. God will not only be expressed in us, but He also will gain a restful dwelling place among us. This is what He wants to work out, and this is what He will obtain. Life and building solve all the problems of the church. Outward debates, explanations, and teachings cannot solve the problems faced by the church. The practical solution to the problems of the church is life and building.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life and Building in the Gospel of John &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
