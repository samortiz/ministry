<h1 class="title">A PRACTICAL EXERCISE OF PRAYING<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S TABLE MEETING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>If we consider these exercises for the meetings as something too difficult and not worthwhile, there is nothing further to say. But if we think that these exercises are worthwhile, we should apply ourselves, spend our time, and learn to put ourselves aside particularly in this matter. Otherwise, these exercises will only be in letter; there will not be much spiritual significance. If we are not willing to pay the price, what we are doing can be compared to building a castle in the air. Therefore, if we are willing to pay the price, we must diligently apply ourselves to be exercised in this matter. This kind of exercise will yield no result if we do not have the heart for it.</p>
<p>Moreover, if we want good and rich meetings, we must allow the Holy Spirit to rule. The Holy Spirit cannot come out in a meeting unless He can first come out through us. Therefore, we must allow Him to reign in us by simply laying ourselves aside.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYER IN THE LORD&rsquo;S TABLE MEETING</h2>
<p>Usually, at the beginning of the table meeting everyone feels quite ordinary; we do not have any particular feeling. In such a case we can select <em>Hymns,</em> #158, &ldquo;Lord, Thy love has sought and found us / Wand&rsquo;ring in this desert wide; / Thou hast thrown Thine arms around us, / For us suffered, bled, and died. / Sing, my soul! He lov&#232;d thee, / Jesus gave Himself for me.&rdquo; This hymn can easily touch the feeling deep within us. On the one hand, it gives us a sense of the Lord&rsquo;s coming to seek us and His giving Himself up for us; on the other hand, it stirs up a sense of gratitude in our hearts and a desire to offer up our praise to the Lord. If we are touched in our spirit after singing and have entered into the feeling of the Lord&rsquo;s seeking us and giving Himself up for us, a brother should offer a prayer according to this feeling in his spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLE OF PRAYING<br />
IN A LORD&rsquo;S TABLE MEETING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Fitly Connected to One Another</h2>
<p>We must pay attention to a few principles when we pray at a table meeting. First, our prayers must be fitly connected to one another. After singing a hymn that was selected according to the spirit of the meeting, we should utter a prayer to follow the hymn; we should not pray in a disconnected way. We should sense the feeling of a meeting by following the Spirit&rsquo;s moving within us. In a meeting we should be like those in a relay race in which we may not run outside the lane. After singing the first hymn, someone should follow with a prayer. After the first prayer, someone else should follow with a second hymn or a second prayer, and perhaps there should be a third prayer. The entire meeting, including the selection of hymns, prayers, reading of Scriptures, exhortation, or testimony, should be carried out as if we are in a relay race; there should not be another beginning halfway through the meeting.</p>
<p>The present situation in our meetings is that we have one beginning after another, with each person making his own move. Five people have five different activities; ten people have ten different activities. From the beginning to the end, our meetings are continually being restarted. Thus, the entire meeting is disconnected, without a distinct beginning, progression, or conclusion. This is a serious mistake. We must firmly grasp this principle: with the exception of the beginning prayer, all subsequent prayers, whether it is one prayer or ten prayers, must be connected with each other and closely follow each other.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Moving Forward in the Spirit</h2>
<p>Second, our prayers should move forward; they should not remain in the same place. Immediately after we offer a prayer in relation to a hymn, we must move forward in our spirit. We must not only move further but also move higher. For instance, when we follow <em>Hymns,</em> #158 with a prayer, our spirit must not remain in the same place; it should move forward. Horizontally, our prayer should advance further; vertically, it should climb higher. The first prayer leads to the subject; hence, the second prayer should climb one step higher, and then when another hymn is selected, it should climb even higher. We must hold on to this principle. Just as in writing a composition, we keep moving higher and further.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Maintaining the Feeling of the Meeting</h2>
<p>Third, as we move forward in the meeting, we must learn to maintain the feeling of the meeting in our prayers and hymns. This simply means that we cannot proceed independently. As we move forward in selecting a hymn, and especially when we pray, we should bring the brothers and sisters with us. The more we pray, the more they will say Amen; the more we pray, the more they will be drawn to the center. The brothers and sisters may not be uplifted in their spirit before we pray, but after we pray, their spirits should climb higher and higher.</p>
<p>Suppose the brothers and sisters are in the feeling of the Lord&rsquo;s suffering, yet our prayer is concerning the Lord&rsquo;s glorification in heaven. Our feeling does not match the feeling of the brothers and sisters. According to our feeling we have already climbed up to heaven, but the brothers and sisters are still prostrate on earth. This is not appropriate. We need to take care of the feeling of the brothers and sisters as we move upward. Hence, prayer requires a great deal of exercise. In a three-legged race, we must take care of our partner who is bound to us; we cannot simply run as fast as we wish. Likewise, as we move forward in a meeting, we must bring the brothers and sisters with us and run with them. Do not disregard this matter. This requires a considerable amount of exercise.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
