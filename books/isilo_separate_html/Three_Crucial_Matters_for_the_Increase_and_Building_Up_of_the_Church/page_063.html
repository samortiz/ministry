<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: After we establish a church in a locality, how should we manage the financial matters?</em></p>
<p>Answer: When dealing with financial matters, it is best to have more than one or two people handling money. It is best for three people to coordinate together for the sake of the testimony. It is even easier to manage financial matters when there are six people on a team. If there are only two people on a team, a local brother or sister should be brought into the coordination. There must be three people present whenever the offering box is opened. In addition, we should have a formal ledger in which we record the date and amount of the general offerings and the designated offerings. Designated offerings include any offerings that need to be passed on to a locality or a saint. Every offering must be clearly recorded in a detailed way. We must also record the total amount of the offerings. Then the three saints responsible should sign under the total amount.</p>
<p>In relation to designated offerings, we must clearly record to whom the offering is designated and when it is delivered to him. If the offering is sent through postal money order, we must retain the money order receipt. A short letter of explanation and a receipt should be enclosed with the money order. The letter of explanation should ask the recipient to sign the receipt and mail it back to us when he receives the funds. The returned receipt and the money order receipt should be filed in our records. These are accounting procedures. In this way, if after three months the saint who made the offering is worried that the offering was not delivered, we can find the record of the offering and show the saint the receipt we received from the recipient. Without such procedures the church will suffer loss if we cannot give the saints a satisfactory answer regarding designated offerings.</p>
<p>In every locality there are many saints who understand accounting; thus, these procedures should not be difficult. Those who serve in this function in the localities should be faithful and keep a detailed record. We should never allow only one person to open the offering box, and there must be a proper place to keep the key to the offering box. We should never carry the key to the box on our person, nor should we allow someone to casually take the key. Of the twelve disciples of the Lord Jesus, Judas was a thief (John 12:4-6). This same problem has also occurred in the church life; therefore, we must be very careful when we deal with money so that we do not fall under suspicion. There must also be a proper record of when the money is deposited. The deposit slips and receipts should be kept as evidence.</p>
<p>The decisions on how to manage the finances of a public organization are quite important. The financial decisions in the new localities should be made by the co-workers on the team plus one or two of the more experienced local saints. They should discuss matters to decide how to use the offerings and then convey any decisions to the accountant. They must not give oral instructions concerning the dispersing of funds, whether by cash or check, to the accountant; rather, they should give the accountant a written record that is signed by two or three saints. The accountant must receive something in writing before he gives cash or writes a check, and he should always obtain a written receipt for every transaction. A petty cash box should also be prepared. The amount of money to be kept as petty cash should be decided by the saints responsible for financial matters. These funds should be given to one person. The amount used for petty cash must be recorded in the general ledger. There must also be an account book to record how the petty cash is spent. The miscellaneous weekly small expenses, which do not require an official approval from the saints responsible for finances, should be taken from the petty cash. For example, if there is a blackout, money can be taken from the petty cash to purchase candles for the meeting hall. It is best to obtain a receipt or a cash register slip for all such purchases. The owners of small shops may not automatically give us a receipt because this will make them liable to pay sales tax. Hence, we should be willing to spend a little more money for the sake of obtaining a receipt; as Christians, we need to be faithful.</p>
<p>We Christians must obey the law and pay taxes, not evade taxes. It is not proper for us to evade taxes in order to save money for the church. A few years ago there was a dispute in a certain locality concerning the funds used in building a meeting hall. After I came back to Taiwan in 1984, I met with the elders, bookkeepers, accountants, and the saints who were involved, and they all felt it was a complicated problem. Therefore, I said that in order to resolve the issue, the church should go through its records and ask a tax authority to assess our records. If we had not paid enough in taxes, we should pay what we owed, and we should gladly pay any fines for delinquent taxes. This suggestion resolved the problem.</p>
<p>If we are careless and do not pay enough in taxes, we must pay the delinquent taxes; we should also be responsible to pay any penalties incurred. In any event, we should not do anything illegal in order to save a few dollars. We must obtain a proper receipt or cash register slip that includes sales tax. This is our Christian testimony to people in the world.</p>
<p><em>Question: We have a burden to perfect some households. Is it appropriate for us to live with these families?</em></p>
<p>Answer: It is very good that there is a burden to perfect some households, but with respect to living in their homes, we should be a little reserved. Before we live with a family, we must first observe the relationships between parents and children, between husband and wife, and between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. If a brother is going to stay with a family, there must be a husband in the household; a brother cannot stay in the house if the sister&rsquo;s husband is not at home. Likewise, for a sister to stay with a family, the situation in the household must be appropriate. It is best not to stay with a family if the husband and wife argue, because our presence will create more problems. If the wife is absent for a period of time or if she has passed away, even if there are children remaining, a sister should not live there. We should never be alone in a house with a member of the opposite sex. We must avoid such situations.</p>
<p>When we enter the home of a new believer, we must learn how to interact with the people there. Problems easily arise when people live in close quarters. In order to avoid these problems, we must learn some lessons. First, we must be careful how we conduct ourselves. We should be regulated in our schedule and pay attention to close doors and turn off lights. We cannot live in someone&rsquo;s house and remain active into the middle of the night. This will put our host in a difficult situation. Second, we must be diligent and help with the chores. We can sweep the house, tidy the rooms, or clean the bathroom. However, we must not do things on our own; instead, we should do chores according to the habits of the family. Otherwise, it will seem as if we are correcting the family. Neither should we take the broom from our host when she is sweeping. It is best to find another broom and sweep together with our host. It is pleasant to eat with our host, but we should not forget to help wash the dishes. However, we should not take over the dishwashing; we should be alert and quick to help our hosts when they do the dishes. We should also bring our own apron and not expect our host to take off her apron when we want to help with the dishes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is not easy to stay in someone&rsquo;s home. Everything is convenient in our own home, where we cannot get into trouble, but it is not so easy when we are in another person&rsquo;s home. There are many ways for us to get into trouble, and we can inadvertently offend people. Therefore, we must give the matter of moving into someone&rsquo;s home careful consideration. We should not take this matter lightly, because it is easy to enter a home, but it may be difficult to leave.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters who go out to the rural places to spread the gospel contact people every day; therefore, they must be careful to maintain their standing. They should not carelessly make friends with people, and they should avoid natural affection. Some people have tempers like tigers; they erupt very easily, and no one likes them. Other people are like little lambs, and everyone loves them. No matter what type of person we contact, we should not have natural affection when we serve. We are all brothers and sisters, and there is only love and care for the brothers and sisters among us. Hence, we must not develop friendships out of natural affection. Some sisters have affection for all the sisters they have brought to salvation, and they become good friends with them and even share shoes with them. This is not sinful, but it is too much. It is not appropriate. Some brothers get along very well with other brothers, and they share their shirts with them. Every team will now live in a locality for six months and will have plenty of time to contact the local saints; hence, we must remember that we cannot develop natural affection. We only have the love that exists among the saints. It may be effective to stay in people&rsquo;s homes, but we must be extremely careful when we contact people.</p>
<p><em>Question: How can we maintain a high morale?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Strictly speaking, in our living we should be like the sun that rises at a regular time. The rising and the setting of the sun are not related to any factor of high or low morale. A proper Christian life should also not be based on morale. Does the sun have a high morale or a low morale? The Bible compares Christ to the sun (Mal. 4:2). This means that those who follow Him should be like the sun. Consequently, we should not be affected by morale. The sun rises every day, whether the day is clear, cloudy, or rainy. None of these affect the morale of the sun. The sun rises regularly in the East, and it sets regularly in the West. Proverbs 4:18 says, &ldquo;The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, / Which shines brighter and brighter until the full day.&rdquo; We Christians are like the sun, and we should not have a morale that can be lifted up by excitement or emotions. We should be beside ourselves to the Lord (2 Cor. 5:13), as if we are the dawning light which shines brighter and brighter. Judges 5:31 contains a prayer: &ldquo;May those who love Him be like the sun / When it rises in its might.&rdquo; When the sun is in its might, it is &ldquo;beside itself.&rdquo; We should always be beside ourselves, just as the sun is in its might, but this is not related to morale. We are all the shining sun rising in the East; hence, we must be revived every morning. Every morning we must have morning revival.</p>
<p>A proper morale is not a matter of emotions, but this does not mean that we do not have emotions. For example, all true Christians cry; anyone who cannot cry should not be considered a genuine Christian. Even the Lord Jesus cried. Jesus wept in the situation with Martha and Mary at the death of Lazarus (John 11:35), Jesus wept for Jerusalem (Luke 19:41), and He also wept in the garden of Gethsemane before His death (Heb. 5:7). We should consider how long it has been since we cried. This is related to our Christian life. It is wrong to cry all the time; the sisters should avoid crying frequently. However, it is a dreadful matter if a person has never cried after being saved. Frequent crying, however, is an expression of a weak vessel. Crying can be compared to the rain; if it rains frequently, the weather is bad. Hence, we must learn not to cry constantly.</p>
<p><em>Question: How should we help new believers who are under pressure from their relatives?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The Lord Jesus also endured pressure from His relatives, because He did not take the time to eat when He was preaching. The Lord Jesus did not respond to His relatives (Mark 3:20-21, 31-35; Luke 8:19-21). Therefore, we must let new believers know that they should not be concerned about how others treat them and that they must endure persecution. The path we take in following the Lord is different from the path of people in the world. Our relatives are in the world; hence, they will not approve of the way we take. This can be compared to the Israelites and the Egyptians. The Israelites were shepherds, but because this was an abomination to the Egyptians, the two peoples could not be together. The people in the world take a road that is different from the road we take. We should clearly explain to new ones that they must endure persecution. They must also pray for their relatives and believe the Lord&rsquo;s promise: &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household&rdquo; (Acts 16:31). We must believe the Lord&rsquo;s word, and we must endure the temporary persecution from our relatives. We should also learn to pay the price.</p>
<p>According to our experience in mainland China, Muslim relatives are the strongest opposers. There are two kinds of Muslims in China, the Han Chinese who converted to Islam and those of the Muslim race. The members of the Muslim race look like Caucasians. It is true that a person from the Muslim race who believes in the Lord can be killed. In Chefoo a Muslim believed in the Lord, and his relatives wanted to kill him, but the Lord protected him. Many people have been martyred for the Lord over the centuries. We should tell their stories to new believers. We should not worry that they will be frightened away; on the contrary, the stories of the martyred saints can stir up new ones and strengthen their faith. As Christians, we should not care for our own lives. Today because many Christians are weak, they preach a weak gospel and have a weak faith. However, the gospel we preach is strong and will stir up much persecution.</p>
<p>The New Testament says that parents will deliver up their children to death, and children will rise up against their parents (Matt. 10:21). Hence, if we want to help new ones take this way, we must testify to them that those who believe in the Lord should not fear hardships, opposition, or persecution. They should consider these matters to be normal.</p>
<p><em>Question: How should we help a new sister whose husband has not believed in the Lord?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The relationship between a husband and wife is mysterious; therefore, we must not make loose decisions regarding their relationship. We should not loosely touch a situation in which the wife believes in the Lord but the husband does not. We should simply preach the gospel and minister Christ. We should exhort the wife to pray for her husband and explain that a change in her behavior is a testimony to her husband and thus is the best way to convince her husband. We should also use the Bible to teach the sister. We can use verses such as 1 Peter 3:1, which says, &ldquo;Wives, be subject to your own husbands, that even if any disobey the word, they will be gained without the word through the manner of life of their wives.&rdquo; A wife&rsquo;s manner of life can become a strong, subduing tool that will cause her husband to submit.</p>
<p>If the husband is saved but the wife is not, we should speak according to the same principle. We should exhort the brother to rely on the Lord and to pray for his wife. If we have the Lord&rsquo;s leading and a word of wisdom, we can say something deeper; however, we should be careful in what we say. In principle, we must be very careful when we touch the situations in the households of other people, especially when it involves the relationship between a husband and wife. All other relationships are easy to deal with, but the relationship between a husband and wife is the most difficult to resolve. Sometimes brothers and sisters will speak openly about the situation in their own homes, but we must be careful because sometimes it is better not to know these things. There have even been situations when sisters who serve have spoken about the things their husbands have done. This is inappropriate and can damage people. Hence, we should never think that getting deeply involved in the family matters of the saints is the way to care for them. It is best if we do not know too much. It is sufficient for us to know that they have problems; we do not need to know all the details. We must be very careful when dealing with the problems between a husband and wife.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_062.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_064.html">Next</a> </body></html>
