<h1 class="title">THE JOY AND REWARD<br />
OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 19:13-15; 21:15-16; Luke 15:7, 10; 16:9; 1 Cor. 9:16-17; 2 Tim. 3:15; Deut. 6:2, 7</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the way to preach the gospel. Stanza 1 of <em>Hymns,</em> #1068, a gospel song, says, &ldquo;In tenderness He sought me, / Weary and sick with sin, / And on His shoulders brought me / Into His flock again. / While angels in His presence sang / Until the courts of heaven rang.&rdquo; The angels sing until the courts of heaven ring because a sinner is saved. This sentence is based on Luke 15:10, which says, &ldquo;In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting.&rdquo; This is a good hymn. From the perspective of sinners, receiving God&rsquo;s salvation is an occasion that is full of warmth and affection. From the perspective of the angels, it is an occasion for singing. When we sing this hymn, we must understand the feeling of the angels.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL BEING THE PRINCIPLE OF INCARNATION</h2>
<p>The rejoicing of the angels shows that a person&rsquo;s salvation is important and that his repentance is precious. It is possible that our feeling toward a person&rsquo;s repentance and salvation does not compare to the feeling of the angels. It is also possible that the angels are jealous that the Lord did not entrust the responsibility and the blessing of preaching the gospel to them. The gospel cannot be entrusted to the angels, because the basic principle of preaching the gospel involves the principle of incarnation. God must entrust it to those who are in the flesh. The angels do not have flesh and hence cannot preach the gospel.</p>
<p>In the case of Peter going to the house of Cornelius to preach the gospel, an angel appeared to Cornelius and said, &ldquo;Now send men to Joppa and send for a certain Simon, who is surnamed Peter&rdquo; (Acts 10:5). Even though an angel appeared to Cornelius and spoke to him, the angel did not have the privilege of preaching the gospel. If I were that angel, I would have been jealous that Peter was so blessed. The angel did not have that privilege. He was not in the right position and therefore could not carry out that task. All he could do was tell Cornelius to send for Peter. Peter had the position because he was a person in the flesh.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
BEING A GREAT PRIVILEGE AND A GREAT JOY</h2>
<p>We need to see that preaching the gospel is a great privilege and a great joy. When a sinner is saved, the angels rejoice, praise, and sing in the heavens. In the Gospel of Luke it is mentioned twice that the angels rejoiced. In Luke 2 when the Lord Jesus was born, there was a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying, &ldquo;Glory in the highest places to God, and on earth peace among men of His good pleasure&rdquo; (vv. 13-14). Then in chapter 15, when a sinner repents, the angels rejoice (vv. 7, 10). Christianity thinks that angels only sing Christmas carols on December 25, but the Gospel of Luke says that a sinner repenting can be compared to the Savior being born. On the day we were saved the Lord Jesus was born into our being, and the angels rejoiced and sang.</p>
<p>If we go on strike and do not preach the gospel, the angels become unemployed. The angels might say, &ldquo;We would like to sing, but there is nothing to sing about.&rdquo; We have seen many people being saved and have become accustomed to it. Hence, it seems that we are not interested, and we do not have energy for it. As a result, many saints take a leave of absence from preaching the gospel. They even go into hibernation. However, in the matter of preaching the gospel, we have been on leave long enough. We cannot hibernate any longer. Now is the time to wake up. We must all awake from our hibernation. Regardless of whether we are young or old, we should rise up, preach the gospel, and rescue souls.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING AT LEAST ONE PERSON<br />
TO SALVATION EVERY YEAR</h2>
<p>This is the time that we should devote ourselves to preaching the gospel. We should consider the Lord&rsquo;s heart as well as the feeling of the angels. The angels look forward to the salvation of sinners. We are promoting every saint and every home to preach the gospel, especially to preach the gospel in the community and even to go to the countryside. Our desire is for many more people to be led to salvation. In all of Taiwan there are at least nine to ten thousand saints who meet regularly. It should not be difficult for every one of these saints to lead one person to salvation each year. We all have relatives and friends, but are they all saved? These are not harsh words. One day the Lord will come to us and ask, &ldquo;Where are the ones that you led to salvation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke 19 shows that the salvation given to us by the Lord is our capital. The Lord has given each one of us one mina. The Lord said that we could give the money to &ldquo;the bank,&rdquo; and when He returns, He will collect the principle plus the interest (v. 23). Who is the bank? The bank consists of those whom we have led to salvation. We deposit salvation into those whom we lead to salvation, and these ones become our bank. We can continually distribute this one mina to people, and it will not be exhausted. Eventually, the one mina will gain ten minas. When we read Luke 19, we must pay attention not only to the story of Zaccheus&rsquo;s salvation but also to the story after Zaccheus obtained salvation; that is, we should distribute salvation to others. In this way, we can gain ten minas. Ten minas might not represent ten; it might be a thousand. The number ten signifies completion. When the Lord returns, He will settle accounts with His slaves. He will ask us whether we utilized His salvation to save others. Our answer will determine whether we can reign with Him when He gains His kingdom and returns to establish it on the earth. This is not our imagination but a prophecy that will be fulfilled.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_052.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_054.html">Next</a> </body></html>
