Revelation 21:25</H2><P>"And its gates shall by no means be shut by day, for there will be no night there." </P><P>According to this verse there will still be day and night in the new heaven and new earth (because the opposite of "day" is "night"). The kings of the earth may travel to the new city during the day, but there is no night in the new city. The condition of the inhabitants of the new heaven and new earth will be like that of Adam and Eve, because they will still have bodies of flesh and blood.</P><P>"Day and night" or "night" is mentioned five times in this book in regard to eternity (7:15; 14:11; 20:10; 21:25; 22:5). Therefore, there must still be day and night in the new heaven and new earth. Nevertheless, there is no night in the city; hence, the people there can serve God day and night. Because those who live in the new city have resurrected bodies, they will never get tired. Therefore, they can serve God day and night.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Revelation 21:26</H2><P>"And they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it." </P><P>"They" refers to the kings in verse 24. The kings of the earth bring their glory into the city. Also, the people of the nations follow them to do the same thing. This is something done absolutely in peace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. Revelation 21:27</H2><P>"And anything common and he who makes an abomination and a lie shall by no means enter into it, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life."</P><P>"Anything common" can also be translated "anything that is cheap." Cheap things are not worth much. "He who makes an abomination" means he who worships idols. "He who makes...a lie" means he who practices sorcery. This does not mean that, at that time, there are still those who practice such abominations and lies. It is only an indication of how clean, solemn, and noble this city is.</P><P>"Those who are written in the Lamb's book of life." Two kinds of people live in the new heaven and new earth. One kind will be those of us who have been saved by the blood of the Lord and who live in the new city; the other kind will be the living people who have passed through the millennial kingdom and have become the inhabitants of the new earth. Our names are written in the book of life; we may live in the city forever. The inhabitants of the new earth also have their names in the book of life, but they do not live in the city. Instead, they can only go in and out of the new city.</P><P>In the millennium, only the ones who are invited may take part in the new city, but in eternity this privilege is given to all who have their names written in the book of life.</P><P>The eating, drinking, and living of the inhabitants of the new earth will be the same as that of Adam before he sinned (but these will not sin); in eternity they will still have a physical body. There is much evidence in the Bible to support this:</P><P>(1) The Lord said, "For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage" (Matthew 22:30). Only those with resurrected bodies will not be given in marriage. Since the inhabitants of the new earth do not have resurrected bodies, they will still be given in marriage.</P><P>(2)The new heaven and new earth are the restoration to the situation before Adam committed sin. Therefore, the people will be fruitful and will multiply; they will eat, drink, and live in the same way that Adam did.</P><P>(3)One of the Ten Commandments says, "And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments" (Exo. 20:6). [Note: "unto thousands" should be translated "unto a thousand generations."] If man could never pass through a thousand generations, why did God ever say such a thing? From Adam to the Lord Jesus, there were only seventy-six generations. (Luke 3:23-38 shows that if we include God as one generation, the total is seventy-seven generations.) From Adam to the Lord, there were only four thousand years. Four thousand years was only seventy-six generations. How many generations have there been from the Lord Jesus until now? According to scientific calculations, one generation is, on the average, thirty years. Therefore, two thousand years would only be seventy or eighty generations. In the millennium a man's life span will be greater, so there will be even fewer generations. If we assume that there will be twenty to thirty generations, the total of these three periods will be only two hundred generations. Taking two hundred generations from one thousand, we still have eight hundred. Where are these remaining generations? Therefore, the inhabitants of the new earth must still multiply, except there will be no more death.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_080.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_082.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 16: Study on Revelation &nbsp; pg 81</div><br></body></html>
