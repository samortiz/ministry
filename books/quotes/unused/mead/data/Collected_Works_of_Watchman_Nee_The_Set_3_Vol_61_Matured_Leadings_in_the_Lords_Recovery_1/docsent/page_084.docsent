   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE ELDERS TO BE OPEN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The elders' spirit must be open to the Lord all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Their spirit must be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order for a person to be an elder, he must receive uninterrupted impressions from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is useless for an elder to force others to obey his own judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This kind of judgment is no better than that of a young sister who has just been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Both are nothing more than sinners saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In making any judgment, an elder must be able to say that it is the Lord making such a judgment through him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the reason he has the capacity to touch a matter while others do not have the capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the reason he can claim that the authority of the Holy Spirit is upon him, not upon others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, he must realize that this does not come from his private, individual authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He does not assume authority in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He only carries out God's authority upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The validity of his authority lies in his fellowship and enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the brothers and sisters have to learn to accept the result of the elders' fellowship with God and the enlightenment they have received from God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If they do not accept it, they are being rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The elders must have an open spirit as well as an open heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They must be pliable before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They have to be quick in listening to the brothers and sisters, and they have to discern God's speaking in their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Suppose a brother or a sister is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The elders have to learn to listen carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Their ears have to be quick, and they have to understand the very meaning of what the Spirit is trying to say.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Someone may speak fifty sentences, but only one is a word from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They should identify this word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, when I was in Shanghai, I once spoke with Brother Luk.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Another brother, a foreigner, was also present in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the course of our conversation, we forgot about our foreign brother.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After we finished our conversation, the brother said that he had understood a few of the words we spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From these few words, he was aware of the nature of our conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, he only understood a few English phrases that were interspersed in our conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>An elder should be like this foreign brother in his ability to pick up the "English."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He should be able to catch the few words that God is saying in the brothers' and sisters' speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE ELDERS MUST BE RICH</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The elders must be the richest persons in the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They must be able to freely dispense themselves to others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They must also be able to receive a supply from every member.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only a rich person can give to others, and only they can receive the supply from the Body and learn from the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The elders must be this kind of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They must be able to make others rich, and they must be able to receive a supply from others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They must be able to draw out the good points of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means not only that their spirit must be open but that they must humble themselves to learn from others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE ELDERS MUST BE COORDINATED</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When there is no authority in the church, there is no coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Among the elders there must also be mutual submission; they must learn to coordinate among themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the only way for the church to be in order.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This kind of coordination will result in the whole church serving together.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the same time, the elders have to learn to not build up their own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I hope our arrangement and fellowship this time will direct the service of the church on to a good track.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A CONCLUDING WORD</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every brother and sister is a member of this Body, and everyone is useful.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the elders can call the whole church into function and bring out all the one-talented ones and if everyone submits to authority, we will gospelize all of Hong Kong in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church will be able to build up itself as well as spread outward to gain more people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>May we pray much for this.</S>
