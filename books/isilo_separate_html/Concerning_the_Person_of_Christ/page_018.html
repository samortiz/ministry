Christ Is Both the Creator and a Creature</h2><p>According to the complete revelation of the Bible, Christ is both the Creator and the creature, because He is God and He is man-He is God who creates, He is also man who is created. As to His being God, He is the uncreated Creator, the I AM who is without beginning. But as to His being man, He is created, the Firstborn, with a beginning. We must see and know these two aspects of Him. We must see that He is God, and He is also man; He is the Creator, and He is also a creature; He is the I AM; He is also the Firstborn; He is without beginning, and He is also with a beginning. Otherwise our understanding of Him is inaccurate, unorthodox, and contrary to scriptural revelation and will invariably fall into error and incompleteness.</p><p>Our knowledge of the Lord should not be limited by our own view; rather, we should accept the whole revelation of the Bible. However much the Bible reveals is that which we must receive. Some think that since the Lord is God, how could He become man. Likewise, some think that since the Lord is the Creator, how could He become a creature. Although they believe the Lord is God and man as well, they only believe Him to be the Creator, not a creature. But the Bible clearly reveals that the Lord is the Creator and that He became a creature, just as on one hand, He is God, and on the other hand, He became man. We must know and accept the various aspects of what the Lord is and not ignore or deny any aspect of what He is.</p><p>We should never try to use our limited, logical mind to analyze our unlimited Lord! The Pharisees recognized that Christ was the Son of David, based on one aspect of the Bible; however, they did not know that the Bible also reveals another aspect of the Lord which says that Christ is also David&#8217;s Lord. We should be warned not to repeat their mistake by limiting ourselves to one aspect of the biblical revelation of Christ and neglecting or rejecting the other aspect. The Scripture on one hand, says that Christ is the Creator; on the other hand, it also says that He is a creature. This is the complete, clear revelation of the Bible; we should not deviate from it nor come short of it. Our all-inclusive Lord is too wonderful! He is so wonderful it is hard for us to comprehend Him. He is really worthy to be called &#147;Wonderful!&#148; He is really worthy also to be appreciated and loved by us!</p><p>If we confess only that our Lord is the Creator yet deny that He is a creature, in principle this is the same as those who deny that the Lord came in the flesh (1 John 4:2-3). Hence, we should never deny the created aspect of our Lord simply because of our narrow, limited view. He is the uncreated God; He is also a created man! He is the Lord of creation, and He is also a creature, even the &#147;firstborn of all creation.&#148;</p><h2 class="head2">7. Christ Is Still the Creator though He Has Become a Creature</h2><p>When Christ became a creature, He did not lose His eternal, uncreated nature-He remains the Creator. In like manner, when He became man, He did not lose His divine nature-He is still God. Although He became a created man, He remains the uncreated God. Although He became a creature, He still is the Creator. Now He is the all-inclusive Christ who has both divinity and humanity and who has the uncreated divine life as well as the created human life. He is the uncreated I AM; He is also the created Firstborn. May we love and worship Him forever and ever! Amen!</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
