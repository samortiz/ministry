<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Destroying the Temple of God</H2><P>Another shortage of those serving the Lord is destroying the temple of God. First Corinthians 3 says, "But if anyone builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble, the work of each shall become manifest." Again it says, "If anyone's work shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss...If anyone destroys the temple of God, God shall destroy him" (vv. 12-13, 15, 17). The wood, grass, and stubble here signify the things that originate from the natural background and natural lifestyle of the believers. When a man builds with these worthless materials, he is destroying the temple of God. For this reason, in the Lord's work we must never allow any human flesh or natural affection to be mixed in. Some among the brothers may have rendered you a lot of help, while others may not have rendered as much help to you. However, you should not prefer one above another because of this. There is no special rank or position among us; there are only different functions within the Body of Christ. The church is the Body of Christ. In the Body no one should propose that someone do certain things or recommend that others do a certain work. It is a shame to do these things; they will corrupt, defile, and damage the Body of Christ. I fully agree that we should love each other. I also feel that as long as I have enough food, I should not allow my co-workers to go hungry. I can say this before the Lord because I have done this in a definite way. In spite of this, we must avoid all fleshly relationships, so that we do not destroy the temple of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TWO SNARES FOR THE SERVING ONES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Pride</H2><P>I have seen much in the way of serving the Lord during the past sixty years. Those who are unable to do something appear common, and those who can do something become proud. Paul told us in Galatians 5 that we should not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another (v. 26). In Philippians 2 he desired that the brothers think the same thing, have the same love, be joined in soul, and think the one thing (v. 2). For this reason, he besought the two sisters, Euodias and Syntyche, to think the same thing in the Lord (Phil. 4:2). The worst thing that can happen among us is for the co-workers not to be one. This will cause us to lose the Lord's presence, and it will make a hole in our vessel, causing us to lose the Lord's blessings. Once we become proud and despise others, considering our work better than others, there will be a breech, and unnoticeably all the blessings that were brought in will leak away. I have said that we are not here to build up our own work. It is good to preach the gospel, to nourish the lambs, and to have group meetings. However, all these are but the means; they are not the work that we are building. The work that we are building is the Body of Christ.</P><P>Hence, all of us must have the Lord's grace, that no matter how well we have done in the Lord's work, we should always have the attitude described in Luke 17:10. After we have completed the work commissioned by the Lord, we should say that we are but unprofitable slaves and that we have only done what we ought to have done. This is my prayer before the Lord all the time. There are many things that I should have done but have not been able to do. No matter how much we have done, we are merely doing our best to fulfill our duty. Pride is a terrible thing. It will make a person blind and will put him under the judgment reserved for the devil (1 Tim. 3:6). We have to be aware of this matter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Fornication</H2><P>Another big snare is fornication. In 1 Corinthians 6:18 Paul said, "Flee fornication. Every sin which a man may do is outside the body, but he who commits fornication sins against his own body." Do not forget that we are fallen and that this age is evil and adulterous. I know for sure that many good brothers have stumbled because of this matter. You have to remember that we are here in the training for the purpose of being trained and sent out to work together. Of course, when a man or a woman grows up, he or she wants to get married, but we should not take any opportunity in the Lord's holy work to pursue after marriage. This will defile the temple of God. I want to give you this warning. Your holy duty is to be trained here and to spread the gospel in the villages. You must flee the snare of fornication.</P><P>The Bible gives many teachings concerning this matter. Paul said in 1 Thessalonians 4:3-4, "For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that you abstain from fornication; that each one of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor." We cannot sell our body cheaply. Fornication is an extremely filthy matter. Those practicing this will not inherit the kingdom of God (Gal. 5:19-21). This is a most serious thing. I have often told people that it is unavoidable for men and women to have contact with each other in the Lord's work. But the principle must be kept that two of the opposite sex must never talk with each other alone in a closed room. If it is necessary, they should do so in an open place, or they should have another person join them. Personally, I am not old-fashioned. I am not here preaching Chinese culture. Rather, I am here preaching Christ. However, I believe in the Chinese saying which says, "Avoid intimacy between male and female in giving or in receiving." There is a place for this word. In contacting others, a brother should not contact a female alone. Neither should a sister contact a male alone. In this way you will be preserved.</P><P>I hope that these four points will be a warning that you can remember in your heart forever. If you do this, I can guarantee you that your time of serving the Lord will be long-lasting. Otherwise, you may fall into these traps and stumble, having regret for a long, long time. None of these four things can be violated. In the Lord's recovery, your work for the Lord must never give others the impression that you are creating a division or that you are different. At the same time, you must not walk according to the flesh, act rashly, or speak loosely. You must not bring in natural affection or any worldliness, and you should not let others feel that you are proud. You should only do what you should do. All the practices that we have are for the Lord's recovery and for the work of the building up of the Body of Christ. We would rather see that we are forgotten and our proper and orthodox work remains. Lastly, you have to honor your worth and preserve your body with holiness and honor by fleeing fornication.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei, Taiwan on October 22, 1990)</P>
