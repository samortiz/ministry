   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Building of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord has revealed through Watchman Nee that believers must be practically built up with others in the local churches under the authority of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This kind of building is a test to genuine spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If one cannot be built up with others in a local church, his spirituality is questionable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>47.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Coordination in the Church Life</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Another revelation received by Watchman Nee, which is closely related to authority and building, was the revelation concerning coordination in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the members in the local church need not only to be built up with others but also to coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The service of the church cannot be carried out individually.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the members must serve in a coordinated way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>48.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Body and the Spiritual Warfare</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the early years of his ministry, Watchman Nee saw the spiritual warfare as a personal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, from 1939 on, he saw that it was not just a personal matter, but a matter of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The warrior in Ephesians 6 is not an individual believer but the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Watchman Nee stressed strongly that if believers are individualistic, it will be difficult for them to fight against the powers in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To fight the enemy we need the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to be not only in the heavenlies but also in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>FROM 1942 TO 1948 49.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Discipline of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The period from 1942 to 1948 was a period of longsuffering for Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>During this time he learned to see the need of the Holy Spirit's discipline for the reconstitution of our being and for the breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He saw that God sovereignly arranges our environment to work good for us through the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Holy Spirit arranges our environment and disciplines us through our environment in order to reconstitute us within with the divine element.</S>
