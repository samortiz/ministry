The recovery is based upon the truth that Christ has only one Body. Even if these divisive ones move to a city in which there is not a church, they have to be checked concerning what kind of relationship they have with the other churches. One of the tests of a genuine local church is that it should have universal fellowship with all the other local churches.</P><P>When these dissenting ones came to me, I told them that regardless of what they did, I would not make any division or set up new churches. But I also told them that I would not tolerate anything that was against the truth. Later, they began to say that once an apostle establishes churches and appoints elders in them, he should keep his hands off of these churches. I pointed out that Paul did not keep his hands off of the church in Ephesus. He established the church in Ephesus, appointed elders there, and went back to Ephesus. He stayed there at one time for three and a half years (Acts 20:17, 31). When he could not go to them personally, he wrote to them (Eph. 1:1). How could the apostles be commissioned only to set up the churches without building them up? This is altogether illogical and unscriptural.</P><P>When I shared this, they had no ground to teach concerning the so-called autonomy of a local church as put forth by G.H. Lang in his book The Churches of God. The church is not an organization that can practice autonomy. Even the United States, a nation of organization, cannot have absolute autonomy. In this country, the states do not have an autonomous defense, diplomacy, or postal system. The postal system, the diplomacy, and the defense of the country are national matters. Even in a nation like the United States, absolute autonomy cannot be practiced. The ones in this recent rebellion taught this because they wanted me to stay away from the churches. Their teaching issued in division.</P><P>Later, one of them said that there was not only one apostle but also a number of apostles. He said that he could present a list of the brothers among us who were apostles. Another brother asked him for this list. All of the ones on this list had been my students. After this I went to Taiwan and gave a message on the different kinds of apostles (see chapter two of A Timely Trumpeting and the Present Need&#151;pp. 21-29). Because of what I presented, they changed and said that there were only twelve apostles&#151;eleven plus Paul. They said that the one selected in Acts 1, Matthias, was a wrong one. This was the old teaching of the Brethren. We knew this and rejected it many years ago. Brother Nee rejected this wrong teaching in The Normal Christian Church Life (see chapter one&#151;pp. 20-38). When they got to know this, they eventually said that there were no apostles. I said in the past that all the saints could function as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. This shows that the ones involved in this recent rebellion do not care for the truth. They do not care for the oneness, for the Body of Christ. We should not do anything without taking care of the Body.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
