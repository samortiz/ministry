   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ORDER OF LIFE AND LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why is the order of life and light reversed in the Gospel of John?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In God s creation, light is first and life follows.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But in God s regeneration, life comes first and light follows.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the old creation light comes before life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in God s new creation, life comes first, followed by light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is because in God s old creation, God did not enter into His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, God sent light in an objective way to shine over the darkness that life may be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, in God s new creation, God comes into His creature.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He comes into us as our life, and this life is the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we came into the church, we did not see light first.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We did not have eyes to see the spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The butterfly was there, but we only saw the cocoon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We could not see the spirit, we could only see the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This simply means that our eyes were blind to the real things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before we were saved, we never saw anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then one day we opened to the Lord Jesus and called on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Soon the light began to shine, and we could see all the sinful things we had done.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually we said, O Lord Jesus, forgive me!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we sensed heavenly peace, and the burden of our sins fell off.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The tears of joy began to flow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From that time we were delivered out of darkness and brought into His wonderful light.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This light comes from the life within.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once Jesus gets into us, the light begins to shine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I believe we have all had this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we were without Christ and in darkness, we could not see our sinfulness, our wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But when the Lord Jesus came into us, His life became the light.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then He began to enlighten and expose us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In one sense, it is terrifying, but in another sense, it is really wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What a release, and what a cleansing!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A PERSON OF LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now we must see something more in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Revelation 1, there are many items related to light concerning the Son of Man: And His eyes were as a flame of fire; and His feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and His countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength Rev 1:14b-15a, 16b .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here the Lord s face is like the shining sun.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His eyes are like flaming fire.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Flaming fire not only burns; it also gives light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His feet were like fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They were also shining.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Look at this wonderful Person!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His eyes are flaming, His face is shining, and His feet are burning.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we approach Him, we simply approach light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When He comes, He comes with light.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In all the social clubs of this world, everything is in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if the church is genuine in the Lord s recovery, Jesus is there with a face like the shining sun, with flaming eyes, and with burning brass feet.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some may argue concerning who is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are the genuine church, Christ is here shining.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eventually, because of His glory, the whole earth will be lightened.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One day, all the earth will be under the lightening of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the new heaven and new earth, all the nations will walk in the light of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And the nations shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it Rev 21:24, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>. The New Jerusalem will not only be full of light, but even the nations around the New Jerusalem will walk in the light of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The city will enlighten the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This should be a picture of the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The church today should enlighten the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Jesus said in the Gospel of John that He is the light of the world John 8:12; 9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is just a little seed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we come to the book of Revelation, there is the harvest of this seed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have already seen that His face is like the shining of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In chapter eighteen, His glory enlightens the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory Rev 18:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Here we see the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the Gospel of John, we only have the seed of Christ being the light, but in Revelation there is the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this book Christ is not only the light, but also the shining sun full of glory, enlightening the whole world.</S>
