   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE SIGNIFICANT ITEMS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT AND THE PROPHECIES OF THE OLD TESTAMENT Scripture Reading: John 1:14; 6:57a; Eph 1:22-23; John 3:29; Rev 21:9-10; Gen 3:15; 22:18; Isa 11:1, 10; 7:14; 9:6; 53:2; Micah 5:2; Gen 2:21-24; Psa 22:22; Isa 8:18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The focus of these messages is a general sketch of the New Testament in the light of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here we cannot deal with many details, but by the grace of the Lord, we will see the main points and the main line of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to know the sketch of the New Testament, we must see something concerning the entire Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, the entire Scriptures reveal not only the nature and character of God but also His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In fact, the Scriptures may reveal God's purpose more than His character and nature because the entire Bible is a book showing us God's plan; it is a book unveiling the purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is the purpose of God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In brief, God's eternal purpose and intention are to have a group of living persons mingled with Himself as one to be His living, corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second, the Old Testament, the first main part of the Scriptures, contains types and prophecies as figures, shadows, and predictions concerning the purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Old Testament are all the figures, shadows, and pictures which describe, portray, or predict God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Third, the New Testament contains the fulfillment of the types and prophecies concerning God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By this brief and clear word we can see that the entire Scriptures are a book of God's purpose: The Old Testament contains the shadows and figures of God's purpose, and the New Testament contains the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With this understanding and realization, we can better understand the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE SIGNIFICANT ITEMS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT Incarnation</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To grasp a few significant items is sufficient for us to understand the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first significant and prominent item mentioned and recorded in the New Testament is that one day God came into man to be mingled with man and to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The almighty Creator of the universe came into one of His creatures, man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before incarnation, God was God and man was man; the Creator was the Creator, the creature was the creature, and the two were not one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Incarnation, however, is a real landmark in time, dividing the dispensation of the Old Testament from that of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is a landmark at which something wonderful, magnificent, marvelous, and indescribable happened: The Creator mingled Himself with one of His creatures man and He Himself became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A Wonderful Life and Living</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Second, the New Testament shows us a wonderful living, a walk as the expression of an inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On this earth the Lord Jesus had the living of the divine life through the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The wonderful living of the Lord Jesus spoken of and recorded in the four Gospels was the issue of the mingling of the divine life with the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In other words, God was lived out through man in a wonderful living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this living we can see God expressed through man and God and man mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we read the four Gospels again with this light and from this point of view, we will have a new understanding of the record of these four books.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They show us the wonderful living of God Himself through man and among men.</S>
