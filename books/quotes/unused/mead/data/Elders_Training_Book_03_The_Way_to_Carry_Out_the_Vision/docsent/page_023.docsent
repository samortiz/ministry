   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PURPOSE OF THE RECOVERY VERSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH THE NOTES To Present the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1974 I began to write the notes for the Recovery Version of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have written these notes to expound the books of the Bible for a few purposes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The main purpose is to bring you into the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As of January of 1985, we had trainings over the entire twenty-seven books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those of you who have been trainees in the trainings should have realized that the first purpose of the notes of the Recovery Version is to present the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I do not believe you can find as many basic truths in other books as you have found in the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Other expositions and commentaries, for example, do not correctly point out what the main truth in the book of Matthew is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Recovery Version clearly points out that this is a book on the kingdom of the heavens and it gives you a proper definition of the truths concerning the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To Minister the Life Supply</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first purpose of the notes is to present to you the truth, and the second purpose is to minister to you the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many of you can testify that you do not get as much nourishment from other expositions and commentaries as you can from the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To Solve the Common and Hard Problems</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>in the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The third purpose of the notes is to help us to solve the common and hard problems in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In nearly every book of the New Testament there are some questions which are hard to answer and some problems and points which are hard to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The notes in the Recovery Version are also an attempt to solve the hard problems in the Bible to help the readers get through them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have had much experience as a young man studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I came to a certain point in the Bible that I could not understand and I became stuck on that point.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For instance, 2 Peter 2:4 refers to the gloomy pits to which the angels who sinned were delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I read this in the Chinese version as a young man I got stuck on this point.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I did not know what the Chinese meant by a gloomy pit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Recovery Version, however, there are adequate notes to help on problems such as these see note 4 2 in 2 Peter 2 and note 19 3 in 1 Peter 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For problems such as these in the Bible, I spend much time to go to the original Greek, to the lexicons, to the concordances, and to others expositions in order to get a proper understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By the Lord s mercy, I believe and thank the Lord that I received such an understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, for each of these problems I have given you a proper interpretation to help you to understand them properly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means to remove all the obstacles on your driveway that you may have a clear route and highway for a drive in your Bible study.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today we have a Recovery Version of the New Testament with nearly no obstacles on the driving way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You can drive your study car through any book of the New Testament without stops.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you have a problem you can refer to the notes for help.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To Open Up the Books of the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The fourth purpose of the Recovery Version with the notes is to open up the books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After the Recovery Version of a book had been published, that particular book of the Bible was opened to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because we have a Recovery Version of the entire New Testament, we must testify that the books of the New Testament have been opened to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have an open book.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some teachers of the Bible admit that Revelation is a closed book and that it is too deep.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Also, a number of believers were told not to touch Revelation and to stay away from it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To most believers Revelation is a closed book, but when you get the Recovery Version of Revelation you cannot say that it is a closed book.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is an open book.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Recovery Version of Revelation gives you a very brief and concise interpretation of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have made an attempt to open every book of the New Testament to you, but I have left the further digging to you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I have only opened up the mine, and I have not dug that much.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The foundation which Brother Watchman Nee laid in China helped me greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>During his time, however, he told me that the Lord had not permitted him to write any expositions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through the messages I heard personally and directly from him, through the publications put out by him, and through many direct talks with him for over at least eighteen years, I received a very solid foundational word to build on.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As a result, I picked up the burden to write the expository notes for the Recovery Version to open each book of the New Testament to the seeking saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Both Brother Nee and I did not have that much time to dig further.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I want to dig further and I am still digging, but I do not believe that I can do that much.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, I leave this further digging matter to you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The basic truths have been presented to us, and much life nourishment has been put into print, especially with the Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Also, the obstacles have nearly all been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We now have a clear way for our study, and every book is open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In mining, the hardest thing is to open the mine.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once the mine has been opened and the treasure is exposed, it is easy for someone to dig out the treasures.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have left only this one matter of further digging to you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I believe the Lord will continue this digging work either through you or through some others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After a period of time I believe that many of you will be good diggers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The intention and the goal of our publishing of the Life-study messages is to open up the mine for you to go in and dig.</S>
