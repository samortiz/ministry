   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PURSUIT 1:4</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 4 says, "Draw me, we will run after thee."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although we have the desire and the willingness to pursue after Him, we cannot help but feel a lack of strength for the pursuit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This strength for the pursuit is not a mighty power from the Spirit that is given to us once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, the Lord's own beauty and glory draw us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His drawing power is our pursuing power.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the Lord has truly drawn us, it is very easy for us to pursue after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If You draw us, "we will run after thee."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Running after is pursuing something continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The power to run after the Lord comes from the drawing of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must realize that no one can come before the Lord by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we were sinners, we needed God's drawing before we could come to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Similarly, after becoming believers, we need the Lord's drawing before we can run after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here we see the relationship between an individual believer and other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Me" is drawn, but "we" are running after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Me" has been brought into the chambers, but "we" will rejoice and be glad.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a man receives grace before the Lord, others will surely be affected by him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>FELLOWSHIP 1:4</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 4 continues, "The King hath brought me into his chambers."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After the maiden prays, we see her prayer being answered: "The King hath brought me into his chambers."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The "chambers" are the "secret place" Psa 91:1 , which are the bedrooms.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Unless we have very deep friendship with a person, we will not bring him into our chambers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, when the King brings her into the chambers, it signifies the beginning of fellowship and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the chambers she tastes of a fellowship that was previously unknown.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But more than this, she sees something that she has not seen before.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word "King" indicates that before we know the Lord as our Beloved, we must first know Him as our King.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A life of consecration always comes before a life of love, and a satisfying experience always comes after an act of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"The King hath brought me into his chambers."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She has previously known Him as her King.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But now the King will show her the experience of the chambers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who are with the maiden can now lift up their heads as their future unfolds before them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no limit to their future.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once the experience of the chambers begins, hope abounds in a life of love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They know that since God has begun the work, He will surely complete it Phil 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, they say, "We will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These are words for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Their present experience fills them with hope for the future cf.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Prov 23:35 for an example of seeking associated with wine .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"The upright love thee" should be translated, "They love thee in uprightness."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that their love comes out of a good conscience 1 Tim 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE REVELATION IN THE INNER CHAMBERS 1:5-7</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 5 says, "I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Who are the "daughters of Jerusalem"?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a poem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, the Jerusalem mentioned here does not refer to the earthly Jerusalem, but to the heavenly Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since these daughters are within the realm of the heavenly Jerusalem, they must be saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Calling them "daughters" means that they are begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, they are not very seeking; they are a cold, ignorant, and careless group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Mr. Hudson Taylor said, "They appear to be the saved ones, but are perhaps barely saved."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"I am black, but comely."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The first result of being in the chambers is to discover one's own blackness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Without the experience of pursuit, there is no possibility of seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now the maiden sees the kind of person she is.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This may be the first time she has seen her own blackness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>She did not become black.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This blackness was already present; it speaks of everything that is in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, at the same time, she sees that she is accepted in the Son of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, she says, "I am black, but comely."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Comeliness refers to her acceptance in the Son of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>"As the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>"Kedar" means a dark chamber.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Being as the tents of Kedar means being outwardly dark and uncomely.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If "the curtains of Solomon" are made of fine linen, they must refer to Christ's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The righteousnesses mentioned in Revelation 19:8 refers to the saints' righteousnesses which come from the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But this is the Old Testament, and cannot refer to the saints' righteousnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>These curtains should be in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>"As the curtains of Solomon" refers to inward beauty, that is, one's beauty before God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Verse 6 says, "Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>"Sun" in the original language has a definite article with it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Through God's enlightening in the chambers, she realizes that she is black.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, she does not want anyone to look at her.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is her mental state at the moment.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Before the Holy Spirit completes His deep work in a man, he may still want to cover himself before others.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But after the Holy Spirit has done a deep enough work, a man will no longer try to hide anything from others.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>At this point, the maiden's appearance before men is the same as it is before God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As a result, she is willing to confess, "I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>"My mother's children were angry with me."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The verse does not say "my father's children," but "my mother's children," because mother signifies the principle of promise, which is the principle of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Galatians 4:26-28 says that the Jerusalem above is our mother and that we, like Isaac, are children of promise.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>"My mother's children" are those who have become God's children according to the principle of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>"Children" is translated "sons" in the American Standard Version.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>"Sons" signifies something objective.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>These sons of the mother are strong in doctrine and in objective things, and they are somewhat authoritative.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Because of the maiden's love for God and the discipline of the chambers, there is a change in her work.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Her mother's sons begin to despise her and even become angry with her.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>"They made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The first mention of "vineyard" is plural in number; it is organized by man.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The second mention of "vineyard" is singular in number; it is ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>"They made me the keeper of the vineyards."</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This was her former work.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>After she has received God's enlightening and is dealt with by Him, she realizes the vanity of her former work she has only done what man entrusted to her, but not what God ordained for her.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Verse 7 says, "Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?"</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The word "loveth" is a verb.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>"Turneth aside" can be translated as "wanders astray."</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In the chambers, she has already realized the vanity of her outward works.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>She already realizes that a Christian's need is not work, but personal food and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The word "feedeth" speaks of food.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>From now on, she will only seek after food and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This "rest" is a complete rest, because "noon" is the time of perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The path of the just is as the shining light, that shines more and more unto the perfect day, which is noon Prov 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Noon is the perfect position.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>When the sun reaches noon, it will not grow any brighter.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The Lord suffered from noon to the ninth hour.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>His sufferings descended upon Him all at once; they came with great intensity from the beginning, and did not increase gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>"Why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?"</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>These "companions" are the Lord's companions.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The flock, however, is not the Lord's flock, but the flock of His companions.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Being turned aside is to be put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>She is outside of the flock, and she has to say, "Why are You not telling me where to find food and rest?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>I have been searching for food and rest; I have searched here and there."</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Because she has been led astray by the flock of His companions and is being ridiculed and criticized, she asks, "Lord, why would You not tell me?"</S>
