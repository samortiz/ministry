Reaping</H2><P>When the harvest is ripe, there is need for reaping. After the gospel is preached, the saved ones should be brought into the church. There is much to say about this also. Here I can only mention this briefly. After the gospel is preached, there must be the reaping.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. Coordination</H2><P>To preach the gospel, there must also be the coordination. Some should be responsible for the message. Some should be responsible for leading the hymns. Some should be responsible for ushering, or to sit with the new ones, or to pass out the tracts. The elders have to help and coordinate all these people together.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. Prayer</H2><P>Finally, we have to help the brothers and sisters to pray for all the items we have covered. They should pray for the zeal of the gospel, the power of the gospel, the truth of the gospel, the leading of the gospel, the purpose and the tools of the gospel. They should ask the Lord to bless every Bible and every tract. You can see that simply on prayer alone there are many things in which we need to render help.</P><P>I deeply feel that our prayer meetings have become too general under our leadership. The reason for this is that we do not have specific goals. Sometimes we do not need to pray for so many things. All we need to do is to pray specifically for the targets of the gospel. Here are the schools, the factories, the prisons. We have brothers and sisters working in all these places. We have to pray specifically for these gospel targets. If you do this, you will find that the prayer meeting will come alive, and the prayers will become weighty. These are all works within the elders' management. The elders are the managers. They must be enterprising and must generate business. If you would spend time on these matters, you could find out that there is much to learn on every point. I am only mentioning the points in brief.</P><P>Other than the above, the gospel message, the gospel hymns, the gospel counselling, and the gospel visitation are four important items as well. This means that the elders have to be good in everything. This is why I said that no one can be an elder alone; we have to serve in coordination. Among the elders, there should be some who can preach the gospel. They should train the brothers to learn to give a gospel message, to lead the gospel songs, to give gospel counselling, and to have gospel visitation. All these are part of the helps the elders should render with respect to the gospel. In the management of the church, after the elders have brought the brothers and sisters into the coordination, the first direction they should take is the gospel.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_118.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_120.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Elders' Management of the Church &nbsp; pg 119</div><br></body></html>
