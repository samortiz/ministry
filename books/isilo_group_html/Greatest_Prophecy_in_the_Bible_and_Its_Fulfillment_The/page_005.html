<p>Today is the time in which the Lord is building up His church in the way of recovery. In order to see the proper way for the Lord to work out His recovery, we need to see something related to the prophecies in the Bible. The prophecies concerning the world situation have been predicted in reference to three sections: the section of the European part; the section of the Mediterranean part, which is considered today as the Middle East; and the section of the Oriental part, which is referred to in the book of Revelation as the place of &ldquo;the rising of the sun&rdquo; (16:12). Today&rsquo;s world situation is progressing according to the prophecies in the Bible.</p>
<p>When I was younger, I spent much time to study the prophecies in the Bible. Also, when I was in school, my favorite subject was world history. I have been observing and studying the world situation for more than fifty years. In this entire century, there has never been a time like today that fits in with the situation predicted by the biblical prophecies. Today&rsquo;s world situation involves mainly America, Europe, and Asia. There are a number of prophecies in the Bible concerning Europe and Asia in their three sections: the European, Mediterranean, and Oriental sections. Today the problems in the world situation are not with America but with Europe and Asia. Actually, the problems in today&rsquo;s world situation are concentrated in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Eventually, the situation is being prepared for that day in which the nations will be gathered together for the last war among mankind before the millennium in a place called Armageddon (Rev. 16:16). Armageddon is less than two hundred miles away from Jerusalem. The book of Revelation tells us that the armies from the Far East will be gathered there along with the kings of the whole inhabited earth (vv. 12, 14). No doubt, the powers of Europe and from the north will be gathered there. At that time, there will still be a warning to the believers who remain on this earth that the Lord is coming (v. 15). After a period of relative peace on this earth, there will be such a great war at the end of this age. Then the Lord will come back to destroy all the world powers and to set up His kingdom on earth (19:11-21; 11:15).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNITED STATES BEING THE BASE<br />
FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>Before that time there will be a period of relative peace in which the Lord will carry out His recovery. The Lord has chosen the United States to be the base for the spreading of His recovery. Revelation 12 tells us that there is a wilderness into which the woman, signifying the remaining and living majority of the believers, can flee for refuge during the great tribulation (v. 6). Since the United States was founded, it has always been a place for oppressed people to take refuge. In a sense, although I am now a citizen, I am a refugee taking refuge in this free country. The United States is a wilderness where oppressed people can take refuge. There is such a big, wide, spacious wilderness where the Lord&rsquo;s people can cooperate with Him. The Lord is going to use the United States as a base.</p>
<p>The Lord will fulfill His prophecy to build up the church, and there is no possibility for Him to do this with all the Christians today. But there is the principle of recovery with a small number, and the Lord is going to accomplish this recovery. It is clear that the Lord has chosen the United States as the base for His recovery. From here He will spread His recovery to Europe, the Middle East, and other continents. This means that the recovery may eventually go back to the city of Jerusalem. The building up of the church started from Jerusalem, and it has been taking place throughout the world. Eventually, it may return to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>We look to the Lord that a number of saints can eventually migrate to Europe for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. For this reason I would encourage a number of the young people who are going to college to major in English and also to pick up a European language, such as German, French, Italian, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, etc. Then they can go to Europe to teach English. Many people in Europe desire to be proficient in English. After this we hope that a number of saints will migrate to the Middle East, including Israel, and then migrate to all the other continents. I hope that the Lord will work this out for the building of His church.</p>
<p>In the early part of the twentieth century, the Lord took China as virgin soil to sow the seed of His recovery. Some said that the practice of the local church would not work in the United States because it had been transplanted from China, but this is not true. The practice of the proper church life really works. The United States is the spacious wilderness where the Lord&rsquo;s people can cooperate with Him that He may have a base for His recovery. He will use the United States to take Europe, the Middle East, and the rest of the earth for His recovery.</p>
<p>If we are faithful to cooperate with the Lord, He will finish His recovery of the building up of the church to fulfill His prophecy. That will be the time for Him to come back. All that we are, all that we have, and all that we can do must be put on the altar of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery so that we can be built up together with others. Our cooperation with the Lord for His move is not in a loose or light way. It must be in the way of life. We will be built up, trained, and then sent. Then the whole earth will be taken for the Lord&rsquo;s purpose.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Greatest Prophecy in the Bible and Its Fulfillment &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
