   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE NINE THE KING S ANOINTING 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In both the Old Testament and the New Testament there are two basic ministries that constitute the kingdom of God: the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Bible there is also a third type of ministry, the ministry of the prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, the prophetic ministry is not a basic ministry; rather, it is a supplement to the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When either the priesthood or the kingship is weak, the prophets come in to strengthen it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the Old Testament, the priesthood was with the tribe of Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, the Old Testament priesthood consummated in John the Baptist, a descendant of this tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In like manner, Jesus was the consummation of the Old Testament kingship, which was with the tribe of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jesus came as a descendant of Judah to be the consummation of the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the one hand, John the Baptist and Jesus Christ terminated the Old Testament priesthood and kingship; on the other hand, they germinated the New Testament priesthood and kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In other words, they terminated the Old Testament dispensation and began the New Testament dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the priesthood brings people to God and the kingship brings God to the people, there is the heavenly reign, the heavenly rule.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This heavenly reign is the kingdom, which today is the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today s church life is the kingdom with the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This church life will continue until the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the millennial kingdom there will still be the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, we, the overcomers, shall be priests and, on the other hand, we shall be kings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, in the millennial kingdom, the priesthood and the kingship will be even stronger than they are today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They will maintain God s kingdom on earth so that the King may gain the people and that the people may gain the King.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the millennium there will be no further need of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In eternity there will be only the kingship because in the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem everyone will be in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that time God will be with man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, there will no longer be the need for the priesthood to bring the people to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In eternity God s presence will eliminate the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nevertheless, the kingship will remain so that those in the New Jerusalem may reign over the nations surrounding the city.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a summary of the Bible in the light of the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the previous message we considered the recommender, John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this message we shall consider John s message of recommendation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>C. The Message of Recommendation 1.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Repentance for the Kingdom of the Heavens</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John s message of recommendation is short, but it is crucial and all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Matthew 3:2 says, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first significant word in this verse is the word repent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John began his ministry with this word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To repent is to have a change of mind issuing in regret, to have a turn in purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Greek the word translated repent means to have a change of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To repent is to have a change in our thinking, our philosophy, our logic.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The life of fallen man is absolutely according to his thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everything he is and does is according to his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When you were a fallen one, you were directed by your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Your mentality, logic, and philosophy governed your way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before we were saved, we all were under the direction of our fallen mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We were far away from God, and our life was in direct opposition to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Under the influence of our fallen mentality, we went farther and farther astray from God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But one day we heard the preaching of the gospel telling us to repent, to have a turn in our thinking, philosophy, and logic.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This was just my experience when I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I was like a young horse running in my own direction.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Actually I was not taking my direction, but the Devil s direction, for the Devil was directing me through my fallen mentality, driving me far away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But one day I heard the call to repent to have a change in my philosophy, to have a change in my logic and thought.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Praise the Lord, I underwent a great change!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I was moving in one direction, but when I heard the call to repent, I made an about-face.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I believe we all have made this kind of turn, which is called conversion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we were converted, we turned our back upon our past and turned our face to God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is what it means to repent, to experience a change of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every ism is a philosophy that directs one s life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nearly every political party has an ism, and that ism is virtually a god.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But we do not have an ism we have the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Formerly, we were under the direction of a certain ism, but now we are under the direction of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our mind has been radically changed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We used to be heading in a certain direction, but now we are heading in the opposite direction.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have had a turn in our thought, in our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The second crucial word in verse 2 is kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the preaching of John the Baptist, repentance, as the opening of God s New Testament economy, was to have a turn for the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This indicates that God s New Testament economy is focused on His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For this we should repent, change our mind, have a turn in our pursuit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The goal of our pursuit has been toward other things; now our pursuit must turn toward God and His kingdom, which is specifically and purposely called in Matthew the kingdom of the heavens cf.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Mark 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The kingdom of the heavens, according to the context of the entire Gospel of Matthew, is different from the Messianic kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Messianic kingdom will be the restored kingdom of David the rebuilt tabernacle of David Acts 15:16 , made up of the children of Israel, earthly and physical in nature; whereas the kingdom of the heavens is constituted of regenerated believers and is heavenly and spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In his message, John the Baptist told people to repent for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He did not say to repent that we might go to heaven or even to obtain salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He said that we must repent for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The kingdom denotes a kind of reign, rule.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Before we were saved, we were not under any rule.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If there had been no police force, government, or law courts to tell us what to do, we would have done whatever we liked.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, when we heard the preaching of the gospel, we turned from a condition of no rule to a condition full of rule.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Thus, we are now in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Before we were saved, we did not have a king.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But after we turned to the Lord, He became our King.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Now we are all under the rule of this King.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>With the King there is the kingship, and this kingship is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Today we are in the kingdom of this King.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The third crucial word in verse 2 is heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>John said to repent for the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The term the heavens, a Hebrew idiom, does not refer to anything plural in nature; rather, it refers to the highest heaven, which according to the Bible is the third heaven, the heaven above the heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This third heaven is called the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The kingdom of the heavens does not denote a kingdom in the air, but a kingdom above the air, a kingdom in the heaven above the heaven, where God s throne is.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In this kingdom there is the ruling, the reigning, of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Therefore, the kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of God in the third heaven where He exercises His authority over everything created by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This kingdom of the heavens must come down to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This heavenly reign must descend to earth to be the authority over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>According to John s word in verse 2, The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This clearly indicates that before the coming of John the Baptist, the kingdom of the heavens was not there.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Even after his appearance, during his preaching, the kingdom of the heavens was still not there; it had only drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>At the time the Lord started His ministry and even at the time He sent His disciples to preach, the kingdom of the heavens had still not come 4:17; 10:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Hence, in the first parable in chapter thirteen vv.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>3-9 , the parable of the seed, which indicates the Lord s preaching, the Lord did not say, The kingdom of the heavens is like....</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Not until the second parable, the parable of the tares v. 24 , which indicates the establishment of the church at the day of Pentecost, did the Lord say this.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The fact that Matthew 16:18 and 19 use the terms the church and the kingdom of the heavens interchangeably proves that the kingdom of the heavens came when the church was established.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>When John the Baptist came, the kingdom of the heavens had only drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>It was approaching, arriving, but it had not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This proves that in the Old Testament there was no kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Even at the time of Moses and David the kingdom of the heavens was not there.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>John said that the kingdom of the heavens was on its way; he did not say that it had arrived.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When the Lord Jesus began His ministry, He also said, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This indicates that even when the Lord Jesus began His ministry, the kingdom of the heavens had still not arrived.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>In his message, John the Baptist told the people to repent for the kingdom of the heavens, which, at that time, was on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The kingdom of the heavens arrived in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This means that it arrived at the very time the church came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Today anyone who has a change in his philosophy and comes back to God will immediately be in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Hallelujah, we are in the kingdom of the heavens!</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We have a King and we are under His rule.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Many times the ruling of the King within us makes it unnecessary for us to be ruled by the policemen or by the law court.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This inward King can put the attorneys out of a job.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>However, those who have not repented and come back to God are not under the King.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Instead, they constantly violate the law.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>For this reason, a great many are summoned to the law court.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>But we, the kingdom people, are under the King of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This King has come into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>At this very moment He is dwelling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>When He speaks to us, He mainly says one word no. According to my experience, His favorite word is no. We have a ruling no within us.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Thank the Lord for this little word, for it saves us from a great deal of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>The speaking of the inward no is the ruling of the King within.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Perhaps today you have heard the King s no a number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>If the kingdom people do not care for this no, they will become backsliders.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Because we are in the kingdom of the heavens, the King rules us mostly by speaking the word no.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Now let us consider how John the Baptist was able to bring others into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>John s ministry was to bring others to God Luke 1:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>John the Baptist, a genuine priest, was filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother s womb Luke 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>There is no doubt that as he grew from infancy to adulthood, to the age of thirty, he was continually immersed in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Because he was flooded and saturated with the Holy Spirit, he could be bold.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>It is a serious matter to stand against the current of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>To do this requires a great deal of boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>How could John the Baptist be so bold as to stand against the Judaistic religion and the Greco-Roman culture?</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>He was bold because for thirty years he was being immersed in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>He was a person thoroughly soaked with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Therefore, when he came out to minister, he came out in the Spirit and with power.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Yes, he wore camel s hair as a sign of his repudiation of the old dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>But that was merely an outward sign.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>There was also reality within him, and that reality was the Spirit and the power.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>The reality in John was not just the presence of God, but also the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>John was immersed, saturated, and soaked with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Spontaneously this caused him to be a great magnet.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>He could be a magnet because he himself had been fully charged.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Year after year and day after day, he was charged with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Therefore, in his ministry, he was a powerful magnet.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>With John there was the Spirit and the attracting power.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>Therefore, as Luke 1:16 says, he turned many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>The Lord here is the equivalent of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>The fact that John turned many of the Israelites to the Lord indicates that the nation of Israel had turned away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>If they had not turned away from Him, they would not have needed John the Baptist to turn them back.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>Even those priests who served God in the temple by lighting the lamps and burning the incense had turned from God and were far away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>Elsewhere in the New Testament we are told that many priests turned to God Acts 6:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>Thus, even the priests, the ones who served God, needed a turn to God.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>Therefore, John the Baptist was used to turn many to the Lord.</S>
