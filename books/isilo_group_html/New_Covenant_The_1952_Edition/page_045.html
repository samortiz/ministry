<p>We have spoken a great deal concerning the characteristic of the new covenant. But to really know and understand it, we must have the revelation and the illumination of the Holy Spirit. We must remember that the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life (2 Cor. 3:6). The Lord said: &ldquo;It is the Spirit Who gives life; the flesh profits nothing&rdquo; (John 6:63). Apart from the Holy Spirit nothing can quicken man.</p>
<p>The new covenant is a great grace; it is very rich and most glorious. Therefore, we need to ask God to give us faith. What is faith? Hebrews 11:1 says, &ldquo;Now faith is the substantiating of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.&rdquo; This is the definition of faith in the Scripture. What is the meaning of substance? In the Greek language it means a foundation, a standing, or a supporting ground. For example, if we put a book on the bookshelf, it is the bookshelf which is holding the book. Or, if we sit on a chair, it is the chair which supports us.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;conviction&rdquo; has the sense of proving, which has the nature of a verb. Faith upholds the things we hoped for, allowing our heart to be at rest. The faith within can prove the unseen things to us, so that our heart can say &ldquo;amen&rdquo; to the words which God has spoken. Faith is the foundation or supporting ground which holds the things we hoped for; faith is the proof of things unseen. Second Corinthians 1:20 says: &ldquo;For how many soever be the promises of God, in him is the yea: wherefore also through him is the Amen, unto the glory of God through us.&rdquo; Therefore, we do not look at ourselves but unto Him, Christ. His blood is the base of the new covenant. He has bequeathed to us the entire spiritual inheritance, and He is also the Executor of the testament, or will. What can be more secure than this?</p>
<p>God is faithful (Heb. 10:23). God&rsquo;s faithfulness is the guarantee of His promises, and the guarantee of His covenant (Deut. 7:9; Psa. 89:33-34). If we do not believe, we commit an offense against God&rsquo;s faithfulness and consider Him to be a liar. Therefore, whenever we find it difficult to believe, on the one hand, we need to condemn the unbelief as sin and ask the Lord to remove the evil heart of unbelief (Heb. 3:12); on the other hand, we need to look away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of faith (Heb. 12:2). Since the Lord has created the initial faith in us (Eph. 2:8; 1 Tim. 1:14; 2 Pet. 1:1), we believe that He will also bring this faith to perfection. Oh, blessed and glorious new covenant! Let us not be too late in believing. We have repented and shed tears many times because we are so poor. We must admit that we have limited God too much and are too far short of the standards of the new covenant.</p>
<p>Many times, brothers and sisters, it is not that we do not seek, but that we seek in the wrong way. This is a shame. We are too much in the letter and too much dependent upon ourselves. For this reason we struggle and strive. The result is only a sigh of pain. The following hymn will help remind us not to seek further in the wrong way.</p>
<p class="hbody">It is not by struggling,<br />
But by yielding all,<br />
I may rest from labor,<br />
All my burden fall.<br />
It is not resolving,<br />
But Thyself to heed,<br />
I&rsquo;m from sin delivered<br />
And from bondage freed.</p>
<p class="hbody">It is not by letter,<br />
 But by Spirit &rsquo;tis,<br />
I will be approved,<br />
 Share Thy life of bliss.<br />
It is not man&rsquo;s teaching,<br />
 But anointing Thine,<br />
Which imparts Thy light and<br />
 Fellowship divine.</p>
<p class="hbody">It is not resolving<br />
 Now to run the race,<br />
But &rsquo;tis by Thy mercy<br />
 I receive Thy grace.<br />
It is not by knowledge,<br />
 But by grace alone,<br />
I can pass through suff&rsquo;ring<br />
 To Thine image grown.</p>
<p class="hbody">Not by lofty phrases,<br />
 But by power Thine,<br />
I the lost can pilot<br />
 Unto life divine.<br />
It is not my wisdom,<br />
 But Thy Spirit, Lord,<br />
Which alone can fit me<br />
 To fulfill Thy Word.</p>

<p>In closing, let us exercise our heart to read two passages of Scripture and so express our deep longing and our heart&rsquo;s desire. The first is Hebrews 13:20-21 which says: &ldquo;Now the God of peace Who brought up from among the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of an eternal covenant, equip you in every good work for the doing of His will, doing in us that which is well-pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ, to Whom be the glory forever and ever, Amen.&rdquo; The second passage is Ephesians 3:20-21: &ldquo;But to Him Who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us, to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations of the age of the ages. Amen.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_044.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>New Covenant, The (1952 Edition) &nbsp; pg 45</div><br></body></html>
