   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verses 5b to 7 say, "Thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead: thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Just as before, "hair" signifies the power of consecration, while "teeth" signify the power of reception.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The temples or cheeks within the locks signify hidden beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The praise in these verses is the same as in 4:1-3.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But here we see two important facts:</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1 The Lord's love never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the maiden failed through her delay and feels that she has sinned through falling into darkness, the Lord treats her just the same as before.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to remove her doubt that He may have changed, He reveals Himself to her with the same words.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What a believer most often lacks after a failure is the assuring faith; it is easy for him to develop a wrong evaluation of his relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We often do not realize how full of doubts we are.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, the Lord uses the same words; He does this to remove our doubts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2 Many spiritual experiences need to be repeated even after a believer has reached a higher stage of attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just as it is necessary to have separating consecrations, the power of reception, and a hidden life at the time of immaturity, the same things are necessary at the time of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some spiritual experiences can change as you progress.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But other spiritual experiences, such as those mentioned here, do not change as you progress.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These experiences take on a deeper significance at a higher stage.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Have we not experienced many repeated lessons in our own spiritual journey?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Are not the lessons learned at the latter stage more perfect than those learned in the initial stage?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The experiences may be the same, but the level and degree are different.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 8 says, "There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All these people are related to Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the world, this may be evil, but spiritually, this presents a beautiful picture to those who understand spiritual types.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our Lord is gaining the whole church with all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Corporately speaking, the Lamb has only one wife.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But individually speaking, He has many lovers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some are like queens, some are like concubines, while others are like virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Adam, Isaac, and Moses all typify Christ marrying a corporate wife.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But Solomon typifies Christ taking individual believers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It seems that those who are holy and spiritual are not chosen as the type; rather, an unrighteous one is chosen as a type of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet the unrighteousness of the person is not typified.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A thief can be a type of the Lord, but only the act of stealing is typified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All those who have wisdom should understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The experiences of individual believers in their communication and relationship with the Lord's love are not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some are like queens, others are like concubines, and still others are like virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But whatever they are, they all have a love relationship with the King.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet none of them matches the maiden in her pursuit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 9 says, "My dove, my undefiled, is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here the Lord marks out the one from among all the people who satisfies His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord considers her as the unique one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This does not mean that there is only one person of her kind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Rather, it means that in the Lord's eyes, she can be considered as the unique one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She is absolutely in the Holy Spirit; hence, she is a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She is also fully separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, she is indeed "undefiled."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It seems as if she is the only perfect one begotten of grace, the only child of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It seems that among all the products of the work of grace, she is the most excellent one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Being a child of grace does not merely mean being one who experiences the forbearance of God and who is forgiven by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All of the works of God in man's heart are works of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Grace means that it is done by God and not by man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A person who receives more grace is one who allows God to work on him more, while a person who receives less grace is one who allows God to work on him less.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God has the grace, but man will not necessarily allow God to do all the works in him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everything that is of the self belongs to the law, and everything that is of God belongs to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The church is full of children of grace, yet only a very small number of people will allow grace to work on them to the point of perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Being the only child of grace does not mean that the maiden is the only one; it merely means that she is the most excellent one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The meaning of the only child is that there is an absolute union with the Lord, and that everything is the Lord's. She has reached a complete union with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"The daughters saw her, and blessed her."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although many believers realize that they are not absolute for the Lord, they know the ones who are absolute for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They have enough life within them to admire those who are absolute, even though they do not yet have enough life to be absolute for the Lord themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many people have enough experience of obedience to appreciate those who are absolutely obedient, even though they are not absolute in obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The daughters, queens, and concubines may not admire the maiden in the fleshly sense, but they cannot help but acknowledge the blessedness of the maiden with respect to the grace she has received.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A life within the veil and everything within man that is from God should be held in high esteem.</S>
