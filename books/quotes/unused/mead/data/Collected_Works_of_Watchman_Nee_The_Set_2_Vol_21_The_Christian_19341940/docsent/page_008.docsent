   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Chapter one, verse 21 says, "Because though they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God or thank Him, but rather became vain in their reasonings, and their heart, lacking understanding, was darkened."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"They" refers to men in general.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Men know that God is God, but they do not want to call God God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They know God, but they do not glorify Him as God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the other miscellaneous sins are not the underlying sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the miscellaneous sins come from one unique sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because men do not consider God to be God, their understanding is darkened.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once the understanding is darkened, all the other sins follow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 24 says, "Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, so that they dishonor their bodies among themselves."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"Therefore" means that this is a continuation of the preceding verses.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because men changed God's glory into the likeness of idols, God gave them up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Consequently, they act in uncleanness according to the lusts of their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Please remember that man's first sin was not his acting in uncleanness according to the lusts of his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first sin was not his dishonoring his own body among other men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first sin of man was his being wrong with God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once man develops a problem with God, all the subsequent sins follow.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today we think that lying, pride, jealousy, fornication, murder, and arson are sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually they are all symptoms of a sickness; they are not the sickness itself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who deal only with the symptoms are not good doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A good doctor is one who prescribes medicine according to the actual sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man's unique sin is being wrong with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 25 says, "Who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshipped and served the creation rather than the Creator."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This shows that man has become more and more wrong with God, and is further and further away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 26 says, "Therefore God gave them up..."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word "therefore" again shows that this verse is a continuation of what preceded it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the second mention of God giving them up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The sins have multiplied by now: "God gave them up to passions of dishonor."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man commits these sins because he has not worshipped the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These sins are the fruits; they are not the root.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 28 says, "And even as they did not approve of holding God in their full knowledge, God gave them up to a disapproved mind, to do the things which are not fitting."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the third mention of God giving them up.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Following this, more sins are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verses 29 through 32 say, "Being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; whisperers, slanderers, hateful to God, insolent, arrogant, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, senseless, faithless, affectionless, merciless; who, though fully knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but also have fellow delight in those who practice them."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How did these sins come about?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They came about because men "did not approve of holding God in their full knowledge."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man sins because he purposely refuses to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Man sins because there is a problem between him and God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once the relationship between man and God is wrong, all other sins will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man's unique sin is being wrong with God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The only question today is whether or not there is a problem between you and God, and whether your relationship with God is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first man sinned because he ate of the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There was no murder, arson, lying, pride, fornication, or jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>None of these sins appeared there.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There was only one sin at the beginning, which was his having a wrong relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God asked man, "Where are you?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Alas, man is no longer in his original position.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His position is wrong; his relationship with God is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, thousands and millions of sins are produced.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not think that you are all right just because you have dealt with smaller sins.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you ask a man if he is a sinner, he may answer that he has not committed many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But I would ask all these "sinless" sinners, "What is your relationship with God?"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am not asking about your relationship with your brother, wife, or children.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am not asking about your relationship with your friends and colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I am asking about your relationship with God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From the beginning, Cain was not accepted by God because he was standing on the wrong ground.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He did not lose God's favor after he killed his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather, he killed his brother because he had lost God's favor.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Abel gained God's favor and did not kill his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only those who are accepted by God have the ability to not commit subsequent sins.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There was another man who fought with his brother even before he was out of his mother's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He was truly a very wicked person.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He deceived his father, uncle, and brothers-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He did whatever it took to benefit himself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was a morally evil person.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Who was this person?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He was Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>His brother Esau was a straight and honest man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although Esau wanted to kill his brother in his anger, he let him go once he saw that his brother had humbled himself before him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Esau was a nice man, yet God was not pleased with him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Although Jacob was evil, he had a proper relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Although his methods were wrong, his goal was right.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He wanted the covenant which God had established with Abraham and Isaac, and he cared for the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God's establishment of a covenant with Abraham and Isaac meant that they had established a proper relationship with God, and Jacob wanted this.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What about Esau?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He appeared to be a gentleman and was willing to give in on everything.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But he was cut off from God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He did not care for his relationship with God, and he belittled his place before God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Therefore, he lost the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Although Jacob was wicked, his relationship with God was proper.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I must confess one thing before all of you.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There are many believers who are morally less honorable than unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But I can testify one thing for them, which I cannot testify for the unbelievers: their relationship with God is right.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Friends, you may be courteous, and you may do things correctly; others may commend you.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But I have to ask you one thing: what is your relationship with God?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Perhaps other believers are not as moral as you, but they are better than you in one thing: their relationship with God is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Their conscience is bold before God, and they can come boldly before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is very precious.</S>
