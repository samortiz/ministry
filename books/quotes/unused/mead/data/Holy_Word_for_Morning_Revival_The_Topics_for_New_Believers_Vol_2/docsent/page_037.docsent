   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 13 DAY 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psa 145:13 Your kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and Your dominion is throughout all generations.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 3:3 ...Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus far in the past five weeks ...we have covered five major items : God, Christ, the Spirit, the believers, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now we come to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Kingdom of God God s Reign in a General Way</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first aspect of the kingdom is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The kingdom of God is God s reign in a general way over the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This general way of God s reign is the way of authority and power.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God rules the heavens, the earth, all created things, and man in a general and objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The kingdom of God as God s reign in a general way is from eternity past to eternity future Heb 1:8; Psa 145:13; Dan 4:3b .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because the kingdom of God is the reigning of God, it follows God s existence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God s existence is from eternity to eternity, without beginning or ending.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, God s reigning, God s kingdom, is also from eternity to eternity, without beginning or ending.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible reveals that the kingdom of God embraces a wide scope comprising seven items .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It embraces eternity without beginning before the foundation of the world, the paradise of Adam, the chosen patriarchs, the nation of Israel in the Old Testament Matt 21:43 , the church in the New Testament Rom 14:17 , the coming millennium Rev 20:4, 6 , and the new heaven and new earth without end for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>227 Since the kingdom is one of the most complicated subjects in the Bible, the chart on pages 220 and 221 will be a great help to our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>228</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God s Reign in a Particular Way</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Genesis 1 says that God created man in His own image and that He gave man the authority to rule all the created things v. 26 ....If we are to have the full image of God to express God and to realize the full authority to represent God, to subdue His enemy, to subdue this earth, God Himself must be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>229 Hence, the kingdom of God is also God s reign in a particular way in the sense of life....The Lord s word to Nicodemus in John 3 reveals God s reign in the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 3 the Lord says, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be born anew, to be regenerated, is to have a new birth that brings in a new life....Every kingdom has a particular kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The plants in the plant kingdom have the plant life, and the animals in the animal kingdom have the animal life....From the Lord s word to Nicodemus we can see that, if we human beings would know the things of the divine kingdom, we need another life, the divine life, God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the kingdom of God as the reign of God is a divine realm to be entered into, a realm which requires the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only the divine life can realize the divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was the reason the Lord said to Nicodemus, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God v. 5 . Hence, to see, or to enter into, the kingdom of God requires regeneration with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>230</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The kingdom of God in the sense of life is actually Christ Himself Luke 17:21 as the seed of life sown into His believers, God s chosen people Mark 4:3, 26 , and developing into a realm in which God may rule as His kingdom in His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Its entrance is regeneration John 3:5 , and its development is the believers growth in the divine life 2 Pet 1:3-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is the church life today in which the faithful believers live Rom 14:17 , and it will develop into the coming kingdom as an inheritance reward Gal 5:21; Eph 5:5 to the overcoming saints in the millennium Rev 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually, it will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God, an eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God s eternal life for all God s redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity Rev 21:1-4; 22:1-5, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>231</S>
