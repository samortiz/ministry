<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. ONLY JEHOVAH BEING GOD<br>AND BEING ABLE TO SAVE</H2><P>Only Jehovah is God, and only He is able to save. Regarding this, 46:9 says, "Remember the former things of old,/That I am God and there is no one else;/I am God and there is no one like Me." Only after they were captives in Babylon did the people of Israel realize that only Jehovah is God. This captivity proved to them that all the idols are powerless, useless, and unable to do anything, and that only Jehovah, the God whom their forefathers worshipped, is the genuine God. He alone is able to save.</P><P>In verse 11 we are told that Jehovah is the One "who calls for a bird of prey from the east,/And from a distant land a man to be His counselor./Indeed, I have spoken; surely I will bring it to pass./I have purposed; surely I will do it." This man as a bird of prey from a distant land was Cyrus (typifying Christ) to be Jehovah's counselor (to carry out Jehovah's counsel&#151;John 6:38). Cyrus was the "bird of prey" called by God to subdue the nations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. JEHOVAH'S LOVE TOWARD HARDHEARTED ISRAEL</H2><P>Chapter forty-six also reveals Jehovah's love toward hardhearted Israel (vv. 3-4). No matter how bad the people of Israel were, God still loved them. Verses 12 and 13 say, "Listen to Me, O hardhearted ones,/Who are far from righteousness./I will bring My righteousness near&#151;it is not far off;/And My salvation will not delay;/And I will give salvation in Zion,/And to Israel My glory."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT<br>ON BABYLON FOR THE SAKE OF ISRAEL</H2><P>In 47:1-6 we have Jehovah's judgment on Babylon for the sake of Israel. Verse 4 is the prophet's declaration: "Our Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts is His name,/The Holy One of Israel." According to verse 8, Babylon, a lover of pleasure, says in her heart, "I am, and there is no one besides me;/I will not dwell as a widow,/And I will not know loss of children." But verse 9 says that two things will come upon Babylon suddenly, in one day: loss of children and widowhood. This will come upon her in spite of the multitude of her sorceries and the great power of her spells. Verse 14 and 15 go on to say, "Behold, they are like stubble;/Fire consumes them;/They cannot deliver themselves/From the power of the flame;/There is no coal for warming themselves,/Nor the light of a fire to sit before./So will those with whom you have labored be to you,/Those who have traded with you from your youth;/Each one will wander off in his own direction;/There will be no one to save you." All this is to make Babylon nothing and to cause nothing to be profitable to her.</P>
