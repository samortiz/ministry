God is God, yet He made Himself a man and lived a human life exactly the same as man in the human nature and the human life
First, God created man in such a way that man had His image outwardly and had a spirit inwardly to contact and receive God
God became a man and accomplished redemption to solve all the problems between God and man and release the divine life
They consider regeneration 'the turning over of a new leaf,' the changing of the past to make it something new
Don't be a husband anymore; don't be a wife anymore; don't be a father or mother anymore; and don't be a son or daughter anymore
Whatever we do, we need to remember that whereas formerly we lived by ourselves, now we no longer live alone, but God lives together with us
Brothers and sisters, it does not matter whether you are old or young, or whether you are a first-time hearer of my speaking
God wants us to receive Him, be filled and saturated with Him, and be permeated by Him, that we may have a metabolic change
Some brothers and sisters might have heard and declared this, but within them they may have a question mark concerning it
Not long afterward the church was distracted from the vision concerning this truth and the economy of God and became more and more degraded
Today when we speak about man becoming God, people generally feel uncomfortable with it and find it difficult to accept
God's highest purpose is attained through the unlimited dispensing of the processed and consummated Triune God
When God the Father gives us the Son He gives us He dispenses into us His divine life that we may be regenerated and become children of God
The old creation becomes the new creation; sinners who were enemies become children of God; and the dead become the organic Body of Christ
Many of you came from faraway places to attend this conference, but when you go to see the Grand Canyon, you forget everything
After the dispensing in regeneration, we first need God to dispense His life element continuously into our spirit by the Holy Spirit
If you have been renewed, people can sense that you have the 'flavor' of God and you also have the spiritual understanding
Unfortunately, because of the work of the enemy, today's Christianity has nearly annulled the prayer faculty of the believers
Prayer enables us to be joined to the Spirit and to absorb the Spirit that the divine element may spread within us
When an oyster is wounded by a grain of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the grain of sand and makes it into a pearl
On one hand, God already loved us in eternity , but on the other hand, we who were dead in our offenses and sins were not worthy to be loved
We believers have been redeemed to be God's inheritance through Christ's dispensing and are taking the lead to be headed up in Christ
On one hand, the Holy Spirit is a seal in us to mark us out, and on the other hand, He is in us doing the work of anointing
In the dispensing of Christ we become God's inheritance, but in the Spirit's sealing God becomes our inheritance
Especially in our speaking and in our temper we very much need to continuously experience the gentle detailed dispensing of the Spirit in us
With regard to our stubbornness and wrangling, the Holy Spirit does not fly away like a dove but remains in us grieving
We should not grieve the Holy Spirit, so that He may freely carry out His sealing within us until our body is redeemed
We have the seal of God in us, so we need to walk by the Spirit, especially in relation to our speaking and our temper
God will be not only in our mind, emotion, and will, but even in our speaking, our move, and our actions, from our head to our feet
The general subject of this conference is 'The Dispensing, Transformation, and Building of the Processed Divine Trinity in the Believers'
They think that since God has regenerated them, He is doing nothing now but waiting in them until they go to heaven
If we read the entire New Testament we will discover that this God who is in us is busier today than when He was on the earth
When He was on the earth He only preached the gospel taught the truth opened the eyes of the blind raised the dead and trained the disciples
Whereas the outward change can be accomplished by human work, the inward transformation must be a matter that is absolutely organic
These two trees indicate two principles: one, the simple principle of life, and the other, the complicated principle of good and evil
In his thinking there is no longer any element of life; rather his thinking is full of the concept of the knowledge of good and evil
He considered himself a good man because he robbed the rich to help the poor for the carrying out of heavenly justice
Unfortunately, even today's Christianity has taken in this principle and has thus fallen into the realm of the knowledge of good and evil
The principle of God is the principle of life, and the purpose of God is for man to have a change in life from within
Transformation is to change people in their essence to make them the new creation of God's desire according to His divine essence
There are the Father's dispensing through regeneration and His dispensing through the renewing by the Holy Spirit
How much we have been transformed determines how much building there is, because transformation itself equals building
Without regeneration and renewing we cannot experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in redemption and through sealing
The dispensing of the Divine Trinity through regeneration and renewing is the foundation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity
It is in redemption, that is, in the Beloved, that we experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in our inward parts
Although it rained for only forty days, even if it had rained for forty years, Noah would still have been very safe
The Father dispenses His life and nature, the Son dispenses His element, and the Spirit dispenses His essence, with which He seals us
When you remain in the sealing of the Holy Spirit, you take Christ as your person; then when you live, it is no longer you but Christ
If you live in the present age in a careless and loose manner, you will not be able to participate in the best rapture
Not only so, in the church life and for the building we need to remain continually in the sealing of the Holy Spirit
Sometimes friction exists among the brothers and sisters because there is not the willingness to apologize to others
In the church life it is very necessary for the brothers and sisters to love one another and to forgive one another
Not only so, 2 Corinthians 3:18 says that when we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, we are being transformed into the same image
The genuine building is the Triune God building Himself into the believers through the transformation of the believers
We might have believed in the Lord for a long time yet we still might not have allowed the Triune God to dispense Himself sufficiently in us
Eventually, by our dwelling in Him and His dwelling in us, He and we become one; that is, God becomes man and man becomes God
Thank the Lord that today we are living in the reality of the New Jerusalem to build the Body of Christ for the New Jerusalem
The burden of this conference is very mysterious, especially the main point on God becoming man and man becoming God
The One who is God yet man dwells in the one who is man yet God, and the one who is man yet God dwells in the One who is God yet man
Eventually, in the universe the divine glory as the eternal expression of God will be manifested brightly in man
