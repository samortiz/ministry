   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENCOURAGED AND ESTABLISHED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 17 Paul says, speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ and God the Father, "Encourage your hearts and establish you in every good work and word."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we want God to encourage us, we need to encourage ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we help ourselves, God will help us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But if we do not help ourselves, God will not help us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you are not willing to eat the food on the dining table, others cannot help you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if you eat, everyone will be willing to help you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is an illustration of the fact that we need to encourage ourselves and establish ourselves, and then God will encourage and establish us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>PRAYING FOR THE MINISTERS OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 3:1 Paul says, "For the rest, brothers, pray concerning us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as it is also with you."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For the word of the Lord to be glorified is for the divine riches contained in the word of the Lord to be released and expressed in the believers' living.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all need to learn how to let the word of the Lord run and how to cause the word of the Lord to be glorified in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 2 says, "And that we may be delivered from improper and evil men; for not all hold the faith."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The ministers of the word of God need such a prayer for them by the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>GUARDED FROM THE EVIL ONE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verse 3 Paul declares, "But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are guarded by eternal encouragement and good hope 2:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only the eternal life can guard us from the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The whole world lies in the evil one 1 John 5:19 , but the divine life with which we have been born of God keeps and guards us from him 1 John 5:18, 4; 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have a part within us that has been regenerated, born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That part, which is actually the Lord Himself, always guards us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE APOSTLES' CONFIDENCE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 4 Paul goes on to say, "We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that what we charge, you both are doing and will do."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The charge here is like those in 1 Thessalonians 4:2-4, 9-12; 5:11-22; 2 Thes 2:2, 15; 3:6, 10, 12-15.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE LORD DIRECTING THE BELIEVERS' HEARTS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 5 Paul concludes, "And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the endurance of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord directs our hearts by the leading of the Spirit, through whom the love of God has been poured out into our hearts Rom 8:14; 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The love of God in this verse is our love toward God that issues from the love of God 1 John 4:19 that has been poured out into our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the positive side, we need to enjoy the love of God so that we may love Him in order to live for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the negative side, we need to participate in the endurance of Christ so that we may endure the sufferings as He did to stand against Satan, the enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 2:13 3:5 Paul once again touches faith, love, and hope.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This indicates that 2 Thessalonians is a continuation of 1 Thessalonians.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This portion of 2 Thessalonians is a conclusion of Paul's writings to new believers concerning the basic structure of the Christian life for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we have pointed out, this basic structure includes faith, love, and hope.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By faith we have been saved into sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have been called unto the obtaining of the Lord's glory, and we have eternal encouragement, which is eternal life, and also good hope in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now according to 3:5, we need the Lord to direct our hearts into the love of God and into the endurance of Christ.</S>
