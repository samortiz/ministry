An example is Francis Cormier, who was very knowledgeable and who had some understanding of the creeds and church history. After reading The New Cults by Walter Martin, he wrote to Martin to point out his error and also sent me a copy of that letter. In the letter he said, \u201cI never met Witness Lee nor any of the believers associated with him. I read his name once, associated with Watchman Nee...We feel a gross injustice has been made against this brother in the Lord...This further saddened us for it was obvious that your researchers didn\u2019t have a clue of what Witness Lee was trying to teach believers...As a group, for the past three years, we have been studying some of Watchman Nee\u2019s books...As we read your comments and quotes concerning Witness Lee\u2019s standards and beliefs, we recognised some of Watchman Nee\u2019s teachings. If your researchers had in the least been familiar with Brother Nee\u2019s books, they would have recognised and seen what Brother Lee was trying to teach...I would suggest that you read with an open mind, not with the mind of a fault-finding researcher, Watchman Nee\u2019s books, and you will understand what Witness Lee\u2019s work is all about\u201d (see Appendix). His letter was extremely well written; I hope that you can read it in a good way. Later, the brothers invited him to attend the conferences, and the fellowship went fairly well.

Brother Francis Cormier, who spoke out with a strong sense of justice, was outside of the Lord\u2019s recovery. He had never seen me or read my books; he had only read Brother Nee\u2019s books. Nevertheless, with very clear light he saw through the misquotations and quasi-quotations of my writings and through the condemning words in the book entitled The New Cults. However, Brother X, who had been working among us for many years, not only failed to see any light, but he even sided with Christianity to attack me, saying that my speaking about the Son being the Father and Christ being the Spirit was heresy. He ignored the fact that I was not the one who started the speaking about the Son being the Father and Christ being the [436] Spirit; Brother Nee spoke about it several decades earlier. Brother Nee had at least three hymns on this subject, and we have these hymns in our hands. Why did no one say that this was heresy while Brother Nee was still living? Why did it become heresy when I continued to speak about this after Brother Nee passed away? I do not understand. "}]}
