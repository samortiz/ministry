[1]  The Conclusion of the New Testament #295-305 CONTENTS
[2]  295: Experiencing and Enjoying Christ in the Epistles 1
[3]  These verses say, Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, a called apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.
[4]  The entire book from chapter 1, which concerns the person of Jesus Christ the God-man and the righteousness of God, to chapter 16, which concerns the local churches as the expression of the Body of Christ is the gospel, the good news and glad tidings 10:15 , of God to men in its completeness.
[5]  The gospel of God is thus God s entire New Testament economy, and the center of this gospel of God is Jesus Christ the God-man.
[6]  His name is Jesus, His title is Christ, and He is our Lord.
[7]  In His resurrection Christ in His humanity was designated the Son of God, not in mere word but in power according to the Spirit of holiness.
[8]  No doubt the divine power was very much exercised in His resurrection, yet we need to see that the divine power in which Christ s humanity was designated the Son of God is the power of life.
[9]  The phrase in power in Romans 1:4 corresponds with 1 Peter 3:18, which says that Christ s flesh was put to death, but His Spirit was made alive.
[10]  Then in His resurrection God the Spirit as Christ s divinity was enlivened with the new power of life to put divinity into the humanity of Christ to make it divine.
[11]  In other words, before Christ s resurrection, Christ s humanity was merely human, but in Christ s resurrection, the Spirit was made strong to impart divinity into His humanity to make it divine.
[12]  Romans 3:22-24 reveals that we may enjoy and experience Christ as the Redeemer: Even the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ to all those who believe, for there is no distinction; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being justified freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.
[13]  Romans 3:25 tells us that God set forth Christ as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred.
[14]  Therefore, upon this sin-covering lid God could meet with the people who broke His righteous law, and He could do this governmentally without any contradiction to His righteousness, even under the observing of the cherubim that bore His glory and overshadowed the lid of the Ark. Thus, the problem between man and God was appeased, enabling God to forgive and be merciful to man and thereby to give His grace to man.
[15]  2 God s Setting Forth of Christ as the Propitiation Place
[16]  God began to set forth Christ as the propitiation place at the time that darkness came over the whole land during His crucifixion, when He offered Himself as the unique sacrifice for sin, the reality of the sin offering Luke 23:44; Heb 9:26 .
[17]  After the Lord s resurrection, God received Christ into the heavens and placed Him at His right hand.
[18]  God set forth Christ through the entire process of His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, in which He sat down at the right hand of God.
[19]  God placed Christ, set forth Christ, as the propitiation place from the time that Christ shed His blood to the time that He ascended to sit at the right hand of God.
[20]  The Factor of Our Justification a. Delivered on the Cross because of Our Offenses
[21]  In Romans 4:25 we see that Christ is the factor of our justification: Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification.
[22]  This means that because we have offenses against God, Christ was delivered on the cross for us in order to satisfy God s righteous requirements.
[23]  In Romans 5:1-2 Christ is presented as our peace toward God and as our access into God s grace: Therefore having been justified out of faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand and boast because of the hope of the glory of God.
[24]  In Romans 5:8-9 Paul says, God commends His own love to us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[25]  In Romans 5:15b-21a Christ is presented as the one man through whom we receive the grace of God and the gift in grace for our justification that we may have life and reign in life.
[26]  On the cross Christ obeyed God even unto death Phil 2:8 .
[27]  Verse 5 says, For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection.
[28]  Romans 6:5 also indicates that we will grow with Christ also in the likeness of His resurrection.
[29]  When we were baptized, we grew together with Christ in the likeness of His death; now, through His death we are growing into His resurrection.
[30]  Just as the element of Christ s death is found only in Him, so the element of Christ s resurrection is found only in Christ Himself.
[31]  with HimThat the Body of Sin Might Be Annulled,
[32]  Our old man has been crucified to the law through the body of Christ that we might marry another husband, Christ, who has been raised from among the dead.
[33]  In Romans 7:4b, Paul says, That you might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God.
[34]  This joining indicates that in our new status as a wife, we have an organic union in person, name, life, and existence with Christ in His resurrection.
[35]  Romans 7:22 8:4 reveals Christ as the Emancipator who by the law of the Spirit of life delivers the wretched man from the law of sin and of death.
[36]  The first law is the law of God, which refers to the written law of God, the Ten Commandments v. 22 . The second law is the law of good in the believer s mind, that is, in his soul, which derives from the natural human life, that is, from man himself v. 23 . The law of good is in our good human nature created by God; it always desires to do good according to our conscience, which corresponds with the God-created human nature, enabling us to know what God justifies and what He condemns 2:14-15 . The third law is the law of sin in the believer s members 7:23 , that is, in his body, which derives from Satan, who as sin dwells in the believer s flesh.
[37]  Without Christ, or outside of Christ, he struggled according to the law in his mind to keep the law of God in order that he might please God, but he was totally defeated by the law of sin.
[38]  Paul had no condemnation because in Christ he did not need to keep the law of God by himself, an effort which produced self-condemnation; no condemnation, because in Christ he had the law of the Spirit of life, which is more powerful than the law of sin and which set him free from the law of sin; no condemnation now, not because of the redeeming blood of Christ which removed the objective condemnation of God but because of the law of the Spirit of life which brought in the freedom of the Spirit in his spirit and which broke through all his subjective condemnation; and no condemnation, because he was freed from both the law of God and the law of sin.
[39]  2 The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ
[40]  Romans 8:2 tells us that the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed us from the law of sin and of death.
[41]  Life is the content and issue of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the ultimate and consummate manifestation of the Triune God after His being processed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection and becoming the indwelling, life-giving Spirit, who is life to all the believers in Christ.
[42]  It is this law, not God or the Spirit, that works in us to deliver us from the working of the law of sin in our flesh and to enable us to know God and gain God and thereby live Him out.
[43]  Romans 8:9-11 presents Christ as the Spirit of Christ.
[44]  The Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself whom we can experience and enjoy.
[45]  a. Being the Spirit of God Who Dwells in Us
[46]  In Romans 8:9 Paul says, You are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.
[47]  This verse indicates that the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God who dwells in us that we may be in the spirit.
[48]  The Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ are not two Spirits but one.
[49]  This is the Spirit of Christ in resurrection, that is, Christ Himself dwelling in our spirit v. 10 to impart Himself, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, into us as resurrection life and power to deal with the death that is in our nature v. 2 . Thus, we may live today in Christ s resurrection, in Christ Himself, by living in the mingled spirit.
[50]  Romans 8:10 reveals that the Spirit of Christ is Christ in us to make our spirit life: If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness.
[51]  Romans 8:9b says, Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.
[52]  In other words, because we have the Spirit of Christ in us, we are of Christ.
[53]  If there were no Spirit of Christ, or if Christ were not the Spirit, there would be no way for us to be joined to Him and to belong to Him.
[54]  According to Romans 8:29, we have been predestinated to be conformed to the image of Christ, the Firstborn of God.
[55]  God has predestinated us not simply that we may be sanctified, spiritual, and victorious but that we may be fully conformed to the image of His Son.
[56]  The purpose of God s foreknowledge, predestination, and calling is to prepare and produce many brothers for His firstborn Son that, on the one hand, they, together with God s firstborn Son, may be the many sons of God with the divine life and nature for the expression of God, and that, on the other hand, they may be the many members who constitute the Body of God s firstborn Son as the corporate expression of God in His firstborn Son, which is the fullness of God s firstborn Son, that is, the fullness of God in His firstborn Son Eph 1:23; 3:19 .
[57]  In Romans 8:37 Paul tells us that in all the sufferings we more than conquer through Christ who loved us.
[58]  Because of God s unchanging love for us and the fact that Christ has accomplished everything on our behalf, neither tribulation nor persecution can suppress or defeat us; rather, in all these things we more than overcome and conquer through Him who loved us.
[59]  In Romans 8:38-39 Paul declares, For I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[60]  In God s salvation this love to us has become the love of Christ, which does many marvelous things for us through the grace of Christ until God s complete salvation is accomplished in us.
[61]  These chapters also show that this Christ who has the Godhead became a man as the seed of David, that He passed through the processes of human living, death, and resurrection, thereby accomplishing God s redemption and entering into God s glory, and that through these processes He was eventually consummated to become the Spirit of Christ, who is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of life, and the reality, the essence, of this wonderful Christ.
[62]  In summary, Christ as God was incarnated to be a man, and Christ in His humanity with flesh passed through the processes of death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit in order to be one spirit with us that we might be a part of His being as members of His wonderful Body.
[63]  OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED THREE EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST
[64]  Christ as a God-man became the life-giving Spirit, and we as men are one spirit with Him and thus may always enjoy Him 1 Cor 15:45b; 6:17 .
[65]  Since we have experienced Christ as God, we know Him as our Redeemer Gal 3:13 ; we know that His death is all-inclusive and eternally effective Heb 9:14 ; we know that as the infinite God mingled with a genuine man, He died for all men, especially for all His believers 1 Tim 2:6; 2 Cor 5:14-15 ; and we know that He is God over all, blessed forever Rom 9:5 .
[66]  He then points out that this means to bring Christ down and that this refers to Christ s incarnation, for Christ came down from the heavens in His incarnation.
[67]  In His incarnation, Christ as the Word brought the infinite God into the finite man, thereby mingling the Triune God with the tripartite man, that is, divinity with humanity Matt 1:20 .
[68]  After His death Christ as the Word descended into the abyss, Hades, and He ascended from that place in His resurrection so that those who receive Him by believing in Him may be justified by God and have His life.
[69]  Romans 10:9-13 reveals that Christ is the Lord.
[70]  Moreover, that Christ is rich to those who call upon Him reveals that God selects us, redeems us, justifies us, sanctifies us, conforms us, and glorifies us in Christ in order that we may enjoy His unsearchable riches in Christ Eph 3:8 .
[71]  Romans 10:9-10 says, That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation.
[72]  These verses show two steps of our being justified and saved: believing in the heart that God has raised Him from the dead and confessing Him with the mouth.
[73]  To believe with the heart is to believe in Christ, who was glorified and raised by God from the dead; to confess with the mouth is to confess that Jesus, who was despised and rejected by man, is Lord.
[74]  Our enjoyment of Christ by calling on His name with the exercise of our spirit is strong proof that God is now the Spirit, that our Lord Jesus Christ is also the Spirit, and that we have our regenerated spirit.
[75]  We are members one of another in Christ not in ourselves for Christ is both the element which makes us members one of another and the sphere in which we are members one of another.
