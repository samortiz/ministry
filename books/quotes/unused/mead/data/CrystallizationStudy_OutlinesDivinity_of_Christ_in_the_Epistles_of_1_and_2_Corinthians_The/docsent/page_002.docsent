   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message One In His Incarnation Christ is the complete God manifested in the flesh the Son with the Father by the Spirit 1 Tim 3:16: Christ is not merely one-third of God but the totality of God God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For Christ to be the complete God means that He is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The entire God, not only God the Son, was incarnated; hence, Christ in incarnation is the entire God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was manifested in the flesh not only as the Son but as the entire God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is the infinite God becoming a finite man: In His incarnation Christ brought the infinite God into the finite man: God is infinite and man is finite, yet in Christ the two became one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is truly wonderful and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the One who is both the infinite God and a finite man, Christ is mystical John 3:13.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ s bringing the infinite God into the finite man is something divine and mystical, for it is a matter in the divine and mystical realm.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is the Word, who was God, becoming flesh John 1:1, 14: The God who the Word is, is not a partial God but the entire God God the Son, God the Father, and God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Word is God s definition, explanation, and expression; therefore, the Word who became flesh God manifested in the flesh is God s definition, explanation, and expression in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence for the union, mingling, and incorporation of the Triune God with the tripartite man: He was conceived of the Holy Spirit, having the essence of God Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18, 20: All three of the Godhead the Father, the Son, and the Spirit joined and participated in this conception.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Father s divine essence was mingled with the human essence by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From such a conception and birth we can see the three of the Divine Trinity in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Union concerns oneness in life; mingling is related to the divine and human natures; and incorporation denotes persons coinhering in each other.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ in His incarnation is the incorporation of the Triune God with the tripartite man John 14:10-11: God in His Divine Trinity is an incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The three of the Divine Trinity are incorporated into one incorporation by Their mutual indwelling and by Their mutual work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In His incarnation the second of the Divine Trinity brought this incorporation into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His name was called Mighty God and Eternal Father Isa 9:6: As the Child born to us He is the Mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the Son given to us He is the Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is Jesus, Jehovah the Savior, and Emmanuel, God with us: He was named Jesus by God Matt 1:21.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was called Emmanuel by man Matt 1:23.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily Col 2:9: All the fullness of the Godhead refers to the entire Godhead, the complete God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since the Godhead comprises the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the fullness of the Godhead must be the fullness of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily means that the Triune God is embodied in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all embodied in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For Christ in His incarnation to be the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead means that the fullness of the Triune God dwells in Him in a bodily form: This implies the physical body which Christ put on in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ as the One who has a human body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before Christ s incarnation the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the eternal Word but not bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From the time that Christ became incarnate, clothed with a human body, the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in Him in a bodily way, and in His glorified body Phil 3:21 now and forever it dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is the great I Am: As the infinite God Christ is the great I Am John 8:58.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am is the meaning of the name Jehovah Exo 3:14 , and Jehovah is the name of God Gen 2:7 , the One who is and who was and who is coming, the self-existing and ever-existing One Rev 1:4: This name is used in speaking of God in His relationship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For Christ to be I am means that He is the ever-existing God who has a relationship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Anyone who does not believe that Christ is I am will die in his sins John 8:24.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the Son of God in His divinity, Christ is the effulgence of God s glory and the impress of His substance Heb 1:3: The effulgence of God s glory is like the shining of the light of the sun, and the impress of God s substance is like the impress of a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Son is the shining, the brightness, of the Father s glory and the expression of what God the Father is God s substance .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is the mystery of God Col 2:2: As the mystery of God, Christ is the embodiment, definition, and expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Christ and by Christ as the mystery of God, the mysterious God is fully revealed: Embodied in Christ is all that God is and has and all that God has done, is doing, and intends to do.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because Christ is the mystery of God, if we know Christ, we know God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As the mystery of God, Christ is the key that opens to us the being of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through Christ we know God and are even brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is the only begotten Son of God to declare God John 1:18: According to His deity Christ is, and always will be, the only begotten Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As the only begotten Son Christ has an eternal relationship with the Father: The Father is the eternal source of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Son is the eternal expression of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In His incarnation the only begotten Son declared God by the Word, life, light, grace, and reality John 1:1, 4, 14, 17.</S>
