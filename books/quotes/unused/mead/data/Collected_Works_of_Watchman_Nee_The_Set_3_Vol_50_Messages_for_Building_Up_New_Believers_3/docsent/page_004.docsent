   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Games</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are many games, such as chess, ball games, and horse-riding, which can be considered proper activities, even though they contain the element of winning and losing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The element of winning and losing is related to skill.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is all right for children to engage in table-tennis, basketball, volleyball, riding, or chess.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All these are proper activities and do not involve any sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Parents should be generous toward these matters and should guide their children to the proper recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Elderly ones may not have time for strenuous sports, but they should not forbid the young ones from them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We want our children to set aside their time for the Lord, but we also need to take care of their need for diversion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should allow them some recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have mentioned four kinds of recreation: rest, a change in work, hobbies, and games.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A Christian can engage in these four kinds of recreation, but he should not be under the power of any of them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is wrong to be bound by any of them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The younger a believer is in the Lord, the more he has to be careful not to be bound.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This matter may not be a problem to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It may not make any difference to us whether or not we play the piano, but it makes a great difference to a new believer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His conscience will bother him every time he engages in these activities.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the beginning of the Christian life, the more one is involved in a recreation, the more he is bound by it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As soon as he experiences bondage in any activity, he should stop immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>C. The Purpose of Recreation Being</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>to Enhance One's Work</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Third, we must ask why we need recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The purpose of recreation is to enhance our work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Recreation has a purpose; it is not recreation for the sake of recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I do not engage in a ball game because I love ball games.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I play because I want to work better.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not sleep because I love to sleep but because I can work better after I sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I plant flowers not for the sake of planting flowers but so that I can work better after my gardening diversion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All of these things are for the purpose of enhancing our work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They must help us to serve God better.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some people break down mentally or physically after doing the same thing day and night for two or three weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such brothers and sisters should be allowed some kind of diversion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They can change their work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They can play the piano or engage in some ball games.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They should do these things only for the purpose of recovering from fatigue.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is altogether for the purpose of increasing one's efficiency.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After they are done with their recreation, they can work better and serve the Lord in a stronger way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes a person may take a respite in a rural place, as the Lord Jesus did, or travel and tour a little.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is also good.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He may play games with his children at home as well.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These activities are not entanglements; they are for the purpose of helping a person in his work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If an activity results in the lowering of one's performance, it is in the wrong principle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A recreation must always enhance a person's work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is easy to become tired after doing the same thing over and over again day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why one should jog, garden, or play for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not promote these things, but we acquiesce in them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The basic principle is that these activities must enhance our performance rather than frustrate it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Having a holiday after working for two or three months is right.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But having a holiday every day is laziness, not vacationing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A Christian must learn to work on earth and not be lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We allow people to have recreation for the purpose of increasing their work efficiency, but we must not give others any ground for criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not want to be extreme, and we do not want to bring shame to God's name.</S>
