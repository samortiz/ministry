<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE HISTORY CONCERNING SAUL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SAUL'S CONQUEST OF THE PHILISTINES</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Sam. 13&#151;14</H1><P>Saul first conquered the Ammonites, and then he conquered the Philistines, Israel's most difficult enemy. Both of these conquests gave Saul the opportunity to make a name for himself. In the first conquest he behaved in a kind, humble manner, but in the second conquest he behaved in a way that caused him to lose his kingship. As we will see, Samuel's intention, which was according to God's heart, was to build the kingdom of God on earth. Saul's intention was altogether in another realm. Saul intended to build a monarchy for himself within the kingdom of God. Saul thought that it was possible to have his own monarchy; actually, it was not possible. God had no intention to build anything for Saul.</P><P>Let us now consider the details regarding Saul's conquest of the Philistines.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. HIS PREPARATION FOR WAR<br>AGAINST THE PHILISTINES</H2><P>In 13:1-4, 6-7 we read of Saul's preparation for war against the Philistines.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. With the Assistance of His Son Jonathan</H2><P>In his preparation for war, Saul was assisted by his son Jonathan, who was quite good.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By Blowing a Trumpet to Gather the People</H2><P>Saul had learned that he needed people and he blew a trumpet to gather the people. Today's politicians also realize that they need to gain the people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Some of the People Hiding and Some Escaping</H2><P>Because some of the people were afraid of the Philistines, they hid themselves in caves and in pits, and some escaped into the land of Gad, east of Jordan.</P>
