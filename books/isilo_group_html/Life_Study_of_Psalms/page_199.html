The Psalmist's Enjoyment of God</H2><P>In verses 5 through 8 we have the psalmist's enjoyment of God. He declares that his soul is satisfied with the rich fatness and that when he remembers God while on his bed and considers Him in the night watches, his mouth praises God with lips of joyous shouting (vv. 5-6). In verses 7 and 8 the psalmist says, "For You have been my help,/And in the shadow of Your wings I will shout joyously./My soul pursues after You;/Your right hand upholds me." Here the most precious thing is the shadow of God's wings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Punishment of the Psalmist's Enemies</H2><P>In verses 9 through 11 the psalmist concludes by speaking concerning God's punishment of his enemies.</P><P>What do you find in this psalm that is of value? Perhaps you will point out the matter of seeking after God. Yes, we should have a heart to seek after God, but are you satisfied with this? In my opinion, this psalm is quite lacking in content.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIII. THE PSALMIST'S COMPLAINT<br>OF HIS ENEMY'S EVIL PLAN<br>AND GOD'S JUDGMENT ON THE EVILDOERS</H2><P>In Psalm 64 we have the psalmist's complaint of his enemy's evil plan and God's judgment on the evildoers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Psalmist's Complaint<br>of His Enemy's Evil Plan</H2><P>In verses 1 and 2 the psalmist asks God to hear the voice of his complaint, to preserve his life from the enemy's dread, and to hide him from the throng of evildoers. The evildoers have sharpened their tongue like a sword and have aimed their arrow, their bitter word, to shoot in secret places at the perfect man (vv. 3-4). The psalmist's use of the words "perfect man" indicates that he considers himself perfect, one who should not be hated by anyone. Then the psalmist goes on to speak of his enemies, saying, "They firm up an evil matter; /They plan to lay snares secretly;/They say, Who will see them?/They devise injustices, saying:/We have completed a carefully sought out plan./Indeed each man's inward thought /And heart is deep" (vv. 5-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. God's Judgment on the Evildoers</H2><P>In the next two verses, the psalmist proclaims God's judgment on the evildoers. "But God will shoot an arrow at them;/Suddenly they are wounded./They are made to stumble over each other by their own tongue;/All who see them shake their heads." The psalmist was surely happy about this.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_198.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_200.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 199</div><br></body></html>
