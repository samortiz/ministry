[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE SPECIFIC COORDINATION OF THE CHURCHES FOR PRACTICING THE NEW WAY Scripture Reading: Luke 19:9; Acts 10:22-24; 16:13-15, 29-34; 18:8; Rom 16:3-5; 1 Cor 1:16; 16:19; Col 4:15; Philem.
[3]  When we speak about the furtherance of the new way for the Lord's recovery, we mean that the only goal of our practicing the new way is to promote the Lord's recovery.
[4]  We can all see one fact: On the one hand, we must confess that we are feeble and small, short of knowledge, and weak in the testimony we live out; yet, on the other hand, we see that if we compare the Lord's recovery of the light of the truth and the condition of life among us with what is found among the majority of today's Christians, we can only bow our heads to worship and thank the Lord that due to His great mercy we have truly advanced in the matters of truth and life.
[5]  In summary, we can say that the truth among us today is unprecedented in richness.
[6]  THE FOCUS OF THE CHANGE IN SYSTEM THE HOUSEHOLD
[7]  Having an Average of One Out of Every Four Saints Go Out Door-knocking
[8]  This does not refer to the door-knocking which is to be carried out by the full-timers; rather, this means that in the seven days of one week, one out of every four saints should set aside two hours to go out door-knocking.
[9]  We must be clear, however, that when the church is about to move ahead, we cannot avoid having some who will blow cold wind or pour cold water on us because they think that it is of no use to gain new ones.
[10]  CHAPTER TWO PRACTICING THE NEW WAY IN THE LIGHT OF THE RECOVERY Scripture Reading: Matt 28:18-20; Acts 2:46; 5:42; 1 Tim 2:4; Eph 3:8-11 CHRISTIANITY MISSING GOD'S ECONOMY
[11]  Concerning God's divine economy, we must mention some history.
[12]  Today we must pay attention to the truth when we go out door-knocking.
[13]  After bringing people to be saved and baptized, we must set up meetings in their homes for the purpose of teaching them the truth and helping them to grow in life.
[14]  Therefore, as we are changing the system to practice the new way, there are four definite steps in our going out door-knocking from house to house: first, leading people to believe and be baptized; second, feeding and taking care of them by setting up meetings in their homes; third, teaching them the truth in their homes and at the same time ministering life to them; and fourth, bringing them into the full knowledge of the church and into the practical church life.
[15]  THE REAL GOSPEL CONCERNING THE ECONOMY OF THE MYSTERY OF GOD
[16]  In Ephesians 3:8-11 Paul said that although he was not a great apostle but was less than the least of all saints, he had received mercy and grace to announce to people the "unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel and to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages had been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church."
[17]  THE NEW WAY REVEALED BY GOD DELIVERING THE GOSPEL AND THE TRUTH TO PEOPLES' HOMES
[18]  NEEDING TO DEAL WITH PRIDE AND OPINION FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY
[19]  In 1984 when I received the burden to begin changing the system, I had the assurance inwardly because I knew what the Lord wanted.
[20]  Whenever there is a change in the way we do things, even if it is changing from an old way to a new way by getting rid of inappropriate things and building up the proper things, there will always be some who disagree.
[21]  We must clearly recognize that the burden and commission which we have received from the Lord are not just to go out door-knocking and to lead people to salvation.
[22]  CHAPTER THREE THE COMMISSION TO CARRY OUT THE NEW WAY THE COMMISSION OF GOD'S ECONOMY
[23]  The purpose of the practice of the new way is to practically carry out the gospel, truth, life, and the church, which God has commissioned us with.
[24]  Through more than sixty years of experience, during which we have carefully analyzed the practices of the Christian denominations and have studied the divine revelation again and again, we have found the way which is according to the Bible and ordained by God.
[25]  CARRYING OUT THE NEW WAY FOR THE LORD'S COMMISSION
[26]  If we want to carry out the gospel, truth, life, and the church, then we must rely on the Holy Spirit and the word of God, and we must pray with all prayer and petition while laboring diligently.
[27]  Now the Lord has given us a definite new way for accomplishing His commission to us, which is the way of door-knocking, visiting people, establishing home meetings, teaching the truth, and bringing people into the building up of the church.
[28]  This is due to the fact that door-knocking is not an easy matter, visiting people is not a simple thing, teaching the truth and ministering life are even more difficult, and bringing people into the Body of Christ to live together in the practical church life is the most difficult of all.
[29]  CHAPTER FOUR THE PROPER CHRISTIAN SERVICE THE SERVICE ACCORDING TO GOD'S WILL MAKING THE BELIEVERS INWARDLY SATISFIED
[30]  After I was saved, I really loved the Lord, and I especially loved His Word, to such an extent that the Bible never left my hands.
[31]  TESTIMONIES OF SERVING ACCORDING TO THE GOD-ORDAINED NEW WAY
[32]  There are two hundred fifty trainees from overseas, one hundred eighteen of whom have requested to stay in Taiwan.
[33]  The Lord has shown us that the church today is walking on an extraordinary, new way.
[34]  According to our concept, after baptism there needs to be some edification of the new believers; otherwise, the new ones will not be able to stand firm.
[35]  There is a practical and detailed way to do anything, and as long as we copy it exactly, studying and practicing according to the pattern, we will be able to do the thing in the right way.
[36]  Before we go out door-knocking, we must dress properly.
[37]  In conclusion, for many years in the church life we have been loving the Lord, attending meetings, serving in various areas, reading the Bible, and praying, but within us there has always been a feeling that something is lacking.
[38]  Now with the practice of the new way, we have been given the opportunity and the way to serve that can fill up our inward lack.
[39]  CHAPTER FIVE HOW TO CARE FOR NEW ONES THROUGH THE HOME MEETINGS
[40]  In this past year we have knocked on the doors of 150,000 households, and the number of people baptized through door-knocking is more than 5,700.
[41]  As far as we are concerned, the situation in Taipei a few years ago was just about the same.
[42]  We frequently had large meetings with just a few people doing everything.
[43]  TAKING THE HOME AS THE CENTER TO BRING IN THE FUNCTIONING OF ALL THE MEMBERS
[44]  The second step of the new way is leading the home meetings.
[45]  THE KEY TO LEADING THE HOME MEETINGS A Definite Goal Evangelizing the Entire Earth
[46]  There are some saints who are unable to go out door-knocking because they are elderly, but they are concerned about the effectiveness of practicing the new way.
[47]  Concerning praying, we should pray as soon as we enter the meeting and also lead others to pray; however, we should not pray in a routine or perfunctory way.
[48]  If we love the Lord and His word, if we are always filled with the Holy Spirit praying and singing livingly and crazily then when we go to lead the home meetings, we will certainly cause people to be supplied and to love the Lord.
[49]  If our concept is completely changed, if, according to the principle we set forth, we produce a full-timer for every twenty saints and a weekly door-knocker for every four saints, and if all the saints continue to support and give their all to preach the gospel house to house, then I believe that within three to five years we can produce a completely new generation.
[50]  CHAPTER SIX HOW TO TEACH THE NEW ONES IN THE HOME MEETINGS THE PROPER CHURCH LIFE BEING BUILT UP IN THE HOME MEETINGS
[51]  The Lord wants us to practice His ordained way with the ultimate result of bringing the church life completely into the homes.
[52]  RECEIVING A BURDEN TO CARE FOR AND NOURISH THE NEW ONES IN THE HOME MEETINGS
[53]  The first step for practicing the new way, the God-ordained way, is to knock on doors and bring people to be saved and baptized.
[54]  So far, we have knocked on the doors of more than one hundred thousand homes, baptized more than six thousand people, and set up approximately one thousand nine hundred home meetings with more than three thousand people meeting regularly.
[55]  Learning to Nourish as a Mother and Lead as a Father
[56]  When we go to lead a home meeting, we are not just attending a meeting but are leading and taking care of the new ones.
[57]  Fourth, when we go to lead the home meetings, we ourselves first must be the kind of person that we want them to be.
[58]  This means that if we lead the new ones to read the Bible and pray, yet we ourselves do not have the habit of reading the Bible and praying, then that is not acceptable.
[59]  If we tell new ones that the Lord today is the life-giving Spirit within them and that they should follow Him the Spirit in their spirit, then we ourselves must be such people those who live in the spirit every day and walk according to the Spirit.
[60]  In conclusion, if the church is to grow and prosper until it arrives at the condition of the early church in the Bible, in which saved ones were added to the church day by day, then we absolutely must bring the church life into the homes.
[61]  In the past, because we had a hard time breaking away from the influence of Christianity, we did not pay much attention to the form of our meetings.
[62]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THE NEW WAY SOME INSTRUCTIONS CONCERNING THE FURTHERANCE OF THE NEW WAY
[63]  There are a few matters which we must be clear about in the practice of the new way.
[64]  We have said that we must lead the home meetings properly so that the new ones will know the truth and grow in life.
[65]  We now have more than six thousand newly baptized ones and have set up two thousand home meetings, so it is just as if we have given birth to the babies and have set up a good environment to care for them.
[66]  In the same way, today when we gain people through door-knocking and establish meetings in their homes, if we do not have the proper way to feed them, they will all die prematurely in about three months.
[67]  The fourth practical step for the practice of the new way is to lead the new ones, who have been baptized, who have home meetings established in their homes, and who have been led to know the truth and pursue the growth in life, into the full knowledge of the church and into the practical church life.
[68]  This means that although the saints raised up by the local church have helped in door-knocking and in caring for home meetings, the new ones that they gain cannot remain only in the home meetings but need to be brought into the church life.
[69]  When we go out to lead the home meetings, teach the truth to the new ones, and lead them to grow in life, there will be a necessary process.
[70]  For example, some will be eager to learn what the church is, so we should take advantage of the opportunity to stir up their love for the Lord and the church and bring them to the church meetings.
[71]  In between the group meetings and the meetings in the meeting halls, we may need yet another level of meetings.
