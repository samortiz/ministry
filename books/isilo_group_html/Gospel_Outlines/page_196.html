<li>Jesus is the righteous One

	<li>Jesus is God coming as man.</li>
	<li>Jesus was born in holiness without the nature of sin.</li>
	<li>Jesus has never committed sin. Once He asked publicly, &ldquo;Who among you can prove that I have sinned?&rdquo; When He was examined before His crucifixion, no one could find sin in Him.</li>
	<li>Jesus is the sinless and the righteous One.</li>

<li>We are the unrighteous ones
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We are sinners.</li>
	<li>We were born in sin.</li>
	<li>We have committed sins and grew up in sin.</li>
	<li>We are altogether, one hundred percent sinners.</li>

	<li>Because He bore our sins and died for us on the cross, our sins are forgiven before God. Because He died for us, we can be delivered from death and can obtain eternal life.</li>
