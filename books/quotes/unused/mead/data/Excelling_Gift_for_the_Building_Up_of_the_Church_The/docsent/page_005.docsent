   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENDEAVORING TO GO ALONG WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO FULFILL 1 CORINTHIANS 14:26</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 14:26 says that whenever we come together, each one has something of the Lord to share with the other attendants in the meeting for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to ask where such a reality is on this earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This verse needs to be fulfilled and it will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Fifty years ago in 1937, Brother Nee saw this matter, and his fellowship was published in the book The Normal Christian Church Life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We did our best to find a way to practice this, but we did not get through.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1948 Brother Nee gave a four month training in which he released a particular series of messages that are contained in the book Church Affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this series of messages, he touched the truth of 1 Corinthians 14:26 again in a strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1984 I went back to Taiwan from the United States because I realized that we must have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Taiwan was the source of the Lord s recovery outside of mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After four years of study in Taipei, eventually I was led to this point 1 Corinthians 14:26.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must endeavor to do everything we can to go along with the Lord for the fulfillment of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This has been unveiled to me, so I cannot remain merely in my teaching during the past twenty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I must have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I must do my best to lead and to guide the saints into this new stage.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since 1 Corinthians 14:26 is a verse in the holy Word, it needs to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we would not pick up this burden, the Lord will go to others, and this will delay Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A small delay to Him, though, is inconsequential because to Him one thousand years are as one day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We will be the ones who will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We will miss His mark, His smile to us today, and His reward.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brother Nee saw this matter and spoke it to the saints, but they did not find a way to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then he spoke it a second time, but soon after that he was arrested and put into prison where he died after twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I believe that Brother Nee will surely be reckoned by the Lord as an overcomer, but if I am not faithful to carry out this vision, I feel that I will miss the mark, miss the reward, and receive a strong rebuke from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brother Nee spoke this to me and I saw it, so I must do something.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why I am so burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today is the day that the Lord is doing His work to fulfill 1 Corinthians 14:26.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By fulfilling this verse, He will be able to build up His Body organically and prepare His bride organically.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord s building work is organic, not organizational as in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must have a change.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Certain factories must change the machines that they use at certain intervals so that they can be up-to-date with the most recent technology.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Otherwise, they will be behind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must change our machines.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have pointed out in the past that no one can change the globe that we live on, but the means of transportation can be improved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man has progressed from the mule wagon to the 747.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We cannot change the truth, but we must change to the best and most scriptural way to carry out the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must change.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are too old in our way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The old way from tradition should be put away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We came into the Lord s recovery, but much of the tradition of Christianity followed us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am so burdened because I have seen a clear vision.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have the deep conviction that I have been commissioned by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If I do not release this burden for the fulfillment of 1 Corinthians 14:26, I am not faithful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have no choice before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Devil hates this way because he knows it puts him into the corner by building up the Body of Christ and preparing the bride for the coming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have the confidence that deep in our spirit there is an echo to this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have the full assurance that the Lord will raise up some faithful ones to fulfill 1 Corinthians 14:26 to bring in the reality of the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
