   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WATER FROM THE ROCK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eating the meat of the lamb marks the beginning of our life, while eating the manna is for the sustenance of life and growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since this is the case, drinking the water must mean the enjoyment of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Water signifies awakening, refreshment, and a kind of renewing power.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since water serves such a function, there is water in the wilderness as well as in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The meat of the lamb is for our life; it signifies the Christ who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The indwelling Christ requires the nourishment of the enthroned Christ before He has the strength to take the journey.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But if we only have these two things, there is not much enjoyment, and a Christian will have a long face all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He will live in a miserable way and murmur like the Israelites, who complained that they only had this coriander-seed-like food; it was so plain that they were tired of it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, one cannot get by without the water of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How did this water come?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Exodus 17:5 says that the first thing needed was the ancient rod.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible calls this the rod "wherewith thou smotest the river" Exo 17:5 ; it does not call it the rod of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This served to remind the Israelites of the story of the smiting of the Egyptian river.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The waters of Egypt became blood at the smiting of God's rod.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Blood denotes death, and this signifies that all the enjoyment and pleasure of Egypt were under God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All of the entertainment in this world is blood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many of these things were quite enjoyable to the Egyptians; they were as drinkable as water.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But to us, they are blood; we cannot draw pleasure from them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We could do certain things in the past, but now they have all been turned to blood.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why many people have said that being a Christian involves too much bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Does this mean that a Christian has no enjoyment at all?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They have enjoyment, but the nature of Christian enjoyment is different from that of the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is why God reminded them of the ancient rod.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have seen that we receive our life from Christ, and our life is sustained also by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But where does the enjoyment come from?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some mothers derive enjoyment from their children.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our enjoyment, however, comes from the rock smitten by the rod.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God told Moses to go up to Mount Horeb, which is one of the peaks of Mount Sinai, and He said, "Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink" v. 6 . Our water comes from the rock before God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First Corinthians 10 says that this rock is Christ v. 4 . The smiting of the rod signifies His death, and the outflow of water signifies the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our joy and enjoyment are found in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This joy is enough to compensate for all our loss.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this age of darkness, many times our feet are sore, our hands heavy, and we do not find any enjoyment at all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During these times, the joy from God will compensate for all of our loss.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Isaiah referred to the Lord as the One who grew up out of dry ground Isa 53:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Roots cannot grow in dry ground.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This shows us that the One the Lord trusted in was God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The world could not supply Him with anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The same is true with the world today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We thirst for water, but only find blood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even if we drink, we cannot quench our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, Christ is the living water; He can quench our thirst and satisfy us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today our God is standing on the mount.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is standing before the rock which has passed through death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, spiritual joy is not far from us, but right in front of us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many years ago, during an earthquake in Italy, many people were moving things out of their houses and running for their lives with their young and their old.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At that time, one woman stood at her door and roared with laughter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although her house had collapsed and her possessions were buried, she was not concerned at all; she was laughing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When others asked why she was laughing so hard, she said, "All it takes is for my God to shake a little, and you can do nothing except run.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How great is our God!"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Indeed, often before our tears have dried, we are already filled with laughter and joy.</S>
