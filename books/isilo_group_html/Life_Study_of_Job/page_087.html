Once again, there was no prayer or exercise of the spirit in fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. ELIHU HAVING MORE TO SAY FOR GOD</H2><P>In 36:1-4 Elihu claimed that he had more to say for God. He said, "I will bring my knowledge from afar/And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker./For truly my words are not false;/One perfect in knowledge is with you" (vv. 3-4). I do not believe that Elihu was speaking for God at all; he was speaking absolutely for himself, making a display of his knowledge. Actually, he had less knowledge than Job and the three friends. Although Elihu said that he ascribed righteousness to God, he in fact ascribed everything to himself, going so far as to refer to himself as "one perfect in knowledge."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. SHOWING JOB THAT GOD<br>TAKES CARE OF THE RIGHTEOUS</H2><P>In verses 5 through 16 Elihu showed Job that God takes care of the righteous and that He allured Job from the jaws of distress into a spacious place. Here Elihu skipped from one subject to another, and it is difficult to know what he was talking about.</P><P>Elihu said that God "does not preserve the wicked man alive" (v. 6a). This is not true, for many wicked people are still living. Elihu also said that those who hear God and serve Him "will spend their days in prosperity/And their years in pleasantness" (v. 11). Such a concept is altogether according to the principle of good and evil. In verse 16 he went on to say, "Indeed He allures you from the jaws of distress/Into a spacious place, where there is no constraint;/And what is upon your table would be full of fatness."</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_086.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_088.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Job &nbsp; pg 87</div><br></body></html>
