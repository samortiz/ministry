<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. CRUCIAL POINTS IN JOHN 14 THROUGH 17</H2><P>Because the revelation in John 14 through 17 is so mysterious and complicated, I want to share some crucial points.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Triune God Being Essential and Economical</H2><P>John 14:16-20 unveils that the Triune God is both essential in His being and economical in His moving.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Distinctly Three</H2><P>Verses 16 and 17 say that the Son would ask the Father to give the disciples another Comforter&#151;the Spirit of reality&#151;indicating that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are distinctly three in Their move in the economical Trinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Essentially One in Verses 17 and 18</H2><P>Verse 17 says that the Spirit of reality will come and verse 18 says that the Son will not leave the disciples as orphans but He is coming to them, indicating that the Spirit and the Son are essentially one in the essential Trinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Essentially One in Verses 17 and 20</H2><P>Verse 17 says that the Spirit will be in the disciples and verse 20 says that the Son will be in the disciples, also indicating that the Spirit and the Son are essentially one in the essential Trinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Coinhering with the Disciples Mutually</H2><P>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit coinhere with the disciples mutually, indicating that the Triune God and the disciples are not only united but also mingled and incorporated into one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Travailing Woman and the Child</H2><P>John 16:21 unveils that the travailing and delivering woman is the believers and that the child delivered is also the believers. This is a mystery.</P>
