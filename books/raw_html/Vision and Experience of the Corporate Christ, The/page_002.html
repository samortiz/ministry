<h1 class="title">THE RECOVERY OF GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL PURPOSE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S FALL AND THE NEED FOR RECOVERY</h2>
<p>We praise the Lord that we are in His recovery. However, if we are serious about being in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we need to consider what the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is. The word <em>recovery</em> indicates that something was lost. Through the fall man was lost and drifted away from God&rsquo;s goal. Therefore, he needed to be brought back. To be brought back is to be recovered. Because man fell from God, he missed God&rsquo;s purpose. When man fell from God and from His purpose, he fell into sin, the world, and the self.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Culture and Religion</h2>
<p>After man fell into sin, the world, and the self, he realized that he could not continue to exist in such a low condition. Therefore, he tried to improve and adjust himself to rescue himself out of sin. Eventually, out of this human self-adjustment, culture was invented. The purpose of human culture is simply to maintain a fallen race. However, culture can never help people to be recovered back to God.</p>
<p>The greatest, highest, and best item within human culture is religion. In the local churches we may consider <em>religion</em> to be a negative word. However, <em>religion</em> is not a negative word but a positive one. In dictionaries and often in literature <em>religion</em> is a positive word, because religion is the best invention in human culture. Nevertheless, we need to realize that neither culture nor religion can ever bring us back to God&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<p>In order to see the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we first need to forget about human culture and to drop religion. After man fell from God and God&rsquo;s purpose into sin, the world, and the self, culture came in with the help of religion to keep man alive in his fallen situation. Culture and religion serve only to maintain man&rsquo;s existence in his fallen situation. No religion can help people out of their fallen situation. Buddhism is a poor, inferior religion, Judaism is a higher religion, and Christianity is the highest religion. However, no religion&mdash;not Buddhism, nor Judaism, nor Christianity&mdash;can do anything to rescue us out of our fallen situation. Religion may improve man a little, but it can never remove him out of one situation and place him into another situation. Therefore, there is the need of recovery. We need to be recovered, rescued, and brought back.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Pure Word versus the Religious Concept</h2>
<p>In addition to human-invented culture and religion, there is a divine book, the Bible. The Holy Bible is not merely a book but the divine Word. In order to understand and to see what the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is, we need to come back to the pure Word. Perhaps today we are not living in the fallen situation of sin and the world, but we may still be living under the concept of religion or our own human concept. Our concept may confine us like a cage confines a little bird. We should not be offended to learn the truth concerning our real situation. We need to consider the possibility that we are confined in our own concept or in the concept we picked up from our religious background. The understanding that we were taught may have become a cage to us. Therefore, today we need the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We need the Lord to rescue us out of our cage. We need to escape from our cage and fly into the air to see the clear sky. The clear sky is the pure Word.</p>
<p>Allow me to illustrate the way in which many are confined by the religious concept. Over the years, as I traveled through various countries in the West and the Far East, many pious, godly Christians have said to me, &ldquo;What you speak is a little too much. We fear God, believe in the Lord Jesus, are saved, and have the assurance that some day we will go to heaven. Moreover, we try to be good people, be kind to others, and lead others to salvation to help them to get into heaven. As long as we do this, it is good enough.&rdquo; I also met some who considered themselves to be deeper in the spiritual life. These ones said to me, &ldquo;As long as we believe in the Lord Jesus, love Him, fellowship with Him, grow in His life, and become spiritual, it is good enough. You should not speak anything more than this, for if you do, it will cause problems.&rdquo; In a sense, for human beings to fear God, believe in the Lord Jesus, be saved, try to be good persons, and help others to be saved is very good. Furthermore, in this dark age on this corrupted earth, for some advanced Christians to love the Lord, daily walk in His presence, care only for life, be spiritual, and be in the likeness of the Lord is truly wonderful. However, because all these good concepts become a cage to people, we need the recovery. We need to be released from the cage of our concepts and come back to the pure Word.</p>
