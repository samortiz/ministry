   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN LEADERSHIP AMONG THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament economy nothing is more serious than insulting the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous Life Message we pointed out that the church is built with Christ as life and with oneness as its ground.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is one further aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For the church to be safeguarded, it must be built according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of all the truths related to the church, the most important one is the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Life is crucial, oneness is important, but without the headship of Christ the church is not safeguarded.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As some of the questions below illustrate, this matter is related to leadership among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why do we who follow the churches turn first this way and then that way?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Too often it is true that we sway back and forth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With no sense of direction eventually we are all disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This needless turning first to the right and then to the left is a sickness in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The cause is the failure to practice the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must all come back, not only to life and oneness, but also to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Any movement, any direction, or any speaking that leads to a hierarchy is an insult to the headship of Christ; as such it must be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By practicing the truth in this way, each local church will be safeguarded from fluctuating and be kept to the one goal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is the function of a full-time worker?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the Bible, for one to be a full-time worker, he must have a ministry or burden from the Lord that occupies all his time, and he must also be in an environment that can provide him with his living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You recall that Paul was fully occupied by the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After a certain time, however, his environment did not supply his material needs, and he resumed his occupation of tentmaker Acts 18:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How can one serve and even help others to serve in a proper way in spirit and under the headship of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With the church service, the less direction there is, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is, however, the practical need to know, for example, where the mops and cleaning supplies are.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you can help by saying where they are, such a direction is not an offense to Christ's headship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Be careful, on the other hand, not to issue kingly directives: "Sisters, you can go clean over there.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then go and help those downstairs to finish."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a matter of the attitude of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you help others because they need some help, that is good.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you help others in the spirit of being the service group leader, that is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That we should not take the role of head is a far-reaching truth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It governs the elders, the co-workers, the saints, and the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It will kill the ambition which is in all of us as fallen human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then if you see the need and take the initiative, is that in the same realm as taking the headship?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is the Lord's place to initiate.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To bring to the Lord what we propose and ask His blessing on it, as is the common practice in Christianity, is an insult to His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must respect His lordship by letting Him initiate; unless He does, we refrain from doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Suppose when you were in our locality you were not speaking the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How would the brothers deal with the situation?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to avoid confusion, the elders would probably not interrupt the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But there would be no second meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After that first meeting, the elders would invite me to their home and tell me in a gracious way that I was not speaking according to the truth and that the church could not take it; would I please refrain from going further?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It would not be too good for the administration of the church to step in and stop the speaker, but for a single saint to do so is according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge," 1 Cor 14:29.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A saint may interrupt the speaker by saying, "Brother So-and-so, I have a question to ask.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You have said such-and-such, but it seems to me this is not according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Please prove it to me."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If all the churches and all the saints are this alert, think how careful the speaker will be.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the other hand, a church which takes whatever I say just because I say it is not healthy and does not know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you follow what I tell you, it must be because you have checked that it is according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It must not be a matter of following a man but of keeping the divine truth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If what is spoken is checked out by every saint and by the church to see that it is according to the truth, we shall be kept from falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Be sure your questioning is done in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the church everything must be genuine and true, but it must also be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you challenge a speaker, you must do so in your spirit with love.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are not opposing someone; we are studying the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let us go on, then, by growing in life, by keeping the oneness, and by seeking after the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When something is bothering us and we want to take that to the Lord, that is not the same as going to the Lord with a purpose, is it?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The best contact with the Lord is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whatever burdens or problems I have, I come to Him without any.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I lay them aside to come to Him with no purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The truth of the matter is that the Lord is bearing our burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A number of times I have gone to Him with my burdens, and He has said, "Foolish child, why do you bear the burdens which are on My shoulder?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Why don't you just enjoy Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is a basic lesson for our whole Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we learn to cast our burden on the Lord, we shall grow.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Don't think that if you don't bear the burden, no one will.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord will bear it.</S>
