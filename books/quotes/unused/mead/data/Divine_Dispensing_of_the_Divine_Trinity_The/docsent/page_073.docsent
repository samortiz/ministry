   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FIGHTING THE SPIRITUAL WARFARE Scripture Reading: Eph 6:10-24</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapter one of Ephesians the divine dispensing issues in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eventually, the Body is developed into the full-grown man in chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This full-grown man is the new man with grace and truth for the carrying out of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter five the new man is developed into the Bride with love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, by the time we come to chapter five, Christ is expressed through His Body, God s purpose is fulfilled through the new man, and Christ is satisfied with the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Body, the new man, and the Bride are all concerned with matters on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But there is still something on the negative side, a problem that must be dealt with God s enemy in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, in chapter six we have a further development, and the church is seen as a fighter, a warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a warrior, the church is commissioned to deal with God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, the church will have a full development to be such a warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have seen that for the new man in chapter four we need grace and truth, and that for the Bride in chapter five we need love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In chapter six two further basic elements are introduced in relation to the church as the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These elements are power and the armor of God 6:10-11, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Power is inward, and the armor is outward.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Inwardly, we are filled with the divine power, the divine dynamo or divine electricity, and outwardly we are clothed with the divine armor.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This strengthens and equips us to fight the spiritual warfare for God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The whole book of Ephesians is concerned with divine dispensing for the producing of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Beginning in chapter one, the Body advances, develops, until it attains full growth and becomes the new man to accomplish God s purpose and the Bride to satisfy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At this point, all that remains is for the church to deal with God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church as the warrior must bear the burden to defeat God s enemy by being empowered inwardly and clothed with the armor outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason, in chapter six we have the power and the armor.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we have the power inwardly and the armor outwardly, we shall be strengthened and equipped to fight the battle for God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many Christians today do not have the full realization that God needs a warrior, that He needs an army.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In his marvelous book, Pilgrim s Progress, John Bunyan likens the individual Christian to a warrior, as revealed in Ephesians 6.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This understanding, however, is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Bunyan wrote this book three hundred years ago, he did not have the light to see that Ephesians 6 speaks not of an individual warrior, but of a corporate warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, the book of Ephesians is not mainly concerned with individual Christians, but with the corporate church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Body of Christ is corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The new man also is corporate, for it is composed of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, the Bride is a corporate entity, not an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the same principle, the warrior in chapter six must also be corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, in Ephesians we have a corporate Body, a corporate new man, a corporate Bride, and a corporate warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all need to stand in the Body and not stand as individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we stand as individuals, we shall be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are detached from the Body, we shall be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My hand is very useful because it is attached to my body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if it were cut off, detached, it would become useless.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is an illustration of the situation of many Christians today: they are detached from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The vast majority of Christians are detached.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Ezekiel 37 we have a vision of dry, detached bones in a valley.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a picture not only of ancient Israel; it is also a picture of the actual situation of today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because so many Christians are like dry, detached bones, the Lord needs a recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The purpose of the Lord s recovery is not merely to recover doctrines, but to recover us through life, through the divine breath.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need the divine breath to make us alive.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then in this life we shall be joined, attached, and become one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The main substance we receive through the divine dispensing is life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the divine life received through the divine dispensing, we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Praise the Lord that in His recovery most of the saints are truly attached to one another in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is a shame for Christians in the Lord s recovery to be individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If anyone remains individualistic, his situation will be pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The warrior in Ephesians 6 is altogether a corporate entity.</S>
