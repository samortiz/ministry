   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Life-producing by Brooding</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first function of the Spirit as revealed in the Old Testament is the function of life-producing by brooding Gen 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The record of Genesis 1 concerning God s creation is a record of the producing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God created the heavens and the earth, and the earth became waste and void.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then the Spirit of God came to brood over the death waters with the intention of producing life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a result of the brooding of the Spirit, life was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, the plant life was produced Gen 1:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The plant life is for beautifying the earth, but it is also for food.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Genesis 2 tells us that the trees are good for food v. 9 . The plant life is food for the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After the plant life was produced, the animal life was created.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This animal life includes the birds, the aquatic animals, the cattle, and the creeping things Gen 1:20-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The animal life is for the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, the human life is for the divine life, the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The record of God s creation is actually a record of life-producing by the brooding of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The brooding of the Spirit as God produced life for the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today in the new creation, the Spirit is also brooding for the producing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God created man, but man, like the earth, eventually became waste and void.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then the Spirit of God comes to brood over man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This brooding function of the Spirit of God always goes along with the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we preach the gospel, the Spirit is brooding to produce life in the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Striving with or Ruling in Fallen Man</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit also functioned to strive with or rule in fallen man Gen 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Man fell by the time of Genesis 3, and he continued to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, there was a struggle between the Spirit and fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because the fallen man was still falling, the Spirit was striving with him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s Spirit was striving against man s rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Hebrew word for striving here could also be translated rule in. God s striving with man implies His ruling in man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Genesis 6 a point was reached when the Spirit of God would strive with man no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, man became so corrupted that God had to judge the earth with a flood.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The judgment of the flood came in because of the unbridled corruption of man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Filling Man in Wisdom, Understanding,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Knowledge, and Skill</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although the situation with man had reached a point where the Spirit of God would no longer strive with him, God would never give up man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, God came to man to call him, to redeem him, and to rescue him from his fallen situation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After God brought the children of Israel into the wilderness, the Spirit, who was brooding over and striving with man, became the filling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God filled man with the Spirit of God in wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and skill Exo 31:3; 35:31; Deut 34:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Spirit filling man in these items means that the Spirit is these items.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The filling Spirit that fills us is the Spirit as wisdom, knowledge, understanding, and skill.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Old Testament, the people who were filled with the Spirit as wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and skill were the builders of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For more fellowship concerning this, see Life-study of Exodus, message one hundred seventy, pp.</S>
