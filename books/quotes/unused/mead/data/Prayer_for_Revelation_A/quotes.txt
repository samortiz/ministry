[1]  A PRAYER FOR REVELATION Scripture Reading: Eph 1:3-23
[2]  As we begin to know God, His work, and His eternal plan which He purposed in eternity, we begin to realize that the light in the book of Ephesians is abundant, high, and special.
[3]  We need to realize one thing before the Lord: in the book of Ephesians, God caused Paul to pray two prayers.
[4]  While the Athenians did not know God at all, this prayer reveals that a Christian, who has received eternal life and who has known God initially, may still not have a sufficient knowledge of God.
[5]  Yet one day God gives to us a spirit of wisdom and revelation.
[6]  Then He reveals Himself to us in a fresh, special, and deepening way, so that we can say that not only do we know Him, but we have a full knowledge of Him.
[7]  Not only does God want us to know Him; He wants us to know His calling.
[8]  He wants us to know what our calling is and what is His inheritance in the saints.
[9]  God has an eternal plan which spans from eternity to eternity.
[10]  This shows us that God has put the Spirit of His Son in us for the purpose of making us His sons.
[11]  If God has opened the eyes of our heart, and if we truly see God's calling, His inheritance, His plan, and His purpose, we will spontaneously see that all our works, both great and small, must be related to God's plan.
[12]  On the objective side, he prayed that we would have the full knowledge of God and know the hope of His calling and the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints.
[13]  They think that they can put aside the knowledge of God and His eternal will, and make it their first priority to acquire power from God for themselves, so that they can be more holy, more victorious, and more spiritual in themselves.
[14]  One can only become useful before God when he sees a vision; he can only become useful when he knows the work of Christ within him and God's power within him.
[15]  A vision allows us to see God's plan, while the power enables us to fulfill His plan.
[16]  The vision causes us to understand God's plan, while the power causes us to carry out His plan.
[17]  The apostle showed us that we must not only know the hope of God's calling and the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, but we must also know "the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe."
[18]  Not only must we know God, His plan, and His goal, we must also know the might of His strength.
[19]  If God's power has not done anything in us, it means that we do not truly know God, and we do not truly know His plan and purpose.
[20]  If we only know God and only know His plan and His purpose, without knowing the surpassing greatness of His power, everything is still objective; it is not subjective.
[21]  We do not need God to do more works, but we need to have the revelation concerning the works that He has completed.
[22]  The apostle prayed that God would grant us a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him who already "is," that we would have a full knowledge of His predetermined plan and have a knowledge of His accomplished works.
[23]  Suppose a brother has a terrible temper using a simple matter as an illustration , and he cannot overcome it once, twice, and three times.
[24]  He wonders why God does not deal with his temper.
[25]  We may pray for greater power, but the Bible says that we do not need greater power; what we need is a spirit of wisdom and revelation in order to see the surpassing greatness of the power within us.
