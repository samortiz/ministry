   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIMENT IN TAIPEI</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>About four years ago, in October of 1984, I went to Taipei to have some new things tested out as an experiment for our practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before I went, I told some of the brothers that I was going to Taipei to try to do something new.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I also said that in those three to five years, I would not be able to do much to help the churches in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What I would do was to come back two times a year for the trainings on the Life-study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then what I would do in Taipei would be tested out, and I would have a finished model to bring back to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The churches in United States would be able to follow this model and do something according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I went to Taipei, I told the brothers there that I came back to have a new start and that I would call this a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But I did not have the assurance how much this way would succeed or work out.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I told them that what I was going to do would be a trial, a test, an experiment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time close to eighty new elders were established.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I told these elders that their being appointed as elders was not something permanent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their appointment was also subject to experiment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Maybe after a short time, some would find out that they were not suitable persons for the eldership and they would feel to resign.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Or maybe I would find out that some were not so fitting in this responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I repeated this word again and again we are conducting an experiment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I said that the training center in Taipei was a lab, that is, a laboratory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Regretfully, I was not strict in keeping my word to raise up a model in Taipei and then return to the United States with the finished product.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the saints in the United States heard about this, many of them wanted to go there to attend the training.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I hesitated but I gave in to their request.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now I regret this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that time, I should have kept my principle strictly to say "no" to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I should have asked all the saints to please stay in the United States while I tested and experimented various things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then I could have properly found out whether or not those things worked.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I should have kept this principle, but I did not.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That was my negligence, and I feel regretful for this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many saints from the United States went to the training in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In principle the training should have fit the situation of the saints who came from the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But I did not have the time to oversee the training that much.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I was occupied to the uttermost with the work on the Chinese Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I could not even be involved that much with the training.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If I had had the time, I would have considered the particular need of the saints from the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The training was planned and formed just to fit in with the need of the island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was not designed to meet the need of saints coming from other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>My negligence was in accepting these saints to be trained and not doing anything to prepare the training to fit in with their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Within such a short time of training, we baptized over thirty thousand new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If I were able to repeat that time of training again, I would not let the trainees baptize so many.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We discovered that we could baptize many people, but then we realized that we did not have the manpower to take care of the new ones.</S>
