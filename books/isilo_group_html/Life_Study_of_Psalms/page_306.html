Tasting It</H2><P>"How sweet are Your words to my taste!/Sweeter than honey to my mouth!" (v. 103). To the psalmist the law was not merely a list of commandments; it was also a word full of enjoyment and life supply. For this reason, God's words were sweet to his taste. If we regard the law as nothing more than the commandments of God, it will not be sweet to us. But if we regard God's law as His word for our nourishment and life supply, we will enjoy its sweet taste.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Rejoicing in It</H2><P>When we taste the word of God, we rejoice in it. This was the experience of the psalmist, who testified again and again that he rejoiced in God's word (vv. 14, 111, 162).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Singing of It</H2><P>"Your statutes have become my songs of praise/In the house of my pilgrimage" (v. 54). This indicates that the psalmist even sang of God's word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Regarding It</H2><P>In verse 6 the psalmist said that he regarded God's commandments, and in verse 117, that he regarded God's statutes. This means that he respected God's word. If we would be genuine seekers of God, we must respect His word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Having a Sound Heart in It</H2><P>The psalmist also had a sound, or healthy, heart in God's word (v. 80).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Inclining Their Heart unto It</H2><P>In verses 36 the psalmist prayed, "Incline my heart to Your testimonies/And not to unjust gain." Then in verse 112 he declared, "I have inclined my heart to perform Your statutes/Forever, to the end." These verses show us that we need a heart inclined to the word of God. Sometimes as we are reading the Bible, our heart is inclined to something else. Because our heart has the tendency to depart from God's word, we need to pray that our heart will be called back to God's word and be inclined to it.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_305.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_307.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 306</div><br></body></html>
