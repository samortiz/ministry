<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL BEING FORMED<br>INTO A BODY TO FIGHT FOR GOD AND SERVE GOD<br>FOR THE CARRYING OUT OF GOD'S PURPOSE</H2><P>The children of Israel were formed into a body to fight for God as warriors and serve God as priests for the carrying out of God's purpose. God's purpose is to have the New Jerusalem, to mingle Himself with His redeemed people. The formation of the children of Israel into a body to fight for God and to serve God typifies the New Testament believers being built up into the organic Body of Christ to fight for God for the carrying out, in its service to God, of God's eternal economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL BEING FORMED<br>INTO AN ARMY ABLE TO FIGHT FOR THE PROTECTION<br>OF GOD'S TESTIMONY (THE ARK IN THE TABERNACLE)</H2><P>The children of Israel were formed into an army able to fight for the protection of God's testimony (the ark in the tabernacle). This indicates that, in a very real sense, the church today is fighting for the protection of the incarnated God. God in Himself needs no protection, but God in His embodiment needs to be protected by the fighting of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Book of Numbers<br>Stressing the Testimony of God</H2><P>The book of Numbers stresses the testimony of God more than the book of Leviticus does. The word testimony is used more frequently in Numbers than in Leviticus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. A Matter of a Formed Assembly,<br>Not of Individuals</H2><P>The army of God protecting God's testimony is a matter of a formed assembly, not of individuals. Today some Christians emphasize individual spirituality. But in the sight of God, individual, separate spirituality means nothing. God desires the formed, coordinated Body of Christ.</P>
