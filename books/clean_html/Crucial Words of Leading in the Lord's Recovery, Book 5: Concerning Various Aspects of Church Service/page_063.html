<h2 class="head2">Having a Principle in Expounding the Bible</h2>
<p>The brothers serving in the word must have a burden. Message 1 of <em>Life-study of Galatians</em> says that Galatians, the first of four books that make up the heart of the divine revelation in the New Testament, is concerned with Christ. We must study to find out what kind of Christ is presented in Galatians. If Message 1 does not give us enough detail, we should read the footnotes, and if there is no explanation in the footnotes, we should consider which Life-study speaks of Christ. The most appropriate Life-study would be on Philippians. We should spend time studying Philippians so that we can develop something without departing from the topic.</p>
<p>The first message also speaks of the background of the book of Galatians, which is that Judaism and the Mosaic law replace Christ. We should thoroughly explain what Judaism is and that the principle of Judaism is religion. What is religion? It is a teaching that is based on doctrines. What is the law? To many, the law teaches people how to do good deeds. Concerning all these points we should get into the footnotes, which contain a substantial amount of explanation. This is the way we should dig out material for the message.</p>
<p>Do not depend on imagination to minister the word. If we read the Life-studies over a long period of time, we will find the principle. Proper biblical exposition points out principles. Without a basis, we cannot say that Judaism is similar to Chinese ethical teaching, or that the Mosaic law is similar to Chinese ethics and morality. We need to speak according to the principles. A Jew must worship God by obeying the Mosaic law. Similarly, the Chinese have their own ethical teaching, morality, and laws. We need to point out the principles, and we need to dig out material from the Life-studies and the footnotes. After we gather material, we still need to practice speaking and consider how we should speak. We must always digest the material and then apply the digested material in our speaking. This is the way to prepare for a message.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Digging into the Riches of God&rsquo;s Word</h2>
<p>We first need to dig into the Lord&rsquo;s word. Let us return to Message 1 of the <em>Life-study of Galatians.</em> Galatians is a book concerning Christ, so we must dig and find Christ. When we come to the section concerning the background, we must pay attention to two things in the background: religion and the law. We also need to dig into these two points. We need to find ways to develop all the material that we have unearthed into our utterance, making the message rich and interesting. This is not so difficult to do. As long as we are willing to dig and to hold on to the principles, every message will be good.</p>
<p>Our material is rich. We have Life-studies of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. When I was saved, I desired to know the Bible. Later, Brother Watchman Nee introduced Darby&rsquo;s <em>Synopsis of the Bible</em> to me, and I was overjoyed. During that time and under very difficult circumstances, I browsed through other books in Christianity, but it was mostly a waste of time. Today, however, we have the Life-studies in our hand, and every message is profitable. We should never take the Life-studies as mere reference books. We need to be aggressive and enter into the riches.</p>
<p>We must not merely repeat a message that is used in both the small group meeting and on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, because God&rsquo;s word is too rich. We need to have a vision. After hearing a message, we should not think that we do not need to hear it again; rather, we need to hear it again and again. Such a vision will create an atmosphere among us of wanting to continually hear the Lord&rsquo;s word. D. L. Moody once spoke in a chapel, and he used John 3:16. The next day, after much consideration, he quoted the same verse, and he continued to speak the same message concerning how God loved the world. After he left, the chapel was burned down. Later, when he was invited again, he still spoke on God&rsquo;s loving the world. The chapel might have been burned down, but the truth that God loves the world will never be burned down. The audience was not bored with the message; instead, they felt that the truth of God&rsquo;s loving the world was endlessly precious.</p>
<p>The truth that we have touched is on the central line. This includes the essential Spirit, the economical Spirit, and God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. All these truths are deeper than the love of God. All the messages in our Life-studies touch the central line. If we have a heart to mine these messages, we will discover that there is a gold mine in them. The Life-studies have been translated into many languages and have gone to all the continents in the world. It is regrettable that not many saints have gotten into them. Many saints have not even entered into the Bible, not to mention the Life-studies. I earnestly hope that we all can diligently enter into the riches in the Life-studies. This was my attitude when I wrote the footnotes of the New Testament Recovery Version. Sometimes I rewrote a footnote ten times. Sometimes when I woke up early in the morning, before getting out of bed I would consider whether the footnotes that were written the night before were thorough. I was in fear and trembling. For example, footnote 6 on 1 John 1:6 concerning the word <em>truth</em> has eight points, which were gleaned from reading various reference books and getting into the Greek grammar and studying it. I hope that we are encouraged by this word.</p>
