   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We are very familiar with this story.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us spend some time to consider it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This man went from the place of peace to the place of a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jerusalem means peace, and Jericho means a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He did not go from Jericho to Jerusalem, a journey that goes up.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was from Jerusalem to Jericho, a journey that goes down.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He went from the place of peace to the place of a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This man was in a downhill condition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He met robbers on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was not one robber, but a whole gang of robbers, who took away all he had, stripped him of his garments, and left him with no outward covering at all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They beat him until he was half dead; he was wounded in his very life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible shows us that a man's garments are his deeds, and a man's being is his life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here the shining deeds are stripped away and gone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The life that remains only has a body that is living; the spirit is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a man half dead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All readers of the Bible know that this is a description of our person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From the time man was tempted by the serpent in the garden of Eden, and since he began to sin, man has never experienced peace in his life journey.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man is continually tempted by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The result is that all his outward deeds are stripped away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even more his inward spirit is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is living as far as the body goes, but dead as far as the spirit goes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Man can do nothing about his condition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He can only wait for others to come and save him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A priest came by.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When he saw this man, he passed by on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A Levite also came by.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After he saw the man, he also passed by on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The priests and the Levites are the two main groups of people in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Old Testament, the whole law is in the hands of the priests and the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you take away the priests and the Levites, there would be no law left.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To a half-dead sinner, one who is bound by Satan, waiting to go to destruction, and having no outward virtue, there was nothing to do except to wait to die.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What would the priests tell him?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The priests would have said, "Love the Lord your God with your whole heart, your whole soul, your whole strength, and your whole mind, and you will rise up and walk."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Levite would also come and say, "That is right.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But you must also love your neighbor as yourself."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These are their messages.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is what a priest and a Levite would say to a dying man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"It is true that you are half dead and that your shining garments have been stripped away.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if you would do good, you can be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the meaning of loving God with the whole heart, the whole soul, the whole strength, and the whole mind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is what it means to love God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you see one who has not been beaten, that one may still have the heart, the soul, the strength, and the mind to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It would still be possible for him to love God with his whole heart, his whole soul, his whole strength, and his whole mind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It would have been possible to tell him this if he were still in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the problem today is that he is no longer in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is on a journey, and he is dying.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These commandments cannot help him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, please remember that it is not a question of giving our "whole," but of getting some help.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Here is a man who is dying of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is living in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He cannot do anything about his condition.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you tell the sinner to love God with all his heart, soul, strength, and mind, he would say that he has never loved God in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you say that he has to love his neighbor, he would tell you that he has been robbing others all his life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What should you say to a man who is about to step into eternity?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At this juncture, the priests and the Levites are of no help.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They can only pass by on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When they see this kind of man, they cannot help him.</S>
