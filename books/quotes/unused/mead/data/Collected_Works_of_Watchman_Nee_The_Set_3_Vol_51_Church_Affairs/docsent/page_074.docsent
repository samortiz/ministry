   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Head Giving the Authority,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Members Having the Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The usefulness of the Body is in the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first principle of the Body is authority, and the second principle is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The supply from the coordination depends on the supply from the authority and also the supply from the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What comes from the Head is authority, and what comes from the members is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Head provides the authority so that we can have order in the Body and order in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, there is also the mutual fellowship among the members.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These are the basic principles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Fellowship is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are many brothers and sisters in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I want to charge you again to test yourselves thoroughly concerning this matter: "O Lord, am I a person who closes up his heart and never asks for help?''</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Please remember that we cannot find such an aloof Christian in the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Being aloof is not the way of a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Never think that you should take care of everything by yourself and not care about the matters of other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You cannot be a Christian on the earth in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You need to learn from the beginning how to coordinate with the brothers in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the way to have spiritual usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Otherwise, when twenty brothers go to Wenchow, they will still be twenty individuals, twenty units there, and when twenty brothers go to Tsingtao, there will still be twenty units there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If this is the case, their going will be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the one hand, we need to learn to submit to authority, and on the other hand, we need to have fellowship to the extent that we can say, "Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We bear the burdens in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have fellowship, and we have the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When there are problems, we take care of them step by step and level by level in an orderly way.''</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Both authority and fellowship are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Neither can be lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we go out to work and experience failure, we should realize that if there is no problem concerning authority, then there must be one concerning fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The work is a matter of authority and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>AUTHORITY AND FELLOWSHIP IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the New Testament there are many arrangements and much fellowship in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Especially with Paul we can learn that there are many arrangements, and we can find a basic principle in these arrangements there is authority and also fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, if we spend some time to look into the record in the Bible, we can repeatedly see that there are many arrangements in which the young brothers should listen to instructions in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These arrangements denote authority and also fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When a brother has received knowledge and light, he not only uses authority to send some brothers to carry things out, but he also fellowships knowledge and light with them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brothers, have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The arrangements in the Bible do not only denote authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If they did, Paul would have simply told his young co-workers to do something and they would have done it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In these arrangements Paul had light and knowledge before God, and he imparted them to his young co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, on the one hand, we need to see that this is a matter of authority, and on the other hand, we need to see that it is a matter of fellowship, because Paul shared his knowledge with his young co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sending Tychicus and Onesimus</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Colossians 4:7-8 says, "All the things concerning me, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow slave in the Lord, will make known to you, whom I have sent to you for this very thing.''</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do you see?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Tychicus was sent to Colossae by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 9 continues, "With Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother.''</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here you see that Paul sent Tychicus and Onesimus to Colossae together.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In God's work the master builders have authority to send people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is recorded in the Epistles that Tychicus was a very good brother.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The book of Philemon tells us that Onesimus was a beloved brother.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But both of them were sent by Paul.</S>
