   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE REALITY OF BAPTISM BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO PUT PEOPLE INTO</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE PROCESSED, INCORPORATED GOD THE FIVE STAGES IN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE PROGRESSIVE REVELATION OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the previous chapter we saw that there are five stages in the progressive revelation of God in the Bible: the bachelor God, the incarnated God, the redeeming God, the indwelling God, and the incorporated God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In eternity past God was alone; He was a bachelor God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then one day He came into His creation, becoming God in the flesh as the man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time, in His incarnation, He became God plus man, the incarnated God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, He was crucified to accomplish redemption, redeeming us not only from sin but also from death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jesus walked into death and walked out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He resurrected not by Himself but with all of us 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because Christ accomplished redemption, He became the redeeming God, God the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The night after His resurrection He came to His disciples, breathed into them, and said, Receive the Holy Spirit John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Greek word pneuma, translated in this verse as Spirit, also means breath.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that Christ had become the Holy Breath, the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, when He breathed into His disciples, they received Him, and He never left them, for He had become the indwelling God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The indwelling God is for an incorporation, and at the end of the Holy Scriptures we see that, after all His stages, God ultimately and consummately becomes the incorporated God Rev 19:7; 21:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is incorporated with all His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The New Jerusalem Being</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>a Corporate Entity Composed of</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God and Man Mingled Together as One</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The divine revelation in the Bible eventually shows us the New Jerusalem, which is a corporate entity, an incorporation of God and all His redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the New Jerusalem, God is in Christ, and Christ is in all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God in Christ is the hub, the center, and we are the rim, the circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For eternity we will be one corporate entity together with the incorporated God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nothing will separate us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We will be one with Him in life, nature, element, and appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every believer will become a part of the incorporated God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God s eternal purpose is to produce this corporate entity composed of all that God is, contained in, mingled with, and expressed through humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the New Jerusalem is completed, the universe will marvel at this corporate entity, humanity constituted and mingled with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This entity is the incorporated God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Bachelor God</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Becoming the Incarnated God</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the beginning of the Bible God was alone; He was a bachelor God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, Isaiah 7:14 prophesies, The virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Immanuel means God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Isaiah 9:6 says, A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us;...</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>/ And His name will be called...</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>/ Mighty God, / Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Matthew 1:18 says, Mary...was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 23 indicates that this child is the fulfillment of the prophecy in Isaiah 7:14 He is God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Gospel of John reveals that the Word, who was God, became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace v. 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Incarnated God</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Becoming the Indwelling God</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ attracted many people to follow Him during the three and a half years of His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, even after the disciples were with Him for three and a half years, they still could not understand Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No doubt Isaiah did not fully understand what he was inspired to prophesy seven hundred years before Christ, yet even those who were with the Lord could not fully understand who He was.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One day He said to them, If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him John 14:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because Philip did not understand this, he said, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us v. 8 . Then the Lord said, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? vv.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Perhaps Philip and the disciples began to understand that Christ and the Father were one, but the Lord went on to reveal something further.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even if the disciples were beginning to understand who the Lord was, He still could be with them only in an outward way; He could not enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, He needed to pass through death and resurrection so that He could return to them in another form, a form in which He could enter into them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>14:16-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The disciples were bothered when the Lord revealed that He would go to the cross 13:33, 36-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord said, I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you 14:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He explained that His going was actually His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He knew that if He did not go, He could never come into them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He needed to go so that He could come into them by being transformed from the flesh into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In John 1 God became flesh, but in the last two chapters of John, Jesus became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>John 1 reveals Jesus coming in the flesh v. 14 , but chapter 20 reveals Jesus as the Holy Spirit v. 22 . By going through the further steps of His process, God in the flesh became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In John 14 through 17 the word in is especially significant.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In 14:20 the Lord said, In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In 17:21 He prayed, That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is a wonderful fact that we are in Him and He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In 15:4 He said, Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>How wonderful that Emmanuel, God with us, became the life-giving Spirit to indwell us!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Triune God today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He has come into us, and we have been brought into Him.</S>
