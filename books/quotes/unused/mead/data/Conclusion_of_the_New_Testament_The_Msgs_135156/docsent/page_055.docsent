   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 According to God's Predestination</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 8:29 tells us that God predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As called and justified ones v. 30 , our destiny has been determined beforehand by God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before the foundation of the world, God predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that conformation to Christ is our destiny and also our destination.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our destiny is not heaven it is to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have been predestinated to be conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son so that He may be the Firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is God's purpose to produce many brothers of His firstborn Son for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Christ was the only begotten Son, He was unique.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But God desired to have many sons who will be the many brothers of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this way the only begotten Son of God becomes the Firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is the firstborn Son, and we, according to God's predestination, are the many sons who are being conformed to the image of the Firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's purpose in this is that we express Him in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, for the fulfillment of God's purpose, He predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>3 As the Many Brothers of God's Firstborn Son in the Process of Maturity</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who are being conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son are the believers as the many brothers of God's firstborn Son in the process of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are presently in the process of maturity, that is, in the process of transformation and conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When this process has been completed, we shall reach maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, maturity is the full extent of the process of transformation for conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are now in the process of being conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This conformation takes place through transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more we are transformed, the more we are conformed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Transformation, a metabolic change, issues in conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through the process of transformation and conformation we become more and more like Christ, our elder Brother.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He has both the divine nature and the human nature, and we, His many brothers, have both the human nature and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Concerning this, Hebrews 2:11 says, "Both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He who sanctifies is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers in Christ as the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To say that He and we are all "of one" refers to the Father as the source.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Both the firstborn Son and the many sons of God have been born of the same Father in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, the firstborn Son and the many sons have one source, one life, one nature, and one essence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because both He, the firstborn Son, and we, the many sons, are the same in the divine life and nature, He is not ashamed to call us brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As His brothers we are now in the process of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This process of maturity involves the believers' experience of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Conformation actually denotes the shaping of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the divine life grows within us and transforms us, it spontaneously shapes us into the form, the image, of the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we are blind to this reality, however, we may try to shape ourselves into the likeness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such self-effort never works.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Concerning this, only one thing is prevailing the divine life that grows in us, sanctifies us, transforms us, and shapes us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is no need for us to shape ourselves, to perform, or to strive to improve our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What we need is a fuller experience of the divine life with its essence, power, law, and shape.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As those who are undergoing the process of transformation for conformation, we are being shaped gradually into the image of the firstborn Son of God by the function of the all-inclusive, divine life.</S>
