   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Some brothers may be afraid for others to come and visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But what we need today among the churches is more divine circulation, more fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are about fifty churches in California, but there is not much fellowship among them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is where our shortcoming is, and this is why we are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The circulation helps us and helps others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It helps everyone in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This fellowship is the fellowship of the apostles, which is today the fellowship of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fellowship today among us is the recovered apostles' fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the churches around the globe are part of the one recovery of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There should not be any boundaries of separation among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some co-workers in the past did have the feeling that a certain area was their territory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But we need to see that it is not healthy or profitable in the Lord's recovery for anyone to have a boundary for his work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The only boundary is the boundary of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not say, "That's my church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That's the work in my territory."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have only one work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That work is the work of the recovery based upon the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The remedy to the problem of so-called boundaries and territories among the churches is the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not have the thought that others coming to our place may disturb our work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not need to defend our work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our work is the Lord's work, which is the recovery's work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need the adequate fellowship among all the churches in all the nations, and we need a clear vision concerning the apostles' teaching and the apostles' fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>E. To Keep the Universal Oneness</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This fellowship is to keep the universal oneness of the Body of Christ John 17:11b, 20-23; Eph 4:3-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Ephesians 4:3 charges us to endeavor to keep the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can keep this oneness because it is our possession already.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have this oneness; thus, we only need to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Regardless of how weak we may be, we still have this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is because we still have the circulation of the "blood," the circulation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we did not have this circulation, we would be spiritually dead.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As long as we have life, regardless of how weak we may be, we have this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is the possession of every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What we need, then, is just to keep this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we keep this oneness, we are in the unique fellowship of the Lord's recovery.</S>
