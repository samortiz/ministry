   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SHEPHERDING THE FLOCK OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 5:2 Peter says, Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not by way of compulsion, but willingly, according to God; not seeking gain by base means, but eagerly.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To shepherd the flock of God requires suffering for the Body of Christ, as Christ suffered Col 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This will be rewarded with the unfading crown of glory 1 Pet 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Literally, the Greek word rendered flock is little flock.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This refers to the church of God Acts 20:28 , which is small in number Luke 12:32 compared to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is a little herb for the supply of life, not a big tree for birds to lodge in Matt 13:31-32 , not a huge religion like Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to this verse, elders are not rulers; they are shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes a shepherd may have to rule the flock, but that is not the ruling of a king.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is a ruling of someone who cares for the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Shepherding is a proper care exercised over the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The flock needs to be cared for, protected, and led in the right direction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They need to be brought to a place where they can eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 5:2 Peter does not tell the elders to shepherd their own flock.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He charges them to shepherd the flock of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The flock is not the elders possession, but God s possession.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In a sense, the elders are employed by God to shepherd His flock.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The elders should not regard the church in which they are taking the lead as belonging to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the New Testament we are told that the church is of Christ, is of God, and is of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church is called the church of Christ, the church of God, and the church of the saints Rom 16:16; 1 Cor 1:2; 14:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the church is not the church of the apostles or the church of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church definitely does not belong either to the apostles or to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But because the church is composed of the saints, it is the church of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because the church has been redeemed by Christ, it is the church of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because the church has been regenerated by God, it is the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, it is possible for an apostle to think since a certain church has been raised up through his ministry, that that church belongs to him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Likewise, the elders may think, because they are taking the lead in the church, that the church is theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But Peter makes it clear that the elders are to shepherd the flock of God, not their own flock.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>OVERSEEING, NOT RULING</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The word overseeing in verse 2 means taking the oversight, looking diligently to be aware of the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Years ago I thought that the overseeing was to observe who is wrong and who is right, who is doing well and who is doing poorly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Later I came to realize that to oversee is mainly a matter of overseeing the need.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, when a shepherd is overseeing the flock, he is not concerned with who is right and who is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is concerned with the need of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His oversight is related to protecting the flock, leading the flock, and feeding the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The shepherd exercises oversight in order to supply the flock with whatever is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Both Peter and Paul use the word oversee.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But they do not use the word rule with respect to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To oversee is to observe the situation, condition, and need.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is to take care of the church with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Parents do not watch over their children in order to find out their faults.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Parents oversee their children in order to protect them and care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because parents have a loving care for their children, they exercise oversight concerning the children s activities.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This does not mean the parents rule the children; it means that the parents protect them and care for them by taking oversight concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The elders must realize that the Lord has not appointed them to be rulers exercising authority over others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Ruling over others is something ugly and base.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The elders should never rule over anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord Jesus said that He is the only Lord and Master and we all are brothers Matt 23:8,10 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that the elders, the leading ones, are also no more than brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>More than a century ago, the so-called Brethren saw this truth, dropped all denominational names, and simply called themselves brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Actually, the title Brethren is a nickname given them by others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the church we all are brothers, and no one should presume to rule over anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 5:2 Peter says that the elders should oversee not by way of compulsion, but willingly, according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The elders should be willing to take care of others, to look after them, to protect them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They should not be compelled to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By the context we can see that to oversee does not mean to rule; it does not mean to be a king.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the natural life, everyone likes to rule over others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is no need to compel someone, to force him, to be a ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The words not by way of compulsion indicate that to oversee is to care for the church, not to rule over it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As Peter says, the elders should oversee willingly, according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To oversee according to God means according to God s nature, desire, way, and glory, not according to man s preference, interest, and purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The elders should not oversee according to their opinion, concept, or likes or dislikes.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Instead, they should oversee according to God s choice, desire, intention, and preference.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The elders must oversee the church altogether according to God s thought, feeling, will, and choice.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They must oversee according to God s likes and dislikes.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Both Paul and Peter speak in their writings concerning elders.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, I would say that what Peter touches in 5:1-4 is even deeper than what Paul touches in 1 Timothy and Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Peter s word here is even more serious than what Paul says.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In 5:2 Peter warns the elders not to seek gain by base means, but to eagerly exercise oversight.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This means that the elders should not take advantage of the eldership and use it as a means to gain money.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They should eagerly take the oversight like parents who eagerly exercise care over their children.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>NOT LORDING IT OVER THE ALLOTMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In verse 3 Peter goes on to say, Nor as lording it over the allotments, but becoming patterns of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To lord it over others is to exercise lordship over those who are ruled Matt 20:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Among the believers, besides Christ there should be no lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All should be servants, even slaves Matt 20:26-27; 23:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The elders in the church can only take the leadership not the lordship , which all the believers should honor and follow 1 Thes 5:12; 1 Tim 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In verse 3 Peter directly tells the elders not to lord it over the church.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>All the elders should be slaves of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is not adequate for the elders even to be servants; they must be slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is something Peter learned from the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Peter heard the Lord Jesus say that those who desire to become great must be slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Elders should regard themselves as slaves, and the brothers and sisters as their masters.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Literally, the word allotments means lots, portions; hence, allotments, portions entrusted.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Here this word refers to the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The churches are God s possession, allotted to the elders as their allotments, their portions, entrusted to them by God for their care.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The church is God s flock and His possession.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The elders have been appointed by God to be shepherds of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Hence, God has allotted the church in their locality to them for their care.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The church in a particular locality is God s possession; it is not the possession of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But God has allotted that church to the elders so that they may care for it and shepherd it.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Furthermore, the church is only allotted to the elders for their care temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>For eternity the church is God s possession.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Even the elders themselves are a part of the church as the possession of God.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Instead of lording it over the allotments, the elders should become patterns of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This means that they take the lead to serve and care for the church so that the believers may follow.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>THE UNFADING CROWN OF GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Verse 4 says, And when the Chief Shepherd is manifested, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>At the apostle s time, crowns were given to victors in athletic games and warfare 1 Cor 9:25; 2 Tim 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Those were corruptible crowns, whose glory faded.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The crown given by the Lord to the faithful elders will be a reward for their loyal service.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The glory of this crown will never fade.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>It will be a portion of the glory for the overcomers enjoyment in the manifestation of the kingdom of God and Christ 2 Pet 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Peter s word to the elders is brief, but it is meaningful and very touching.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I hope that all the elders will take adequate time to delve into these verses in order to touch the depths of the truth revealed here.</S>
