   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 11 DAY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rom 8:29 Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rev 20:4-5 ...And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years....This is the first resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brothers of Christ as the Firstborn Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ was the only begotten Son of God from eternity John 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When He was sent by God into the world, He was still the only begotten Son of God 1 John 4:9; John 1:14; 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By His passing through death and entering into resurrection, His humanity was uplifted into His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, in His divinity with His humanity that passed through death and resurrection, He was born in resurrection as God s firstborn Son Acts 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the same time, all His believers were raised together with Him in His resurrection 1 Pet 1:3 and were begotten together with Him as the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, they became His many brothers to constitute His Body and be God s corporate expression in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>129 Today Christ is not merely the only begotten Son but also the firstborn Son, and we are His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the Firstborn, Christ has both humanity and divinity, and as His brothers we have both divinity and humanity....Therefore, both the Lord Jesus and we are the same in that both He and we have the human nature and the divine nature....</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, we are not, and we never shall be, the same as Christ with respect to His deity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Deity refers to His Godhead, whereas divinity refers to His divine being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to His deity, Christ is still the only begotten Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We, His brothers, participate in His divinity, but we can never partake of His deity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It would be heresy to say that we can partake of Christ s deity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As His brothers, we partake of the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 , and this is to partake of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>130</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Members of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1 Corinthians 6:15 Paul asks, Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because we are organically united with Christ and because Christ dwells in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 and makes His home in our heart Eph 3:17 , our entire being, including our purified body, becomes a member of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To practice such membership we need to offer our body to Him Rom 12:1, 4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ indwells our spirit, and from our spirit He spreads throughout our entire being, thereby making His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, according to Romans 8:11, from our inner being He seeks to impart Himself as life into our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, Christ spreads from the spirit to the soul and from the soul to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this way our bodies become His members.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to our natural constitution, we cannot be members of Christ s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ Himself is the element, the factor, that makes us parts of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, in order to be parts of Christ as members of His Body, we must have Christ wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>131</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Co-kings of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is in resurrection that the believers are co-kings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Speaking of the overcoming believers,...Revelation 20:6 says, Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection....</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>132 The first resurrection is the best one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not only the resurrection of life John 5:29; 1 Cor 15:23b; 1 Thes 4:16 but also the resurrection of reward Luke 14:14 , the out-resurrection, i.e., the outstanding resurrection, which the apostle Paul sought Phil 3:11 , the resurrection of kingship as a reward to the overcomers, which enables them to reign as co-kings with Christ in the millennial kingdom Rev 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>133</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Being co-kings of Christ is in the consummation of the believers maturity in the divine life....Before a prince can be a king, he needs to grow and mature in the kingly life....Likewise, we need to grow in the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually,... when we have reached this maturity we shall be qualified to be co-kings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>134</S>
