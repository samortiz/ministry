<p>Matthew 18:20 says that two or three are gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name. The Lord does not say that two or three meet together. The predicate here is not in the active voice, but in the passive voice, saying that two or three are gathered. This indicates that when we come to meet we should not be the ones who take the initiative. Rather, it must be the Lord who takes the initiative. He gathers us. In the world it is the people who initiate a congregation or a gathering. However, sometimes they are gathered. The government, the school, or a club or society initiates the gathering. The initiators gather the people, and all the attendants are gathered. Our meeting is not initiated by anyone except the Lord Jesus. Every time we meet it should be He who initiates, who gathers us, and we are gathered by Him into His name.</p>
<p>The word into has been wrongly translated as in. According to the best use of the English idiom, no one would say &ldquo;into the name&rdquo;; there is no such idiomatic expression. The translators took care of the language idiom, but they damaged and sacrificed the real meaning of the Greek text. Language is always according to culture. Today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we have a high culture; therefore, we must have a higher idiom. We must say that we are &ldquo;gathered into&rdquo; His name.</p>
<p>This means that if we are not gathered by the Lord, we remain in so many other things. We are occupied, detained, kept, and to some extent imprisoned by many things. We are kept in our families, and in our business, and even by our family and by our business. Wives are kept by their husbands, husbands are kept by their wives, and children are kept by their parents. If there were not the gathering of the Lord among us, who would come to the meeting regularly? Many capturing things, many imprisoning and retaining things, such as your tiredness, your office, and your overtime work hours, are the detaining power to keep you from the meetings. Therefore, we need a powerful One to rescue us, to bring us out from all these occupations, and to gather us into His name. In the New Testament &ldquo;His name&rdquo; always denotes His Person. Whenever we meet, we should be gathered out of many different occupations and gathered into the very living Person of the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>The Brethren stress this verse very much. They say that all the denominations meet in their denominational name, such as the Lutherans meeting in Luther&rsquo;s name and the Wesleyans in Wesley&rsquo;s name. They declare and boast that they meet in the name of the Lord Jesus, taking His name. I do not oppose that teaching, yet it does not reveal the depths of the truth. The Lord gathers us <em>into</em> Himself. When we are meeting, we are meeting in Him because we have been gathered out of so many occupations and gathered into this living Person. This is a basic principle of meeting for any kind of meeting&mdash;for prayer, for the Lord&rsquo;s table, for the reading of the Word, or for edification, for building up. Whatever kind of meeting&mdash;small ones, big ones, in the homes, in the halls&mdash;the principle is first that we are gathered out of all kinds of occupations into the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>Quite often even when we are in the meeting we are still not gathered; we still remain in our occupation, in our study of our textbooks, or in our care of our children. We are in the meeting, but we are occupied by things other than the Lord. Therefore, we need this gathering, this rescuing. We need to be rescued by the Lord out of so many occupying things and gathered into His name, that is, into Himself as a living Person. This is a strong point. I hope that the elders from the different churches would have some meetings to show the saints how to take care of these basic principles of meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING IN MUTUALITY AND IN SPEAKING</h2>
<p>In every meeting we should keep the principle of mutuality. The Devil has plotted to annul the mutuality in Christian meetings. All the denominations hold their meetings with one or two speakers plus several assistants helping in music, prayer, and in reading the Bible. This is one-sided. The entire congregation is the audience, keeping silent with hardly any function. There is hardly any mutuality. However, if you would read the New Testament again you could see that the Christian meeting is altogether a meeting in mutuality, a matter of one to another. In 1 Corinthians 14:26 one has a teaching, another has a revelation, another has a psalm, another has a tongue, and another has an interpretation. All these are in mutuality. There is not simply one or a few who function. There is no distinction between laymen and clergy. All are functioning members in mutuality. Hebrews 10:25 encourages us not to stay away from the meetings, but to be &ldquo;exhorting one another.&rdquo; This indicates that the Christian meetings have to be in mutuality. When we all say something, the meeting is altogether mutual, not one-sided.</p>
<p>Speaking is another principle in the Christian meetings. Everyone should speak. In the New Testament even singing is considered as speaking. Ephesians 5:19 says, &ldquo;Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&rdquo; Our singing is a kind of speaking. We speak something by singing. In ancient times the saints spoke the hymns in the meetings. Today Christians in their meetings often use the Psalms. In the ancient times psalms were mainly put to music for singing, but today many Christians use the Psalms not for singing, but simply for reading or speaking. They do not have the habit of speaking from their hymnal. We have been influenced by this tradition. We take psalms by speaking, but we do not use our hymnal by speaking. Whenever we call a hymn, everyone will sing it unless we say otherwise. It is understood that when one calls a hymn, we should sing it. We have to change our habit. When we call a hymn, I now prefer that we speak it first.</p>
<p>I hope that from now on all you brothers who take the lead would try to practice speaking. Quite often when we speak a hymn it means quite much to us. It may be more significant than singing it. Often when people sing a hymn, they pay attention to the music, to the melody, instead of the words. It is somewhat of a distraction to sing it. However, when you speak it, there are no distractions. We take the words in a pure way. If you use the words plus the music, it is hard to conquer the music. The music may conquer the words. To avoid this kind of conquering, it is better to speak.</p>
<p>To speak means more than to sing. Even to read is not so significant as to speak. Speaking the hymns has been nearly killed, annulled, in Christian practice today. We must come back to the practice revealed in the pure Word. Ephesians 5:19 says to speak the hymns to one another. In mutuality, I speak to you and you have to speak back to me. This is quite meaningful. The first time I proposed speaking the hymns was in Jakarta, Indonesia in 1968. That was a wonderful experience of Ephesians 5:19. The major item in our meetings is not the singing but the speaking. The teachers must be speaking, the prophets must be speaking, and all the saints attending the meeting must function by speaking. Your function in the meeting is altogether a matter of speaking. Even to give a testimony is to speak.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 08: The Life-Pulse of the Lord's Present Move &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
