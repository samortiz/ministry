   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S INTENTION TO HAVE A MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s intention on earth is to have a man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eventually, He Himself became a man, and today on the throne He is still a man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>People may want to be like God, but God wants to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God s intention is to work Himself into us, making us the same as He is, and even more, making Himself the same as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, God s intention is to have a man and to work Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that the Lord is still on the throne as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the book of Ezekiel, the term the son of man is used more than ninety times.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates how much God desires to have a man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we would live out God and express God, we need to be a man and have the appearance of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ezekiel 1:5 says that the four living creatures have the appearance of a man, and verse 26 says that the One on the throne has the appearance of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The crucial point here is that because man was created in the image of God in order to express God, only man is like God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A person must have the appearance of a man in order to live out the image of God and therefore express God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we want to live out God and express God, we must be a man and have the appearance of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anyone who does not have the appearance of a man cannot express God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The One on the throne and the four living creatures both have the appearance of a man, indicating that the four living creatures on earth are the expression of the One on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Chapter one of Ezekiel is the deepest chapter in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The thought in this chapter is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have seen that the throne is above a clear sky, above a spiritual and heavenly expanse, or firmament.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God s grace works upon a group of people to such an extent that their condition now is the very condition of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this condition, indicated by a sky that is crystal clear, the throne of God is present.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The place of the throne is the place where heaven and earth are connected.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because with the living creatures on earth there is a throne above a clear sky, God is not only the God of heaven but also the God of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through these living creatures, who have the throne over their heads, heaven and earth are joined.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Ezekiel 1 the One on the throne is the union of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, the place where the throne is, is the place where heaven and earth are joined.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The One on the throne is God, but He manifests the appearance of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was God manifest in the flesh, for He was the God-man and had the appearance of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Inwardly, He was God, but His appearance on earth was the appearance of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now, as the One on the throne after His ascension, He is still the God-man; He is God, yet with the appearance of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the church life today, there should be a condition where God is manifested in man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that in the church we should have not only a clear sky with a throne and the Lord on the throne but also the expression in man of the One who is on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When this is the condition of the church, there will be in the church the great mystery of godliness God manifested in the flesh 1 Tim 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, there are a clear sky, a throne, and the Lord on the throne; on the other hand, the Lord s manifestation in the church is in the appearance of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the church life there should be the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order for this to be the situation, there must be in the church the glorious union of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Inwardly we should have God, but God is manifested in the flesh, manifested in and through a normal and proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All those in the church life the brothers and the sisters, the elderly ones and the young ones should behave in a way that is normal and fitting for their respective ages.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead of pretense, there should a genuineness that is both human and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the condition of God being manifested in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God s eternal plan is to connect heaven and earth and to join God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God in heaven wants to gain man on earth for His expression by working Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The desire of God s heart is to reach the one goal of connecting heaven and earth and of joining God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Where there is such a condition, there is the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The One sitting on the throne is God, but His manifestation has the appearance of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God s eternal plan is to have such a manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the church today we need to be in a condition where God is manifested in the appearance of a man.</S>
