<p>The greatest commission God has given to us is to preach the gospel. This was the Lord&rsquo;s final charge after His resurrection at the time of His ascension.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations.&rdquo;</strong>  Matthew 28:19</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. WHAT IS PREACHING THE GOSPEL?</h2>
<p>1. BEING THE LORD&rsquo;S WITNESSES</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;You shall be My [the Lord&rsquo;s] witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth.&rdquo;</strong>  Acts 1:8</p>
<p>The believers are those who know the Lord and have received Him. As such they are the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses.</p>
<p>2. BEARING FRUIT</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I [the Lord] am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit.&rdquo;</strong>  John 15:5</p>
<p>Every saved person is a branch in the true vine, which is the Lord Himself. The sole responsibility of a branch is to bear fruit. Hence, preaching the gospel is the result of the overflow of the inner life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE SECRET OF PREACHING<br />
THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>1. BE BURDENED</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I am debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish. So, as far as depends on me, I am ready to preach the gospel to you.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 1:14-15</p>
<p>We are all debtors in the gospel. To a certain extent we are all indebted to our relatives, friends, and schoolmates in the gospel.</p>
<p>2. HAVE THE SPIRIT OF THE GOSPEL</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;That I might by all means save some.&rdquo;</strong>  1 Corinthians 9:22</p>
<p>Concerning our debt in the gospel we need to <strong>pray much</strong> to kindle the fire of the gospel, that we would love men and be concerned for the sinners&rsquo; salvation.</p>
<p>3. BE BOLD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;To make known in boldness the mystery of the gospel.&rdquo;</strong>  Ephesians 6:19</p>
<p>Only those who are burning in spirit and have no self-consciousness can preach the gospel for the Lord. For this reason we must exercise ourselves not to be ashamed and be bold to testify for the Lord.</p>
<p>4. SPEAK</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;For we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard.&rdquo;</strong>  Acts 4:20</p>
<p>Preaching the gospel depends on the testimony of our daily life, and it also depends on the preaching of the word. The reason for this is:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;How then shall they call upon Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without one who preaches?&rdquo;</strong>   Romans 10:14</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s faith comes by hearing the word of the Lord. But his hearing the word of the Lord depends on someone&rsquo;s speaking.</p>
<p>Hence, to preach the gospel is not only to bring people to hear the gospel, but also to speak to them. Only by speaking continually will the gospel be spread. Furthermore, the more you speak, the more your daily walk will be changed.</p>
<p>5. HAVE FAITH</p>
<p>Regardless to whom, at what time, or in what place we preach, we must have faith to believe that:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;It [the gospel] is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believes.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 1:16</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;[God] desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth.&rdquo;</strong>  1 Timothy 2:4</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. BEING EQUIPPED<br />
FOR GOSPEL PREACHING</h2>
<p>1. KNOW THE BIBLE WELL</p>
<p>Memorize some suitable and effective verses, such as:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And what if He [God] should make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory?&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 9:23</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo;</strong>  1 Corinthians 15:45b</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;He who has the Son has the life.&rdquo;</strong> 1 John 5:12</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life.&rdquo;</strong> John 4:14</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name.&rdquo;</strong>  John 1:12</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;That if you confess with your mouth, Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from among the dead, you shall be saved.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 10:9</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo;</strong>  Mark 16:16</p>
<p>2. READ MORE BOOKS ON THE TRUTHS OF THE GOSPEL</p>
<p>There are three basic books. They are: (1) <em>The Basic Truths of the Bible (Vol. 1),</em> (2) <em>Gospel Outlines,</em> and (3) <em>How to Lead Different Kinds of People to Receive the Gospel.</em> In addition, other gospel booklets such as <em>There Is a God</em> and <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> are also very practical.</p>
<p>3. FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH TWO KINDS OF HYMNS</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) <strong>Gospel hymns,</strong> such as hymn 1068, &ldquo;Oh, the love that sought me!&rdquo; and hymn 1024, &ldquo;You need Jesus!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) <strong>Hymns on assurance of salvation,</strong> such as hymn 309, &ldquo;Since Jesus came into my heart,&rdquo; and hymn 322, &ldquo;Drinking at the fountain that never runs dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The best way to preach the gospel to others is by singing. When we sing with overflowing joy, it is difficult for others not to be attracted and moved.</p>
<p>4. USE GOSPEL TRACTS</p>
<p>Gospel tracts are not limited by time or space, for they can be distributed everywhere, and they are a very convenient means of helping people to be saved.</p>
<p>Since we have these tools for preaching the gospel, we should equip ourselves with them properly and utilize them skillfully to preach more.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>New Life Lessons, Vol. 1 &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
