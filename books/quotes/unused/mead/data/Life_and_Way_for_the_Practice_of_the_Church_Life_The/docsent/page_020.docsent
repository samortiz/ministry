   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let me share a little testimony with you.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Just before I came here this evening, around suppertime, I was with the Lord considering the message tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I had prepared a message which was different from what I am speaking now.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I had everything ready for that message, but I sensed a darkness in me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Somehow I was in a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then when I was with the Lord, the sense came to me that I had to give the message which I am speaking here tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I said to the Lord, "Lord, no doubt, I will go along with You."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Right away within me it was transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The cloud was lifted and the sky became clear.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How do you know that you are going along with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just by checking in this way, "Am I clear?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Or am I cloudy, smoggy, foggy?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you have the cloud, the smog, or the fog, that means there is something between you and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You are on the wrong track.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You need to be adjusted within.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some brothers like to make jokes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I would ask you, "After you make a joke, do you feel you are clear within?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Or do you sense you are foggy, smoggy?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is nothing wrong with your morality when you make jokes, but if you are a person who jokes too much, I am sure you are a person not taking Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you are one who takes Christ all the time as life, you will not joke, because the life of Christ is not a joking life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Joking is unbecoming to the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I use this illustration to show you how you can know whether you are in the flow or not, whether you are in the transparent spirit or under the clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When you take Christ as your life, you have joy, and you have the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now let us consider the law of life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The life is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With any kind of life, in principle, there is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The divine life, which is Christ Himself, is the very law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ within you is not just the life, the light, the fellowship, and the joy, but also the law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have an inner, living regulating.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have some regulations within you, not written in word but written in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The inner regulating of this life is deep, strict, and fine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You know what is right and what is wrong; you know what you should do and what you should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You know because you have the regulating within you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since I learned the lesson of the inner law of life, I realize one thing there is no need for you and me to tell people what is right and what is wrong, what to do and what not to do.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever a saint comes to me and asks me something about good or evil, right or wrong, I always answer him by asking, "How do you feel?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You know the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is a living rule within you, and this living rule is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is not only the life, the light, and the flow; He is also the law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Old Testament times God gave Moses the Ten Commandments as the law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That law is the description, the definition, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By that law we know what kind of God He is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But today in the New Testament times, God Himself comes into us as the law.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The old law of letters consisted of words written as the description of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today God Himself comes into us as the living law.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is something subjective, something inside of us; it is not something objective, something outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Himself, the living One, is the law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What kind of relationship should you have with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not according to the regulations of the so-called church or according to doctrinal teachings, but according to the inner regulating.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Old Testament times, an Israelite could do a lot of good things, and he could even sacrifice himself and all that he had for others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In spite of all the good things that he had done, if he did something against the law, he still had a problem before God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today it is the same with us related to the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are not right with the inner regulating, no matter how many good things we may have done, we know there is a problem within between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Maybe we would preach the gospel, minister the word, and do a lot of things to help others, but we know there is a problem between us and God because we are wrong with the inner regulating.</S>
