He has shown how He graces His children in many ways in the church in K'un-ming. We should give blessing, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power, and might to our God forever and ever, amen.</p><p>(1) The meeting hall: We used to rent a meeting hall at 39 Hwa-Shan South Road in K'un-ming. However, our landlord decided to build a house on some empty land nearby, and he wanted to use the building as a workplace for the carpenters. Therefore, we had to rent another meeting place. Because of the political situation, many people from other provinces moved to Yunnan, making it difficult to rent a proper building. The brothers and sisters looked to God and prayed. Thank the Lord, He is Jehovah-jireh. In a surprisingly short time, He led us to a new, well-lighted and well-ventilated building that can hold about one hundred fifty people. The location is also good. It is in the middle section of Tung-Ren Street in K'un-ming at the east end of Yen-Tse Lane. It does not have a number because it is a new building.</p><p>(2) The meetings: In addition to the table meeting and the gospel meeting on the Lord's Day, there are prayer meetings every Tuesday and Saturday evening at 7:00 p.m. There is a Bible study or testimony meeting every Thursday evening at 7:00 p.m. By the Lord's protection, these meetings have never stopped during the past year, starting in March. Before we found a meeting hall, we met in a brother's house. When we began the table last year, there were a little over ten brothers and sisters. Thank and praise God for His operation. The number of saved ones has increased gradually. Now more than thirty brothers and sisters attend the table meeting. Before Brother K. H. Weigh came to Yunnan, we had Brother Lin Kwang-tsao lead the gospel meetings on the Lord's Day. Afterward, three brothers led it in rotation. At that time there were only twenty or thirty people who would come to hear the gospel (including the brothers and sisters). Thank the Lord, the number has increased, and now eighty or ninety come to hear the gospel (including the brothers and sisters). From February 7-13 of this year, several workers for the Lord held gospel meetings in the meeting hall. Thank the Lord, many believed and received Him. Brother Weigh has decided that on the eighteenth of this month he will have some edification meetings for several evenings in a row.</p><p>(3) Marvelous miracles: When the brothers were preaching the gospel in rotation, a Miss Lee began to attend the meetings. When she was at home, a piece of earth fell from the ceiling and hit her on the head, injuring her brain. She frequently had headaches after this accident. She went to both Western and Chinese doctors, but to no avail. The doctors said that there was no hope of recovery. They exhorted her to give up her studies and take a long rest. When she heard this, she was desperate. Her classmate introduced her to the gospel meetings. Thank and praise the almighty God for leading her to come to the gospel meeting again and again. She received the Lord Jesus as her Savior. One day she was reading in Psalm 103:3, which says, "He pardons all your iniquities;/He heals all your diseases." When she read it, she realized that God was not only her Savior but also her doctor. She prayed desperately that God would heal her sickness and pain. Thank and praise God for listening to her prayer and healing her. Now she is normal and back in school. She also comes to break bread with us. There is another Sister Lee who had been oppressed by demons for many years before she believed in the Lord. She really felt that human life was a suffering. When the evil spirits acted up, she could not sleep for nights. She would lose her temper, get extremely angry, and even hit herself. It seemed as if she was possessed by a demon. Since receiving the truth and believing, she has become very peaceful and happy by relying on the Lord. She was once bound by Satan, but now she has received a wonderful freedom. These are the miracles that the Lord's grace has bestowed upon sinners. Hallelujah!</p><p>(4) Offerings: In the past the offerings from the brothers and sisters did not do much more than cover all the expenses; at the end of the year not much was left. But the church is the house of God, and there should never be a lack. When man has no way, God has a way. The deposit on the meeting hall is very large, and there was not enough in our bank account. The brothers and sisters prayed that God would touch His children to do their best to make an offering. Thank and praise Jehovah-Jireh, on the last Lord's Day before the Chinese New Year, there was enough money in the offering box, including two pieces of gold jewelry and the addition of our bank savings, to more than pay for the deposit and the rent. There was even quite a bit left over. Thank God that His grace exceeds our need. The furnishings inside the meeting hall are sufficient. The Lord supplied all the necessary things by touching His children to cheerfully give. Although what we have mentioned pertains to material offerings, it shows that the brothers and sisters care very much for the house of God.</p><p>(5) Baptisms: Since we began meeting in K'un-ming, those who have believed and been saved have not been baptized. If we continue to delay, it will not be very good. We have already prepared a metal baptistry framed in wood. A baptism meeting will soon be held. More than ten people want to be baptized. We hope that God will give grace on the one hand, and that the Lord will touch those who have not obeyed yet to be willing to render this testimony on the other hand (Mark 16:16).</p>
