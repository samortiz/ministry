   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONSCIENCE WILL NOT LET GO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we sin, our conscience also does not let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometimes when the conscience is hushed, we do not sense too much guilt.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But though the conscience may sleep, it never dies!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The minute the conscience awakes, it convicts us of our sins and makes us feel very uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Perhaps it is silent today, but it will not shut up forever.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It will never let go of what we have done in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>FORGIVENESS BASED ON RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, God cannot forgive our sins lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we sin carelessly and God forgives our sins irresponsibly, then God Himself falls into sin in His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This does not mean that God does not have the power to forgive sins, but it means that God can only grant forgiveness when it comes up to His dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He cannot degrade Himself to a state of unrighteousness in the process of forgiving our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is forever the righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Kaifeng, I met a Christian by the name of Wen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was the chief officer of a certain department in the government.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One day he invited me to dinner and mentioned a difficult situation that confronted him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Within his department a few persons were known to have engaged in a fraud that involved more than ten thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The act was brought into the light, and the guilty persons were arrested.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The law of the department said that anyone involved in a fraud that exceeded five thousand dollars was to be executed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the law, such men had to die.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Wen said to me, "As a Christian, I am very reluctant to put people to death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If I forgive them, I myself become guilty of breaking the law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, I cannot bear the thought of executing men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is my dilemma.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What would you say?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I could not think of any way to save them either.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The law is absolute!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is no way around it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As Christians we cannot violate the law and fall into unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet, if we uphold our righteousness, we sacrifice others' lives.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>GOD HAS JUDGED CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How then did God forgive our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible shows us that we not only received forgiveness in our salvation, but we obtained justification as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many times the Bible puts forgiveness and justification together.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These constitute the two initial steps towards the receiving of a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let us take a closer look at the matter of forgiveness and justification.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to come back to Christ because He is the key to all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God regards Christ as the Head of a new race.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is the second man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is also the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first Adam was a huge man incorporating the whole of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When he sinned, the whole human race was corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God executed His judgment on one person, Christ, because Christ also is a huge corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who are included in Him bear all the judgment of God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this reason, the Bible says that when Christ died, He died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not die as individuals; we die in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His death included all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>With this death our sins can be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, God's forgiveness is based upon His judgment in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not irresponsible forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, this is very just.</S>
