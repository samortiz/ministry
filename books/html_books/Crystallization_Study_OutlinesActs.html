<h1 class="title">The Intrinsic Significance of the Book of Acts<br />
and<br />
Witnesses of the Resurrection of the Lord Jesus</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 1:8-11, 14, 22;<br />
2:24, 32-33; 4:33; 10:39-40; 26:16</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>We need to see the intrinsic significance of the book of Acts:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Acts of the Apostles is a book without an ending; this book is still being continued, because Acts is a record of the work of God, who is always advancing and never stops&mdash;28:30-31.</li>
	<li>In the book of Acts the disciples are the continuation of the Lord Jesus&mdash;1:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord brought the disciples with Him into His death and resurrection; this means that they passed through the same processes through which the Lord Jesus passed&mdash;Rom. 6:6; Eph. 2:5-6.</li>
		<li>By passing through the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection, His disciples became His continuation; this continuation is unveiled in the book of Acts&mdash;1:14.</li>
		<li>By replacing the disciples with Himself, the Lord Jesus made them His reproduction; therefore, they became His increase, development, enlargement, and continuation&mdash;the church as His extension in time and His spread in space&mdash;John 12:24; 14:19; Gal. 2:20; Acts 8:1; 9:31.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The book of Acts is a record of a group of people who are resurrected and ascended with Christ, having Christ within them as their life and Christ upon them as their power and authority; they live by the Triune God within them as their life, and they act by the Triune God upon them as their strength, power, and authority&mdash;John 20:22; Luke 24:49; Acts 1:8.</li>
	<li>Acts is a record of a group of people who act and work in the Body, through the Body, and for the Body&mdash;v. 14; 13:1-4a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Acts reveals the move and activity of the Body, not of individual actions unrelated to the Body&mdash;8:1-17.</li>
		<li>Acts contains a beautiful picture of the one accord in the activities and work of the believers who moved in the Body, through the Body, and for the Body&mdash;2:44-47; 4:24, 32; 13:1-4a; 16:1-5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The book of Acts shows us the divine stream, the unique flow; there is only one stream, one current, of the flow&mdash;Gen. 2:8-12; Rev. 22:1-2; Acts 2:33.</li>
	<li>In Acts there is a group of people who know the meaning of resurrection and ascension, who live by Christ as their life, who act by Christ as their power and authority, and who realize that they are the Body and act in the Body and for the Body in the one divine stream; this is the intrinsic significance of the book of Acts&mdash;John 20:22; Acts 1:8-11, 14; 2:1-4, 24, 32-33; 4:33.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The apostles and disciples were witnesses of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus&mdash;1:8, 22; 2:24, 32; 4:2, 33; 10:39-40; 17:3, 18; 23:11; 24:14-15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To carry out His heavenly ministry for the propagating of Himself so that the kingdom of God might be established for the building up of the churches as His fullness, the ascended Christ uses not a group of preachers trained by man&rsquo;s teaching to do a preaching work but a body of His witnesses, who bear a living testimony of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ&mdash;1:8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The apostles and disciples were the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses (lit., martyrs); all the apostles and disciples in Acts were His martyrs, His witnesses, of this kind&mdash;v. 8; 2:40; 10:39-41; 22:20; 23:11; 26:16.</li>
		<li>In His ascension the Lord carries out His ministry in the heavens through these martyrs, in His resurrection life and with His ascension power and authority, as recorded in Acts, to spread Himself as the development of the kingdom of God from Jerusalem unto the uttermost part of the earth&mdash;1:8.</li>
		<li>Testifying requires experiences of seeing and enjoyment concerning the Lord or spiritual things; it is different from merely teaching&mdash;2:40.</li>
		<li>Paul was appointed as a minister and a witness&mdash;26:16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>A minister is for the ministry; a witness, for the testimony.</li>
			<li>The ministry is related mainly to the work, to what a minister does; a testimony is related to the person, to what a witness is.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Luke&rsquo;s narration, as an account of the Lord&rsquo;s move on earth, stresses not doctrine but the testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses; hence, in his narration there are no details related to doctrine; rather, there are details regarding the things that happened to His witnesses, in order to portray the testimonies of their lives&mdash;27:21; 1:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s resurrection was the focus of the apostles&rsquo; testimony&mdash;1:22; 2:32; 3:13, 15, 26; 10:39-40; 13:33; 17:3, 18: 
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The resurrection of the Lord Jesus points back to His incarnation, humanity, human living on the earth, and God-ordained death, and His resurrection points forward to His ascension, ministry and administration in heaven, and coming back&mdash;2:23; 1:9-11.</li>
		<li>The Lord is both God and resurrection, possessing the indestructible life&mdash;John 1:1; 11:25; Heb. 7:16; Acts 2:24:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Since He is such an ever-living One, death is not able to hold Him.</li>
			<li>He delivered Himself to death, but death had no way to detain Him; rather, death was defeated by Him, and He rose up from it&mdash;Rev. 1:18.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The apostles were witnesses of the resurrected Christ, not only in word but also by their life and action, especially bearing witness of His resurrection; bearing witness of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is the crucial point, the focus, in carrying out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;Acts 2:32; 4:33; 10:39-40; 17:3.</li>
		<li>God glorified His Servant Jesus through His resurrection and in His ascension&mdash;Luke 24:46; Eph. 1:20-22; Phil. 2:9-11; Acts 3:13, 15, 26; 4:10, 33; 5:30-31.</li>
		<li>Resurrection was a birth to the man Jesus&mdash;13:33:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>He was begotten by God in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God among many brothers&mdash;Rom. 1:3-4; 8:29.</li>
			<li>He was the only begotten Son of God from eternity; after incarnation, through resurrection He was begotten by God in His humanity to be God&rsquo;s firstborn Son&mdash;John 1:18; 3:16; Rom. 8:29; Heb. 1:6.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We need to know the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection&mdash;Eph. 1:19; Phil. 3:10:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In His resurrection the Lord Jesus broke through all barriers, even the greatest barrier of all&mdash;death&mdash;Rom. 6:9; Rev. 1:18; Eph. 1:19-20:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Death is the greatest limitation, but resurrection has conquered death; thus, resurrection is the greatest power of all&mdash;Acts 2:24.</li>
				<li>2) In His resurrection the Lord Jesus transcended time and space&mdash;Eph. 1:19-21.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>The power of resurrection, and even resurrection itself, is now in the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; Phil. 1:19.</li>
			<li>Ephesians 1:19-20 speaks of the surpassing greatness of God&rsquo;s power toward us who believe; this is the resurrection power manifested by God in Christ through His raising Him from the dead.</li>
			<li>The church is the place where God demonstrates the operation of the might of His strength, according to the power which He caused to operate in Christ&mdash;vv. 19-20:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) The church is the same as the resurrected Christ not only in nature but also in power&mdash;vv. 19-22; 3:16; 6:10.</li>
				<li>2) The church is the depository and storehouse of the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection&mdash;Phil. 3:10.</li>
				<li>3) The church is the same as Christ in resurrection and should be as unlimited and victorious as Christ is&mdash;Eph. 1:19-23.</li>
				<li>4) If two or three see this revelation, touch the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, and pray in one accord, they will shake the ends of the earth&mdash;Matt. 18:18-20; Acts 1:14; 4:23-33.</li>
				</ol></li>

<h1 class="title">One Accord</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:24, 32; 5:12; 15:25;<br />
Rom. 15:5-6; 1 Cor. 1:10</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed for oneness, in Ephesians 2 He died to produce oneness, in John 20 He breathed the Spirit into us as the essence of oneness, and in Acts 1 we have the application of oneness.</li>
<li>The genuine one accord in the church is the practice of the oneness of the Body, which is the oneness of the Spirit&mdash;Eph. 4:3-6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The practice of the genuine one accord in the church is the application of the oneness; when oneness is practiced, it becomes one accord&mdash;Acts 1:14; 2:46.</li>
	<li>The landmark that divides the Gospels and the Acts is the one accord among the one hundred twenty&mdash;Acts 1:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>They had become one in the Body, and in that oneness they continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer&mdash;Eph. 4:3-6; Acts 1:14.</li>
		<li>When the apostles and the believers practiced the church life, they practiced it in one accord&mdash;2:46; 4:24, 32; 5:12; 15:25.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we practice the principle of the Body, we will have the one accord, for the one accord is the Body&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5; 15:5-6; 1 Cor. 12:12-13, 20, 27; 1:10.</li>
	<li>One accord is the master key to every blessing in the New Testament&mdash;Eph. 1:3; Psa. 133:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In order to receive God&rsquo;s blessing we must practice the oneness by the one accord&mdash;v. 1.</li>
		<li>The blessing of God can come only upon a situation of one accord, the practice of the oneness.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>One accord refers to the harmony in our inner being, in our mind and will&mdash;Acts 1:14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In Acts 1:14 the Greek word <em>homothumadon,</em> used for &ldquo;one accord,&rdquo; is strong and all-inclusive:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This word comes from <em>homo,</em> &ldquo;same,&rdquo; and <em>thumos,</em> &ldquo;mind, will, purpose (soul, heart)&rdquo; and denotes a harmony of feeling in one&rsquo;s entire being.</li>
		<li>We should be in the same mind and the same will with the same purpose around and within our soul and heart; this means that our entire being is involved.</li>
		<li>For the one hundred twenty to be in one accord meant that their entire beings were one&mdash;v. 14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In Matthew 18:19 the Greek word <em>sumphoneo</em> is used to signify the one accord:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This word means &ldquo;to be in harmony, or accord&rdquo; and refers to the harmonious sound of musical instruments or voices; the harmony of inward feeling among the believers is like a harmonious melody.</li>
		<li>When we have one accord, we become a pleasing melody to God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The practice of the oneness&mdash;the one accord&mdash;is according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching&mdash;Acts 2:42, 46:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>There was one accord among the believers, and those who were in one accord continued steadfastly in the apostles&rsquo; teaching&mdash;v. 42.</li>
	<li>The apostles taught the same thing to all the saints in all the places and in all the churches; today we also must teach the same thing in all the churches in every country throughout the earth&mdash;1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17; 11:16; 14:33b-34; Matt. 28:19-20.</li>
	<li>The prohibition against sowing two kinds of seed in one&rsquo;s vineyard may typify the prohibition against teaching differently in the church&mdash;Deut. 22:9; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; 6:3; cf. Luke 8:11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church is God&rsquo;s vineyard, and in this vineyard only one kind of seed, one kind of teaching, should be sown&mdash;1 Cor. 3:9b; Acts 2:42.</li>
		<li>If we teach differently, sowing more than one kind of seed, the &ldquo;produce&rdquo; in the church will be forfeited.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In practicing the one accord, we need to be in one spirit with one soul&mdash;Phil. 1:27; 2:2, 5; 4:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We should be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion; this is to be one in our soul&mdash;1 Cor. 1:10; Phil. 1:27; 2:2, 5; 4:2.</li>
	<li>To be in one accord is to be one in our whole being; this results in our being one in our outward speaking&mdash;Rom. 15:5-6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To have one mind and one mouth means that we have only one Head&mdash;Christ; we should think with the mind of Christ and speak with the mouth of the Head&mdash;Col. 1:18a; Phil. 2:2, 5; 4:2.</li>
		<li>Whenever we are in one accord, we speak with one mouth&mdash;Rom. 15:6.</li>
		<li><em>With one accord</em> and <em>with one mouth</em> mean that even though we are many and all are speaking, we all &ldquo;speak the same thing&rdquo;&mdash;1 Cor. 1:10.</li>
		<li>The only way to be with one accord and one mouth is to allow Christ the room to be everything in our heart and in our mouth so that God may be glorified&mdash;Eph. 3:17a, 21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to be in one accord we need to have one heart and one way&mdash;Jer. 32:39; Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The believers should have one heart&mdash;to love God, to seek God, to live God, and to be constituted with God so that we may be His expression&mdash;and one way&mdash;the Triune God Himself as the inner law of life with its divine capacity&mdash;Mark 12:30; 2 Cor. 13:14; Eph. 3:16-17; Jer. 31:33-34; John 14:6a.</li>
	<li>Divisions result from having a heart for something other than Christ and taking a way other than Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 1:13a; 2:2; Col. 2:8; Acts 15:35-40.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>If we would have one accord, there should be only one &ldquo;scale&rdquo; in the church life&mdash;Deut. 25:13-16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To condemn a certain thing in others while justifying the same thing in ourselves indicates that we have different weights and measures, that is, different scales&mdash;one scale for measuring others and a different scale for measuring ourselves.</li>
	<li>The practice of having different scales is the source of disaccord, but if we have only one scale, we will keep the oneness and one accord in the church&mdash;Eph. 4:1-3; Matt. 7:1-5.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>For the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date move, all the churches need to be in one accord; we should all voice the same thing, trumpet the same thing, teach the same thing, and be the same in practice&mdash;Josh. 1:16-18; 6:1-16; Acts 2:42; 4:24, 32; 1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17; 11:16; 14:33b-34; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; 6:3.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Holy Spirit in Acts&mdash;<br />
the Essential Spirit of Resurrection Life<br />
and the Economical Spirit of Ascension Power,<br />
the Baptism in the Holy Spirit,<br />
and the Inward and Outward Filling of the Spirit</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 24:49; John 20:22;<br />
Acts 1:5, 8; 2:4, 33; 4:8; 6:3; 13:52; 1 Cor. 12:13</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The Scriptures reveal that there are two aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit: the inward aspect for life&mdash;the essential Spirit&mdash;and the outward aspect for power and authority&mdash;the economical Spirit&mdash;John 14:17; 20:22; Luke 24:49; Acts 1:5, 8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Essential</em> refers to the existence, to the being, and to the life for existence; <em>economical</em> refers to work, function, and power.</li>
	<li>As a man, Christ Himself experienced these two aspects of the Holy Spirit:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He was born of the Holy Spirit essentially for His being and living, and He was anointed with the Holy Spirit economically for His ministry and move&mdash;Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:18, 20; 3:16; Luke 4:18.</li>
		<li>The essential Spirit was within Him, and the economical Spirit was upon Him&mdash;Matt. 1:18, 20; Luke 4:18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In principle, both aspects of the Spirit are the same with us as they were with the Lord Jesus; every believer in Christ should experience both aspects of the Spirit&mdash;24:49; John 14:17; 20:22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Inwardly we need to drink of the Holy Spirit for life, and outwardly we need to be clothed with the Holy Spirit for power and authority&mdash;1 Cor. 12:13; Luke 24:49; Acts 1:5, 8.</li>
		<li>Inwardly we need the breath of the Holy Spirit breathed into us for life, and outwardly we need the wind of the Holy Spirit blowing upon us for power&mdash;John 20:22; Acts 2:2, 4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The inward aspect is the Holy Spirit as life within us&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 11.</li>
			<li>The outward aspect is the Holy Spirit as power upon us&mdash;Acts 1:8.</li>
			<li>As believers, we need the Spirit of life inwardly and the Spirit of power outwardly; we must be filled inwardly with the Spirit as life and clothed outwardly with the Holy Spirit as power&mdash;Eph. 5:18; Luke 24:49.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>To experience the Spirit as our life for our spiritual being and existence is essential; to experience the Spirit as power for our spiritual work and function is economical&mdash;Rom. 8:11; Luke 24:49; Acts 1:5, 8:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>On the day of resurrection, the Lord breathed the Spirit of life into the disciples; this is essential&mdash;John 20:22.</li>
			<li>On the day of Pentecost, the Lord poured out the Spirit of power upon the disciples; this is economical&mdash;Acts 2:1-4.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Regarding the Spirit of life, we need to breathe Him in as the breath; regarding the Spirit of power, we need to put Him on as the uniform, typified by the mantle of Elijah&mdash;John 20:22; Luke 24:49; 2 Kings 2:9, 13-15:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The former, like the water of life, requires our drinking; the latter, like the water of baptism, requires our being immersed&mdash;John 7:37-39; Acts 1:5.</li>
			<li>The essential indwelling of the Spirit of life and the economical outpouring of the Spirit of power are the two aspects of the one Spirit for our experience&mdash;1 Cor. 12:13; <em>Hymns,</em> #278.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The baptism in the Holy Spirit is the outpouring of the consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive compound Spirit by the Head upon His Body&mdash;Luke 24:49; Acts 1:5, 8; 2:1-4; 10:44-47; 11:15-17; 1 Cor. 12:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Through the baptism in the Holy Spirit, the believers were put together to form the Body of Christ, joined to Him as the Head&mdash;v. 13.</li>
	<li>The real meaning of the baptism in the Holy Spirit is that we are immersed in the Triune God and that we put on the Triune God as our uniform&mdash;Luke 24:49.</li>
	<li>The baptism in the Holy Spirit was accomplished in two sections:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>All the Jewish believers were baptized in the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost&mdash;Acts 2:1-4.</li>
		<li>All the Gentile believers were baptized in the Holy Spirit in the house of Cornelius&mdash;10:44-47; 11:15-17.</li>
		<li>In these two sections all genuine believers in Christ were baptized in the Holy Spirit into the one Body of Christ once for all universally&mdash;1 Cor. 12:13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>There are five historical cases of the outpouring of the Spirit recorded in Acts, only two of which are called the baptism in the Holy Spirit:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In these two cases Christ as the Head baptized the Jewish and Gentile parts of His Body in the Holy Spirit once for all; by so doing, He fully accomplished the baptism in the Holy Spirit upon His Body&mdash;Acts 1:5; 11:15-17.</li>
		<li>In the other cases the baptism in the Holy Spirit that had already been accomplished upon the Body by the Head was transmitted to the new members of the Body through identification with the Body; these three cases were experiences of the one baptism in the Holy Spirit, which the Body of Christ had already received&mdash;8:15-17; 9:17; 19:1-7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The baptism in the Holy Spirit is uniquely one and has been accomplished upon the Body once for all; the experiences of the baptism in the Holy Spirit are numerous and may be shared continually by the members of the Body who have a proper understanding and realization&mdash;4:8; 13:9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to realize that the Lord has ascended and that He is the Lord and the Head over all things to the church&mdash;Luke 24:50-51; Acts 1:9-11; 2:33-34; Eph. 1:19-23.</li>
		<li>The baptism of the Body in the Holy Spirit is an accomplished fact and now exists upon the Body, ready for us to apply; this fact is a bequest given to us through the New Testament as a will&mdash;Luke 22:20; Heb. 8:8, 13.</li>
		<li>We need to be right with the Body, stand in the Body, believe the will, and take the baptism in the Holy Spirit by faith&mdash;1 Cor. 12:13; Heb. 11:1, 6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As believers in Christ, we should experience both the inward and the outward filling of the Spirit&mdash;Eph. 5:18; Acts 2:4; 4:8; 6:3; 13:9, 52:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To be filled with the Spirit inwardly is to experience the essential Spirit as life&mdash;Eph. 5:18; Acts 6:3; 13:52.</li>
	<li>To be filled with the Spirit outwardly is to experience the baptism in the Spirit for power and authority&mdash;1:5, 8; 2:4; 4:8; 13:9.</li>
	<li>When we are filled with the Spirit both inwardly and outwardly, we are completely mingled with the Triune God, who fills us, occupies us, and covers us; inwardly and outwardly, everywhere and in everything, there is the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God&mdash;1 Cor. 12:13.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol><h1 class="msg">Message Four</h1>
<h1 class="title">The Teaching and the Fellowship<br />
of the Apostles</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 2:42;<br />
1 Tim. 1:3-4; Titus 1:9; 2:1, 7-8; 1 John 1:3</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The teaching of the apostles is the unique and healthy teaching of God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;Acts 2:42; 1 Tim. 1:3-4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The teaching of the apostles is the entire teaching of the New Testament as God&rsquo;s speaking in the Son to His New Testament people&mdash;Heb. 1:1-2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God firstly spoke in the Son as a man in the four Gospels&mdash;John 14:10; 5:24; 16:12; 10:30.</li>
		<li>God secondly spoke in the Son as the Spirit through the apostles in Acts and the twenty-one Epistles (Romans through Jude)&mdash;John 16:12-15; Matt. 28:19-20; Heb. 2:3-4; 2 Pet. 3:15-16; Col. 1:25-27.</li>
		<li>God thirdly spoke in the Son as the seven Spirits through the apostle John in Revelation&mdash;1:1-2, 4; 2:1, 7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The teaching of the apostles is the unique, divine revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy from the incarnation of God to the consummation of the New Jerusalem&mdash;the teaching of the full ministry of Christ in His three divine and mystical stages:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The stage of incarnation is for Christ to bring God into man, to unite and mingle God with man, to express God in humanity, and to accomplish His judicial redemption&mdash;John 1:14, 29; 5:19; Matt. 1:18, 20.</li>
		<li>The stage of inclusion is for Christ to be begotten as God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, to become the life-giving Spirit, and to regenerate the believers for His Body&mdash;Acts 13:33; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 1 Pet. 1:3.</li>
		<li>The stage of intensification is for Christ to intensify His organic salvation, to produce the overcomers, and to consummate the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rev. 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6; 2:7, 17; 3:20; 21:2, 9-10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The teaching of the apostles is the holding factor of the one accord, causing us to have one heart, one way, and one goal&mdash;Acts 1:14; 2:42a, 46a; Jer. 32:39.</li>
	<li>Different teachings, other than the teaching of the apostles, are the major source of the church&rsquo;s decline, degradation, and deterioration&mdash;1 Tim. 1:3-7; 6:3-5, 20-21a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The striking point of the churches&rsquo; degradation is different teachings; these teachings crept in because the churches turned away from Paul&rsquo;s teaching, the unique teaching of God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;Rev. 2:14-15, 20; 2 Tim. 1:15.</li>
		<li>Different teachings separate us from the genuine appreciation, love, and enjoyment of the precious person of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself as our life and our everything&mdash;2 Cor. 11:2-3.</li>
		<li>The Lord appreciated the church in Philadelphia because they kept the word, which means that they did not turn away from the healthy teaching of God&rsquo;s economy, the teaching of the apostles&mdash;Rev. 3:8; 1 Tim. 6:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must be those who are &ldquo;holding to the faithful word, which is according to the teaching of the apostles&rdquo;&mdash;Titus 1:9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The churches were established according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching and followed their teaching, and the order of the churches was maintained by the faithful word, which was given according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</li>
		<li>We must speak the things that are fitting to the healthy teaching of the apostles, the teaching of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;2:1, 7-8; 1 Tim. 6:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The fellowship of the apostles is the unique and universal fellowship of the Body of Christ&mdash;the reality of living in the Body of Christ&mdash;Acts 2:42:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Teaching creates fellowship, and fellowship comes from teaching; if we teach wrongly or differently from the apostles&rsquo; teaching, our teaching will produce a sectarian, divisive fellowship&mdash;1 Cor. 4:17; 1:9; 10:16; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; 6:3.</li>
	<li>The fellowship is the flow of the eternal life within all the believers, who have received and possess the divine life&mdash;1 John 1:3; 2 Cor. 13:14; cf. Rev. 22:1.</li>
	<li>The initial experience of the apostles was the vertical fellowship with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ, but when the apostles reported the eternal life to others, they experienced the horizontal aspect of the divine fellowship&mdash;1 John 1:2-3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Our horizontal fellowship with the saints brings us into vertical fellowship with the Lord; then our vertical fellowship with the Lord brings us into horizontal fellowship with the saints&mdash;vv. 7, 9.</li>
		<li>In this divine fellowship God is interwoven with us; this interweaving is the mingling of God and man&mdash;cf. Lev. 2:4-5; 1 Cor. 10:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The coordination of the four living creatures presents a beautiful picture of the practical fellowship of the Body of Christ; fellowship means doing everything through the cross and by the Spirit to dispense Christ into others for the sake of His Body&mdash;Ezek. 1:5a, 9, 11b-14, 19-22, 25-26; 1 Cor. 12:14-30:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The eagle&rsquo;s wings are the means by which the four living creatures are coordinated and move as one, signifying that their coordination is in the divine power, the divine strength, and the divine supply (not in themselves)&mdash;Ezek. 1:9, 11; Exo. 19:4; Isa. 40:31; 2 Cor. 12:9; 1 Cor. 15:10.</li>
		<li>Each of the living creatures faces one direction; as they face these four directions, two of their wings spread out and touch the adjacent creatures&rsquo; wings, forming a square.</li>
		<li>When the living creatures move, they do not need to turn; one moves straight forward while the opposite creature moves backward and the other two move sideways&mdash;Ezek. 1:9.</li>
		<li>In the church service we all need to learn not only how to walk &ldquo;straight forward&rdquo; but also how to walk &ldquo;backward&rdquo; and &ldquo;sideways&rdquo;; in coordination there is no freedom or convenience; coordination keeps us from making turns&mdash;cf. Eph. 3:18:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To walk backward and sideways is to say Amen to another member&rsquo;s particular function (or ministry) and burden&mdash;Rom. 12:4; cf. 1 Cor. 14:29-31.</li>
			<li>If we care only for our particular service and do not have these four kinds of walk, eventually we will become a problem in the church&mdash;cf. 3 John 9.</li>
			<li>The one who is walking straight forward has the responsibility of following the Spirit&mdash;Ezek. 1:12; cf. Acts 16:6-10.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>If brothers with different functions do not know how to coordinate in fellowship, they will compete and even strive against each other, which could result in division&mdash;cf. Phil. 1:17; 2:2; Gal. 5:25-26.</li>
		<li>Fellowship blends us, mingles us, adjusts us, tempers us, harmonizes us, limits us, protects us, supplies us, and blesses us, giving us the power and the impact of the Spirit; the Body is in the fellowship&mdash;1 Cor. 12:24-25; Ezek. 1:13-14.</li>
		<li>We should apply this matter of coordination not only in a particular local church but also among the churches; this means that we are followers of the churches and that the local churches should fellowship with all the genuine local churches on the whole earth to keep the universal fellowship of the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Thes. 2:14; 1 Cor. 10:16.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Heavenly Vision<br />
and Vanquishing Conversion<br />
of the Apostle Paul</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 9:1-19; 22:6-16; 26:13-19</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The heavenly vision of Paul&rsquo;s completing ministry must be seen by us, and this vision must be renewed in us day by day&mdash;Acts 26:19; Eph. 1:17; Prov. 29:18a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This vision of the age will keep us living in God&rsquo;s presence; this vision will uphold us, control us, and become our divine commission to meet the need of this age&mdash;Jer. 1:7-10, 18-19; Isa. 6:1-8; Acts 26:16-19.</li>
	<li>When we see a vision of God&rsquo;s plan and have been converted from everything to Christ Himself, He will be the inner operating God to us, energizing us to carry out His plan&mdash;Gal. 1:15-16; Rom. 15:16; 1 Cor. 15:10; Phil. 2:13; cf. Jer. 1:1, 4-10, 18-19.</li>
	<li>Eventually, the opposing Saul became, in his victorious ministry of the gospel, Christ&rsquo;s vanquished captive in the triumphal procession celebrating Christ&rsquo;s victory over all His enemies; the Lord&rsquo;s perfecting of His chosen vessels in such a way is excellent and marvelous&mdash;Acts 26:14; 2 Cor. 2:14; Eph. 4:7-12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>While Saul of Tarsus was on the way to Damascus, a heavenly vision came to him, and this vision revolutionized him&mdash;Acts 9:1-19; 22:6-16; 26:13-19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>After he saw the vision, he became blind, unable to see anything, and impotent, unable to do anything; a blessed blindness comes upon those who are met by the heavenly vision:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>After this blindness comes upon us, there will be the inner anointing and the inner shining, the inner enlightening; we, who were once God&rsquo;s enemies, will be brought into the feast of the New Testament ministry to be saved in Christ&rsquo;s life&mdash;v. 14; Rom. 5:10; 1 Cor. 5:8; cf. 2 Kings 6:18-23.</li>
		<li>The inner vision will increase more and more and will revolutionize the way that we serve the Lord; this vision will control us to do everything by the Spirit, in our spirit, and in the Body, through the Body, and for the Body&mdash;Gal. 5:25; Phil. 3:3; Rom. 1:9; 1 Cor. 12:12, 27.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>For three days Saul did not see anything, and he did not eat or drink anything; all he could do was pray&mdash;Acts 9:9, 11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Under the inspiration of the essential Spirit, his only interest was to pray in order to know the significance of what he had seen and heard&mdash;22:14-15.</li>
		<li>It is likely that as Saul was praying, vision after vision and revelation after revelation came to him concerning Christ as the embodiment of God, the mystery of God, and the church as the Body of Christ, the mystery of Christ&mdash;Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4; 5:32.</li>
		<li>Each crucial point of Paul&rsquo;s vision recorded in Acts 9 should not merely be a teaching to us but a vision that we see on the heavenly &ldquo;television.&rdquo;</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In our reading of Acts 9 we need to see the heavenly vision concerning three items&mdash;&ldquo;Me&rdquo; (v. 4), &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; (v. 5), and the &ldquo;chosen vessel&rdquo; (v. 15).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo;&mdash;v. 4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This is a corporate &ldquo;Me,&rdquo; comprising Jesus the Lord and all His believers; He is the Head, and we are His Body as one person, one new man&mdash;Eph. 2:15; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
	<li>Saul (who is also Paul) began to see that the Lord Jesus and His believers are one great person&mdash;the wonderful &ldquo;Me&rdquo;; to him this was a unique revelation in the entire universe&mdash;Acts 13:9a; 1 Cor. 12:12-27; Eph. 3:3-4; 5:32.</li>
	<li>Paul is the only writer of the New Testament to use the term <em>the Body of Christ;</em> he placed great emphasis on the Body because at the time of his conversion he heard a message concerning the corporate &ldquo;Me,&rdquo; a message concerning the Body of Christ&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5; 1 Cor. 12:12-27; Eph. 1:22-23; 2:16; 4:4, 16.</li>
	<li>Immediately after Saul was saved, the Lord began to educate him concerning the Body of Christ; those who see that they are members of the Body treasure the Body and honor the other members&mdash;Acts 9:6, 17-18, 24-25; 1 Cor. 12:23-24; 16:18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Who are You, Lord? And He said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute&rdquo;&mdash;Acts 9:5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Lord</em> here equals the word <em>Jehovah</em> in Hebrew&mdash;Exo. 3:14-15; John 8:58.</li>
	<li>The name <em>Jesus</em> embodies the full message of the gospel; Paul saw that Jesus is Jehovah the Savior and that as the One who is now in the heavens, He has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension for the producing and building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;Rom. 9:5; Eph. 1:19-23.</li>
	<li>Paul saw that Jesus is the very God, Jehovah, who has been processed and consummated with the divine and human elements to be the ascended Lord, the Head of the Body, and the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus, to be dispensed into all His members&mdash;Rom. 10:12-13; Col. 1:18a; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Acts 16:7; Phil. 1:19.</li>
	<li>Paul saw that the center of the universe is that Christ is in us and we are in Christ; he saw that God&rsquo;s plan is both to reveal Christ in us as life so that we may live Christ and to put us into Christ so that we may be conformed to His image and built up with others to be His living Body for His corporate expression&mdash;Gal. 1:15-16; 2:20; 4:19; Rom. 8:28-29; 12:1-5; Eph. 1:22-23; 3:16-19.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;This man is a chosen vessel to Me&rdquo;&mdash;Acts 9:15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s intention in saving Saul of Tarsus was to fill him with Himself and thereby make him an outstanding vessel&mdash;Col. 1:25; Eph. 3:8-9.</li>
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s writings develop the spiritual significance of the word <em>vessel:</em>
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul saw that man is a tripartite vessel to contain and be filled with Christ as life for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;Gen. 2:7; 1 Thes. 5:23-24; Rom. 9:21, 23; 2 Cor. 4:7; 2 Tim. 2:20-21; cf. 2 Kings 4:1-6; Jer. 48:11.</li>
		<li>The Body of Christ is God&rsquo;s great corporate vessel to contain Him and be filled with Him for His expression&mdash;Eph. 3:16-19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As God&rsquo;s chosen vessel, Paul was converted from everything to Christ Himself&mdash;converted to call on His name, to suffer on behalf of His name, and to bear His name before both the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel&mdash;Acts 9:14-16; 22:16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The central vision of the apostle Paul&rsquo;s completing ministry is God in us as our contents (&ldquo;vessel&rdquo;), Christ as the mystery of God (&ldquo;Jesus&rdquo;), and the church as the mystery of Christ (&ldquo;Me&rdquo;)&mdash;9:4-5, 15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s preaching in Acts and his writing in his Epistles are a detailed description of the heavenly vision seen by him&mdash;26:16; 22:15; Eph. 3:3-6.</li>
	<li>The Lord appeared to Paul to appoint him as a minister and a witness both of the things in which Paul had seen Him and of the things in which He would appear to Paul&mdash;Acts 26:16; cf. 1:8; 23:11; 20:20, 31.</li>
	<li>In all the visions that Paul saw, he saw Christ; the things in which we have seen Christ and the things in which He will appear to us are the things that we must minister to others&mdash;Gal. 1:15-16; Acts 22:14-15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery today is the recovery of the central vision of Paul&rsquo;s completing ministry&mdash;26:13-19; Col. 1:25; Eph. 5:32.</li>

4:10-12; 5:30-31; 9:20, 22; 13:33-34</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>As we study the book of Acts, we need to have the view of the Lord Jesus as the One who is on the throne economically and within us essentially; this is the revelation that precedes the book of Acts&mdash;Heb. 12:2; Rev. 5:6; 2 Tim. 4:22; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
<li>God&rsquo;s central testimony is the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ&mdash;Acts 1:3, 9-11; 2:22-24, 32-36.</li>
<li>We all need the full enjoyment of Christ as the Feast of Harvest; this full enjoyment of Christ is actually the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God reaching us&mdash;v. 1, footnote 1.</li>
<li>All the apostles carried out the same ministry to bear the testimony of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all, announcing Christ in His person and work&mdash;1:17; 9:20, 22; 10:36-43:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>With Christ there are two main aspects&mdash;the aspect of His person and the aspect of His work; <em>the Son of God</em> denotes His person, and <em>the Christ</em> denotes His work&mdash;9:20, 22; John 20:31:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>For the Lord Jesus to be the Son of God means that He is God, the One with the unique divine source&mdash;1:18; 3:16.</li>
		<li>For the Lord Jesus to be the Christ means that He is the God-anointed and God-appointed One to carry out whatever God intends&mdash;Matt. 16:16-18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Peter witnessed concerning the man Jesus in His work, death, resurrection, and ascension&mdash;Acts 2:22-36:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>While Christ was living and ministering, whatever He did was an exhibition that His work was done by God and was fully tested, proved, and approved by God&mdash;v. 22.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion was not an accident in human history but a purposeful fulfillment of the divine counsel determined by God, taking place according to the eternal predestination of the Triune God&mdash;v. 23.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was God&rsquo;s approval and declaration of Him as the real Messiah, the One anointed and appointed by God to carry out His eternal commission&mdash;vv. 24-32.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s ascension was God&rsquo;s exaltation of Him; the pouring out of the Holy Spirit was a proof that God had exalted the Lord Jesus and made Him both Lord and Christ&mdash;vv. 33-36.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Jesus&rsquo; incarnation made Him a man, His human living on earth qualified Him to be man&rsquo;s Savior, His crucifixion accomplished full redemption for man, His resurrection vindicated His redemptive work, and His exaltation inaugurated Him to be the ruling Leader that He might be the Savior; this exalting of Him was the ultimate step in His being perfected to be the Savior of man&mdash;5:30-31; Heb. 2:10; 5:9.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The apostles&rsquo; testimony of Jesus Christ, the Lord of all, was all-inclusive; as depicted in the book of Acts, they preached and ministered the all-inclusive Christ&mdash;3:13-26; 4:10-12; 13:22-39:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In his ministry Peter announced the all-inclusive Christ&mdash;3:13-26; 4:10-12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord Jesus, the Servant of God, the Healer, is <em>the holy and righteous One&mdash;</em> 3:13-14, 16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>As the holy One, He is absolutely for God, unto God, and one with God.</li>
			<li>As the righteous One, He is right with God and with everyone and everything&mdash;v. 14.</li>

		<li>Christ is the Author of life, the origin and Originator of life, the Chief Leader in life&mdash;v. 15.</li>
		<li>The Lord Jesus is the Prophet, who speaks for God and speaks forth God&mdash;vv. 22-23.</li>
		<li>Christ is the seasons of refreshing; to have Christ is to have times of refreshing&mdash;v. 20.</li>
		<li>Christ is the seed in whom we receive God&rsquo;s blessing&mdash;v. 25.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s way of sending the ascended Christ was by pouring out the Spirit; when the outpoured Spirit came to the people, that was Christ, the ascended One, sent by God to them&mdash;v. 26.</li>
		<li>As the Stone-Savior, Christ is the material for God&rsquo;s building; in resurrection God made Him the cornerstone, the prominent stone that joins the walls of a building&mdash;4:10-12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In his ministry Paul announced the all-inclusive Christ; he carried out a work of presenting, conveying, and ministering the all-inclusive Christ realized as the life-giving Spirit&mdash;13:22-39; 1 Cor. 15:45b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Through resurrection Christ became the firstborn Son of God; God&rsquo;s raising up Jesus from the dead was His begetting of Him to be His firstborn Son&mdash;Acts 13:33; Rom. 8:29:

			<li>As the only begotten Son, the Lord is the embodiment of the divine life&mdash;John 1:4; 1 John 5:11-12.</li>
			<li>As the firstborn Son, Christ is the life-dispenser for the propagation of life&mdash;Rom. 1:3-4; 8:2, 6, 10-11, 29.</li>
			<li>In Acts 13 Paul was preaching Christ as the firstborn Son for propagation; for this reason, he preached the resurrection of the Lord Jesus as His birth in His humanity to be God&rsquo;s firstborn Son&mdash;v. 33.</li>

<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Even as the Divine Trinity is the framework of the entire New Testament, so the Divine Trinity is the structure of the book of Acts; chapter after chapter of Acts unveils the operation of the Divine Trinity for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;e.g., 1:1-2, 4-5, 8, 11, 21; 2:4, 17-18, 21-24, 27, 31-33, 36, 38; 13:2, 4, 7, 9-10, 12, 16, 23, 30, 33-39, 49-50, 52; 28:15, 23, 25, 31:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;was fully involved with the Son&rsquo;s ascension and the pouring out of the Spirit&mdash;2:32-36:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Son ascended, the Father exalted Him, and the Spirit was poured out&mdash;Luke 24:51; Phil. 2:9; Acts 1:9-11; 2:32-36.</li>
		<li>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit were all wrapped up with the outpouring of the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God&mdash;v. 33; John 7:37-39; Phil. 1:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In Acts 16:6-7 <em>the Holy Spirit</em> and <em>the Spirit of Jesus</em> are used interchangeably, revealing that the Spirit of Jesus is the Holy Spirit:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>The Holy Spirit</em> is a general title of the Spirit of God in the New Testament&mdash;9:17, 31.</li>
		<li><em>The Spirit of Jesus</em> is a particular expression concerning the Spirit of God and refers to the Spirit of the incarnated Savior who, as Jesus in His humanity, passed through human living and death on the cross&mdash;16:7:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This indicates that in the Spirit of Jesus there is not only the divine element of God but also the human element of Jesus and the elements of His human living and His suffering of death as well&mdash;Phil. 2:7-8.</li>
			<li>In his ministry the apostle Paul needed such an all-inclusive Spirit.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>As a vessel containing the Triune God, Paul was fully constituted of the Holy Spirit, who was involved with the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation and birth, and of the Spirit of Jesus, who was involved with the Lord&rsquo;s humanity, human living, all-inclusive death, life-imparting resurrection, and ascension&mdash;Eph. 3:14-17; Luke 1:35; Acts 2:32-36; Phil. 1:19.</li>
		<li>The kind of work that we do for the Lord depends on the kind of Spirit by whom we are guided, directed, instructed, and constituted; when the all-inclusive Spirit becomes our constitution, our work will be the expression of this Spirit&mdash;Acts 16:6-7; Rom. 8:9; Phil. 1:19.</li>

		<li>God purchased the church by paying the price of &ldquo;His own blood.&rdquo;</li>
		<li>Through incarnation our God, the Creator, the eternal One, became mingled with man&mdash;John 1:1, 14:

			<li>As a result, He was no longer only God&mdash;He became a God-man, who had blood and was able to die for us&mdash;1 John 1:7.</li>

		<li>The blood that He shed was not only the blood of the man Jesus but also the blood of the God-man.</li>

<li>The kingdom of God is the main subject of the apostles&rsquo; preaching in Acts&mdash;1:3; 8:12; 14:22; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The fact that the resurrected Christ, in His appearing to the apostles through a period of forty days, spoke to them &ldquo;the things concerning the kingdom of God&rdquo; indicates that the kingdom would be the main subject of the apostles&rsquo; preaching in their coming commission after Pentecost&mdash;1:3.</li>
	<li>According to the New Testament, the kingdom of God is not a visible, material realm; actually, the kingdom of God is a person, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself&mdash;Luke 17:20-21.</li>
	<li>The churches and the kingdom of God go together; the churches produced by the propagation of the resurrected Christ are the kingdom of God on earth today&mdash;Acts 14:22; 20:25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The resurrected Christ, who is propagating Himself in His ascension, by the Spirit, and through the disciples, is the reality of the kingdom of God; the kingdom of God is His expansion&mdash;1:8; 8:12:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The churches are the expansion of Christ, who came to sow Himself as the seed of the kingdom of God; this is revealed in the Gospels&mdash;Mark 4:3, 26.</li>
			<li>In the Gospels Christ was the seed of the kingdom; in the book of Acts we have the propagation of this seed to produce the churches as the kingdom of God&mdash;8:1, 12; 13:1-4.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We in the churches are the propagation of Christ and the expansion of Christ, and we are enlarging the kingdom of God&mdash;Rev. 1:9, 11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The kingdom of God is the spreading of Christ as life into His believers to form a realm in which God rules in His life&mdash;2 Pet. 1:3-11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To enter into this kingdom, people need to repent of their sins and believe in the gospel so that their sins may be forgiven and so that they may be regenerated by God to have the divine life, which matches the divine nature of this kingdom&mdash;Mark 1:15; John 3:3, 5.</li>
		<li>All the believers in Christ can share the kingdom in the church age for their enjoyment of God in His righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit&mdash;Rom. 14:17.</li>
		<li>The kingdom of God will become the kingdom of Christ and of God for the overcoming believers to inherit and enjoy in the coming kingdom age so that they may reign with Christ for a thousand years&mdash;1 Cor. 6:9-11; Gal. 5:19-21; Eph. 5:5; Rev. 20:4, 6.</li>
		<li>As the eternal kingdom, the kingdom of God will be an eternal blessing of God&rsquo;s eternal life for all God&rsquo;s redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity&mdash;21:1-4; 22:1-5, 14, 17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In Acts 14:22 Paul entreated the believers who were continuing in the faith to realize that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God, because the whole world opposes our entering in; to enter into the kingdom of God is to enter into the full enjoyment of Christ as the kingdom.</li>
	<li>In Acts 19 we see that Satan is fighting against God&rsquo;s spreading of His kingdom on earth; the prevailing ministry for the propagation of Christ is a fighting, a battle, for God&rsquo;s kingdom&mdash;vv. 23-41.</li>
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s proclaiming the kingdom of God in 28:31 was the propagation of the resurrected Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This is proved by the words <em>teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ,</em> which things go together with the kingdom of God&mdash;v. 23.</li>
		<li>To teach concerning Christ is to spread the kingdom of God; therefore, the kingdom of God is actually the propagation of the resurrected Christ&mdash;a process that continues to be carried out through the believers today&mdash;v. 31.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Enjoyment and Propagation<br />
of the Resurrected Christ as the Jubilee in Acts</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 2:21; 7:58-60;<br />
9:14, 21; 22:16, 20; 26:18-19</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>To enjoy and propagate the resurrected Christ as the jubilee is to enjoy and propagate Him as our possession, our God-given portion, and as the One who is able to set us free from the slavery of sin for us to be returned to the church as our divine family&mdash;Lev. 25:8-17, 28, 39-41; Luke 4:18-22; Col. 1:12-13; John 8:32, 36; Acts 26:18-19; cf. Psa. 68:5-6.</li>
<li>In Peter&rsquo;s first proclamation of the gospel, he quoted from the prophet Joel and declared that we can enjoy Christ as the jubilee by the jubilant practice of calling on the name of the Lord&mdash;Acts 2:16-18, 21; Joel 2:28-29, 32a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The book of Joel reveals the intrinsic divine history within the outward human history; our divine history in the midst of human history is a history of calling on the name of the Lord to enjoy the riches of Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ as the fullness of Christ&mdash;1:1-4; Rom. 10:12-13; Eph. 3:8, 19; 1:22-23.</li>
	<li>Joel&rsquo;s prophecy and its fulfillment concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament jubilee have two aspects: on God&rsquo;s side, He poured out His Spirit in the ascension of the resurrected Christ; on our side, we call on the name of the ascended Lord, who has accomplished all, attained unto all, and obtained all:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Calling on the name of the Lord is vitally necessary in order for us to participate in and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ with all that He has accomplished, attained, and obtained for our full salvation&mdash;1 Cor. 1:2; Rom. 10:12-13; 5:10.</li>
		<li>We can enjoy seasons of refreshing (cooling, reviving, and relieving) from the presence of the Lord by calling on the name of the Lord&mdash;Acts 3:20; 2:21.</li>
		<li><em>Jesus</em> is the Lord&rsquo;s name, and the Spirit is His person; when we call, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we receive the Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 12:3b, 13.</li>
		<li>By calling on the name of the Lord, we enjoy the Spirit as the application of God&rsquo;s salvation to us; when we exercise our spirit to call on Him, we breathe Him in and drink Him to enjoy His riches; this is the real worship to God&mdash;Acts 2:21; Rom. 10:12-13; Lam. 3:55-56; Isa. 12:3-4; John 4:14, 24.</li>
		<li>By practicing to call on the name of the Lord, we can continually receive the riches of the Spirit, and God fulfills His promise to restore to us &ldquo;the years that the...locust has eaten&rdquo;&mdash;Joel 2:25; Gal. 3:2, 5, 14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The book of Acts reveals that calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name was a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s followers (1 Cor. 1:2); this calling must have been audible; thus, it became a sign:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Greek word for <em>call on</em> is composed of <em>on</em> and <em>call</em> (by name); thus, it is to call out audibly, even loudly, as Stephen did&mdash;Acts 7:59-60.</li>
		<li>When Stephen suffered persecution, he practiced this, and his practice surely impressed Saul, one of his persecutors; later, the unbelieving Saul persecuted the callers by taking their calling as a sign&mdash;vv. 58-60; 9:14, 21; 22:20.</li>
		<li>Immediately after Saul was caught by the Lord, Ananias, who brought Saul into the fellowship of the Body of Christ, charged him to be baptized, calling on the name of the Lord, to show others that he too had become such a caller&mdash;v. 16.</li>
		<li>Paul was one who practiced this, and he charged his young co-worker Timothy to do this that Timothy might enjoy the Lord as he did&mdash;2 Tim. 2:22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The book of Acts shows us the enjoyment and propagation of the resurrected Christ as the jubilee of grace in the disciples&rsquo; spreading of the gospel and in their practice of the church life:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo;&mdash;1:8b.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Day by day,...breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with exultation and simplicity of heart, praising God...And the Lord added together day by day those who were being saved&rdquo;&mdash;2:46-47.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;With great power the apostles gave testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all&rdquo;&mdash;4:33.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;So they went from the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be dishonored on behalf of the Name. And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ&rdquo;&mdash;5:41-42.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God...And they stoned Stephen as he called upon the Lord and said, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit! And kneeling down, he cried out with a loud voice, Lord, do not hold this sin against them&rdquo;&mdash;7:56, 59-60a.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Those therefore who were scattered went throughout the land announcing the word as the gospel...And there was much joy in that city&rdquo;&mdash;8:4, 8.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away; and the eunuch did not see him anymore, for he went on his way rejoicing&rdquo;&mdash;v. 39.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;So then the church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it was multiplied&rdquo;&mdash;9:31.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Barnabas...when he arrived and saw the grace of God, rejoiced and encouraged them all to remain with the Lord with purpose of heart&rdquo;&mdash;11:22b-23.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;The disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit&rdquo;&mdash;13:52.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;They therefore, having been sent forward by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, telling in detail about the turning of the Gentiles; and they brought great joy to all the brothers&rdquo;&mdash;15:3.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;About midnight Paul and Silas, while praying, sang hymns of praise to God; and the prisoners were listening to them&rdquo;&mdash;16:25.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;They said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household...And he brought them up into his house and set a table before them; and he exulted because he had believed in God with all his household&rdquo;&mdash;vv. 31, 34.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;These men who have upset the world have come here also&rdquo;&mdash;17:6b.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Now I commit you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who have been sanctified&rdquo;&mdash;20:32.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;To open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me&rdquo;&mdash;26:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Acts 26:18 unveils the all-inclusive contents of our divine commission according to the heavenly vision of the jubilee; we need to pray over these contents, asking the Lord to make them our experience and reality so that we can bring others into this experience and reality.</li>
		<li>When we pray in this way, the Lord Jesus will appear to us, His appearing will give us a vision, and we will enjoy and propagate the resurrected Christ as the jubilee unto the uttermost part of the earth&mdash;vv. 16-19; 1 Tim. 1:4, 11; Acts 1:8.</li>

<h1 class="title">Keeping Ourselves in the One Flow of the Lord&rsquo;s Work<br />
for the Spreading of the Church<br />
and Receiving the Lord&rsquo;s Mercy to Be<br />
Saved from Satan&rsquo;s Schemes</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 1:8; 5:20; 6:4, 7; 9:31; 12:24; 19:20</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The book of Acts reveals that in the move of the Lord there is only one divine stream of the Lord&rsquo;s work and that we need to keep ourselves in this stream:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The divine stream, which has been flowing throughout the generations, is uniquely one; since there is only one divine stream and since the flow is uniquely one, we need to keep ourselves in this one flow&mdash;1 John 1:3; Rev. 22:1.</li>
	<li>Where the divine stream flows, we have the life of God, the fellowship of the Body, the testimony of Jesus, and the work of God&mdash;Gen. 2:10-14; Psa. 36:8-9; 46:4a; John 7:37-39; Rev. 22:1.</li>
	<li>When we give the Lord the preeminence in our entire being, making Him our first love, He becomes the divine stream to us, flowing within us and out of us as the first works; the first works are works that are motivated by, issue from, and express the Lord as our first love; only works that are motivated by the first love are gold, silver, and precious stones&mdash;v. 1; 2:4-5; 1 Cor. 2:9; 3:12.</li>
	<li>The flowing of the divine life, which started on the day of Pentecost and has been flowing throughout all generations to this day, is just one stream for God&rsquo;s goal to build up the church for His corporate expression&mdash;Matt. 16:18; cf. Ezek. 47:1-12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The basic principle of the church is that it is eternal and universal, so the church must constantly spread on the earth; the growth of the church and the building up of the church are based on spreading&mdash;Acts 1:8; 8:1; 9:31:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The spreading of the church is brought about by the growth in the Lord&rsquo;s life and the flowing out of the Lord&rsquo;s life, the overflow of life&mdash;Eph. 4:16; John 7:37-39; Acts 2:42, 46-47; 5:20; 6:4, 7; 12:24; 19:20.</li>
	<li>When the church begins to spread, erroneous concepts are shattered, regardless of whether the concepts are regional, racial, or mutually discriminatory; it is through spreading that all our close-mindedness is eliminated&mdash;cf. 1 Cor. 12:24; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
	<li>Acts 8 shows that the first step in the church&rsquo;s spread was to Samaria (vv. 1-25), and the second step was to Ethiopia, to Africa (vv. 26-39); this shows that we must preach the gospel to every tribe and tongue and people and nation, because the church is universal and needs to spread (Rev. 5:9-10; 7:9).</li>
	<li>Acts 9 shows God&rsquo;s choosing of Saul (later Paul), which is against the human concept; our narrow, erroneous human concept needs to be broken and shattered through the spreading of the church; we must believe that a person can be persecuting the church one hour and preaching the gospel the next hour&mdash;vv. 10-22.</li>
	<li>Acts 10 indicates that the Lord&rsquo;s evangelistic move on earth is under His administration on the throne in heaven and that the gospel needs to be spread to the four corners of the inhabited earth to collect all kinds of unclean (sinful) people, cleansing them with the redeeming blood of Christ and washing them with the renewing Holy Spirit&mdash;vv. 11-12, 15, 28; cf. Heb. 8:1; Acts 7:56.</li>
	<li>Acts 13 reveals that in the church in Antioch, the five prophets and teachers who were ministering to the Lord were composed of Jews and Gentiles, each having a different background, education, and status; this indicates that the church is composed of all races and classes of people regardless of their background, and that the spiritual gifts and functions given to the members of the Body of Christ are not based on their natural status&mdash;v. 1; 4:36; Rom. 16:21; Luke 9:7-9; Acts 22:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Through these five faithful and seeking members of the Body of Christ, the Lord took a great step to set apart Barnabas and Saul for His work and move to spread the gospel of His kingdom to the Gentile world.</li>
		<li>It was absolutely a move by the Spirit, in the Spirit, and with the Spirit through the coordination of the faithful and seeking members of the Body of Christ on the earth with the Head in the heavens&mdash;13:1-4a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>On the apostle Paul&rsquo;s first trip to spread the gospel, he went to Cyprus and then to Asia Minor to establish many local churches&mdash;13:4b&mdash;14:28; Rev. 1:4.</li>
	<li>After Paul separated from Barnabas, he went out on his second ministry journey to Europe (Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea, Athens, Corinth, and returning through Ephesus back to Antioch)&mdash;Acts 15:35-40; 16:6&mdash;18:22.</li>
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s third journey was from Antioch to Galatia, Phrygia, Ephesus, Macedonia, and Greece to Jerusalem&mdash;18:23&mdash;21:17.</li>
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s fourth journey was from Caesarea to Rome&mdash;27:1&mdash;28:31.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We must receive the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to be saved from Satan&rsquo;s schemes to frustrate the spreading and building up of the church, and we must keep ourselves in the flow of the age for the building up of His Body&mdash;cf. Heb. 4:16; Lam. 3:22-25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We must be saved from outward and dead ordinances, human opinions, and the self with its old concepts; whoever receives mercy from the Lord will be saved in these matters; the degree to which we are saved is the degree to which the church can be built up&mdash;Rom. 5:10; Phil. 1:19-21a; 2:12-16; Acts 15:1-12; Gal. 2:21; 5:1; 2:4.</li>
	<li>We must learn from the lesson of Peter to be saved from the veils of our religious traditions and old background so that we may see and live under the vision of God&rsquo;s eternal economy to hold the truth of the gospel&mdash;Acts 10:9-16; Gal. 2:11-14.</li>
	<li>We must learn from the lesson of Barnabas to be saved from human opinions and natural relationships&mdash;disputes that arise among the co-workers because of personal relationships are terrible; remember this well!&mdash;Acts 13:13; 15:35-40; Col. 4:10.</li>
	<li>We must learn from the lesson of Apollos to be saved from a ministry that lacks a complete revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and from not being fully one with the ministry of the age&mdash;Acts 18:24&mdash;19:2; 1 Cor. 1:12; 16:10-12.</li>
	<li>We must learn from the lesson of Paul in Acts 16:6-12; these verses indicate the problem of workers coming to a place and tending to become set and settled down, not wanting to move; old relationships, old affections, old inclinations, and old concepts keep us from following the inner leading of the indwelling Spirit:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Holy Spirit forbade Paul and his co-workers, and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them; the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s forbidding separates us, sanctifies us, and the Spirit of Jesus either allows us or does not allow us&mdash;vv. 6-7.</li>
		<li>The Holy Spirit says &ldquo;no&rdquo; to sanctify us, and the Spirit of Jesus says &ldquo;go&rdquo; to send us out in the humanity of Jesus to accomplish the will of God under the cross.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must learn from the lesson of Paul to practice the Body life and to take the word of the Spirit through the members of the Body, obeying it as a word from the Head&mdash;20:23; 21:4, 7-8, 11-14.</li>
	<li>We must learn from the mistake of James and the devastating mixture of the church in Jerusalem&mdash;vv. 18-21; Matt. 22:7; 24:1-2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Jeremiah spoke of the law of life that could be written upon our hearts (Jer. 31:31-34), and Paul spoke of the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit (Rom. 8:2, 4, 6), but James treasured and uplifted the law of letters (Acts 21:20).</li>
		<li>Paul spoke of being crucified with Christ and being conformed to the death of Christ by the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection; it is this life that produces the Body life that consummates in the New Jerusalem&mdash;Gal. 2:20; Phil. 3:10.</li>
		<li>In the light of the divine revelation, the greatest lack of James is the cross of Christ; self-cultivation does not carry out God&rsquo;s economy, but self-denial does.</li>
		<li>James boasted that there were myriads of believing Jews in the church in Jerusalem who were zealous for the law, but Paul was zealous to gain Christ, be found in Christ, know Christ, lay hold of Christ, pursue Christ, and uplift Christ for the fullest enjoyment of Christ&mdash;Acts 21:20; Phil. 3:6-14; Col. 1:18b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must learn from the lesson of Paul to be saved from the mixing of Judaic practices with God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which is not only erroneous but also abominable in the eyes of God&mdash;Acts 21:18-27, 31, 36; Heb. 10:29.</li>
	<li>We must learn from the lesson of Paul&rsquo;s appealing to Caesar, utilizing his Roman citizenship to save himself from his persecutors so that he might fulfill the course of his ministry&mdash;Acts 22:25-29; 23:10-11; 25:8-12; 26:32:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul was willing to sacrifice his life for the Lord, but he still endeavored to live longer so that he might carry out the Lord&rsquo;s ministry as much as possible&mdash;20:24.</li>
		<li>God in His sovereignty rescued Paul so that He might separate him from all the dangerous situations and entrapments and sent him to a quiet prison; this was to afford him a quiet environment and give him time, whether in Caesarea (24:27) or in Rome (28:16, 23, 30), so that through his last Epistles he might release exhaustively to the church throughout the generations the revelation of the mystery of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy that he received from the Lord.</li>
		<li>The benefit and profit that the church throughout the generations has received from these Epistles will take eternity to measure (see 25:11, footnote 1).</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>All of us should follow the pattern of the apostle Paul to do the same one work universally for the unique Body&mdash;1 Cor. 3:12; 15:58; 16:10; Eph. 4:11-16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is for the building up of the local churches unto the building up of the universal Body of Christ&mdash;2:21-22; 1 Cor. 16:10.</li>
	<li>Today there are four kinds of workers:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first kind is the co-workers who match the need of the ministry of God in the present age; this is a small group of people who have been dealt with by the Lord and who are in one accord.</li>
		<li>The second kind is the younger co-workers; they are willing to receive the direction and to come under the coordination of the older co-workers, and they are willing to follow and to learn in humility.</li>
		<li>The third kind is those who are unwilling to submit to the senior co-workers, who do not belong to the denominations yet who are happy to remain in fellowship with us.</li>
		<li>The fourth kind is the preachers and free evangelists among the denominations.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>What we need today are the first and second kind of co-workers; concerning the third and fourth kind of workers, we can only let them choose their own pathway; with some people God has not assigned them to take the same way as we do, and we dare not say anything to them.</li>
	<li>Whatever the situation may be, we are here to do the work that God has committed to us; we cannot interfere with others&rsquo; work, and we are not here tearing down others&rsquo; work.</li>
	</ol></li>

<h1 class="title">The God-ordained Way of<br />
Prayer, the Spirit, and the Word for God&rsquo;s Move</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 1:8, 14; 4:24-31; 6:4, 7; 12:24; 19:20</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The book of Acts shows that the God-ordained way to carry out God&rsquo;s move to fulfill His New Testament economy is entirely by three main substances&mdash;prayer, the Spirit, and the Word:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Prayer, the Spirit, and the Word are the three substances of the power in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery&mdash;Acts 1:8, 14; 4:31; 6:4, 7; 12:24; 19:20.</li>
	<li>We must pray that we might have the Spirit as the power to spread the Word&mdash;6:7; 12:24; 19:20; cf. 1 Tim. 5:17-18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We must get ourselves saturated, constituted, and even soaked with the holy Word; if we are burdened to preach the gospel, we must get into the Word and be persons who know the Word&mdash;Col. 3:16.</li>
		<li>We should ask the Lord to bring our entire being into the light and be dealt with by Him to become persons of power, who are full of the Spirit within and without, essentially and economically&mdash;Eph. 5:18; Acts 2:38; 5:32b; 4:8, 31; 13:9, 52.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The early disciples could not have maintained the one accord if they had different ways, means, agents, or substances for them to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s move on this earth; in order to maintain the unique one accord, we all must learn to do the same thing by the same way&mdash;1:14; 4:31.</li>
	<li>We must not think of taking a way other than prayer, the Spirit, and the Word; any other way will cause dissension and division.</li>
	<li>The picture of Lot&rsquo;s family and his seed by incest shows that when God&rsquo;s people lose the proper function in life, they use ugly and worldly means for securing the increase&mdash;Gen. 19:30-38:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Desiring to have seed regardless of the means, Lot&rsquo;s daughters bore sons out of their father by incest, thus breaking the governing principle ordained by God.</li>
		<li>In principle, to use any kind of sinful or worldly methods to secure increase for our success in the Christian work is to break God&rsquo;s governing principle and thus to commit spiritual incest&mdash;cf. Matt. 7:21-23.</li>
		<li>It is possible for God&rsquo;s people to be drugged with the wicked current of the evil world and care only for success, not for the means; they may care for soul-winning but not for the proper way of doing it.</li>
		<li>Some groups use rock music, dancing, drama, movies, and games to satisfy their desire of securing the increase; in the eyes of God this is spiritual incest, which brings forth &ldquo;Moabites&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ammonites&rdquo;&mdash;cf. Ezek. 25:3, 8.</li>
		<li>Our spiritual activities must be the doing of the Father&rsquo;s will; if we do things without this assurance, we break the governing principle and commit spiritual incest, being workers of lawlessness&mdash;Matt. 7:21-23.</li>
		<li>Ishmael, brought forth by fleshly effort, was rejected by God (Gen. 21:10-12); Moab and Ben-ammi, brought forth by incest, were a shame in history; only Isaac, brought forth by God&rsquo;s grace, was used to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose.</li>
		<li>In order to bear fruit we should live by Christ, live out Christ, pray, and help people to receive the living word of God so that they might be reborn; this is the way to bring forth the proper fruit to be the &ldquo;Isaac&rdquo; for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;Gal. 4:28.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The book of Acts shows that the apostles never initiated any work without prayer; whenever they wanted to do something, they stopped themselves by their prayer, giving God a way to come into them, to fill them up, and to saturate their entire being&mdash;1:14; 6:4; 13:1-4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In order to be one with the Lord in His work, we need to pray ourselves into God and pray God into us so that we are mingled with God&mdash;Matt. 6:6.</li>
	<li>To pray means to stop ourselves from doing anything apart from the Lord so that He can do His work through us&mdash;cf. 14:22-23.</li>
	<li>To pray means that we realize that we are nothing and can do nothing; prayer is the real denial of the self&mdash;Gal. 6:3; cf. Mark 9:28-29.</li>
	<li>To pray by calling on the name of the Lord is to deny ourselves and to declare, &ldquo;No longer I but Christ&rdquo;&mdash;cf. Gal. 2:20a.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The book of Acts shows the prayer that we need in order to be filled with the Spirit essentially and economically so that all our activities would be the activities of the acting God:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The prayer that we need is the prayer that brought in the outpouring of the Spirit&mdash;Acts 1:14; 2:1-4, 16-17a.</li>
	<li>The prayer that we need is the prayer that shook the earth and empowered the disciples with the Holy Spirit to speak the word of God with boldness&mdash;4:24-31.</li>
	<li>The prayer that we need is the prayer of the apostles to match the ministry of the word&mdash;6:4.</li>
	<li>The prayer that we need is the prayer that brought Peter into a trance and brought a heavenly vision to him&mdash;10:9-16.</li>
	<li>The prayer that we need is the prayer that opened the prison gate for Peter&mdash;12:4-14.</li>
	<li>The prayer that we need is the prayer that brought the five prophets and teachers into the Lord&rsquo;s commission&mdash;13:1-4.</li>
	<li>The prayer that we need is the prayer that brought in a great earthquake and shook the foundations of the prison house&mdash;16:23-26.</li>
	<li>The prayer that we need is the prayer that brought Paul into a trance and into the Lord&rsquo;s speaking to him&mdash;22:17-21.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The book of Acts shows that our working together with God to build up the church is a spiritual warfare and that prayer is the secret to accomplish God&rsquo;s work&mdash;4:24-31; Psa. 2:1-2; Eph. 6:10-20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The prayers that we utter before the Lord must stand against and resist &ldquo;counter-prayers&rdquo; that are directed particularly against the church and the work we are carrying out to build up the church&mdash;John 17:15; Matt. 6:13; cf. Psa. 31:20.</li>
	<li>Prayerlessness is a sin; all in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must be prayerful and stand against the sin of prayerlessness&mdash;1 Sam. 12:23; Col. 4:2.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Gospel, God&rsquo;s Salvation,<br />
and the Need for a Dispensational Transfer</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 1:6-8; 8:12; 13:39; 14:3; 16:31; 20:24</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The gospel preached in Acts is the complete gospel&mdash;the gospel of Jesus as the Christ (5:42), the word as the gospel (8:4), the gospel of the kingdom of God (v. 12), the gospel of the name of Jesus Christ (v. 12), the gospel of peace (10:36), the Lord Jesus as the gospel (8:35; 11:20), the gospel of the promise made to the fathers (13:32), Jesus and the resurrection as the gospel (17:18), and the gospel of the grace of God (20:24):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We need to learn from Philip&rsquo;s preaching of the gospel in Acts 8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Philip preached Christ as the gospel, as the good news&mdash;vv. 5, 12, 35.</li>
		<li>Philip also preached the kingdom of God as the gospel just as the Lord Jesus had done&mdash;v. 12; Mark 1:14-15; Luke 4:43.</li>
		<li>Like Philip, we should preach the gospel that is Jesus Christ and also the kingdom of God, preaching Jesus Christ as the kingdom of God&mdash;Acts 8:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The conversion of Saul shows that the name of Jesus itself is an adequate gospel&mdash;9:4-5.</li>
	<li>In our gospel preaching, we should proclaim both the person of Christ and the work of Christ&mdash;vv. 20, 22.</li>
	<li>The gospel preached by Peter comprises the divine blessings not only of forgiveness (5:31; 10:43) and salvation (2:21; 4:12) but also of the Spirit (2:38) and life; forgiveness deals with people&rsquo;s sins, and life, with people&rsquo;s death (John 5:24; 1 John 3:14; 2 Cor. 5:4).</li>
	<li>In Athens Paul &ldquo;was announcing Jesus and the resurrection as the gospel&rdquo;&mdash;Acts 17:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul&rsquo;s preaching was a strong indication that he had been constituted with the all-inclusive Jesus Christ and His resurrection&mdash;Phil. 3:10.</li>
		<li>Whether or not we have power in preaching the gospel depends on our being, our person; if we would have power in our preaching, we need to be constituted with the all-inclusive Christ, as Paul was&mdash;1 Cor. 2:2, 4-5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>According to the record in the book of Acts, God&rsquo;s salvation includes the Savior (13:23), repentance (5:31), faith (15:9), forgiveness (13:38-39), justification (v. 39), and eternal life (v. 48):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Redemption is what Christ accomplished on the cross, and salvation is the application of this accomplished redemption to us&mdash;Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14; Acts 4:12; 28:28; Rom. 1:16; 3:24; 10:10; 13:11; Heb. 2:3, 10; 5:9; 9:12.</li>
	<li>From David&rsquo;s seed, God brought forth a Savior, Jesus; with Him there is salvation&mdash;Acts 13:23.</li>
	<li>As the Leader, the Ruler, and the Savior, the Lord is ruling the earth for the purpose of our salvation&mdash;5:31:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord Jesus is ruling so that we may be saved, and now the Savior Himself is our salvation&mdash;v. 31; 2:21, 40, 47; 8:37; 16:31; Luke 2:30; 19:9.</li>
		<li>As the Leader and Savior, He gives repentance and forgiveness of sins; His sovereign ruling causes and leads God&rsquo;s chosen people to repent, and His salvation, which is based on His redemption, affords them forgiveness of sins&mdash;Acts 5:31:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Repentance is for forgiveness of sins&mdash;Luke 24:47:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) On God&rsquo;s side, forgiveness of sins is based on the redemption of Christ, which was accomplished through His death&mdash;Acts 2:38; 10:43; Eph. 1:7.</li>
				<li>2) On man&rsquo;s side, forgiveness of sins is through man&rsquo;s repentance&mdash;Mark 1:4.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>Forgiveness of sins is the initial and basic blessing of God&rsquo;s full salvation; based on forgiveness, the blessing of God&rsquo;s full salvation goes forward and consummates in the receiving of the gift of the Holy Spirit&mdash;Acts 2:38.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We are saved by grace, which includes Christ&rsquo;s person and redemptive work&mdash;15:11; 11:23; Rom. 3:24.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;In this One everyone who believes is justified&rdquo;&mdash;Acts 13:39:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be forgiven of sins is on the negative side (v. 38) and is for our release from condemnation; to be justified is on the positive side and is for our reconciliation to God and our being accepted by Him&mdash;Gal. 2:16; Rom. 3:24-26, 28; 5:1, 11.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;This One&rdquo; in Acts 13:39 is the One who has been resurrected to be God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, our Savior&mdash;v. 33.</li>
		<li>The One by whom we are forgiven and in whom we are justified is Himself our forgiveness and justification; the resurrected Christ is our forgiveness and justification&mdash;vv. 33-34, 38-39.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s salvation is by faith, by believing, and in God&rsquo;s salvation we experience the cleansing of our hearts by faith; this cleansing is by the Holy Spirit with the divine life&mdash;8:37; 15:7, 9; 16:31.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;As many as were appointed to eternal life believed&rdquo;&mdash;13:48:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>One&rsquo;s rejecting the gospel is evidence that he is unworthy of eternal life (v. 46); one&rsquo;s believing is proof that he was appointed or ordained by God to eternal life&mdash;v. 48.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s ordination, or predestination, for man&rsquo;s salvation is sovereignly of Himself, but He still leaves man to his own free will; whether man would believe or reject His salvation is up to man&rsquo;s own decision&mdash;2 Thes. 2:13; Acts 8:37; 16:31.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The book of Acts portrays the need for a dispensational transfer in order to be brought fully into God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;1:6-8; 1 Tim. 1:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Dispensation</em> denotes the divine arrangement in God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</li>
	<li>Acts is not merely concerned with acts but with God&rsquo;s economy and God&rsquo;s arrangement in His economy&mdash;1:8; 9:15, 17.</li>
	<li>Acts is a dispensational book because it describes a great transfer that was to be accomplished during a time of transition&mdash;the transfer from the Old Testament economy to the New Testament economy&mdash;15:7-11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To speak of a dispensational transfer in Acts means that in this book we see the need for a great turn from the old dispensation to the new&mdash;14:1-3.</li>
		<li>In Acts we can see God&rsquo;s move for His New Testament economy and all the crucial dispensational turning points related to this move&mdash;1:6-8; 10:45.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The old dispensation was the dispensation of the law and of the temple, and the new dispensation is the dispensation of Christ as the law of life and as the living temple; between these two dispensations there was a transitional period in which God was transferring His chosen people from the old dispensation into the new&mdash;6:14; 7:48-49; Rom. 8:2; Eph. 2:21-22.</li>
	<li>God in His New Testament economy had delivered and separated the Jewish believers in Christ from the Jewish nation; thus, the Jewish believers, as the church of God, should be as distinct and separate from the Jews as from the Gentiles&mdash;Acts 2:40; 1 Cor. 10:32.</li>
	<li>According to Luke&rsquo;s narration in Acts, the church among the Jews, including the early apostles, did not pass through this transition successfully due to the influence of their Judaic background&mdash;11:1-2, 17-18; 15:1-2, 13-21.</li>
	<li>James, the elders in Jerusalem, and thousands of Jewish believers still remained in a mixture of the Christian faith with the Mosaic law&mdash;21:18-26:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>They were not aware that the dispensation of the law was over and that the dispensation of grace should be fully honored, and that any disregard of the distinction between these two dispensations would be contrary to God&rsquo;s economical plan for the building up of the church as the expression of Christ&mdash;Rom. 10:4; Gal. 2:16, 21; 3:23-29.</li>
		<li>The Jewish believers in Jerusalem had formed a religious mixture of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy with the Old Testament dispensation and even insisted on putting together both faith in Christ and the out-of-date things of the Old Testament&mdash;Acts 21:18-26.</li>
		<li>This mixture was not only erroneous but also abominable in the eyes of God, who left the church in Jerusalem as it was until the devastating mixture was terminated with the destruction of Jerusalem&mdash;Matt. 22:7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord carried out a complete dispensational transfer with Paul; in four crucial Epistles concerning this transfer&mdash;Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Hebrews&mdash;there is no ground remaining for any kind of mixture; there is room only for Christ&mdash;Eph. 3:14-21; Phil. 3:1-11; Col. 3:10-11; Heb. 8:6-13.</li>
	<li>We need to know God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and have a dispensational transfer&mdash;1 Tim. 1:4; Eph. 1:10; 3:8-11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s intention is to propagate the resurrected Christ by imparting Him into us so that we may become His living members saturated with Him and constituted of Him in order that Christ may have a Body on earth for His expression; then He will bring His kingdom in, and following that there will be the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;Acts 4:33; Eph. 3:14-17a; 4:16; Rev. 11:15; 21:1-2.</li>
		<li>We need to see the vision of God&rsquo;s eternal economy and have a dispensational transfer so that we may live a life fully according to and for God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;Prov. 29:18a; Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:16, 18, 25.3.</li>
		<li>The way to keep ourselves in this dispensational transfer is to remain faithful to the vision of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;Acts 26:19.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Continuation of the Book of Acts&mdash;<br />
the Corporate Continuation of Christ</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 27&mdash;28</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The apostle Paul lived Christ for His magnification as His continuation&mdash;Phil. 1:19-21a; Acts 9:4-5, 15; 26:19; 1 Tim. 1:16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul was a disciple of Christ&mdash;seeing Christ, hearing Christ, and learning Christ as the reality is in Jesus&mdash;Acts 9:1-19, 25-27; 22:14-15; Eph. 4:20-21.</li>
	<li>Paul was a chosen vessel of Christ to contain Him, be filled with Him, and overflow with Him for His fullness&mdash;Acts 9:15; 2 Cor. 4:7; Eph. 1:22-23; 3:19.</li>
	<li>Paul was a man of prayer&mdash;Acts 9:11; 13:1-3; 14:23; 16:13, 25; 20:36; 21:5; 22:17; 28:8; Eph. 6:18; Col. 4:2.</li>
	<li>Paul depended on the Body, doing everything in the Body, through the Body, and for the Body&mdash;Acts 9:11, 17-18, 25-27; 1 Cor. 1:1; 12:14-27.</li>
	<li>Paul practiced calling on the name of the Lord&mdash;Acts 9:14, 21; 22:16; 2 Tim. 2:22; Rom. 10:12-13; Phil. 2:9-11.</li>
	<li>Paul lived by the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus (the Spirit of a man with abundant strength for suffering) for his preaching ministry, a ministry of suffering carried out among human beings and for human beings in the human life for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;Acts 9:16; 16:7, 22-34; Phil. 3:10; Col. 1:24; 2 Cor. 6:4; 11:23; Heb. 6:19-20; 13:13.</li>
	<li>Paul lived in his mingled spirit (the divine Spirit mingled with his human spirit as one spirit)&mdash;Acts 17:16; 19:21; Rom. 8:4, 6, 16; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
	<li>Paul was filled with the Spirit of joy, essentially for his existence, and with the Spirit of power, economically for his function&mdash;Acts 13:9, 52; Eph. 5:18.</li>
	<li>Paul exercised himself to always have a good and pure conscience&mdash;Acts 23:1; 24:16; 1 Tim. 1:19; 3:9.</li>
	<li>Paul lived a life of always rejoicing in the Lord and thanking Him&mdash;Acts 16:25; 27:35; Phil. 4:4; Col. 3:16; 1 Thes. 5:16-18.</li>
	<li>Paul was allied with God and assisted by God to speak the gospel boldly in the name of Jesus to spread the testimony of Jesus unto the uttermost part of the earth&mdash;Acts 9:20, 27; 26:22-29; 28:31; 1:8; 1 Thes. 2:2; cf. Rom. 15:24, 28.</li>
	<li>Paul cherished the saints in the humanity of Jesus and nourished them in the divinity of Christ with all the truths of God&rsquo;s eternal economy, displaying in his living the word of the Lord Jesus that it is better to give than to receive&mdash;20:18-38; 1 Thes. 2:1-12.</li>
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s fourth ministry journey (Acts 27&mdash;28) shows in a particular way his life of living Christ, magnifying Christ, doing all things in Christ, and pursuing Christ in order to be found in Christ (Phil. 1:19-21a; 3:8-9, 14; 4:13):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>All during the apostle&rsquo;s long and unfortunate imprisonment-voyage, the Lord kept the apostle in His ascendancy and enabled him to live a life far beyond the realm of anxiety; this life was fully dignified, with the highest standard of human virtues expressing the most excellent divine attributes&mdash;vv. 5-9.</li>
		<li>This was Jesus living again on the earth in His divinely enriched humanity! This was the wonderful, excellent, and mysterious God-man, who lived in the Gospels, continuing to live in the Acts through one of His many members! This was a living witness of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and God-exalted Christ!</li>
		<li>In Paul&rsquo;s living and ministry he expressed the very true God, who in Jesus Christ had gone through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, and who, as the all-inclusive Spirit, was then living in him and through him&mdash;Gal. 1:15-16, 24; 2:20; 3:14; cf. Acts 28:6.</li>
		<li>On the sea in the storm, the Lord had made the apostle not only the owner of his fellow voyagers (27:24) but also their life-guarantor and comforter (vv. 22, 25); now, on the land in peace, the Lord made him furthermore not only a magical attraction in the eyes of the superstitious people (28:1-6) but also a healer and a joy to them (vv. 7-10).</li>
		<li>The warm welcome that Paul received from the brothers in Rome and the loving care of those in Puteoli (vv. 13-15) show the beautiful Body life that existed in the early days among the churches and apostles:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Apparently, the apostle, as a prisoner in bonds, had entered the region of the dark capital of the Satan-usurped empire; actually, as the ambassador of Christ with His authority (Eph. 6:20; Matt. 28:18-19), he had come into another part of the participation in the Body life of Christ&rsquo;s church in the kingdom of God on earth.</li>
			<li>While he was suffering the persecution of religion in the empire of Satan (the satanic chaos in the old creation), he was enjoying the church life in the kingdom of God (the divine economy for the new creation); this was a comfort and an encouragement to him.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The continuation of the book of Acts is the corporate continuation of Christ with the corporate living of the perfected God-men as the reality of the Body of Christ&mdash;28:31; cf. John 5:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The book of Acts was actually not ended but left open that more may be added; the reason for this must have been that the work of the Holy Spirit in preaching Christ for His propagation, multiplication, and spread through the believers of Christ was not yet completed and needed to be continued for a long period of time.</li>
	<li>Such an evangelistic work for Christ&rsquo;s propagation, multiplication, and spread is according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy for the producing of many sons for God (Rom. 8:29) that they might be the members of Christ to constitute His Body (12:5) for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s eternal plan and the fulfillment of His eternal will; this is revealed in detail in the twenty-one Epistles and the book of Revelation, which follow the book of Acts.</li>
	<li>Since God is after a corporate vessel, we must be brought into the reality of the Body of Christ and learn to live the Body life by denying our natural life; otherwise, we are useless in His hand and can never fulfill His goal.</li>
	<li>In the four Gospels God was incarnated, passed through human living, died, and resurrected, thus completing Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9); in the book of Acts this embodiment of God, as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), spreads Christ into His believers, working the processed Triune God into His chosen, redeemed, and transformed people to make them the constituents of the church, through which God may be expressed.</li>
	<li>The ultimate issue of the church will be the New Jerusalem in eternity future as God&rsquo;s full and eternal expression, which will also be God&rsquo;s eternal kingdom as the sphere in which He reigns in His divine life in eternity forever and ever; this should be the reality and goal of all our gospel preaching today as we follow the pattern of the apostle Paul&mdash;&ldquo;proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, unhindered&rdquo;&mdash;Acts 28:31.</li>
