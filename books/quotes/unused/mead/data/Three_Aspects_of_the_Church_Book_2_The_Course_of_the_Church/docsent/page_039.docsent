   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROTESTANTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The eleventh and twelfth centuries were the darkest period in the history of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The power of the Roman Catholic Church had grown to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Eastern Greek Orthodox Church was also powerful, but it was not as strong as the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Roman Catholic popes were more powerful than at any other time in their history; they established almost all the kings and emperors of Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In such a situation a fifth group was produced in the sixteenth century, the Reformation, or Protestant, sect.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Protestantism began with Martin Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This group gained strength rapidly and included many people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Protestants were not confined to one country; rather, many people all over Europe took action simultaneously to produce Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the sixteenth century Christianity was divided into five main groups.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Nestorians, however, were by that time only a scattered remnant.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the remaining four groups were the Roman Catholic Church, the Greek Orthodox Church, the Protestant churches, and those with pure hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Within these four main groups, there were many smaller groups.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Roman Catholic Church is not truly universal; there are many sects of Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although they recognize and take their orders from one pope, in practice they are very different and constantly criticize and attack one another.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They wear different clothes and pray different prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some nuns let their hair grow, and others shave their heads; their veils and the color of their habits vary as well.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Catholic sects separate themselves rigidly from one another; some emphasize scholarship, and others are interested only in works.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are hundreds of variations, so it is difficult to enumerate all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Greek Orthodox Church is also divided into sects, but there are fewer Orthodox sects than Catholic sects.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The strongest Catholic sect is the Jesuits.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Protestantism there are more than two thousand sects today, although some conservatively estimate that there are only several hundred sects.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Baguio in the Philippines, we met an American missionary who said he was from the Church of the Nazarene; we had not heard of that group.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This shows that we do not know the number of sects in Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The pure-hearted believers are also divided into numerous scattered sects.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, even they are no longer pure-hearted.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is like the time of the Judges when there was no king in Israel and everyone did what was right in his own eyes; it is almost to the point where the situation of the church is so confused that anyone can establish his own group.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is proper to oppose organization, but it is wrong to be so loose and free.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not long after we came to Taiwan, we saw a sign that read Christian Family Meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After a few days we saw that someone had established a church in another place.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we spoke with these groups, they both declared that they did not want organized Christianity and only desired to serve God according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some scholars of church history would classify such groups with the pure-hearted believers; some have even been called Puritans.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, these groups are scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some believers are pure to such an extent that they reject everything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They do not set up churches or join any church; rather, they stay at home reading the Bible, praying, and worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There are many such ones in Taipei and Tokyo.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They have a clean, pious living, and read the Bible, pray, and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is difficult to speak about the church with them because they think that all Christian groups are wrong and have problems; therefore, they do not want any church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today the church is in a very divided condition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE PROPER STANDING</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As Christians, with which group should we stand?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must belong to a group, unless we are not Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are Christians, we must be in a group.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Roman Catholic Church today is powerful in terms of money, scholarship, position, and influence; Catholics study every area of knowledge, including education, science, and politics.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They have a grasp of modern human society s psychology of education.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Modern man wants to be educated; even the poor want an education.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It seems that the future of human life is based on education, and those who are not educated have no future.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Catholics run excellent schools, from elementary through secondary school to the university level.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Their principals, vice-principals, teachers, and professors are all specialists.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, people are willing to be educated by them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once young people are among them, the Catholics use every available method to entice and encourage them to join the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a student converts to Catholicism, his education will be more convenient in terms of his grades and the treatment he receives.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Philippines some brothers and sisters among us graduated from Catholic schools.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was very difficult for them to graduate because they were not Catholics.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Almost all the people who study in the Catholic schools eventually become Catholics; the Roman Catholic Church gains students as they study at their schools.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This has continued from generation to generation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The graduates of Catholic schools are usually Catholic.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To the Roman Catholic Church, it does not matter whether they are true or false believers as long as they are Catholic in name.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In addition to their schools, the Roman Catholic Church also has a specially trained group of people who work to gain talented students and rich families.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Those in their schools who are good students or come from rich families are unable to escape once they are noticed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The priests and lay brothers have received special training to gain such young people through particular care.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Their love, care, and sympathy toward these young people are for the purpose of gaining their heart so that they also might become priests.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In order to gain young girls, the nuns love and care for the female students to such an extent that they even trim the girls fingernails.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They love and care for them to such an extent that almost all the young girls consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is not loose speaking; there are many cases in which these things happened.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Everyone has emotions, and the Catholics heart to care for and sympathize with people is much better than ours.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is not surprising that people cannot escape them, and many young people become priests and nuns.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the other hand, they care for gaining only the rich.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Statistically, after World War I a third of the world s wealth was in Rome; thus, a third of the world s wealth was in the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Another third was in the hands of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The concentration of wealth in the Roman Catholic Church has only increased.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Revelation 17 through 19 speaks of MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT ; God calls, Come out of her, My people, that you do not participate in her sins 18:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This shows that she is very great.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Of course, we should not neglect the fact that in the Roman Catholic Church there are a small number of saved, godly people.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Where should Christians serve the Lord today?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the Roman Catholic Church?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the Greek Orthodox Church?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In Nestorianism or Protestantism?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>With those who have a pure heart for the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>No one can escape the issue of sects, because Christianity is divided and has no way to unite.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There are genuine believers and godly people in every major sect.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We must consider where we should be.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The scholarly writers of church history would undoubtedly rank us among the pure in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Although we are not a sect, they would classify us as a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is the situation, and we cannot avoid it.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The only way to escape classification is to not be a Christian; as Christians, we must fall into one of the five major classifications.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Many years ago in Nanking, a member of the Uigur tribe from the Sinkiang Province heard the gospel and received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Later, he told us that his mother and aunts were Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>His aunt met in a church without a name or a pastor; when they came together to meet and sing hymns, it seemed as if no one was leading.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The only way he could describe their meetings was to say, It is almost like your meetings here.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This shows that in faraway Sinkiang Province a group of people who love the Lord with a pure heart has been raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We may think that we go to remote areas to preach the gospel because the people in those areas have not heard the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>However, this is not correct.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The people there have not only heard the name of Jesus, but there are some among them who have a pure heart to worship God according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God has many hidden works that are not publicized and are unknown to us.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I deeply feel that these hidden, pure-hearted believers are taking the right way before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The responsible brothers in each locality should be in fear and trembling before the Lord, because being hidden is always better than being exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Although we cannot avoid the matter of sects, we must absolutely keep ourselves from being sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We are different from the sects, but we should not argue with people about who is a sect and who is not.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It is foolish to do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We must seriously ask the Lord where we should be in light of the degraded condition of the church in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We should be among the hidden believers who are pure in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We should not hope for a universal church; the Lord is not looking for this.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>A universal church is not our commission.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Our only responsibility is to learn to be pure-hearted believers before the Lord, not making a display of ourselves and not becoming involved with any movement but, instead, simply serving the Lord in a hidden way.</S>
