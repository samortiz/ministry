   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Earth here represents humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When God branches out into humanity as the earth, He brings forth fruit.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The bread issues from the grains, and the grains come from the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Moreover, no seed can grow by itself.</S>

   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When a seed is planted, it stretches out its element into the ground, and at the same time absorbs some element of the ground into itself.</S>

   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The growth is just the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Jesus is not only divine; neither is He merely human.</S>
