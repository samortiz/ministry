   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>JOSEPH RELEASED FROM PRISON INDIRECTLY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH HIS INTERPRETATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF THE CUPBEARER'S DREAM</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we come to my burden in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My burden is to point out that Joseph was released from prison through his speaking by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Joseph dreamed that he was a sheaf rising up and that his brothers were bowing down to him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ten years went by, and still this dream had not been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If this had happened to us, we would have been disappointed to the uttermost and said, "Forget about this dream.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I'm through with being a dreamer and with hearing about dreams."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If Joseph had done this, he probably would never have been released from prison.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was released from the dungeon by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, Joseph was not released at the time he interpreted the dreams of his two companions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He interpreted their dreams by speaking in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If I had been the one interpreting dreams for others, I would have been afraid they would ask about my own dreams, because I would have had the vision, but not the experience or the fulfillment of the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, I would not have dared to say anything for fear that someone might say, "What are you talking about?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Don't talk about dreams until your own dreams have been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I don't believe in you."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But no matter whether his dreams had been fulfilled or not, Joseph spoke boldly by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If he had been questioned, he might have said, "Yes, I have had two dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although they have not been fulfilled, I still believe in them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps tomorrow they will be fulfilled."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, by his speaking Joseph was released from prison.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If he had not spoken to the cupbearer, there would have been no one to tell Pharaoh about Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was the cupbearer who brought the news to Pharaoh that there was someone in prison who could interpret dreams 41:9-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, Joseph was released from prison indirectly through his interpretation of the cupbearer's dream.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have experienced this myself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1957 I was somewhat troubled by a problem that had arisen in the churches in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But one day the Lord showed me that I should forget about the problem and begin to speak concerning the kingdom and the New Jerusalem, telling people that the church life today is a miniature of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, I began to speak boldly, first in Taipei and then in Manila.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>An elderly British missionary attended the meetings in Manila and heard my messages.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After one of the meetings, he came to me and said, "Brother Lee, do you mean these things to be for today or for the future?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I said that I meant both, he replied, "The New Jerusalem will certainly be in the future, but I cannot see it here today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How can you say that it is both present and future?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nevertheless, I continued to say that it was both.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He would not believe it, but I did.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, he left the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that the more you say no to the vision, the more you will be out.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You may say, "There is no such thing as the church life; this is simply Brother Lee's dream.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let's forget about it."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the more you say this, the more you will be out of today's church life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I believe that the church life is here today."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more you say this, the more you will be in it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a dreamer's vision.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all need to speak like dreamers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not wait until you have the experience before you speak.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Speak first.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Speak immediately after you have seen the vision and then you will have the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Andrew Murray once said that a good minister always speaks more than he has experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In a sense, a good minister must be a boaster.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>During the years I have been in this country, I have spoken so boldly about the church life that some might have thought that I was boasting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Regarding the church life, some asked me, "Brother Lee, does this work?"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I answered, "Why not?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For those who have said that it was impossible to have the church life, it has been impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In 1962 we had our first conference in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Immediately after that conference, I was invited to a brother's home in Whittier.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One day my host asked me, "Brother Lee, do you intend to say that what you minister actually works?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I replied, "I can assure you that it does.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I would even sign a guarantee to this effect."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whether or not the vision works depends upon your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you say, "No," it will not work for you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But if you say, "Yes," it will work for you, even though it does not work for others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It all depends on whether you say yes or no. If you say no, it will be no; and if you say yes, it will be yes.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Concerning the dream, the vision, it matters a great deal whether we say yes or no; for either our yes or our no will come true.</S>
