   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE EATING JESUS FOR GROWTH AND BUILDING Scripture Reading: Eph 3:8; Rom 10:12; Col 2:9; John 1:14, 16; 1 Cor 3:2a, 7; Col 2:19; Eph 4:13 CHRIST AS THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN OUR SPIRIT FOR GOD'S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ today is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b indwelling our spirit Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen clearly that this is simply for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's eternal plan is to get a living building, but Satan came into man, into man's flesh, trying to frustrate God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, God is wiser than His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He came in the likeness of the flesh to crush the flesh, and then in resurrection He became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He became the Spirit to come into our spirit, and we are joined to Him as one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may say that this was for life-imparting, for saving us, or for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But all of these points are for one ultimate point, that is, for us to be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ's dealing with the flesh and being the life-giving Spirit in our spirit are for one goal, that is, for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>BUILDING BEING THE GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the New Testament, the concept of building is much different from our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our natural concept concerning building is that one piece of material is placed upon another piece repeatedly, piece upon piece, until we have a high tower.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in the eyes of God, this is not building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a piling of material.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some may say that we Christians are people of togetherness, so they think building is just to get together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But togetherness is not building.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you sit together with me, and we talk to one another about our personal affairs, this is togetherness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Building is not just to get together, to be piled up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Building in the New Testament is growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's salvation is absolutely not a matter of doing, working, acting, or behaving.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's salvation consummates in one thing our growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all have to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The vine tree in John 15 is not a matter of doing, working, behaving, laboring, or striving.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The vine tree is altogether a matter of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Growing is the real building.</S>
