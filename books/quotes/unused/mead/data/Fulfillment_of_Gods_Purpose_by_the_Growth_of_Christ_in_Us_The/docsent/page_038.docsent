   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE SECRET OF LIVING, WALKING,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND HAVING OUR BEING IN AND ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT EXPERIENCING LIFE IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we need to spend some time to see how to experience life in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The experience of life is absolutely a matter in the two spirits: the divine Spirit and the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is the Spirit of life as the breath and the Spirit of power as the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This Spirit is both God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God, Christ, and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are not three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are the Triune God, one God with three mysterious and wonderful Persons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Triune God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He died on the cross, was buried, resurrected, and then He ascended to the heavens where He was enthroned and crowned with glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After all these accomplishments and attainments, He came down as the Spirit of power, the all-inclusive, mighty, living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From that time He began to work and to move to gain His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His people were all chosen before the foundation of the world in eternity Eph 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After He accomplished all things for His economy, He came down as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is the breath and the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is the Spirit who gives life and the Spirit of power.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As such a Spirit He picks up all His chosen people and puts them into Himself to make them one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By this baptism the Body was produced and the new man was born.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now our life today is the wonderful, all-inclusive Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our spirit is the central part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we live in our body, we are a very shallow person in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we live in our soul, we are deeper, but still not so deep.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to live in our spirit, the deepest part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may be sincere in our soul, but this sincerity is not the deepest sincerity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our sincerity should be in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our spirit is the deepest part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we called on the Lord Jesus for the first time, we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At that time the Lord Jesus as the divine Spirit, the Spirit of life and power, the life-giving Spirit as the all-inclusive Spirit, came into our spirit and we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That which is born of the divine Spirit is our human spirit John 3:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our human spirit was regenerated by the divine Spirit, who is the realization of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He came into our spirit and remains here to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In our spirit we have the divine Person as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before we were saved, we did not have a life in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But now that we are saved, the divine Person, the divine Spirit, who is Christ Himself, is in our spirit to remain here and be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The divine Spirit is with our spirit, and these two spirits have become one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our oneness with Him is not in our flesh or in our soul but in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today Christ as the divine Spirit lives and stays in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord be with your spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we consider how poor we are, we may wonder how we can be the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a doubt from our mental consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But when we turn to our spirit, we have the witness and the assurance that we are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we were not the children of God, we would not call God "Abba, Father" Rom 8:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The mind may doubt, but the spirit cries, "Abba, Father!"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have the assurance that we are the children of God, not in our mind, but in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to learn the lesson of rejecting the doubts in our mind and praising the Father from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Triune God is the all-inclusive Spirit within our spirit as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He stays here, dwells here, lives here, moves here, and acts here.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The center of God's salvation is that this all-inclusive Spirit, who is Christ and God, is dwelling, living, moving, and acting in our spirit as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are one with Him in our spirit.</S>
