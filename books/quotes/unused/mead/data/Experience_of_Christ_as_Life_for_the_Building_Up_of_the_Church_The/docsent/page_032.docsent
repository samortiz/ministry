   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LINE OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fourth line in 1 Corinthians is the line of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a book written to the local church at Corinth 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this book there is a definite church-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whatever Paul said was for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today the Lord's desire is to recover the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From the time of Martin Luther, the Lord began His recovery work in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Within the Lord's recovery there have been four main categories of things: 1 the teachings or doctrines of fundamentalism; 2 the gifts of Pentecostalism; 3 the preaching and spreading of the gospel of evangelicalism; and 4 the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord's recovery has passed through these stages to reach the present-day recovery of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the previous recovery work is for this present-day recovery, the building up of the local churches for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to take Christ as our inner life for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We also need to see the difference between the gifts and life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Balaam's donkey speaking a human language was a gift, but that did not change the donkey's life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There was no change in life, but there was a change in speaking ability.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some think that the more gifts they have, the more life they have.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But a gift is an enablement or ability for service.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First Corinthians 13 confirms this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This chapter tells us that everything is empty without love, and love is the expression of Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you have the gift of speaking in tongues without love, you are as sounding brass and a clanging cymbal, making empty sounds without life v. 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Gifts are outward.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are the outward endowments of God to enable and equip us for His service.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in addition to these gifts, we need the inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Corinthians had the gifts, but they were short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In fact, they were still babes, with hardly any growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They were not only soulish but also fleshly and even fleshy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They misused their gifts because of the shortage of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They were short of love, which is the expression of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The gifts are the outward abilities, but life is the inward spiritual essence, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to realize life, we have to learn how to exercise our spirit, because the essence of life is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today Christ is the life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit, so we have to learn to walk, to behave, and to have our being in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Never do anything according to what you think, what you like, or what you decide.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But always have your being in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You have to renounce and reject your smart mind, your loving emotions, and your strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you behave yourself in these parts of your soul, you are a soulish man and you are through with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Your behavior will become an insulation between you and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not a matter of whether we are good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is a matter of whether or not we are one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You may do good things and yet be insulated from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You have to remain in the spirit to be spiritual, not soulish, fleshly, or fleshy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can practice the church life and build up the church life only by living in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christianity has been divided by teachings, doctrines, and by gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Also, the church cannot be built up by good speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many good speakers today minister very little of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to enjoy, experience, and partake of Christ and then minister what we have experienced to others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we enjoy Christ in the spirit and minister Christ to one another, the local church will be built up and there will be no division.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We will have the oneness of Philadelphia with the real brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As long as Christ is enjoyed and ministered, the church will grow up with the nourishment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today we are in the age of the recovery of the local churches by Christ being enjoyed by us to be our nourishment for our growth in life.</S>
