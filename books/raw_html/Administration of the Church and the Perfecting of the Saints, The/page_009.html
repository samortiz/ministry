        <h2 class="head1">BRINGING ALL SAINTS INTO FUNCTION</h2>
<p>The elders can always come up with reasons for not putting people to use. Based on these excuses, no one can be used. Hence, the saints are set aside. The elders must bring the saints to the right track by perfecting them. A piece of wood cannot become a door by itself. It requires a carpenter to work on it before it can be installed into a building. This is the meaning of perfecting. The more the elders bring the saints into function, the fewer problems there will be in the church. The materials that are used to make furniture will not become a problem.</p>
<p>In building up the church, it is critical for the elders to use all the different kinds of materials, regardless of whether they are good. Sometimes, the well-behaved saints cannot carry out a task, but the naughty ones can carry out the task. The function of the saints depends on how the elders perfect them and build them up. The elders need to perfect, shepherd, and teach the saints and then assign responsibility for things to the saints. The elders need to identify the things that need to be done in order to assign them to the saints so that the saints can function.</p>
<p>The elders should not think that they are the only ones able to do things. Many young people are full of potential and will eventually do things better than the elders. There is a Chinese saying: &ldquo;There are only champion trainees but not champion trainers.&rdquo; A trainer may not be a champion himself, but one of his trainees may become a champion. Therefore, the elders need to let the saints develop by giving them opportunities to serve. Our problem is that many people are not built up but are &ldquo;piled up&rdquo; on the side. They have nothing to do, so they just gossip about the elders and about the church. The elders cannot blame them, because the elders do not give them anything to do. These ones have too much time, so they gossip. The elders need to build up the saints so that they function and bear responsibility. When the saints bear responsibility, they will not have time to gossip.</p>
<p>I have learned a basic secret from my many years of service in the church. If someone criticizes something, let him do it. For instance, if someone says that the glass windows were not thoroughly cleaned, he can be put in charge of cleaning and be given a chance to do it. This will help him to stop criticizing. If he does not do as good a job, his condition will be exposed. If he does a better job, his ability will be manifested. We should not prohibit those who criticize from doing things. If a person complains that the message was poor, he can be asked to give a message the next Lord&rsquo;s Day. When he gives the message, either his poverty will be exposed, or his riches will be manifested. The principle is that we should do our best to bring people into function.</p>
<p>The elders should not consider themselves to be in a higher position, nor should they consider themselves to be the authority for every decision. It is bureaucratic and authoritarian to set aside those who &ldquo;disobey.&rdquo; The Lord has commissioned me to minister life and truth to the churches and the saints. The churches have the freedom to decide what they want to do and how they will develop. There are more than three hundred churches on six continents. Not one church is in my hand. I live in Anaheim, but I do not know about many matters in the church in Anaheim. Some may even think that I am not a member of the church in Anaheim, because I am unaware of many things in the church there; these matters are in the hands of the elders. Every church should have the opportunity to develop, and the elders should allow the saints the opportunity to develop.</p>
<p>It is easy for the elders to conduct themselves as officials. In some situations it is better not to have elders, because they cause the church to suffer. In Revelation the Lord does not mention elders in the local churches. I believe that at the time of Revelation, people viewed the eldership as a system and the elders as officials. Hence, the Lord does not mention the elders or deacons in the local churches. The Lord seems to be saying, &ldquo;We do not need the elders to be officials. Instead, My people need the opportunity to develop, to live in the spirit, and to follow the spirit at all times.&rdquo; Some have a wrong concept and do not pray in a meeting when they feel that the meeting is under a certain elder brother&rsquo;s leadership. This should not be practiced. We are all brothers and sisters and should fulfill our functions in the meetings.</p>
<p>The elders in some local churches are like kings who give orders to the saints at will. This is entirely improper. As much as possible, the elders should assign the affairs of the church to the saints. The elders need to oversee instead of replacing the saints. When I hand things over to the saints, I often find that they do a better job. They can do what I could not do. Every person is limited; we have only two hands. May the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood cover me to say that although I have done many things, everything is now in others&rsquo; hands. The elders must learn how to perfect the saints. If the elders think that there is no &ldquo;good&rdquo; material, they should still use the &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; materials. A coffee table does not need to be made of valuable material; it can be made of ordinary wood.</p>
<p>If the elders cannot lead the saints to function, everyone standing idle will become a problem. Those standing idle will turn to idle words, which will turn into problems. The elders need to perfect the saints and allow them to fulfill their portion within their measure. At the same time, the elders should supply the saints with life and pray for them so that they may learn the lessons of life. If the saints are built up in this way, there will be no more problems.</p>
<p>The problem is that the elders think too highly of themselves. Every person is confident. However, I have learned to do things against my nature and not trust in myself but to commit things to others and teach them to do things. I once asked a sister to take care of a matter; she handled it in a better way, so I told her to do it her way because it was better. The elders must do this if they want to perfect the saints and build them up. If everything is held in the hands of the elders, the church will not develop.</p>
<p>We must help the saints realize that the elders do not have to approve everything that they do. The elders may not have the feeling to preach the gospel, but they should not discourage or restrict the saints who have earnestly received a burden for the gospel. Rather, the elders should encourage all the saints to preach the gospel. Not everything needs a stamp of approval from the elders. That is not the Body. The Body is of life and in the spirit.</p>
<p>There have always been those who love to be first (cf. 3 John 9), but the elders should not be such. Those who love to be first think that by exercising strict control they prevent chaos in the church. There have been some who caused problems, but most believers will not cause problems. Therefore, the saints should be free to function. Among the Lord&rsquo;s disciples, only one was Judas. The elders do not need to worry that everyone will be like Judas.</p>
<p>Let me repeat, the elders should not hold things in their hands. If a person is able to do a great thing, let him do it. If a person is able to do a small thing, let him do it. Even a person who is unable to do anything should do something, because he will learn. No one knows everything or is able to do everything from birth. Experience is acquired through learning. If a person makes a mistake, give him more chances. He will not always make mistakes; his mistakes are not on purpose. Hence, the elders need a large heart and much prayer. The elders are shepherds, so they should pray for the saints by name. In particular, they should pray for those who do not know how to do things and for those who may cause problems. The elders are busy, and they should make others busy as well. If only the elders are busy while the others stand idle, the church is not being built up.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
