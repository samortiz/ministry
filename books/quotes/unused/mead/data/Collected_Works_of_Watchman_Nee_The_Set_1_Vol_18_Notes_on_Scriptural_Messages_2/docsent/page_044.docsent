   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The geography of Canaan is as follows: on the east side is the river Euphrates.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This was the river Euphrates which Abraham crossed from Ur of the Chaldees to Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the west side is the Jordan River.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Canaan lies in between the two rivers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What does the Bible say after Lot chose all the plain of Jordan?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east" 13:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Journeyed east" was to move towards Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since he made this choice, he was able to move east gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No one succumbs to sin in one day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No one falls in one day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is all a matter of losing a little today and a little tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After a while, one falls into sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you choose the plain, it is easy for you to shepherd the flock and look for water because there is no need to climb the mountains, and you can live comfortably.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you desire comfort and do not want hardship, your tent will slowly move eastward.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you love the sinful pleasure of the world, your feet will eventually walk toward the world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you cannot hold back the first step, you will not be able to hold back the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since your heart leans toward the world, you cannot keep your feet from walking toward the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since your eyes are fixed on the world, you cannot safeguard your feet from treading upon the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you have chosen the world, you will not be able to keep your feet from walking in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Genesis 13:12 says, "Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Friends, brothers, and sisters, I do not know what choice you have made today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Abraham yielded the fat and beautiful land to Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He remained in the land of Canaan, the land to which God called him, the land that God could bless, and the place where he could receive spiritual edification.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What about Lot?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He dwelt in the cities of the plain of the Jordan River, the place that he chose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Are we like Abraham, who dwelt in Canaan, the land to which God called him?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Or are we like Lot, who lived in the cities of the plain of the river Jordan, which he chose by himself?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Genesis 13:12 says, "Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Lot thought to himself, "I am a righteous man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If I choose Sodom, I will surely fall and become apostate.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, it may be all right to choose a place outside Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is merely close to Sodom; it is not in Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not good to be completely in Sodom, but perhaps it is all right to be near Sodom."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Oh, we may think that it is not good to choose the world, yet perhaps it is permissible to choose something or some place that borders the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many Christians are borderline Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The world says, "You do not look like one of us."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Canaan also says, "You do not look like one of us."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is true that you are only settling close to the world, but you do not live in Canaan either.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On which side are you?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once I was in a village, and I asked a soldier why some soldiers so easily change sides.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He said that it was because the uniform was gray.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The color gray is a mixture of black and white.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is neither white nor black.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many Christians are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They do not seem to be on this side or that side.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They seem to be in Paradise, yet at the same time in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They are reluctant to give up God on this side, and they are unwilling to let go of the world on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Friends, on which side are you today?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Are you a gray Christian, one who is neither white nor black?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When you encounter people of the world, do they consider you degraded or a twelfth-century man, who is very different from others in the world?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The sad thing is that some consider Christians to be very different, yet find that they are just like themselves!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the saddest remark an outsider can make toward a Christian!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many are not willing to stand up to say that they belong to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since they are already Christians, they do not consider it to be of any importance to acknowledge it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They cannot let go of Paradise, but they also want Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They go to church on Sunday mornings, and they read the Bible for five minutes every day, thinking that they are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, they do not have real Christian fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They cannot really give up the cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Nevertheless, we must ask God to deliver us out of this way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Otherwise, it will be very dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You may think that it is all right that you have not entered Sodom, that you have not become apostate, and that you have not declared that you do not believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, your tent is gradually moving, and it will move all the way to Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you take the first step, it is inevitable that you will take the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you have chosen to face Sodom, you will eventually enter the city of Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you have chosen worldly pleasure, you will inevitably end up in sin and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you have chosen material goods, you will inevitably be defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You must say, "God, in what direction are my feet heading toward?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Originally, you were outside the cities of the plain, but your tent can move gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I do not know whether your feet have moved or not.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I do not know if you have entered Sodom or not.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Perhaps the footprints you have left behind will tell whether or not your feet have moved.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At first, you can choose to leave other Christians because you value your cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But it is inevitable that your footsteps will move further along.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Thank God that there are still many Christians today whose tents are in Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>May we see that we must repudiate the sin of the world as well as the pleasure of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Genesis 13:13 says, "But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Did Lot know the condition of Sodom?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Lot knew.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Sodomites were exceedingly sinful and wicked before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Yet step by step Lot moved into Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When your feet move away from other Christians, your tent will also gradually move toward Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What God hates, you will not hate.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>What God condemns, you will no longer condemn.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Your feet will slowly move eastward.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There is a saying in the north which goes, "Slow is not something to be afraid of, but standing still is."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Standing still is something Satan fears.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But being slow easily gives opportunity to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is how temptation comes in. If we go against our conscience a little today, we will go against it a little more tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we cut down a little in reading the Bible today, we will cut down a little more tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If we pray a few minutes less today, we will pray a few minutes less tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we testify a little less today, we will testify a little less tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>By these reductions day after day, we eventually backslide.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Satan does not make us cease from going to the meetings, reading the Bible, praying, and testifying all at once.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He causes us to backslide gradually, bit by bit and moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He is extremely patient in dragging us along.</S>
