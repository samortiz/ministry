   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN LIVING WITH THE DIVINE TRINITY 1 Scripture Reading: John 15:5, 7-8, 16; 14:17; 1 John 3:24a; John 14:23, 21-22; Gal 2:20b; Rom 8:9-11, 2, 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that to live in the Divine Trinity is to dwell in Him as our home.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To live in Him is to abide in Him, to remain in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord said, "Abide in Me and I in you" John 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, abiding in Him is a condition of His abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whether or not He would abide in us depends upon our abiding in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To live in Christ, to abide in Christ, is the first part of our enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this chapter we come to the second part of our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This part of our enjoyment is conveyed by the Lord's word concerning His abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His abiding in us brings His presence to us, so we live with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To live in Him puts us into the position of the enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To live with Him is the enjoyment itself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To live with the Divine Trinity is to enjoy the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To live with a person is to enjoy that person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, to live with the Triune God is our enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to my rough estimation, one-fourth of the New Testament is for our living in the Triune God, but three-fourths of the New Testament is for our living with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To live with the Triune God covers nearly the entire New Testament revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The final revelation of the entire Bible, in Revelation 22, is the eternal part of our living with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Revelation 22 reveals the throne of God and of the Lamb, out of which proceeds the river of water of life v. 1 . On the two sides of this river grows the tree of life, yielding its fruit each month to be the food of God's redeemed for eternity v. 2 . God's redeemed will be His slaves and His priests v. 3 . While they are serving God, they will see God's face, and the Triune God's name will be on their forehead v. 4 . This indicates that they are one with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Bearing the name of the Triune God not only indicates that we belong to Him but also that we are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In eternity we all will have the name of the Triune God on our forehead.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We will drink the river of water of life, eat the tree of life, and enjoy God as our light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to Revelation 22:5 we will not need the light of a lamp made by man or the light of the sun created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We will only need and only have God Himself as our illumination.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We will enjoy Him as our light, and we will also enjoy reigning in and with Him as kings forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the last view, the last vision, of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the eternal part of our enjoying the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This revelation is under the section of living with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our living with the Triune God today will bring us into that enjoyment in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In eternity the fallen angels and the fallen human beings will live with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because they will be with Satan, they will partake of whatever Satan will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They will suffer Satan's eternal judgment, the torment of the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same principle, we will be with our Triune God, so we will enjoy whatever He is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To live with the Triune God is to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to see this last vision revealed in the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to have a bird's-eye view of the entire revelation of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This bird's-eye view is that one-fourth of the New Testament is concerning our living in the Triune God, whereas three-fourths is concerning our living with the Triune God.</S>
