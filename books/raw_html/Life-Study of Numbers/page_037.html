<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE ELEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>BEING FORMED INTO AN ARMY</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(10)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Num. 6:22-27; 2 Cor. 13:14</H1><P>In this message we come to a wonderful section of the book of Numbers&#151;6:22-27. These verses cover the matter of being blessed by God in His divine trinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. BEING BLESSED BY GOD</H2><P>This section on being blessed comes after the dealing with defilement, the test of suspicion, and the vow of the Nazarite. These three things are actually three steps. First, we must deal with anything that is defiling. Then we need to undergo the test related to suspicion. Following this, we should consecrate ourselves to the Lord by taking the vow of the Nazarite.</P><P>If we spend time to consider these three steps, we will realize that to serve the Lord and to fight for His kingdom are not shallow, small, or light matters. On the contrary, these matters are very deep, high, and profound. We must be up to the level of a Nazarite, one who overcomes natural affection, earthly pleasure, rebellion, and unexpected death. If we overcome these four things and stay away from them, we will be in a position to receive God Himself as our blessing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By God in His Divine Trinity</H2><P>After the record of the Nazarite vow, the Lord told Moses to tell Aaron and his sons&#151;all the priests, who were so close to Him&#151;to bless His people in the way of His divine trinity. Jehovah is the Triune God. As the Triune God, He dispenses Himself into us in His divinity and in His divine trinity. Without being triune, God could not dispense Himself into His chosen people as their blessing. The very blessing is God Himself dispensed into His chosen people. Although God desires to bless His chosen people in this way, they need to come up to a standard that matches His blessing.</P><P>The unique blessing in the whole universe is God Himself. Anything besides God is vanity. The entire universe was created by God, yet without God, apart from God, even the universe created by God is vanity. The existence of the universe is a great miracle, but without God the miraculous existence of the universe is vanity. Apart from God, everything is "vanity of vanities" (Eccl. 1:2). Only God Himself is real. Only He is the blessing to us. If we gained the entire universe yet missed God, we would be the most pitiful persons. History is filled with cases of people who gained many riches and many material things but who eventually realized that, without God, it was all vanity. God Himself is our blessing, and this blessing comes to us through the dispensing of the divine Being into us in His divine trinity&#151;in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</P>
