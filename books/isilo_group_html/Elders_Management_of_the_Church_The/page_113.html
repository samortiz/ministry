Strictly speaking, to manage is to coordinate, and to coordinate is to build. The elders' work of managing the church is to coordinate and build up the brothers and sisters. Where there is real management, there is real coordination, and where there is real coordination, there is real building. We have said much about the management of the church. The central goal for speaking about this matter is to speak about coordination. For this reason we stayed on the matter of coordination for a long time. Because of time, I spoke only sixteen points. Strictly speaking, there are many more lessons to give on coordination. Moreover, the sixteen points given must be explained by practical, real, and detailed examples. All the fine points and detailed considerations in our work occur in the matter of coordination.</P><P>For example, we have to help the brothers and sisters to solve their problems. This one item alone has much for us to learn. In our following the Lord and serving Him, we often encounter many problems. For example, there are problems with family, with jobs, with education, with marriage, with spiritual progress, with the study of the Bible, and with prayer. There are too many problems. How should we solve them all? If possible, we should spend much time to illustrate them point by point with examples. We can only mention them in brief now and will leave it up to the brothers to probe into them in detail. Strictly speaking, the one item of solving others' problems will alone require much practice for many sessions.</P><P>For example, a person listening to the gospel may have a girlfriend. Now this person is saved, but the girl has not yet believed. The question is brought before the elders. How are you going to solve this problem? The elders cannot merely say: "Brother, just pray!" Of course he has to pray. But you have to show him a way that fits his present condition and that does not contradict the biblical truth. It has to pose no hindrance to his future following of the Lord and not put him in difficulty with his family. This is not a very easy thing to do.</P><P>Take another example. Some young people may be graduating from high school. They are zealous in pursuing the Lord, and they come to you for fellowship. What kind of university should they attend? Should they study medicine, or should they study engineering, or some other subjects? Do not think that this is a light matter. Many times, their choice has much to do with their future growth in life and their usefulness in service. You cannot say something rashly and expect them to act rashly! You may be a little spiritual and say: "Go and pray! The Lord will lead you." This will not work. You have to touch their real condition, bring them to the Lord, and solve the problem before the Lord.</P><P>Some brothers had two wives before they were saved. Now they are saved. How should they solve this family problem? How will this affect such a one in his service to the Lord? What attitude should he take in the future? What kind of stand should he have? There are many questions such as these. If the elders cannot open a way for others in these matters, and cannot solve their problems, they are short in management. The brothers and sisters will suffer and will be like children without the care of their parents.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_112.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_114.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Elders' Management of the Church &nbsp; pg 113</div><br></body></html>
