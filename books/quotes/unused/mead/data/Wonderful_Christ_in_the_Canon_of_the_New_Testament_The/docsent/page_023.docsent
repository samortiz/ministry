   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INTO THE NAME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Matthew 28:19 the Lord tells us to baptize the nations into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Greek preposition translated in should be into.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, we should baptize them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To understand this, we must also read Galatians 3:27, For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By these two verses we can see that to be baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is equivalent to being baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Father is in the Son, and the Son by resurrection became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, today, if we touch the Spirit, we touch the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And when we have the Son, we have the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before Matthew 28:19, the Triune God was never revealed in such a clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is one name of three persons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This one name is the fully processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After His resurrection He was fully processed in order to be dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Spirit who comes into us is the Son with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is proved in Romans 8:9-10.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In these verses we see that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then there are many verses in the New Testament which tell us that the Father is in us, the Son is in us, and the Spirit is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all know that there are not three in us, but only one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are just one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the processed, Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to be processed, God firstly became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then, after living on this earth as a man, through death and resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is our living Christ today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is in the heavens, and He is also on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is omnipresent; we do have Him within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Him we have the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Him we also have our Redeemer, our Creator, and our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Him we have everything, because He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is our all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is our life, our light, our power, our strength, our holiness, our righteousness, our love, our kindness, and our peace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the divine attributes and human virtues are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is everything!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the processed Triune God who is the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we baptize people, we baptize them into this One.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Baptism should not be a formal ritual, but the real putting of people into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A MYSTICAL UNION WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To baptize people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit really has a deeper meaning than most have realized.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For years I had seen that this verse signifies the putting of people into the Triune God, but I did not have the confirmation of any other record.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, I hesitated to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then one day I obtained a set of books entitled, Word Studies of the New Testament, by M. R. Vincent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In one of these books, Mr. Vincent comments about baptizing into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit as recorded in Matthew 28:19.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He says, Into denotes union or communion with, as in Romans 6:3.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Baptizing into the name of the Holy Trinity implies a spiritual and mystical union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The name is the expression of the sum total of the divine being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is equivalent to His person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His name is of no avail detached from His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When one is baptized into the name of the Trinity, he professes to acknowledge and appropriate God in all that He is and all that He does for man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Isn t this wonderful?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now we can understand what it means to be baptized into the name of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is to be put into this mystical union with Him, and to appropriate whatever God is into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The purpose of this is to produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now we have seen a sketch of Christ in the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was the son of David and the Son of Abraham, born of a virgin with the names of Jesus and Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Eventually He passed through all the processes to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now we are to be baptized into Him, into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Having been baptized into Him, we can partake of all that He is, for He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To do this we must exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Blessed are the poor in spirit Matt 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have a willing spirit Matt 26:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our flesh is weak, but our spirit is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>So we must exercise our spirit and call Him Lord as David did Matt 22:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We can call Him Lord in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we do this, He becomes so practical to us in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is for the building up of the church.</S>
