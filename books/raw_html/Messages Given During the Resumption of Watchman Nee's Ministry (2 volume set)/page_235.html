<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Everything Done<br>in the Fellowship of the Church<br>and for the Benefit of the Gospel</H2><P>The brothers and sisters should know that their future, their jobs, occupations, dwellings, businesses, possessions, and everything that forms a part of their living should be put in the fellowship of the church. Formerly, one could make decisions on his own. Now, if he is to take the service of God as his center, everyone has to take one great step forward. From now on, no one can make his own decisions or do things his own way. Many enterprises and occupations do not render much help to the gospel. The responsible brothers will ask you to change these occupations. What we do must be of maximum benefit to the gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING MONEY</H2><P>Concerning money, we have the following fellowship. In the coming days, many brothers and sisters will have to leave their jobs. In Shanghai, we have asked two sisters and two brothers to do this. Brother Hsia Hsi-ling has been working in the customs department for many years. We are asking him to leave that job. In addition, perhaps twenty to thirty brothers and sisters will also have to hand themselves over. Perhaps we will need fifty or sixty brothers and sisters to do that. If they give up their jobs and offer up themselves full-time, their support will be on the shoulders of you brothers who are holding jobs. During the past twenty years, we have not mentioned the matter of money. This platform can testify for me concerning this. But today, we are going into business as partners and preaching the gospel as partners. For this reason, the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs should work conscientiously, and they should do their best to make money as well as to save money.</P><P>Today we stand on a different ground, and that is why we are not afraid to say something and do something. Today I can pass around my hat to ask money for a brother. If some have misunderstood what we have said and are no longer willing to offer up everything, you can claim back your consecration slip from Brother Witness after the meeting. There is no need to be shy and no need to be ashamed. We do not force anyone to do anything. But when the brothers come together to discuss matters, and when a decision has been reached, you cannot draw back. Today, we are not asking you to save money to such an extent that you will suffer in your physical health. We are not asking for one-tenth, or one-half, or one-hundredth. We are asking you to offer up all you have besides what you need to spend. If you make ten million dollars a month, and you need all ten million, you do not have to offer a cent. If you make only eight million, the church will gladly give up two million to make up enough to meet your need. But if you make eleven million, you can only keep the ten million that you need, and you have to offer up the remaining one million. If you make a hundred million, then the ninety million will all have to be offered up. If you do not do this, you owe these brothers who are giving up their jobs something. We have to learn to bear the responsibility of the gospel together with the brothers. Only by doing this will the gospel spread, and only then will we be able to go on in the way before us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FOUR THINGS CONCERNING THE WORK</H2><P>Concerning the future of the work, there are a few things that we have to pay attention to. In order for God's work in China to be carried out properly, four things are indispensable. The first is that strong messages need to be delivered in the local meetings. The second is that the literature work needs to spread. The third is the need to perfect the young people. The fourth is the need for joint conferences everywhere yearly. If any of these four things are lacking, our work will not be covered adequately. Shanghai and Foochow should maintain very strong message meetings. In this way, when a person wants to be perfected, he has to come to the church.</P>
