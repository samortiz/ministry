[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE SCRIPTURAL MEANING OF LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 John 5:12; Col 3:4; John 11:25; 14:6; 1:4; 3:16, 36; 10:10 THE SCRIPTURES BEING A BOOK OF LIFE
[3]  If we take something from the Scriptures as knowledge, we will have nothing but death, but if we take something as life, the result, the issue, to us is life.
[4]  In the Scriptures, the Holy Spirit is revealed as the Spirit of life, the living water of life, to us, but among so many books about the Holy Spirit it is hard to find one which conveys the revelation, even if expressed in different words, that this very Holy Spirit is Christ as life to us.
[5]  If we are going to know life, we must realize that God is life to us in Christ through the Spirit, and this Spirit as life to us is now dwelling and living in our spirit.
[6]  In the first chapter we saw clearly that life is the Triune God Himself.
[7]  Today we can locate the Holy Spirit not only within us but also, in a very definite way, in our spirit, because He witnesses with our spirit, and we are joined to the Lord in our spirit as one spirit.
[8]  THE EXPERIENCES OF LIFE BEING THE EXPERIENCES OF GOD
[9]  In this chapter we shall see something concerning the experiences of life.
[10]  Although Christians today speak concerning spiritual experiences, they very seldom say that we experience life or that we have experiences of life.
[11]  If we realize that life is the Triune God Himself, we must realize that the real experience of life is the experience of God.
[12]  THE EXPERIENCES OF LIFE BEING THE EXPERIENCES OF CHRIST Christ Revealed in Us
[13]  Because God is life to us in Christ His Son, the real experience of life is the experience of Christ.
[14]  The third step, or stage, in the experience of Christ is that Christ is formed within us Gal 4:19 .
[15]  The real experience of Christ as everything is that we sense only the presence of Christ and nothing else.
[16]  Other people can realize many good, heavenly, eternal, spiritual, and divine things with us, but we ourselves do not sense them.
[17]  We are not aware that we are patient or that we are loving others, but, praise the Lord, we are dealing with and seeing the Lord Christ Himself!
[18]  CHAPTER THREE THE FIRST EXPERIENCE OF LIFE Scripture Reading: John 3:3-7; 1:12-13; 2 Cor 5:17; 1 Cor 6:17
[19]  In this chapter we will see the first experience of life, the beginning of the experience of the divine life, which is regeneration.
[20]  We have a life which is created by God, which we received of our parents, but this created life is not the real life.
[21]  As we have seen, regeneration means to be born anew.
[22]  John 1:12-13 says, "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."
[23]  We are first born of man, of our father, to be a son of man, but we must be born anew of God to be a son of God.
[24]  To be born of water and of the Spirit simply means that we realize, on the one hand, that as humans we need to be put into the water to be buried, and on the other hand, that we need the Lord to regenerate us with the Spirit of life.
[25]  The process, the way, to be born of God is first to confess that we are sinful and good for nothing but to be buried.
[26]  Then, we will have the Lord as life in us; we will have the second life, the divine life, which is God Himself in Christ through the Holy Spirit.
[27]  It is to realize that we are sinful, that we are good for nothing but death, and that we need the second life, the divine life, the heavenly life, which is God Himself.
[28]  When we repent and recognize and realize that we are good for nothing but death and that we need the life of God, we simply come to Him, open ourselves with our heart and spirit, and receive Him as life and everything to us.
[29]  In order to know how to experience the life that we have received, we must realize that at the time we received the Lord as our Savior and were saved and regenerated, something happened to us related to ourselves and related to God.
[30]  In addition, before we were saved we did not have a living spirit, so we could not contact the Lord, but at the same time we received a longing heart to love the Lord, we also received a living spirit.
[31]  In addition, something related to the Lord Himself also took place in us.
[32]  Verse 6 goes on to say, "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace."
[33]  If we do not have life and peace, we have death, which proves that we are not in the spirit.
[34]  When we have Christ, we have life, and when we are in life and enjoying life, we have a certain sense.
[35]  If we are in life, this law regulates us to sense life and peace, and when we are not in this life, this law regulates us to sense that we are in death, weakness, and darkness without joy, comfort, satisfaction, and all the items on the positive side.
[36]  In the past four chapters we have dealt with some basic matters concerning the divine life, the inner life.
[37]  In this chapter we will consider two more basic items that we should know in order to help us to experience life.
[38]  We are the children of the human race because we have the human life, the children of the devil because we have the life of the devil, and the children of God because we have the life of God.
[39]  FOUR LAWS The Three Laws of the Three Lives
[40]  As we have seen, with any kind of life, there is always a law.
[41]  With the human life there is the law of the human life, with the devilish life there is the evil law of the devilish life, and with the divine life there is the divine law of the divine life.
[42]  Before we receive Christ as our Savior, we may not have a feeling of contradiction or conflict, but after we receive the Lord, we often have a contradicting and fighting within.
[43]  In addition to the three subjective laws of the three lives within us, we also have the objective law of God outside of us and above us, telling us what is right and wrong, what is good and evil, what we ought to do and what we ought not to do.
[44]  With this point of view, we may read Romans 7 and 8.
[45]  Verse 18 in chapter seven says, "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not."
[46]  Verses 22 and 23 say, "For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man, but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members."
[47]  Romans 8:2 says, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death."
[48]  Here we have another law, the law of the Spirit of life.
[49]  The Holy Spirit is dwelling in our spirit, so the law of the Spirit of life is in our spirit.
[50]  CHAPTER SIX THE LAW OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2; Heb 8:10; 10:16; Jer 31:33
[51]  In this chapter we need to be further enlightened concerning life and the details concerning the law of life.
[52]  We have the law of good, the law of sin, and the law of life, that is, the law of the Spirit of life.
[53]  Whenever we hear the law of God outside of us, the law of good in our human life, within our soul, corresponds to it and answers to what the law of God demands.
[54]  The law of the Spirit of life is not a small matter.
[55]  With every life there is a law, and all the riches, the contents, of each kind of life are included in the law of that life.
[56]  THE RICHES OF LIFE BEING BROUGHT FORTH BY THE REGULATING OF THE LAW OF LIFE
[57]  As we have seen, a law is the spontaneous, automatic, regulating power of a life, which constantly regulates in order to bring forth all the riches of that life.
[58]  We need to love the Lord in the way of stopping every kind of doing.
[59]  If we love the Lord with our heart yet try to do many things, we spoil the environment for the divine law to work something out.
[60]  The trouble is that when we do not love the Lord, we have nothing to do; we forget about everything.
[61]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:1-3, 5-7; 2:27
[62]  In the previous chapters we saw the sense of life the consciousness or inner feeling of life and the law of life.
[63]  The fellowship of life is life itself flowing, and this flowing life is God the Father and God the Son in God the Spirit the very Triune God Himself.
[64]  First John 1:5-7 says, "And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.
[65]  If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth; but if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin."
[66]  To be sure, when we have fellowship with God who is light, we are in the light, and while we are in the light, we have fellowship with one another.
[67]  Then, the more we are in the fellowship, the more light we see; the more light we see, the more we realize our sins, faults, and defilement; and the more we apply the blood of the Lord, the more cleansing we receive.
[68]  Following this, we are in the fellowship, we are in the light, we realize our defilement, we apply the Lord Jesus' blood, and we receive the cleansing.
[69]  However, when we are in the light and we sense our faults and defilement, but we do not confess and apply the blood, the flow within us is stopped.
[70]  While we are doing something, we should check to see if the inward current is still flowing within us.
[71]  In the previous chapters we saw what life is, what the real experience of life is, the first experience of life, the sense of life, the law of life, and the fellowship of life.
[72]  CONTACTING THREE WORLDS BY THE THREE PARTS OF OUR BEING
[73]  Because we humans are of three parts, we can contact three worlds, the physical world, the psychological world, and the spiritual world.
[74]  In our body we have a seeing sense, a hearing sense, a smelling sense, a tasting sense, and a touching sense.
[75]  There is a great difference between the soul and the spirit.
[76]  As we have seen, 1 Thessalonians 5:23, supported by Genesis 2:7, shows us that we are tripartite, of three parts spirit, soul, and body.
[77]  If we are in fellowship with the Lord, the Holy Spirit many times will show us that we have something which is good, about which there is nothing wrong, but it is not of the spirit but from the self, in the self, and out of the self.
[78]  Within our body we have two parts, the soul and the spirit.
[79]  The soul in itself does not desire anything spiritual, it cannot receive or understand the spiritual things, and it is very much contradictory to the spirit.
[80]  These verses say, "Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it." Verse 24 says, "Deny himself," and verse 25 says, "Loses his soul-life." The soul-life in verse 25 is the very self in verse 24.
[81]  We may say that our soul contradicts our human spirit, the inmost part of our whole being, where the Holy Spirit dwells, or for the sake of further understanding, we may say that it is our self that contradicts our spirit.
[82]  If we realize that these three parts the emotions, the mind and the will are the three parts of the self, the soul, then we will realize that to deny our self is simply to deny these three things.
[83]  CHAPTER NINE THE SPIRIT WITH THE FACULTIES OF THE SOUL Scripture Reading: Matt 16:24-26; Luke 9:23-25; Lev 11:43-44; 1 Cor 2:14; Rom 8:6; 1 Cor 2:11; 2 Cor 7:13b; Acts 19:21 THE SPIRIT AND THE SOUL
[84]  Thus far, we have seen that the spirit and the soul are two distinct parts of man's being 1 Thes 5:23; Heb 4:12; Luke 1:46-47 .
[85]  If you denied your natural thought, the spirit within you would rise up.
[86]  Because we are so much in the soul, in the mind, emotion, and will, our human spirit does not have the chance, the ground, to do anything.
[87]  We have to deny our soul, to lose our soul, because we regenerated persons have another part, an inmost part, which is the quickened, regenerated spirit with the Holy Spirit of God indwelling it.
[88]  First Corinthians 2:11 says, "For who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him?"
[89]  The Scriptures speak much concerning the flesh, perhaps even more than concerning the soul.
[90]  Galatians 2:16 says, "And knowing that a man is not justified out of works of law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we also have believed into Christ Jesus that we might be justified out of faith in Christ and not out of the works of law, because out of the works of law no flesh will be justified."
[91]  Galatians 5:24 says, "But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts," and Romans 6:6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ.
[92]  If we talk about the Savior in an objective way, we speak of Christ, but if we talk about the Savior in a subjective way, we speak of the Spirit.
[93]  CHAPTER ELEVEN DEALING WITH THE SELF 1 Scripture Reading: Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20; 5:24; Rom 6:11; Matt 16:24 SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE AND THE SELF The Problem of Spiritual Knowledge without Experience
[94]  All spiritual experiences begin with a certain amount of knowledge, but once we have the knowledge of spiritual experiences, it is easy to consider that we have the experiences themselves.
[95]  If we hear a person testify with spiritual knowledge, we may think that he has the experiences of the Christian life, the church life, and the Spirit.
[96]  At the time we received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, we recognized that we died with the Lord, and we sealed this realization by handing ourselves over to the cross, by putting ourselves on the cross.
[97]  CHAPTER TWELVE DEALING WITH THE SELF 2 Scripture Reading: Matt 16:21-26; Luke 9:25
[98]  We have seen what the flesh is, but it is more difficult to see what the self is.
[99]  In Matthew 16:24 the Lord says that we must deny our self and bear the cross.
[100]  OPINION BEING THE MANIFESTATION AND INCARNATION OF THE SELF
[101]  God clearly told man that he should not take the fruit of the tree of knowledge, but man made the decision to take it.
[102]  There are two problems with fallen man: sin in the body and the self in the soul.
[103]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN DEALING WITH THE CONSCIENCE Scripture Reading: Acts 23:1; 24:16; 1 Tim 1:5, 19; Heb 9:14; 10:22; 2 Cor 1:12; Rom 9:1
[104]  In the previous chapters we saw the dealing with the flesh and with the self.
[105]  In order to learn the way of life, that is, in order to grow in life, we need to also deal with our conscience.
[106]  Second Corinthians 1:12 says, "For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you."
[107]  Many times we have no problem with the flesh or the self, yet we still have a problem before God in our conscience because the conscience in our spirit always speaks something to us for God through the intuition of the spirit.
[108]  Please note, however, that our conscience is troubled not only due to the intuition from God in our spirit.
[109]  If there is anything wrong with us, our conscience will speak something for God.
[110]  If, for example, we do something wrong toward a brother, right away the conscience within us will speak for God to tell us we are wrong.
[111]  At the time when man was sinless, he was directly under the divine government, the government of God.
[112]  DEALING WITH THE CONSCIENCE BEING NECESSARY FOR THE GROWTH IN LIFE
[113]  In order to grow as Christians in the spiritual life, there is no other way to take.
[114]  If we do not deal with our conscience, we can never be persons living in the presence of the Lord.
[115]  In this chapter we will consider our dealing with the world.
[116]  Food, protection, and pleasure are necessary for human existence and living, but because humans have lost God, they now care for their own living, protection, and amusement.
[117]  If something that is necessary for our life even our wife, husband, children, or parents becomes more to us than God, it is the world.
[118]  In order to exist as humans, we need to have parents, marry, have children, eat, and drink, but at a certain point all these necessities may become something more than the Lord to us; then they become the world.
[119]  This is why the Lord told us to follow Him to the extent that we give up not only the surplus of the necessary things but also, at times, the necessary things themselves.
[120]  BEING CLOTHED WITH THE SPIRIT BY DEALING WITH THE CONSCIENCE AND WITH THE WORLD
[121]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN DEALING WITH THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Psa 51:10; 2 Tim 1:7; Gal 6:1; 1 Pet 3:4; Prov 16:19; Matt 5:3; 2 Cor 7:1 THE NECESSITY OF ALL THE DEALINGS
[122]  In the previous chapters we saw the dealings with the flesh, the self, the conscience, and the world.
[123]  Christians today speak much about spiritual gifts and power, but even though we love, follow, and serve the Lord with a sincere heart, we can only realize the spiritual gifts and spiritual power in a real way through all the above dealings.
[124]  If we do not know how to deal with the flesh, if we do not practice dealing with the self, if we neglect our conscience, or if we do not pay the price to deal with the worldly matters with us and in us, then no matter how seeking we are, we can never realize anything real in the spiritual realm.
[125]  If we neglect our conscience, we may gain much self-knowledge, but we cannot have even a little spiritual growth.
[126]  We may be in the flesh, speak in the flesh, act in the flesh, and even serve the Lord in the flesh, but we do not have the sense, the knowledge, that we are in the flesh because our conscience is not functioning well.
[127]  We have seen the difference between the spirit, the soul, and the body and that our human spirit is the innermost part of our entire being, through which, in which, and by which we contact God.
[128]  We need to deal with our flesh, our self, our conscience, and even the more with our spirit as our innermost part.
[129]  To learn how to deal with our spirit is very important because the spiritual ministry, the spiritual service, and even the spiritual flow of life depend upon our spirit.
[130]  THE SPIRIT BEING THE REALITY AND SINCERITY OF OUR BEING
[131]  The spirit is the innermost part of our whole being.
[132]  Someone may ask us how we feel about a brother, and we may reply that he is a good brother and that we have no problem with him.
[133]  If a person knows how to sense the human spirit, however, he will be able to realize that we actually have many problems with that brother.
[134]  If we have a spirit of hatred, even though we may say one hundred times that we love a brother, the spirit of hatred is still there.
[135]  On the other hand, if we do not have a proud spirit, if we have dealt with the spirit of pride, we can even say, "I am too proud," but others will sense that we are very humble.
[136]  If we have a self-intention, self-ambition, self-exaltation, self- interest, and an undealt with, impure motive for self, and if our desire has never been crucified, we may do many right and spiritual things, and we may seem to minister something of Christ, but we will minister in a wrong, impure spirit.
[137]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE ANOINTING Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:27
[138]  In the previous chapters we saw the dealing with certain negative things.
[139]  First John 2:27 says, "And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him."
[140]  ADDING THE ELEMENT AND ESSENCE OF THE TRIUNE GOD INTO US
[141]  The anointing is the working of the Triune God.
[142]  The more we have this anointing, the more we enjoy our portion of the Triune God.
[143]  The more we have the anointing of the Holy Spirit, the more the element of God is increased within us, and we become spiritually weighty; we become weighty with God.
[144]  There are three major items we must realize related to the anointing.
[145]  We may already know that we have been crucified with Christ, but we apply the cross only when we are in fellowship with the Lord and we sense the anointing.
[146]  OUR NEED OF CONSECRATION FOR ALL THE DEALINGS AND FOR CARING FOR THE INNER ANOINTING
[147]  To go along with the inner anointing is simply to follow the Lord, obey the Lord, submit to the Lord, and always keep ourselves in the presence of the Lord.
[148]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN TRANSFORMATION 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45; 1 Thes 5:23; Matt 27:45-46; Col 3:4; 1 John 5:11-12; Col 1:13; 2 Cor 3:18; 1 John 3:1-2; Rom 8:19
[149]  In this chapter we will present a brief outline of what we have seen so far concerning life.
[150]  THE INCARNATED, CRUCIFIED, AND RESURRECTED GOD-MAN BECOMING OUR LIFE
[151]  After we are regenerated, we need to be transformed from darkness into glory Figure 11 .
[152]  For this, we need to give a free way for the divine life to spread throughout our entire being.
[153]  At the time of our regeneration we receive a little of the divine life, but if we cooperate with God and give Him the way, the Holy Spirit will work within us to spread, to increase, the divine life within us.
[154]  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN TRANSFORMATION 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 10:5; Eph 1:18; 4:22-24; 1 Cor 2:16; 1 Pet 1:23; 2:2, 4-5; James 1:21; Matt 16:25
[155]  As we saw in the previous chapter, we experience three matters as part of a process.
[156]  Romans 12:2 says, "And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind."
[157]  First Peter 1:23 says, "Having been regenerated not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God."
