<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Revelation 13:6</H2><P>"And he opened his mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, which tabernacle in heaven."</P><P>The first thing the beast does is blaspheme against God. The name of God includes the person, nature, and authority of God. "His tabernacle" here is heaven.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Revelation 13:7</H2><P>"And permission was given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them; and authority was given to him over every tribe and people and tongue and nation."</P><P>"The saints" are the remnant of the Christians and the Jews who are faithful to God. By this time, the beast's sphere of influence reaches the whole world, but his kingdom is limited to Rome.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Revelation 13:8</H2><P>"And all those dwelling on the earth will worship him, every one whose name is not written in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world."</P><P>This proves that there will still be some Christians on earth at this time, because there will still be people whose names are written in the book of life of the Lamb. God's selection alone is able to preserve them from temptations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Revelation 13:9</H2><P>"If anyone has an ear, let him hear." </P><P>In chapters two and three, the churches still had a place. Hence, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." Here, however, although there is still the remnant of the Christians, the church no longer has a place, and God again returns to the Old Testament standing!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Revelation 13:10</H2><P>"If anyone is for captivity, into captivity he goes; if anyone kills with the sword, with the sword he is to be killed. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints." </P><P>Christians cannot war, as the Crusaders did, against their enemies; they can only endure (1:9). To lose endurance is actually to lose faith. To fight will result only in being killed or captured.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE BEAST COMING UP OUT OF THE EARTH<br>(REVELATION 13:11-18)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Revelation 13:11</H2><P>"And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon."</P><P>In the original text, this beast refers to a wild beast. He comes up out of the earth and must, therefore, be a resurrected one, since Hades is under the earth. At the same time, the "earth" indicates the Jewish kingdom because in the Bible the sea always indicates the Gentiles and the earth indicates the Jews.</P><P>This beast is the false prophet and is a man because: (1) he is called the false prophet three times in the Bible (Rev. 16:13; 19:20; 20:10); (2) the Lord says clearly in Matthew 24:24 that there will be false prophets; and (3) there are altogether three evil spiritsâ€”Satan, the beast (Antichrist), and "another beast" (the false prophet), all of whom are charged with commissions. Therefore, the beast is certainly not a system. Still, there are others who say (for instance, Mr. Gabelein) that the beast in Revelation 13:1 indicates the king of the north (mentioned in the book of Daniel) and that only in 13:11 does the beast actually refer to Antichrist. However, to say this is illogical because: (1) since Christ came out of the Jews, Antichrist should, of course, come out of the Gentiles; and (2) since chapter twelve concerns Satan, the beast in 13:1 must be Antichrist, and the beast in 13:11 must be the false prophet. This is actually a counterfeit of the Triune God.</P><P>"Two horns." This beast is merely a person; he does not represent a kingdom. The horns of the Lamb indicate the Spirit (5:6). Since these horns are like the horns of the Lamb, these two horns must indicate two spirits. "To give breath to the image of the beast" in 13:15 may be translated "to give spirit to the image of the beast." This is one spirit, and 16:13 tells of another spirit.</P><P>"He spoke like a dragon." This indicates that his speaking deceives people and is cruel and violent. The first beast sits upon the dragon's throne; this beast speaks the dragon's language.</P>
