        <h2 class="head2">Eating the Lord by Praying over His Words</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is our spiritual vitamins. He is the bread of the vegetable life and the bread of the animal life in order to be our supply. He supplies us through His words. When His words enter into us, they are spirit. When we speak forth His words into others, His words become spirit again. When I pray, &ldquo;Lord, You are the bread of life,&rdquo; I receive the word, and the Spirit, who is life, becomes my supply. When I release this supply of life, the Spirit enters into others as the word. Hence, the word and the Spirit are one.</p>
<p>The Scriptures are the Lord&rsquo;s words, and to receive His words is to eat Him. Therefore, we need to read the Scriptures daily and turn them into prayer. This is what we call pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s words. God is Spirit, and He is embodied in the Word. If we did not have the Bible, it would be very difficult for us to understand the Spirit, and consequently we would not be able to touch God. God is Spirit. But the Spirit is mysterious and abstract. We thank the Lord that the Spirit is in the Word, the Bible, which has a definite form. We can touch God in any verse of any chapter in the Bible. Genesis 1:1 says, &ldquo;In te beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; We should not only read this verse; we should also pray, &ldquo;God! In the beginning, oh, in the beginning God! You are the beginning. You are the beginning of everything, and You are the beginning in my living. Be my beginning today. You are my God, my beginning. You were in the beginning, and You are my beginning.&rdquo; By praying in this way, we will receive light and be supplied. Through pray-reading, the words in the Bible become the Spirit, and we are supplied with life.</p>
<p>Dr. Hu Shih was a famous philosopher in modern China who commended the Chinese Union Version of the Bible as a great accomplishment for the Chinese language. However, what he commended was the letter, because he remained unsaved. He knew the Bible in letter, not according to the Spirit. Once while I was preaching the gospel in the villages, I met a group of elderly sisters who had very limited education. They had learned only a few verses, including, &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son&rdquo; (John 3:16), and &ldquo;Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners&rdquo; (1 Tim. 1:15). When they prayed with these verses, the Spirit came forth, and I was supplied. Dr. Hu Shih had a doctorate degree, but if he were to talk about the Bible, the Spirit would not be conveyed. In contrast, when these illiterate elderly sisters prayed over the Bible, I was supplied. This is to experience the Lord&rsquo;s words being spirit and life.</p>
<p>I hope that instead of becoming doctors of philosophy, we would be people who pray-read the Bible. Then the words of the Bible will become spirit and life (John 6:63). The Bible, including both the Old Testament and the New Testament, contains the words spoken to us by the Lord. In Matthew 4:4 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&rdquo; This quotation from Deuteronomy 8:3 shows that the Lord acknowledged the Old Testament as the Word of God. This verse also indicates that we should not only read the Word; we should also pray-read the Word. By pray-reading the Word, it becomes our spiritual food.</p>
<p>Let me repeat, God&rsquo;s Word is not only for us to gain knowledge but also for us to receive as food. Do we gain knowledge, or do we receive food when we read the Bible? For nearly ten years after my salvation I read the Bible diligently. I would even lose my temper if my mother interrupted me to eat a meal. This Bible reading was not profitable, because it killed me and caused me to lose my temper. We should not take this way to receive the Bible. We need to study the Bible for life, not for knowledge.</p>
<p>As a result of such a background, I did not lead the saints in Taiwan merely to study the Bible. Instead, I led them to have the life-study of the Bible, and I later also used the term <em>pray-read.</em> When we read the Bible, we should not simply use our eyes to see or our mind to think. Rather, we should use our spirit to pray in order to receive what we read. Through prayer the words in the Bible convey the Spirit and thus supply us with life and become our spiritual constitution. As a result, we are people who are mingled with the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING GOD BEING THE PROPER WAY<br />
FOR BELIEVERS TO MEET AND SERVE</h2>
<p>The chorus of hymn #450 in the Chinese hymnal says, &ldquo;Spirit begets spirit, and spirit worships Spirit, / Thus I am filled with the Spirit; / The Spirit becomes the word with abundant life / Flowing forth rivers of living water.&rdquo; This chorus was written not according to someone&rsquo;s imagination; it is from our experience. The Spirit has regenerated us, so we can worship the Spirit of God with our human spirit. This is the way for our entire being to be filled with the Spirit. The Spirit is also the word to supply us with abundant life. Hence, rivers of living water can flow out of us to supply and water others.</p>
<p>This should be the condition of our meetings. Sometimes the weather is not good, but we still come to the meetings, because the purpose of our meetings is to eat the Lord, to drink Him, and to enjoy Him. We also meet to supply one another with the flow of living water. Stanza 4 of <em>Hymns,</em> #501 says, &ldquo;Thy Spirit touched, Thy word received, / Thy life in me is thus conceived.&rdquo; When we receive the word, we touch the Spirit in the word and are inwardly supplied. We should eat, drink, and enjoy the Lord not only in the meetings but also in our daily life so that He can become our supply. This is a practical way to experience the Triune God as life.</p>
<p>We must be people who enjoy God so that we can meet and serve properly. Suppose there is a prayer meeting tonight, but instead of enjoying the Lord the first thing in the morning, we are busy preparing for the day and rush off to work. If we are busy for eight hours without enjoying the Lord, by the time we return home after work, we will be too tired to attend the meeting. Even if we go, we will not have any energy, nor will we have the Spirit or the word. Our spirit will be &ldquo;deflated&rdquo; like a flat tire. Hence, we must force ourselves to utter a few words, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for gathering us together; what a grace!&rdquo; Some may say that this is better than nothing, but can such a meeting be considered a prayer meeting?</p>
<p>In changing the way that we meet, it is important that everyone functions; we should not have only one person speaking while the rest listen. To have one person speak means that one person is a pastor, and to have the rest listening means that they stop serving as priests and that their function is annulled. If we desire to function in the meeting, we must enjoy the Lord in our daily life. We cannot function without enjoying the Lord, just as it is difficult for us to function when our physical body is hungry, thirsty, and has no energy.</p>
<p>In order to cope with such a situation, people think that the best way is to have a gifted person give a wonderful message every Lord&rsquo;s Day. However, the more believers listen to such messages, the more deadened they become, and the less they function. This fills me with grief. The church in Taipei is the birthplace of my ministry. I witnessed the marriage of many saints there, and some of their sons have even become elders. However, the saints there cannot speak the truth with clarity. I blame myself for taking the wrong way of producing a group of co-workers who minister the word on the Lord&rsquo;s Day while the saints come merely to listen.</p>
<p>There is a brother who has served as a co-worker for over thirty years and has been sent to seven different localities. In every place he was responsible to give the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning message. Therefore, every Saturday night he had to search the ministry books and compose a message. This was a suffering to him. It was also a suffering for him to stand on the platform and give the message. But now he is released because we no longer meet in the way of one man speaking; instead, we can all function. In order to function in the meeting, we need to enjoy God as our life. This is the proper way for believers to meet and to serve.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
