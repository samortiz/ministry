   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The elders have to spend a great deal of time to stir up the brothers and sisters to have a heart to learn to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The elders must also learn to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you have never learned, how can you teach others?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In one locality, some of the Chinese-speaking sisters have been burdened to teach some of the other sisters to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They encourage the sisters to compose their daily inspirations into a prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The sisters then present their compositions for correction to the other sisters teaching them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes their compositions are too long, or the point of their prophecy is not very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One sister who is more than eighty-eight years of age has asked another sister who is a little over thirty years of age to correct her prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once her prophecy has been corrected, she comes to the meeting and anxiously waits for an opportunity to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She likes to be the first one to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether or not her prophesying is so good or so rich, I do not care.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What I care for the most is her spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If all the brothers and sisters in the different localities would have such a spirit, the meetings would be very high.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today, however, most of the saints do not have a strong sense of the need to prophesy in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They may come to the Lord's Day meeting for the Lord's table and the prophesying meeting, but they are very relaxed with little exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do you not believe that such a situation is an offense to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If anyone comes to meet with the Lord in the meeting without exercising his or her spirit, this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The elders' responsibility is to stir up the saints by telling them that it is altogether an offense to the Lord to come to the meeting in a loose way without exercising their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have rarely seen a place where the elders promoted, adjusted, and improved the spirit, attitude, and preparation of the saints in coming to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to do this, the elders themselves must take the lead to be prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Their spirit must be high and ready.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then they will have the standing and the qualification to edify others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The elders should come to the meetings early.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The way they sit in the meeting, their gesture and attitude, should be right.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because we are meeting with the Lord, we should not be so loose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The elders must also bear the responsibility for the attendance in the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In some places, the attendance on the Lord's Day is one hundred, but the attendance of the prayer meeting is less than thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This percentage is typical throughout the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The elders must say something.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The elders must struggle and strive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No crop will grow without plowing, sowing, and watering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The farmer's duty is to labor diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The elders must labor diligently in the same way.</S>
