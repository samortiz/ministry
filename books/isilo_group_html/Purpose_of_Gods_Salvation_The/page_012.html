<p>We need to have an absolute and thorough consecration. In the Old Testament the children of Israel daily offered up burnt offerings in the morning and in the evening, and particular offerings were offered every Sabbath, at the beginning of every month, and for every feast (Num. 28&mdash;29). The children of Israel also had to offer up burnt offerings on major events (Lev. 8:18, 28; 1 Kings 3:4, 15; 8:62-64). Offering the burnt offering typifies our need to consecrate ourselves on every occasion, for everything, at all times, and in every place. Young people who are taking college entrance exams and young adults who will be getting married and starting a family must both have proper consecrations. We should also consecrate ourselves for spiritual activities, such as preaching the gospel or visiting the saints. Renewing our consecration daily is an important and great lesson. Practices such as learning to abide in the Lord and having His presence through consecration were recovered by Mrs. Hannah Whitall Smith. We should not do anything that will cause us to leave the Lord&rsquo;s presence. If saying something will take us out of the Lord, we should not say it. We must learn to pay attention to the inner sense and practice abiding in the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>We need to experience death and resurrection in everything. We must experience the cross in all things. Even our love for the brothers needs to go through the cross. Our inclinations and desires must go through the cross. We must also learn to experience resurrection. Resurrection is the next step of the cross. Thirty years ago a brother told me that a stone buried in the earth would yield nothing, but a seed buried in the earth would bring forth fruit. This is resurrection. As Christians, we have Christ in us. If we would accept the cross, stop ourselves, and let ourselves die, the resurrection life of Christ within us will be lived out. Therefore, we must experience death and also resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BUILT TOGETHER WITH OTHERS</h2>
<p>We must ask ourselves whether we are individualistic or are joined to others and being built up together with others. As Christians, we must be on the proper ground, and we must practice being built up with others as the church in our locality. This is God&rsquo;s eternal intention and the goal of His eternal salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: What does it mean to experience death by accepting the cross?</em></p>
<p>Answer: A dead person has no feelings; he cannot even feel death. If we can feel death, we are not yet dead. If we still have feelings, we are not yet dead. In Foochow there was a married woman who had such a disagreeable contention with her husband&rsquo;s family that she threatened to drown herself in the sea. She ran to the sea, and her family followed, but when she reached the sea, she held on to her skirt so that it would not get wet. When the family saw this, they knew that she would not drown herself, because she was unwilling to let her skirt get wet. Many Christians say that they accept the cross, but they have too many feelings. They are like the woman who held on to her skirt. A person with so many feelings is not dead. When we truly experience death, we do not feel anything.</p>
<p><em>Question: How can we always renew our consecration?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We should consecrate ourselves in great matters and in small matters. For example, a sister who wants to visit a friend should consecrate herself before leaving her home. She may say, &ldquo;Lord, I belong to You; I am not my own. I am going to visit a friend, so I hand myself over to You so that You can make every decision.&rdquo; Once she consecrates herself, she may sense that the Lord does not want her to go. The Lord may ask whether this visit is according to her will or according to His will. Then the sister should ask the Lord to forgive her because the visit was according to her will. She may also say that she no longer intends to go. If the Lord then leads her to go, she should be exercised not to say anything presumptuously. She should follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading in whatever she says and does. We need such an absolute consecration in what we say and do.</p>
<p>The younger saints sometimes ask me whether they may still watch movies now that they are Christians. I do not debate with them, nor do I say anything related to going or not going. Instead, I advise them to consecrate themselves whenever they want to watch a movie. They can say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I belong to You; I am not my own. I am now going to watch a movie, so I consecrate myself fully to You.&rdquo; Then they will know whether they should watch the movie. They often say that after such a consecration, they are not able to watch a movie. Whether or not they watch movies should not be the result of human exhortation but of their consecration. Our consecration can make things clear for us. When we place ourselves on the altar, our eyes will be opened, and there will be no more reasoning. This is my experience; many things become clear to me when I pray and consecrate myself.</p>
<p><em>Question: How do we know whether something is of the Lord or is acceptable to Him?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We should never analyze spiritual matters with our mind. I still do not know whether my right foot or my left foot is the first to move when I walk. If I always paid attention to whether I use my left foot first or my right foot first, I still would not know how to walk. Instead of analyzing, we should just walk. We need to believe that the Lord accepts our consecration, regardless of who is consecrating himself or of what is being consecrated. Even if a brother would feign a consecration, the Lord never pretends; He will make a feigned consecration real. In the Old Testament no one could take an offering back once it was on the altar (Lev. 27:9-10). After something has been placed on the altar, it cannot be taken back. This proves that the Lord remembers our consecration forever and that no one can annul his consecration.</p>
<p><em>Question: How can I know whether I have growth in life?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We need to have faith regarding matters of life. Matters of life have their law. Once I planted a seed but did not see anything grow after two days. I was so worried there might be a problem with the seed that I dug up the soil to see whether the seed was still there. There was no problem with the seed, yet nothing grew after several more days. Later, an experienced person told me to leave the seed alone, because it has its law of life and will grow when it is time. Likewise, it is sufficient to love the Lord, draw near to Him in prayer daily, consecrate ourselves, wait on the Lord and abide in Him, and give heed to the sense of peace within. We do not need to analyze our situation or worry. We should be at peace and let the law of life take care of the matters of life. The life seed will grow, and we will be strong. There is no need to check whether we have grown. When we analyze, we interfere with the law of life.</p>
<p>Being a Christian is very difficult and also very easy. My youngest daughter is often concerned about how many centimeters she has grown. She should not worry, even though she seems to be the same height every day. The Lord said, &ldquo;A man cast seed on the earth, and sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and lengthens&mdash;how, he does not know. The earth bears fruit by itself&rdquo; (Mark 4:26-28). Hence, we do not need to be anxious concerning whether we are growing. We simply need to eat and sleep properly, and life will grow.</p>
<p><em>Question: What should we do when we do not want to eat, drink, or enjoy the Lord?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There are two solutions. First, we should force ourselves to eat and drink the Lord. We must eat and drink the Lord even when we do not want to. If we would force ourselves to eat and drink the Lord, after a while our negative feelings will disappear. Second, if we are unable to eat and drink the Lord for a long period of time, we need to see a spiritual physician. The Lord is our spiritual Physician, and the church is also. When we come to the church, the Lord will speak to us through the saints concerning our sickness. By praying for us, the saints &ldquo;prescribe medication&rdquo; and also strengthen and supply us. Therefore, there is no reason for a Christian to be weak for a long period of time. He must always eat and drink the Lord normally.</p>
<p><em>Question: What should we do if we do not understand our environment?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Christians encounter two kinds of environments. The first kind of environment is an obstacle raised up by Satan when we obey and carry out God&rsquo;s commandment. We must overcome such environments by faith, but we must not use our flesh to deal with Satan. The second kind of environment is a trial from God. We should not expect to overcome the environment that God gives us but should rather accept the environment and learn the lesson in that environment. Because it is difficult for believers to discern whether an environment is an attack from Satan or a trial permitted by God, we need to pray more and also pray together with our fellow members. We may ask the Lord to resolve the environment if it is an attack from Satan and to strengthen us if the environment is a trial from the Lord. The lesson that the Lord wants us to learn is different in each environment. If through prayer we are certain that an environment is of Satan, we should pray until the environment is resolved.</p>
<p><em>Question: How do we discern what is of God and what is an obstacle from Satan?</em></p>
<p>Answer: When we encounter a situation that we do not understand, we should first wait and not do anything. We should never have an attitude of resignation, of accepting everything. We should do our best to avoid problems. We should avoid what is avoidable and commit the unavoidable into the Lord&rsquo;s hand. For example, if a brother sees that a car is about to hit him, he should not stand still and say, &ldquo;I do not know whether this is an attack from Satan or a trial from the Lord.&rdquo; Of course, he should try to avoid being hit by the car. Some things, however, are unavoidable, no matter how much we try to avoid them. In such situations we should willingly submit and accept them. It is wrong to willingly accept avoidable problems, but we should accept with thanksgiving and learn lessons from things that are from the Lord.</p>
<p><em>Question: Does the Lord reveal His will to us in one instant, or do we wait for Him to gradually reveal it to us?</em></p>
<p>Answer: It is not easy to be clear concerning the Lord&rsquo;s will, because there are many intricacies that are involved. In principle, the Lord does not let us know everything about a matter; He often reveals things to us bit by bit. In this way, we will always look to the Lord, draw near to Him, and depend on Him. When God called Abraham, He said, &ldquo;Go...to the land that I will show you&rdquo; (Gen. 12:1). However, Abraham did not know where he was to go. God did not tell Abraham the destination. If God had told Abraham, he would not have needed to depend on Jehovah God. Abraham needed to follow God step by step; he took one step one day and another step the next day. Abraham could not afford to lose God, because God was his Guide. God did not give Abraham a map, so Abraham could not forsake God.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Lord wants us to understand His will, but we are distracted by the mixture within us. Miss M. E. Barber knew the Lord. She said, &ldquo;If you have not forsaken yourself completely, you are only ten percent into your hundred-mile journey of pursuing to know the Lord, but if you have forsaken yourself, you have already finished ninety-nine miles.&rdquo; This means that the greatest problem in knowing the Lord&rsquo;s will is the self.</p>
<p>There is a story of a captain who steered his ship toward the foot of a mountain, even though he navigated with a map and compass. He could not explain why the ship was steered to the foot of the mountain. Some experts later discovered that the mountain was so rich in magnetite that it affected the compass. This is a very good illustration. The self is so rich in &ldquo;magnetite&rdquo; that it can influence a Christian to read the Bible according to his concept and to deliberate concerning God&rsquo;s will according to his own thoughts. Such Christians are like a ship with a failed compass. If we want to know God&rsquo;s will, we should be pure, trust in the Lord, and follow Him closely step by step; we must not expect to know His will in one instant.</p>
<p>On our journey of following the Lord we must forsake our self when we sense that it is entangled in a certain matter. However, we should not overanalyze. If we fellowship with the Lord and accept the cross, we do not need to analyze.</p>
<p><em>Question: I still have a strong feeling concerning my consecration to the Lord, but I lack a clear calling from the Lord. Should I still drop everything and hand everything over for His use?</em></p>
<p>Answer: To consecrate oneself to the Lord for His use does not mean that one must drop everything and become a preacher. We consecrate ourselves to let the Lord live in us and pass through us. Such a consecration requires that we hand ourselves over fully. Consecration depends on us, but what we do after our consecration does not depend on us. The problem of many believers is that either they do not consecrate themselves, or they consecrate themselves and then instruct the Lord concerning how to use them. The Lord wants us to consecrate ourselves, but He does not want us to direct Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Purpose of God's Salvation &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
