   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE GOD'S JUDGMENT UPON THE NATIONS Scripture Reading: Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>25:2-3, 7-8, 12-17; 26:2, 4, 19-20; 28:21-22, 24, 26; 29:3, 6-7, 16; 30:6, 10; 31:16, 18</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's judgment upon the nations is covered in Ezekiel 25 through 32.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to Genesis 11, rebellious mankind sought to build the tower and city of Babel in order to concentrate themselves and make a name for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord then came down to exercise His judgment over the rebellious people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Babel, under the Lord's judgment, became a center of scattering, not a center of gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The human race was scattered from Babel as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Deuteronomy 32:8 tells us that God set up the boundaries of all the nations according to the number of the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that in God's economy on earth among the human race, Israel is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Israel is the center of the population upon earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By looking at a map, we can see that Palestine, the good land where God put Israel, is in fact a real center on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Palestine is situated at the very center of the three main continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These three continents are the old continents where the human population began.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Later, the human population spread to America and also to Australia.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the geography of the inhabited earth, the land of Israel is right at the center.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This provided a good opportunity for the spreading of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to history, the preaching of the gospel began in Jerusalem, spread to Europe and to Egypt, and then to Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Afterwards, it spread to America and Australia.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, it was God's purpose to put His people at the very center of the human population.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, according to the prophecies concerning the coming age, the millennium, the people of Israel will be priests on the earth teaching all the nations to worship God Isa 61:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even this prophecy shows us that the center of the earth is Palestine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the time of Ezekiel, however, the people of Israel had become degraded and unsuitable for God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They forced God to exercise His judgment upon them and to temporarily give up Palestine as His center.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God turned to Babel again and raised up King Nebuchadnezzar who built the empire of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Babylonian empire became God's center for executing His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through Babylon under King Nebuchadnezzar, God executed His judgment not only over His people Israel, but also over all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE SEVEN NATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to Ezekiel 25 through 32, seven nations were surrounding the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, there were more nations surrounding the nation of Israel, but the record only mentions seven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is according to the principle also followed in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Spirit spoke of the churches in Asia, He selected only seven churches Rev 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This did not mean there were only seven churches in Asia, but that the Lord selected seven representative churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ezekiel did the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It does not mean there were only seven nations surrounding Israel, but that the Lord selected seven nations as representative of all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What were these seven nations?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They were Ammon, Moab, Edom, Philistia, Tyrus, Zidon, and Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Divided into Three Groups</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first four nations, Ammon, Moab, Edom, and Philistia form one group, and Tyrus and Zidon form a second group.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Egypt stands alone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We know that the nations are divided into these three groups because Ezekiel saw three separate visions at three different times concerning these groups.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His first vision covered the first four nations.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His second vision covered the judgment over Tyrus and Zidon.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then the third vision covered God's judgment over Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, the first two, Ammon and Moab, fit together as a pair.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The third and fourth, Edom and Philistia, stand as a pair, and Tyrus and Zidon also are a pair.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only Egypt stands alone.</S>
