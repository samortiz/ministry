[2]  OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE ONE PURSUING CHRIST FOR SATISFACTION Scripture Reading: S.S. 1:2-4a
[3]  This series of messages covers the living of a Christ-seeker as depicted in Song of Songs.
[4]  1 Attracted by Christ s love, charmed by His name, and captivated by His person to pursue Him and be led into the church life.
[5]  Song of Songs is a book in the Bible that tells us how we can be satisfied properly with God.
[6]  There is no other way except by pursuing after Christ, because Christ is the very embodiment of the Triune God.
[7]  THE NEED FOR A PERSONAL AND AFFECTIONATE RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRIST
[8]  Dear saints, in this message I want to impress you with something particular.
[9]  After you have received Christ as your life, you must have a very personal seeking after Christ.
[10]  Hymns, #437 stanzas 1 and 6 with the chorus says:
[11]  The inner chambers of Christ are His lovers regenerated spirits mingled with and indwelt by Him as the life-dispensing Spirit Rom 8:16; 2 Tim 4:22; Rom 8:11 and are the practical Holy of Holies in Christ s lovers for their participation in and enjoyment of the pneumatic Christ as the consummated Triune God Heb 4:16 .
[12]  Song of Songs 1:4b-8 shows the fellowship in the mingled spirit of Christ s lovers 2 Cor 13:14; Rom 8:4b .
[13]  This fellowship is in the joy of Christ s lover with her companions, in their extolling His unrivaled love S.S. 1:4c . She and her companions extol the Lord s love, but this seeker stands out.
[14]  She was black because of the scorching sun: Do not look at me, because I am black, / Because the sun has scorched me v. 6a . In her fellowship with the Lord, she was enlightened to see that she was a sinner in Adam black but that she has been justified in Christ lovely . She stands out among her companions as one who is pleasant to God and man.
[15]  We also need to see that in the whole universe there are two kinds of worlds.
[16]  After we were saved, our concern was merely for our satisfaction, but Christ s concern is God s satisfaction, to have His eternal economy accomplished by having us as the members of the church, the essence of which is the organic Body of Christ, which ultimately consummates in the New Jerusalem.
[17]  OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE THREE TRANSFORMED AND PERFECTED IN THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: S.S. 1:9-11, 15; 2:1-2 THE NEED FOR TRANSFORMATION
[18]  Metabolism needs some element, and this element is God Himself through Christ in three steps: in Christ s death, in Christ s resurrection, and in Christ s ascension.
[19]  The perfected ones coordinate with the transforming Spirit to perfect the lover of Christ by adding God s divine nature plaits of gold into her.
[20]  OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE FOUR SATISFIED WITH CHRIST MUTUALLY
[21]  Now we need to see how the Christ-seeker goes on to experience being satisfied with Christ mutually in the churches.
[22]  At the beginning she was seeking her personal satisfaction, but then she was taught to seek satisfaction mutually with Christ.
[23]  The lover gained Christ as a bundle of myrrh S.S. 1:13a , signifying Christ s sweet death for her, and as a cluster of henna flowers, signifying Christ in His resurrection in the churches built upon the fountain of His redemption v. 14 . If we are going to gain Christ, we must gain Him in His death.
[24]  As Her Husband in the Divine Life as the Couch,
[25]  and in Christ in His Death as the Rafters
[26]  We gain and enjoy Christ as our Husband in the divine life as the couch, in Christ in His resurrection as the beams, and in Christ in His death as the rafters for our shelter.
[27]  Again we see Christ s death, Christ s resurrection, and Christ s Spirit.
[28]  The lover s gain and enjoyment of Christ, and Christ s gain and enjoyment of His lover result in the mutual satisfaction and rest of Christ and His lover in the churches.
[29]  OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE FIVE DELIVERED FROM THE SELF
[30]  This causes her to fall into introspection, which becomes the seclusion as a wall that keeps her away from the presence of Christ 2:9 .
[31]  Christ wants His seeker to remain in the cross, that is, to stay in the clefts of the rock and in the covert of the precipice S.S. 2:14a . Christ wants us to remain in the cross continually.
[32]  OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE SIX EMPOWERED AND ENCOURAGED
[33]  We have the light of the truth and even speak the deep things of God s economy, but we do not have the support of the adequate experiences of Christ.
[34]  According to the revelation of God s complete gospel, Isaiah 53:4-5 makes it very clear that in His redeeming death on the cross, Christ has borne all our griefs and carried our sorrows; furthermore, by His chastening we receive peace and by His stripes we are healed.
[35]  Another A. B. Simpson hymn on our being crucified with Christ says, Tis not hard to die with Christ / When His risen life we know Hymns, #481 . To remain in Christ s death we need the power of His resurrection.
[36]  The cross is precious to the uttermost because the cross terminated all the enemies of God.
[37]  In order to empower and encourage His lover to rise up and get away from her down situation in her introspection of the self, Christ empowers her by showing her the power of His resurrection by the gazelle s leaping upon the mountains and the young hart s skipping upon the hills 2:8-9 .
[38]  It is by this power of Christ s resurrection that we, the lovers of Christ, determine to take the cross by denying our self Matt 16:24 .
[39]  It is also by this power of Christ s resurrection that we, the lovers of Christ, are enabled to be conformed to His death Phil 3:10 , to be one with His cross as staying in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the precipice S.S. 2:14 .
[40]  Thus, these three things the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ are the means for us to enjoy Christ, experience Christ, and gain Christ in our spirit.
[41]  OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE SEVEN MOVING WITH GOD AND UNITED WITH CHRIST Scripture Reading: S.S. 3:6-11 BECOMING WORTHY OF GOD S ECONOMY
[42]  By passing through the adequate process of transformation, the lover of Christ is worthy to be involved in God s economy, to move with God.
[43]  After the lover of Christ has experienced the breaking of her self, her natural man, by the cross of Christ and after she has seen the flourishing riches of Christ s resurrection by which she was empowered and encouraged, she became a spiritual, steady person signified by the unshakable pillar of smoke, the same as God was to the children of Israel in their exodus from Egypt to the wilderness.
[44]  OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE EIGHT LIVING IN ASCENSION Scripture Reading: S.S. 4:6-9
[45]  In the previous message, we saw that we need to be those who are moving with God and united with Christ.
[46]  A pursuer and follower of Christ should be one who moves with God on earth.
[47]  After the lover of Christ has experienced Christ in His sweet death and His fragrant resurrection, she determines to stay in the sweet death of Christ the mountain of myrrh and His fragrant resurrection the hill of frankincense until her Beloved comes back when the day dawns and the shadows flee away S.S. 4:6 . If we have Christ, we have His sweet death because He and His death are one.
[48]  At this juncture her Beloved calls her to live in His ascension, as He had called her to remain in His cross.
[49]  OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE NINE BECOMING A GARDEN TO CHRIST Scripture Reading: S.S. 4:12 5:1; 6:2-3 THE DIVINE-HUMAN ROMANCE God Becoming a Man
[50]  In God s romance He desires to be one with man.
[51]  This God-man is the Bridegroom in the divine, universal romance John 3:29 , but His counterpart, being merely human, still does not match Him.
[52]  Through her living in Christ s ascension as the new creation in resurrection for her growth in life and transformation by life, Christ s transformed bride becomes four things: a garden to satisfy Christ 4:12 5:1; 6:2-3 , God s dwelling place with its protection 6:4a , the heavenly bodies as the universal light v. 10a , and a terrible army which is the corporate overcomer the Shulammite vv.
[53]  The lover of Christ expects the cold north wind to awake and the hot south wind to come blowing upon her garden that her spices may flow forth v. 16a . The wind from the north is cold and harsh, but this causes the apple trees to give forth the best fragrance.
[54]  He is eating His own things, and He invites His beloved friends, the Triune God, to eat and drink deeply with Him v. 1c . The Bridegroom, Christ, the Son in the Divine Trinity, invites His beloved friends, God the Father and God the Spirit, to enjoy His garden.
[55]  OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE TEN BECOMING THE SANCTUARY OF GOD Scripture Reading: S.S. 6:4a THE CONSUMMATION
[56]  Through her living in Christ s ascension as the new creation in resurrection, the lover of Christ becomes mature in the riches of the life of Christ so that she becomes not only a garden to Christ but also the sanctuary of God, signified by Tirzah, and its safeguard, signified by Jerusalem.
[57]  To become a garden to Christ is to be flourishing in the element of Christ s life with its unsearchable riches; to become the sanctuary of God is to be built up related to the building of the Body of Christ in the growth with the life of Christ with its unsearchable riches Eph 4:15-16 .
[58]  The Sanctuary Being Divided into Two Sections by the Veil, Signifying Our Flesh
[59]  The sanctuary of God is divided by the veil into two sections: the outer Holy Place and the inner Holy of Holies.
[60]  In God s economy, such a marvelous thing the sanctuary of God has a negative thing our flesh.
[61]  With Christ, the veil in the sanctuary of God was split Matt 27:51 , but with the believers it still remains for the purpose of God s dealing with them.
[62]  The apostle Paul became mature in the life of Christ, living in the ascension of Christ, yet God still let him have a thorn in his flesh through a messenger of Satan to keep him from being exceedingly lifted up 2 Cor 12:7 .
[63]  In God s economy, God firstly regenerates us in our spirit with His resurrection life 1 Pet 1:3 and secondly renews us, transforms us, and conforms us in our soul through His resurrection life to the image of His firstborn Son, Christ as the first God-man Titus 3:5; Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 8:29 .
[64]  OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE ELEVEN BECOMING THE HEAVENLY BODIES Scripture Reading: S.S. 6:10a
[65]  After the lover of Christ pursued Him for satisfaction and attained it in the first section, the Lord called her to be delivered from her self by experiencing His cross; then He called her further to live in His ascension as the new creation of God in resurrection; and ultimately the Lord called her to live within the veil in the Holy of Holies, in God Himself, to enjoy the consummated God embodied in Christ.
[66]  The lover of Christ becoming the moon and the sun indicates that she has become not only wholly spiritual but also absolutely heavenly and signifies that she has become an overcomer.
[67]  In Song of Songs the lover of Christ eventually becomes a pillar of smoke 3:6 ; that is a figure showing that she is altogether spiritual.
[68]  Then the lover of Christ overcomes the self which secluded her from the presence of Christ by becoming one with the cross of Christ in the second stage of this book.
[69]  OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE TWELVE BECOMING A TERRIBLE ARMY
[70]  At this point the lover of Christ has reached the stage of living not only in Christ s ascension but also within the veil.
[71]  After seeing such a high vision in Song of Songs, we may ask, Who can be such persons?
[72]  Shulammite is the feminine form of Solomon, indicating that now the overcomers have become the same as Christ.
[73]  All the overcomers must be one with God and must be Christ.
[74]  To say that we are the same as God in His Godhead is a great blasphemy, but if we say that we cannot be the same as God in life, nature, expression, and function, this is unbelief.
