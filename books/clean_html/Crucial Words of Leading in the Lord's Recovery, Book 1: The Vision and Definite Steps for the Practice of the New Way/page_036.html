<h2 class="head2">Preparing Life Messages</h2>
<p>The elders also need to study how to make the small groups attractive to people. The most important thing is to spend much time in prayer and study. We can then arrange message after message from the ministry publications to lead the small groups in pursuing the truth, fellowshipping, and reading in a living way. Even though the characteristic of the small group is &ldquo;dragging,&rdquo; you should have a life message to supply people. If the saints are not fully fed, they should at least be half fed; do not let them go home with an empty stomach. Do not wait until the last minute to prepare such a message. Because some people are lazy in preparing dinner, they merely open a can of food or buy a loaf of bread. But we cannot do this in the small groups. We must plan everything ahead of time. The small group meets only once a week. We should be well prepared. There is not a lack of rich messages among us. Hence, whether a small group has a life supply depends on whether or not the serving ones are enlivened and prepared. Today we have the meeting place, the meeting ones, and the truth. The question is whether or not we are willing to labor. Promoting merely by words does not work. Only when we carry it out earnestly will there be a result.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Way of Propagation</h2>
<p>In order to propagate the small groups, we need to subdivide the groups. Once there are twelve people meeting in a small group, we must prepare to be subdivided into two groups. Some may think that it has taken them awhile to reach this number and that once they divide, their group will be finished. For this reason, they are not willing to be divided. At the beginning a group may seem weak after dividing, but gradually the group will be enlivened. After a group of twelve is subdivided into two groups of about five to six people, gradually, each group will increase to twelve. We need to remember that the small group is for the Lord&rsquo;s increase and not merely for our own enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>The practice of the new way requires our coordination in one accord. Having the same goal, we can study the definite steps to practice. If we merely talk or sit on the fence without any progress, we will waste our time. We will not gain anything, the church will not gain anything, and the Lord will not gain anything. Our goal is to gospelize Taiwan in five years. One and a half years have already passed, and the remaining three and a half years will pass by quickly. I hope that we all can see this goal clearly and share this burden.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FURTHER WORD ON TEACHING <em>TRUTH LESSONS</em></h2>
<p>In the previous chapter I pointed out that the key to teaching <em>Truth Lessons</em> is not to preach. Now I repeat: we should not try to expound <em>Truth Lessons;</em> we should simply teach them. Take mathematics as an example. The principle of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can only be taught, not explained. One plus one is two; one plus two is three. This can only be taught but not explained. The content of <em>Truth Lessons</em> is very solid, and some lessons may require two sessions. Some lessons may be very difficult. If we try to expound these lessons, we may not be able to finish them in several years. Hence, do not explain. Simply teach the saints to read livingly, to read with repetition, to read with emphasis, and to pray-read. We may not understand what we read at the beginning, but later we will understand. This can be compared to the ancient Chinese teachers teaching the <em>Three-character Classic.</em> At the beginning, the students recited the book, and no explanation was given to them. Later, they gradually received an understanding. In order to enter into the truths of the Bible, we first must recite them. As our growth in life reaches a certain degree, we will spontaneously understand the meaning. Therefore, the purpose of <em>Truth Lessons</em> is to show the saints that there are certain truths in the Bible that we should know. As we reach a certain degree in our growth in life, we will spontaneously receive understanding.</p>
<p>For example, in Taiwan we have intercollegiate entrance examinations. The content of the examination is not what the teachers have explained but what is written in the teaching materials. A good teacher must be able to teach and convey everything that is in the teaching materials to the students. In this way, the students will know how to answer the test questions. I hope that the whole church can teach <em>Truth Lessons</em> and impart the truths into the saints. Perhaps we also need an examination with rewards in order to encourage the saints to study diligently. In this way, even if a &ldquo;famous professor&rdquo; has his own way of teaching, we still must teach based on the teaching material. This way is worth practicing.</p>
