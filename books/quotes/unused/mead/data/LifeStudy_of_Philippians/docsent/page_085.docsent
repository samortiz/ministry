   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DAY AND NIGHT IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Christian life we experience both night and day.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to Genesis 1, night comes before day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Paul was abased, he was in the night, and when he was abounding, he was in the day.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Just as day follows night, night in turn will follow day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that after the night of abasement came the day of abounding.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul realized, however, that this day would eventually be followed by another night.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot change the principle of God s universe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the universe there is night and day, day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Christian life does not stay on one level; it has many ups and downs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is normal to be up and down, down and up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not normal to remain on one level and not experience ups or downs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, it is not normal to experience day and not night.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whose spiritual day is two hundred hours long?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I do not have such days.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have nights as well as days, downs as well as ups.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, our account should be balanced: the ups should equal the downs, and the debit should equal the credit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we have such a balance in our experience, we are normal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the Lord s sovereign arrangement, we need both the ups and downs in order to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I thank the Lord for all the valleys through which He has taken me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But with the valleys, there have also been hills.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Christian life is not one vast plain; it is a land with many hills and valleys.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is by the hills and valleys that we experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Young people, do not dream that your life will be level and plain.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the contrary, you will face many valleys and many hills.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You will encounter all kinds of circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But in these circumstances you may apply Christ as your secret and experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is crucial that we learn to apply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>IN EVERYTHING AND IN ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Earlier we pointed out that in verse 12 Paul uses the puzzling expression in everything and in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What is the difference between everything and all things ?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We experience one thing at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot experience all things at once.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, according to our experience in time, it is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But after a long period of experiences has gone by, the everything becomes all things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to recall that the book of Philippians was written according to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In time we experience one thing after another.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This fact is denoted by the word everything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But after a prolonged period of experience, the everything becomes all things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The words in everything refer to a particular time when we experience a certain thing of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The words all things refer to a broad range of experiences over a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul could say that both on a particular occasion and on all occasions, both at a certain time and throughout the course of his life, he had learned the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul experienced Christ moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the one hand, he experienced Christ in particular things at particular times.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the other hand, he experienced Christ in all things and at all times.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What a blessing it is to receive such a word concerning the experience of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I hope that the young people especially will realize how blessed they are and will pray, Lord, even in my youth I desire to seek You, pursue You, and experience You in the way presented in the book of Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As far as the normal experience and enjoyment of Christ are concerned, I want to be today s Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I do not seek to be a great apostle, evangelist, or a worker for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But I do desire to be a normal Christian experiencing You and enjoying You in everything day by day, even in all things, for my whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>May we all aspire to enjoy Christ to such an extent.</S>
