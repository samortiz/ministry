<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 13:44-46</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The basic thought in Matthew 13 and 1 Corinthians 3 is the basic thought of the entire Bible&mdash; life and building:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In both chapters we have God&rsquo;s farm and God&rsquo;s building&mdash;Matt. 13:3, 24, 37-38a, 44-46; 1 Cor. 3:9b-12.</li>
	<li>The parables in Matthew 13 reveal the matters of life and building:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first four parables are related to God&rsquo;s farm for growing Christ into the kingdom&mdash;vv. 1-33.</li>
		<li>The fifth and sixth parables are related to transformation for producing precious material for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;vv. 44-46.</li>
		<li>In today&rsquo;s Christendom the Lord can find a great deal of wheat and a small amount of meal, but He cannot find much of the pearl and the treasure.</li>
		<li>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery it is not adequate simply to be wheat or meal; we must also be the pearl and the precious stones.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord Jesus is continually seeking two things&mdash; the kingdom as the treasure and the church as the pearl&mdash;vv. 44-46:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If we would apply the parables of the treasure and the pearl in a practical way, we need to see that during the period of the existence of Christendom, the Lord is working to gain the treasure and the pearl.</li>
	<li>In order to understand the treasure and the pearl in 13:44-46, we need to consider the kingdom and the church in 16:18-19; the treasure is the kingdom, and the pearl is the church.</li>
	<li>On the cross the Lord Jesus sacrificed everything to buy both the pearl and the field in which the treasure was hidden; this reveals how much He desires the kingdom and the church&mdash;13:44-46.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The treasure hidden in the field signifies the kingdom hidden in the God-created earth&mdash;v. 44:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The treasure signifies the kingdom with the true Israel, God&rsquo;s peculiar treasure&mdash;Exo. 19:5; Psa. 135:4.</li>
	<li>The treasure hidden in the field must consist of gold or precious stones, the materials for the building of the church and the New Jerusalem&mdash;1 Cor. 3:12; Rev. 21:18-20.</li>
	<li>Christ went to the cross and sacrificed all that He had to redeem the God-created earth because within the earth there was the kingdom, the treasure&mdash;Matt. 13:44:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the Bible the earth signifies the world created by God, and the sea signifies the world corrupted by Satan&mdash;Gen. 1:26-28; Isa 57:20:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God&rsquo;s kingdom cannot be established in the sea, and God&rsquo;s will cannot be done in the Satan-corrupted world.</li>
			<li>God&rsquo;s will must be done on the God-created earth, and God&rsquo;s kingdom must be established on the Christ-redeemed earth&mdash;Matt. 6:10.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In order to have the kingdom on earth, the Lord had to redeem the earth because it had been polluted by Satan&rsquo;s fall and man&rsquo;s sin.</li>
		<li>The kingdom is realized in the church life, but its manifestation is related to the redeemed nation of Israel&mdash;Rom. 14:17; Acts 1:3, 6; 3:21; Matt. 19:28.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Because the pearl comes out of the sea, which signifies the world corrupted by Satan (Rev. 17:15), it must refer to the church, which is constituted mainly of regenerated believers from the Gentile world and which is of great value&mdash;Matt. 13:45-46:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The merchant in verse 45 is Christ, who was seeking the church for His kingdom; after finding it in 16:18 and 18:17, He went to the cross and sold all that He had and bought it for the kingdom&mdash;Acts 20:28.</li>
	<li>Ephesians 5:27 says that Christ will present to Himself a glorious church without spot, wrinkle, or any such thing; this is the church as the beautiful pearl produced out of the Gentile world.</li>
	<li>The parable of the pearl in Matthew 13:45-46 reveals that the Lord&rsquo;s desire is to have this pearl of great value&mdash;the church as the consummation of His complete salvation&mdash;Rom. 5:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The desire of Christ in accomplishing His judicial redemption and carrying out His organic salvation is that He would gain not merely individuals but the church, which is His Body&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 5:23.</li>
		<li>The Lord desires to gain this pearl of great value by His ministry in three stages&mdash;incarnation, inclusion, and intensification:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>First, Christ worked to gain His desire by the judicial redemption accomplished by Him in His incarnation&mdash;John 1:14, 29.</li>
			<li>Christ carries out His organic salvation by Himself as the life-giving Spirit in His stage of inclusion&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
			<li>The intensified work of Christ&rsquo;s organic salvation is carried out by Him as the sevenfold intensified Spirit in His stage of intensification&mdash;Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The parables in Matthew 13 reveal that the Lord Jesus came as the Sower to sow the seed and that eventually He gained the pearl:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The seed is Christ, and the pearl is the church; the pearl comes out of the seed.</li>
		<li>The Sower Himself is the seed, and the multiplication of the seed is the multiplication of the Sower; hence, the kingdom is the multiplication of Christ as the seed sown into us.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The parables of the treasure and the pearl refer to the overcomers throughout the centuries&mdash;Rev. 2:7b, 11b, 17b, 26; 3:5, 12, 21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the first four parables the Lord covers Christendom in a general way, and in the next two parables He covers the overcomers in a particular way.</li>
	<li>In the eyes of God, the overcomers are more solid, precious, and valuable than the wheat; He likens them to the treasure hidden in the field and to the pearl out of the sea.</li>
	</ol></li>
