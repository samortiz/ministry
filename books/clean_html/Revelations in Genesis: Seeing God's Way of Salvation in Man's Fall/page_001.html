<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1>
<p>For three months, beginning from October 1954, Brother Witness Lee conducted a life training in which one of the classes considered the line of life in the whole Bible. The messages in the first part have been published in the book <em>Revelations in Genesis: Seeing God&rsquo;s Desire and Purpose in Creation.</em> This book is a collection of edited records from the second part of that study of Genesis.</p>
