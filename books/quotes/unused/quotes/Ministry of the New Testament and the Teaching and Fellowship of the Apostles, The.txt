Grant us an open fellowship a fellowship that is so free so refreshing in the spirit a fellowship that overcomes all kinds of frustrations
Those who are carrying on the present turmoil have misunderstood, wrongly applied, and evilly interpreted this term
Two other crucial terms among us that have also been damaged are the teaching of the apostles and the fellowship of the apostles
From the beginning of the Lord's recovery with Brother Nee there have been turmoils in the recovery caused by the evil one, Satan
We do have a constitutional book the Bible in our hand with a number of good verses concerning the matter of the ministry
We need to come to the Word concerning the matter of the ministry and touch this matter carefully and with a thorough consideration
In these chapters Paul touches the matter of the ministry based upon God's covenants, the new covenant and the old covenant
Whatever we may do to carry out our own preference or desires is not a ministry of God but is merely a human work
At the time when the Lord Jesus established His table, He enacted the new covenant with the blood that He would shed for us
In the Old Testament time God covenanted with His people a number of times , but the main covenant was the law
We all need to be clear that the ministry of the New Testament, which is the ministry of the new covenant, is uniquely one universally
In 2 Corinthians 3 the ministry of the old covenant is referred to as 'the ministry of death' and 'the ministry of condemnation'
The new covenant and the new ministry based on the new covenant is a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness, that is, of justification
The unique ministry of the New Testament comprises all the works of all the apostles, the ministers of the new covenant
In 2 Corinthians 3 the plural ministers is used clearly in verse 6, and the singular ministry is used in verses 8 and 9
In the first verse of chapter four Paul said, 'Therefore having this ministry as we have been shown mercy, we do not lose heart'
After the twelve apostles, many ministers, including Paul, Barnabas, and many others, entered into the ministry
No doubt this refers to the unique ministry of the New Testament to carry out God's eternal purpose, which is contained in the new covenant
In Ephesians 4:12 the phrase unto the building up of the Body of Christ appears in apposition to unto the work of the ministry
The ministry of the New Testament is uniquely one, but there are many ministers who have a part in this one ministry
Every part of the work must be done according to the one blueprint and under the leadership of the one master builder
God's new covenant is a great matter concerning the lives of millions of people, yet it is accomplished by only one ministry
Although every believer has a part of the ministry, their parts are not separate ministries but are only parts of the one ministry
The ministry is only for the accomplishment of God's economy, which is to build up the church as the Body of Christ
In the turmoil among us the intention of the dissenting ones is to condemn me therefore they say that the ministry is Witness Lees ministry
Peter, Martin Luther, and Brother Nee also had a part, and today my ministry also is a part of the new covenant ministry
Because Peter practiced hypocrisy in relation to the truth of the gospel, Paul had to rebuke Peter to his face
Certain ones came down to Antioch from Jerusalem to trouble the believers, saying that they had to be circumcised in order to be saved
Through that fellowship the problem was settled; however, the settlement was not thorough but was somewhat a compromise
Paul did not agree with this, and there was a sharp contention between them, so that Barnabas and Paul separated from each other
He expected that Apollos would join him to solve the problem in Corinth, because Apollos had gone to Corinth to help the believers there
At one time Paul and Alexander must have been intimate with one another; otherwise, Alexander could not have been so evil toward Paul
Paul's situation was quite complicated, but today ours is more complicated because of all the rumors that are being spread in a subtle way
Along with this item, the matter of the apostles' fellowship was also misapplied and evilly interpreted by the dissenting ones
The teaching of the apostles also includes the teachings of the apostles in the Epistles, from Romans through Revelation
Revelation should be considered not merely as a book but actually as a long epistle, within which are seven epistles
The Lord meant that the disciples could not then enter into what He wanted to tell them, because they had not yet received the Spirit
After three days He resurrected, and in the evening of the third day He came back to the disciples in the form of the Spirit
Prior to that time Peter had often spoken quickly and foolishly , but immediately after the Lord's ascension, Peter's speaking changed
In Acts 1 2 Peter could expound the Psalms concerning Christ and concerning Judas , and his interpretation was wonderful
Before Christs resurrection Peter was merely Peter without the Spirit of reality but after Christs ascension Peter became another person
The first few Galatians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Romans were written considerably earlier than Peter's
According to John's word here, after the writing of Revelation no one can add anything to or subtract anything from the divine revelation
It is very logical to conclude that all the Epistles written by the apostles are also God's speaking in the person of the Son
We need to be careful because in the universe not only God speaks, but another one, Satan, who is competing with God, also speaks
The speaking of God in the Old Testament concerning the law is good, but we should not include this speaking in the New Testament
In the Old Testament Moses spoke very much concerning the law but in the Epistles of the New Testament the teaching of the law is prohibited
The Gnostics attempted to bring their philosophy into the church and mix it with the teachings of the New Testament
These three 'isms' Judaism, Gnosticism, and asceticism are very strongly excluded by the apostles in their writings
God's people were to consider His speaking in the Old Testament as the holy word, the divine speaking, and God's oracle
When some came from Jerusalem, from James, Peter shrank back and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision
From Peter's word in 2 Peter 3:16 we can learn one lesson, that is, that God's holy writing should not be twisted by anyone in any way
The Bible does need some expounding and some interpretation, but we must be careful when we expound the Word of God not to twist it
The fellowship of the apostles is, first, the fellowship of the divine life, between the apostles and the believers
Through regeneration we received the divine life and were transferred into the divine kingdom, the kingdom of God
Unless we are born anew and thereby receive the divine life, we cannot see the kingdom of God, because we do not have the capacity
Regardless of our race or nationality, as long as we are saved, when we come together there is spontaneously a fellowship among us
Our meeting together is very harmonious because we all have been brought into the divine life, and in the divine life we have fellowship
The fellowship of the apostles is also the fellowship of the divine life, between the believers among themselves in their spirit
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
These three love, grace, and fellowship are not three separate things; rather, they are three aspects of one thing
The fellowship of the Spirit carries with it the grace of Christ, and within the grace of Christ is the love of God
Ephesians 43 tells us to be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit and then verse 4 follows immediately to say One Body and one Spirit
According to the New Testament there are four kinds of exclusions from the unique fellowship of the Body of Christ
The removing here is not an excommunication but a form of quarantining, as is used to isolate those who are sick of a contagious disease
In Leviticus and Numbers God charged the Israelites to 'remove' a leper from their fellowship that this one might be healed
One group of antichrists did not believe that Christ was a human being, and the other group did not believe that Christ was a divine being
When this kind of person who has gone beyond the proper teaching of Christ and does not abide in it comes to us, we must reject him
The person who went beyond the teaching of Christ in the apostles' time is like today's modernists, who do not believe that Christ is God
Romans 16:17 charges us to turn away from those who make divisions and causes of stumbling contrary to the teaching of the apostles
Titus 3:10 tells us to refuse the factious man who causes divisions by forming parties in the church according to his own opinion
In Greek this expression denotes a person who holds an opinion or a different doctrine that tends toward division
In the New Testament we can find at least these four kinds of exclusions of Christians from the fellowship in the church, the Body of Christ
The dissenters taught people that the apostles' teaching includes only the portion of the New Testament up to the book of Acts
In order to clear up the mixture, we spent many years to find the proper way to classify the different items of the truth in the Bible
To avoid further damage by the present turmoil, we need to practice a strict quarantine over this contagious disease
To serve the Lord, to be one of the co-workers, the first requirement is faithfulness not only to the Lord but also to His recovery
