<h2 class="head1">THE NEWNESS IN NATURE OF THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>Since 1984 we have mentioned the practice of the new way, and about four and a half years have gone by. Everyone has said much about this new way, but I feel that there is the need for further revelation, vision, and light concerning this way. In other words, we still need to see the inward reality of this new way.</p>
<p>Every divine thing in the Bible has its outward appearance and its inward reality. In the same way, when we mention the new way, there is a distinction between its outward aspect and its inward aspect. It is easy for us to just see the outward manifestation of the new way. Whether in the East or in the West, the impression that I have received from most brothers and sisters when they have talked about the new way is that they refer mostly to some outward methods. For example, we used to preach the gospel in one kind of way, and now we have changed the method. According to the understanding of the brothers and sisters, this new method is the new way. Another example is that we used to meet in one kind of way, and now we have changed to meet in another kind of way. Even in our service, we used to have one kind of practice, and now we have changed to another. According to the understanding of the brothers and sisters, all these new methods are the new way. Actually, this kind of understanding is wrong. It is true that in the Old Testament as well as the New, there are definite ways to carry out all of God&rsquo;s commandments and instructions. However, within all the ways there is the inward nature.</p>
<p>For example, here we have a cup. When we see this cup, we realize right away that it is to contain liquid as its content. The way it is shaped tells the nature of the content. Another example is that of shopping in department stores. If you buy a rectangular item, the salesman will surely put it in a rectangular box. Hence, for everything the method must match the inward nature of the thing itself. According to the revelation of the New Testament and our experience of serving the Lord for so many years, we have seen clearly that there are four main points in our service to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR MAJOR STEPS IN PRACTICING THE NEW WAY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching the Gospel</h2>
<p>The first matter in the Christian service is the preaching of the gospel. This is like marriage and childbirth. After a young couple become married, the first thing that occurs is childbearing. After a child is born, the center of the family is shifted to the child. If a couple has no child, there is a big lack. Children are the focus of the family. This is true in the West as well as in the East. It is a natural law that God put into man. Praise the Lord that we are all saved today. In other words, we are all married. What ought to follow is childbearing. The spiritual childbearing is the preaching of the gospel. Paul said, &ldquo;For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:15). Paul preached the gospel and led many to salvation. These Corinthian believers then became the spiritual children begotten by Paul.</p>
<p>The Lord told us in John 15:5 that He is the vine and we are the branches. The usefulness of the vine does not lie in its blossoms; it is not for people to appreciate the flowers. Rather, it is for fruitbearing. If a vine does not bring forth fruit, its destiny is to be cut off (v. 2). The meaning of being cut off is not to go to hell, nor to go into perdition. Rather, it means that believers will lose their enjoyment in Christ. Originally you are a branch abiding in the vine. Everything that the vine is and has is your portion and enjoyment. But if you only enjoy and do not bear fruit, you will lose the rich enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<p>It is a terrible thing to be cut off from the vine. The Bible says that the consequence of being cut off is a kind of punishment and loss. To avoid the destiny of being cut off, we must bear fruit. For us who are serving the Lord, the primary thing is the preaching of the gospel. In the long run, the fruit-bearing must be done in an optimal way. There must not be too many or too few; it must not be done too quickly or too slowly.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The New Testament Priests of the Gospel &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
