<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>LIVING WITH THE DIVINE TRINITY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 15:5, 7-8, 16; 14:17; 1 John 3:24a; John 14:23, 21-22; Gal. 2:20b; Rom. 8:9-11, 2, 6</H1><P>We have seen that to live in the Divine Trinity is to dwell in Him as our home. To live in Him is to abide in Him, to remain in Him. The Lord said, "Abide in Me and I in you" (John 15:4). Thus, abiding in Him is a condition of His abiding in us. Whether or not He would abide in us depends upon our abiding in Him. To live in Christ, to abide in Christ, is the first part of our enjoyment of the Triune God. In this chapter we come to the second part of our enjoyment. This part of our enjoyment is conveyed by the Lord's word concerning His abiding in us. His abiding in us brings His presence to us, so we live with Him. To live in Him puts us into the position of the enjoyment of the Lord. To live with Him is the enjoyment itself. To live with the Divine Trinity is to enjoy the Divine Trinity. To live with a person is to enjoy that person. Thus, to live with the Triune God is our enjoyment of the Triune God.</P><P>According to my rough estimation, one-fourth of the New Testament is for our living in the Triune God, but three-fourths of the New Testament is for our living with the Triune God. To live with the Triune God covers nearly the entire New Testament revelation. The final revelation of the entire Bible, in Revelation 22, is the eternal part of our living with the Triune God. Revelation 22 reveals the throne of God and of the Lamb, out of which proceeds the river of water of life (v. 1). On the two sides of this river grows the tree of life, yielding its fruit each month to be the food of God's redeemed for eternity (v. 2). God's redeemed will be His slaves and His priests (v. 3). While they are serving God, they will see God's face, and the Triune God's name will be on their forehead (v. 4). This indicates that they are one with the Triune God. Bearing the name of the Triune God not only indicates that we belong to Him but also that we are one with Him.</P><P>In eternity we all will have the name of the Triune God on our forehead. We will drink the river of water of life, eat the tree of life, and enjoy God as our light of life. According to Revelation 22:5 we will not need the light of a lamp made by man or the light of the sun created by God. We will only need and only have God Himself as our illumination. We will enjoy Him as our light, and we will also enjoy reigning in and with Him as kings forever and ever. This is the last view, the last vision, of the entire Bible. This is the eternal part of our enjoying the Triune God. This revelation is under the section of living with the Triune God. Our living with the Triune God today will bring us into that enjoyment in eternity.</P><P>In eternity the fallen angels and the fallen human beings will live with Satan. Because they will be with Satan, they will partake of whatever Satan will suffer. They will suffer Satan's eternal judgment, the torment of the lake of fire. In the same principle, we will be with our Triune God, so we will enjoy whatever He is. To live with the Triune God is to enjoy Him. We need to see this last vision revealed in the entire Bible. We need to have a bird's-eye view of the entire revelation of the New Testament. This bird's-eye view is that one-fourth of the New Testament is concerning our living in the Triune God, whereas three-fourths is concerning our living with the Triune God.</P>
