This signifies the departure of God's presence. Normally, the lifting of the pillar of cloud in the day signaled the children of Israel to set forth on their journey. On this day, however, the lifting of the cloud from the tent of meeting was not a signal to begin the journey. Whenever there is reviling, God's presence is withheld, and the movement of His people stops. This is not a small thing. In man's eyes an argument with Moses only involved Moses; the issue seemed minor. In God's eyes, however, this was very critical. God withdrew His presence because of this argument. This shows the seriousness of the offense. Moreover, Miriam became leprous. She was the one who instigated the whole incident, and the instigator always comes first in everything. Being a leper was no better than being a Cushite. A Cushite, at the most, was dark in skin, but a leper was unclean and had to be kept away for seven days from the camp of God's people.</p><p>This matter was resolved by Moses' intercession for his sister's healing. God told Moses, "If her father had done no more than spit in her face, should she not be disgraced for seven days? Let her be shut up outside the camp for seven days, and after that she may be brought in again" (12:14). Spitting was a sign of shame to the Jews. Here we are told that if her father had spit in her face, she would have been shut out of the camp for seven days. This meant that she had to bear her shame for seven days. After the seven days, the cloud was lifted, and the Israelites were allowed to move on. God removed one shame with another kind of shame. The sin of reviling was absolved. According to the Bible, transgression against authority is a very serious thing. If we are wrong in our attitude towards God's servant, we stumble, and there is no way for us to go on. We must be very careful and exercised in dealing with God's servants. We cannot speak lightly against them. Today many people revile and deal capriciously with God's servants and those who are ahead of them without realizing the seriousness of the matter. May God open our eyes to see the seriousness of authority.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REBELLION OF KORAH'S COMPANY</h2><p>The above examples first show sons rebelling against their father, then sons acting arbitrarily, and finally a brother and sister speaking against their own brother. All these things happen because of men's blindness; they do not see the spiritual relationship that exists in their midst. They do not realize that they are not dealing merely with family relationships. A few years after the incident with Miriam, another rebellion broke out. In Numbers 16 we find Moses and Aaron being attacked by Korah's company and by Dathan and Abiram. This time men outside Moses and Aaron's immediate family rose up against them. Korah's company of men were Levites; they were assigned to carry the ark, and they had nothing to do with the sacrifices. Dathan and Abiram were descendants of Reuben. Here we find the tribe of Levi and the tribe of Reuben. According to the flesh, Reuben was Jacob's oldest son. The tribe of Levi was chosen to take the lead in spiritual matters. The tribe of Reuben, however, was the leading tribe in physical matters. These two tribes were not happy that God spoke only through Moses and Aaron. They rose up, reviled, and attacked them. In addition to these men, there were two hundred fifty leaders among the people. These men were chosen by Moses to share the responsibility of ruling over the people of Israel. Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, together with the two hundred fifty leaders rose up and spoke against Moses, saying, "You have gone too far! For all the assembly is holy, every one of them, and Jehovah is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the congregation of Jehovah?" (v. 3). They all reviled and attacked Moses and Aaron fiercely and vehemently.</p><h2 class="head2">A Deputy Authority Being a Meek Person</h2><p>When Moses heard this, he fell on his face. He was a very meek person, more than all men who were on the face of the earth. Unless a man is meek, he will not fall on his face when others revile him. Those who fear God will fall on their face because they know that authority belongs to God. A deputy authority does not walk around in pomp and style. He does not sit in a high chair and demand obedience from others. Moses was not reviled while sitting on a high pedestal; he was a person who could fall on his face. He was indeed a meek person. This is the reason he had the authority. Unless a man first falls on his face, he cannot truly be lifted up.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> </body></html>
