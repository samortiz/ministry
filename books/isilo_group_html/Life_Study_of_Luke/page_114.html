In verses 7 through 9 He says, &ldquo;Now which of you, having a slave who is plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, Come immediately and recline at the table? But will he not rather say to him, Prepare something that I may dine, and gird yourself and serve me until I eat and drink; and after this you shall eat and drink? Does he thank the slave because he did the things which were directed?&rdquo; This indicates that the slave, after plowing or tending sheep, should not expect to be highly praised for his work. It is still necessary for him to go to the kitchen, prepare food for his master, and serve him so that he may be satisfied. After all this, the slave should realize that he is unprofitable. Therefore, the Lord concludes, &ldquo;So also you, when you do all the things which you are directed, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done&rdquo; (v. 10). I appreciate the point the Lord makes in 17:7-10, for it strengthens us in our service.</p><h2 class="head2">The Seriousness of Offending Others</h2><p>In the church life, the church service, and the Lord&rsquo;s ministry it is a very serious thing to offend others. Sometimes it seems that we can accomplish a great deal. Nevertheless, we may tear down more than we build up. This is the result of stumbling others.</p><p>When I was young I was given the following admonition: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do the Lord&rsquo;s work in such a way that you build up one foot and then tear down a foot and a half.&rdquo; According to this admonition, it is possible for us first to build up and then to tear down more than what we have built up. This is what some who are serving the Lord are doing. On the one hand, they have done much for the Lord; on the other hand, simultaneously they have torn down a great deal, even more than they have built up. We need to learn from this not to stumble others and thereby tear down what has been built up. We always need to be careful and cautious not to hurt others, not to offend others, and not to stumble others.</p><h2 class="head2">Ready and Willing to Forgive</h2><p>If we are offended by someone, we need to be ready and willing to forgive that one. Then we shall not have problems with others. However, on the one hand, some servants of the Lord stumble others, and, on the other hand, are easily offended by others. Therefore, they are always having problems with people. Either they stumble others, or they are offended by others. We should try not to stumble others, but always be ready and willing to forgive anyone who may offend us.</p><p>Do you know what it means to forgive? To forgive means not to be offended. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word in 17:4, even if a brother sins against us seven times a day, we should always be ready to forgive him. As soon as we forgive someone, we shall not be offended by him. But if we do not forgive, we shall be offended. The point here is that forgiving annuls offending. If we do not forgive others, we shall be offended by them. But if we forgive them, we shall annul the offense.</p><p>Suppose a certain brother offends you, and you forgive him. Your forgiving of him will annul his offending of you. Then there will be no problem between you. However, suppose this brother offends you, and you are not willing to forgive him and forget the offense. This will cause trouble, especially to you, for you will become entangled as the result of being offended. Hence, we should avoid stumbling others, and we should also avoid being offended by others. We should always be careful and cautious not to offend others. At the same time, we should always be willing to forgive others.</p><h2 class="head2">Exercising Faith and Realizing<br />That We Are Not Useful</h2><p>In addition to being careful not to offend and being ready to forgive, we need to exercise faith in God under all kinds of circumstances. We need to believe that whatever happens to us is of God and that He is sovereign and is taking care of us.</p><p>As we exercise our faith in God, we need to do everything we can for Him. Yet we need to realize that we are not useful, that we are not profitable. Thus, we need to humble ourselves before the Lord with the attitude that we are not profitable servants. If we do these things, we shall be preserved in usefulness under the hand of the Lord.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_113.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_115.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Luke &nbsp; pg 114</div><br></body></html>
