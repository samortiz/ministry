The Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>The Spirit is also the life-giving Spirit (2 Cor. 3:6b). We should not forget that today the life-giving Spirit is a compound Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Indwelling Spirit</H2><P>As the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit is also the indwelling Spirit (Rom. 8:11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Sevenfold Spirit</H2><P>In Revelation 1:4b, 4:5b, and 5:6b, the Spirit is revealed as the sevenfold Spirit. In these verses the one Spirit of God is called "the seven Spirits." However, here we do not have seven separate Spirits; rather, we have one Spirit who is sevenfold&#151;one sevenfold Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Spirit as the Consummated Spirit<br>to Be the Consummation<br>of the Processed Triune God</H2><P>Eventually, the Spirit in all of the above aspects is simply the Spirit as the consummated Spirit to be the consummation of the processed Triune God (John 7:39; Rev. 22:17). In this Spirit we have God, Christ, man, Christ's death, Christ's resurrection, the power of Christ's death, and the fragrance of Christ's resurrection. In all of today's Christianity, it would be difficult to find one person who has any knowledge of these things. This is the recovery of the divine revelation concerning the Spirit.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>A Brief Presentation of the Lord's Recovery &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
