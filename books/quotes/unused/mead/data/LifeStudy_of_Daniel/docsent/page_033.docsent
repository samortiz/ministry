   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ACCUSATION OF THE OPPOSERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The chief ministers and the satraps assembled and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God Dan 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then they came near and spoke to the king concerning his edict, saying, "Daniel, one of the captives from Judah, has not respected you, O king, or the edict that you have signed, but three times daily makes his petition" v. 13 . When the king heard this, he was very displeased with himself, and he set his heart on delivering Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Until the sun set, he made efforts to deliver him v. 14 . However, the opposers prevailed upon the king v. 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>V. DANIEL'S SUFFERING OF THE PERSECUTION</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Knowing that the edict could not be changed, the king commanded, and the opposers threw Daniel into the lions' den v. 16a . The king responded and said to Daniel, "Your God, whom you serve continually, He will deliver you" v. 16b . A stone was brought and set over the mouth of the den, and with signet rings it was sealed by the king and his lords that nothing might be changed regarding Daniel v. 17 . Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No entertainment was brought before him, and his sleep fled from him v. 18 .</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verses 19 through 24 we see God's deliverance of Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The king arose at the first light and went in haste to the lions' den.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When he had come near the den, he shouted to Daniel with a sad voice, saying, "O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?" v. 20 . Daniel replied, "My God has sent His angel and has shut the lions' mouth, and they have not hurt me, inasmuch as before Him innocence was found in me; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm" v. 22 . Just as the Lord did not quench the fire for Daniel's three companions, He also did not slay the lions for Daniel's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, He shut the lions' mouth, making their teeth of no effect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The king was very pleased concerning Daniel, and he commanded that Daniel be taken out of the den.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, Daniel was removed from the den, and he was found completely unhurt, because he had trusted in his God v. 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After Daniel was taken out of the den, the king gave commandment concerning the opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who had accused Daniel were thrown into the lions' den with their children and wives.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They had not reached the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones v. 24 .</S>
