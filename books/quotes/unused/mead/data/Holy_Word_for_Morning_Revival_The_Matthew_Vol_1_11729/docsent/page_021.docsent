   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 3 DAY 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 5:6, 10, 12</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>10 Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>12 Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you read Matthew 5:3-12 carefully, you will see that righteousness here is not merely a matter of outward behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, it is the outflow of our inner being, the expression of what we are within.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sequence of these verses is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Firstly, we must be poor in spirit, and then we can mourn.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are not poor in our spirit, we do not have the capacity for the King to come in to establish His kingdom within our being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, we cannot realize how negative and pitiful the whole world is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this reason, the Lord Jesus did not speak first of mourning and then of being poor in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He put the matter of being poor in our spirit first.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you have been fully occupied within by the heavenly kingdom, you will mourn and be meek...toward every pitiful person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The New Testament tells us that we do not fight against flesh and blood, but against the devil, against the enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But toward all men, including the adversaries and opposers, we must be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we are being meek toward others, we must hunger and thirst for righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We ourselves must be right with everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not think that, if we are mournful and meek, we can afford to be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No, we must hunger and thirst for the highest righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although we must be strict with ourselves in righteousness, we must learn to be merciful to others and not to place demands on them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When others offend us, thereby exposing their shortage, we must be merciful toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All those who are self-righteous condemn others and never let them go.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To ourselves, we must be righteous and strict, serious and sober.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But toward others we must be merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This matter is not firstly a matter of outward behavior; it is firstly a matter of our inward attitude, of our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although righteousness and mercy are two opposite poles, they must meet in your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our being pure in heart comes after the showing of mercy to others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are strict with ourselves and merciful to others, we shall have a pure heart, a heart single toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You will also be a peaceful person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Peacemakers do not like to offend, hurt, or damage anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be a peacemaker does not mean to be political.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be political is falsehood and hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must be righteously square, not politically round.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Remember, the New Jerusalem is square.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The eighth blessing concerns the persecution for righteousness v. 10 . If we would have the kingdom of the heavens remain in us, we must stay in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But be prepared to confront persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The ninth blessing concerns being reproached for the sake of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The entire world, whether it is the political, religious, educational, commercial, or industrial world, is against Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, if you live by Christ, for Christ, and with Christ, you will surely be reproached and evil spoken of.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Each of the nine blessings has a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The reward of the first is the kingdom of the heavens; of the second, comfort; of the third, the earth; of the fourth, satisfaction; of the fifth, mercy; of the sixth, seeing God; of the seventh, being called the sons of God; of the eighth, the kingdom of the heavens; and of the ninth, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we have Christ, we have the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, the real blessing is Christ with His kingdom.</S>
