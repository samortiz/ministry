   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW VAST IS THE UNIVERSE?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I then said to the young man, "And here you are!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You have not even walked through the whole earth, and yet you consider yourself greater than the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let me ask you, do you know how vast the universe is?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Take light for example.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Light travels at 186,000 miles per second.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Try to calculate how far light travels in one minute, or one hour, or a day, or a year.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are some stars whose light takes three thousand years to reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Go and work out how far they are from us!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And you think you are so great!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I would therefore advise all atheists and young men alike to admit the incompetency of man not only morally, but intellectually and academically as well."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>CAN MAN EXTEND BEYOND THE BOUNDS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>OF TIME AND SPACE?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Another time when I was in Kaifeng, I met another one of those young, stout atheists.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I walked up to him and patted him on the shoulder, saying, "I saw God today!"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He stared at me in curiosity and demanded a further word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I replied, "You are God!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you know that there is no God, then you have to be God."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He asked for an explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I said, "Since you are convinced that there is no God, you must have traveled over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If God is not in Shanghai, He may still be in Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You must have been to both places.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If God is not in Nanking, He may be in Tientsin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You must also have been to Tientsin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But you cannot draw this conclusion simply by being in China; God may be in another country.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>So you must have been to every country on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If God is not in one place, He may be in another.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, you must have traveled throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One never knows if God is hiding at the North Pole or the South Pole, or in the woods or wilderness somewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So you must have combed through all those regions as well.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If God is not found on earth, He may be found on the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You therefore must have been to the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God may also be on other planets or in outer space.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that you have traveled through space and all the other galaxies as well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you can say that there is no God, it must mean that you have traveled throughout the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If this is the case, you must be God yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even though you know that God does not exist in Shanghai today, how about yesterday?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps God will come tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You say that you know there is no God today, but what about last year?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And how do you know that God will not come next year?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You say that there is no God this year, but what about a thousand years ago?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Very well, you must be an everlasting one who knows everything about the past and future.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You have to be a being beyond time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You must be in Tientsin and in another country at the same time; you must be omnipresent from the east to the west, from the North Pole to the South Pole.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Who else but you can be the very God?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you are not God, you can never be qualified to say that there is no God."</S>
