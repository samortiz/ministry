<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NUMBERS<br>RELATED TO THE COMPOUND OINTMENT</H2><P>Now we need to consider the numbers related to the ingredients of the compound ointment. According to typology, all the numbers in the Bible are meaningful.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Humanity and Divinity<br>Compounded in the Spirit of God</H2><P>There are four spices, and the number four in the Bible is the number of the creatures. The book of Ezekiel speaks of the four living creatures (1:5). Thus, the number four signifies humanity in God's creation. There were 500 shekels of myrrh, 250 shekels of cinnamon, 250 shekels of calamus, and 500 shekels of cassia in the compound ointment, giving a total of three units of 500 shekels each. The number three signifies the Triune God. From these numbers we can see that both humanity and divinity are compounded in the Spirit of God, the heavenly olive oil.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Second of the Divine Trinity<br>Split on the Cross</H2><P>Notice that the second unit of 500 shekels is split in half into two units of 250 shekels each. This signifies that the Second of the Divine Trinity was split through His death on the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Connection of Christ's Death and Resurrection</H2><P>The two units of 250 shekels each are not complete. One signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of the Lord's death; the other signifies the precious resurrection of Christ. This shows that the Lord's death is incomplete. His resurrection must follow His death and be added to His death. These two things are not separate but are connected together.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Complete, Perfect, Eternal, Divine Spirit</H2><P>All of these elements are put into one hin of olive oil. This entire hin of olive oil signifies the complete, perfect, eternal, divine Spirit. The Spirit of God is complete and eternally perfect in Himself, but He still needs more ingredients to be consummated as the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ.</P>
