<h2 class="head1">NOT CONSIDERING POSITION AND HONOR</h2>
<p>There should be no consideration for position and honor among us. Anyone who bears responsibility in human society is granted position and honor. However, position and honor in the church are not a glory but a shame. It is shameful for a brother or sister to seek position, honor, and fame; this is something that we condemn. Among us there are only labor and loss, not position and gain. Serving ones must not covet; they should only sacrifice. Our loss is our gain, and our lowliness is our position. We should only love, serve, and labor for the saints. We should sacrifice for them. We should not expect the saints to love, praise, exalt, honor, or repay us. This is the proper intention and attitude of the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones.</p>
<p>Every responsible one should reject thoughts of position and honor. We must be free from feelings for position and honor. I feel uneasy when the saints address a brother as Elder So-and-so. Such a title shows that the saints have a concept of position. Although the saints do not speak of a brother as Pastor So-and-so, they feel uneasy about addressing an elder merely as a brother. Consequently, they use <em>Elder</em> as if it were a title. This is a human concept related to position. According to the Bible, the eldership is a service related to maturity. The Bible does not indicate that the word <em>elder</em> is a title. Addressing a brother as Elder So-and-so proves that some saints still have a human concept of position. Such a concept should not be among us. It must be completely removed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PURSUING TRUTH AND LIFE</h2>
<p>The truth of the Bible is the foundation of the believers and the church, and the divine life is the content of the believers and the church. In order for a church to have a firm foundation and rich content, the saints must have an adequate knowledge of the truth and a sufficient experience of life. Only the truth of the Bible can make us firm and accurate, rather than excessive, and only life can make us rich and living, rather than dead or dull. When we have both truth and life, our service will be firm, rich, accurate, living, and full of light and spiritual reality.</p>
<p>Therefore, all the responsible saints should pursue to know the truth of the Bible and to grow in life. In order for our service to render spiritual help to the saints, we must know the truth and have experiences related to dealing with sin, being led by the Spirit, living by the Spirit, experiencing Christ, and praying to fellowship with God. We must also know the truth and have experiences related to taking the way of the cross, being broken, and dealing with the flesh and the self so that the Lord may reign in us and fill us. We must have specific and thorough experiences in these matters of life.</p>
<p>The elders and deacons should have such experiences, and they should pursue to know the truth of the Bible. They should have an overall understanding of the Bible and know the principles of the Bible and the mysteries of the truth. Without this, our leading of the saints will not be proper, and our decisions concerning church affairs will deviate from the truth. This means that we must be well-read in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH SERVICE SUPPLYING LIFE</h2>
<p>The purpose of the service of the church is to supply Christ as life to others. This cannot be achieved merely by taking care of the details of outward matters. Often, the matters that we take care of are without spiritual value, because we do not supply the life of Christ to others through them. If our service is normal, we will supply the divine life to others in all the affairs of the church that we touch. This point is very serious. Merely accomplishing a church service does not make the service successful. The services are not our goal; rather, the services are the means to supply the life of Christ to others. The elders and deacons must pay attention to this point and practice it.</p>
<p>For example, the saints who sell books in the bookroom should not have the air of department-store salesmen. They should supply something spiritual. The saints who serve in book sales should be polite and loving, and they should seize the opportunity to fellowship with those who buy books and to supply something spiritual to them. In this way they will not only sell books of letters but also supply the living Christ. A person who comes to buy a Bible can be supplied with the living Word, Christ.</p>
<p>Our business office should not be like a bureaucratic government office. The saints serving in the business office should not take care of things like common government officials. This is not valuable. Instead, those who serve should seize the opportunity to supply Christ to the brothers and sisters and to the unbelievers. Then our service will have spiritual value.</p>
<p>Sometimes the elders handle church affairs like bureaucratic officials, not like serving ones who supply life. The elders should seize every opportunity in their contact with the saints to supply life to them. Even when giving hospitality, the elders should have fellowship with the saints who are being received and should supply life to them. The responsibility of the church is not focused on matters or work but on supplying life. Every aspect of our service should be a means for people to gain the spiritual supply of Christ&rsquo;s life. Our service should be different from handling business matters in the world.</p>
<p>Every service in the church is for us to contact people, to give us an opportunity to transmit the life of Christ into others. Regrettably, we often miss these opportunities. For example, the baptismal service often does not render a spiritual atmosphere to the persons being baptized. Rather, the saints in this service exhibit an attitude that they are merely doing things. In addition, the ushering saints are often harsh and strong; they do not express the meekness of Christ so that people can smell the savor of Christ. The services in the church are not monumental, but they are opportunities for us to supply and minister Christ to others. If we want to supply and minister Christ to others, we must be filled with Christ and allow our outer man to be broken. Only in this way can we express Christ so that those whom we contact can touch the life of Christ and can receive the spiritual supply.</p>
