   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Old Testament, Levi was the tribe of the priests and Judah was the tribe of the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord s descending from the tribe of Judah caused a transfer in the priesthood and combined the priesthood together with the kingship in one tribe Zech 6:13 , as manifested in Melchisedec who was both the high priest and the king v. 1 .</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 28 indicates that the priesthood has also been transferred from men to the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the men who were priests in the Old Testament were fragile, subject to death, but the Son of God is eternal, living forever.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is the Only Begotten Son and the Firstborn Son of God as the very life that constitutes the priesthood of the new covenant.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A Transfer of Law Needed</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 12 says, For the priesthood being transferred, there is of necessity a transfer of law also.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With the priesthood of the old covenant, there was an old law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now, with the priesthood of the new covenant, there should be a new law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So a transfer of law is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>a. From the Law of Letters to the Law of Life</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This transfer of law is from the law of letters to the law of life, according to which Christ has been constituted a living and perpetual High Priest v. 16 . Christ has not been constituted High Priest according to the law of letters but according to the power of an indestructible life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The priesthood of Christ in the new covenant is not a matter of letters but of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ as our High Priest takes care of us now with His indestructible life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nevertheless, many Christians still want to go back to the law of letters on the other side of the river.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By the Lord s mercy, we have crossed the river from the other side, the side of letters, to this side, the side of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is in this indestructible, eternal life that we participate in and enjoy the priesthood of Christ today.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From the Weak and Unprofitable Commandment</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>to a Better Hope</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verses 18 and 19 say, For there is indeed a disannulling of the preceding commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness, for the law perfected nothing , and the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The commandment, or the regulations, of the law concerning the Levitical priesthood has been disannulled because of its weakness in letters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It was not a matter of life but a dead commandment in letters; so it was unprofitable.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Due to the weakness of man, the law perfected nothing Rom 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The transfer of law annuls the old law and brings in a better hope.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is this better hope?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is the priesthood in life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This hope mainly depends upon life, the indestructible life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because the priesthood that takes care of us is in such a life, we are full of hope.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When you feel weak and consider that feeling as a lie, it indicates that you are full of hope.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If your wife tells you that you are weak, you need to say, That is a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Dear wife, wait awhile.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I ll be a strong fighter just like Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am full of hope because of the priesthood of my Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you say this, it means that you are full of a better hope.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This better hope is the priesthood in life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As long as there is life, there is hope.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only a dead person has no hope.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As long as we are alive, there is a certain amount of hope.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The transfer of law annuls the dead letters and brings in the hope in life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Never be disappointed we have a better hope.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have a priesthood of the indestructible life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A number of times people have said to me, Brother Lee, we never see that you are troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Don t you have any trials or troubles in your Christian life?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I have at least as many troubles as anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The only difference is that I do not believe in my troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I believe in my hope.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is a better hope in me.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We all have such a hope because the law according to which the priesthood that takes care of us is constituted, has been transferred from the weak and unprofitable commandment to an indestructible life.</S>
