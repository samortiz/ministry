   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FATHER, THE SON,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE SPIRIT A MYSTERY OF MYSTERIES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Triune God the Father, Son, and Spirit is a mystery, in fact, a mystery of mysteries!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Small and finite as we are, we human beings cannot understand it thoroughly; even less can we define it in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many things relating to the matter of life are not within the comprehension of men; men can only have a general idea of them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For instance, though we have life in our physical body, no one can explain it thoroughly, for life is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, there is a spirit within us this is even more of a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is the life of man?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And what is the spirit of man?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No one can give a full explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are not able to comprehend such a comparatively small mystery as man, to say nothing of the Triune God the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are many other inexplicable things in the universe electricity is one example: in certain aspects, we with our limited mind can only understand that they are so, but we cannot perceive why they are so.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we cannot fully understand things such as electricity, how much less the Triune God!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND, BUT WE CAN ENJOY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although we cannot understand this mystery of the trinity of the Godhead, we can receive and enjoy this mysterious God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot understand, but we can enjoy!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In former days men had no knowledge of vitamins, though they greatly enjoyed their benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Triune God is not for us to understand, but to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All that He is for us to enjoy is revealed in the Scriptures; we can simply accept it according to scriptural revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although we cannot fully understand it, yet we may, according to all that is declared in the Scriptures, accept whatever is said.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For instance, John 1:1 says, "The Word was with God," and it also says, "The Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Based upon the statement "the Word was with God," the Word and God are two distinct entities.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the declaration "the Word was God," clearly indicates that the Word and God are one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Are they two then, or are they actually one?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We cannot clearly explain such a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But we can accept what is said in the Scriptures just as it is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, "The Lord is the Spirit," and it also says, "The Spirit of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"The Lord is the Spirit" tells us that the Lord and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, in the following verse the Lord is called "the Lord Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"The Spirit of the Lord" is "the Lord Spirit" in the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"The Lord Spirit" as a compound name is used to show that the two, the Lord and the Spirit, are one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the title, "the Spirit of the Lord," clearly indicates that the Lord and the Spirit are two.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We really cannot thoroughly understand this kind of statement.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But since the Scriptures have said it, we must accept it as such.</S>
