   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AN ADVOCATE WITH THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:1 John says, If anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John did not have the confidence that the believers would always be able to keep themselves from sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He knew that even though we may be alert concerning the sin that dwells in our flesh, we may still sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, he tells us that if we sin, we have an Advocate with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word rendered Advocate is parakletos, and it denotes one who is called to another s side to aid him, hence, a helper; one who offers legal aid or one who intercedes on behalf of someone else, hence, an advocate, counsel, or intercessor.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word denotes consoling and consolation, hence, a consoler, a comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paraclete is its anglicized form.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This word is used in the Gospel of John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7 for the Spirit of reality as our Comforter within us, caring for our cause or affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is used here for the Lord Jesus as our Advocate with the Father, the One who cares for our case, intercedes on our behalf Rom 8:34 , and pleads for us if we sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This interceding and pleading is based upon His propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In chapter one John speaks concerning the redeeming blood of Christ that constantly cleanses us as we walk in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But in this verse John goes further to show us a Person, who is our Advocate with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, in the divine provision we have the blood of Christ and also the Person of Christ as our Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Comforter in the Heavens</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>and the Comforter in Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we have seen, Advocate is a translation of the Greek word parakletos.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This word is formed of two words: the preposition para used here as a prefix and the word kletos.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Put together, these words denote someone called to our side.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Greek word parakletos is used in the New Testament only by John.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In his Gospel John says, And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever 14:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that while the Lord was with the disciples, one parakletos, one Comforter, was there with them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But this parakletos was about to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, there was the need for another parakletos, another Comforter, to come.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, the first parakletos and the other parakletos are one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The One who is called another Comforter is now in us as the life-giving Spirit, and the One who was the first Comforter, the Lord Jesus Christ, is now in the heavens at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may use electricity as an illustration of these two Comforters.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the one hand, electricity is in the power plant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the other hand, electricity has been installed into our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may say, therefore, that with electricity there are two ends: one end in the power plant and the other end in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the electricity flows from the power plant, where it is stored, to our homes, where it is applied, these two ends are connected.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may compare the electricity in the power plant to the Comforter, the Lord Jesus, in the heavens, and the electricity in our homes to the other Comforter, the life-giving Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the heavens we have the Lord Jesus Christ as our Comforter, and in our spirit we have the Spirit as another Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, these two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason, the Greek word parakletos is used for both the Comforter in the heavens and the Comforter in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Recovery Version we translate parakletos as Comforter in John 14:16 and as Advocate in 1 John 2:1.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In John 14:26 and 15:26 this Greek word is also translated Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Comforter is an appropriate translation of parakletos in John 14:16, for in this verse there is a certain feeling that this Paraclete comes to comfort the disciples in their sorrow caused by the Lord s leaving them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord had told His disciples that He was leaving, and they were troubled by this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, in this chapter the Lord indicated to the disciples that they did not need to be sorrowful, for He would ask the Father to send them another Paraclete, another Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because the troubled disciples were in need of comfort, it is correct to render parakletos in John 14:26 as Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This Greek word does imply the thought of comfort; it refers to one who helps us, serves us, stands by us, and goes along with us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such a one surely is a comforter.</S>
