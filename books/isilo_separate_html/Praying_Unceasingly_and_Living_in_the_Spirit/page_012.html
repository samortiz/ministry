<h1 class="title">PRAYING UNCEASINGLY AND<br />
LIVING IN THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">VEILS AND TRAPS</h2>
<p>We are all covered by a thick veil. This veil is our natural constitution and includes our natural concept that stems from our natural constitution. We are not the second generation of mankind born after Adam. Rather, we were born nearly six thousand years after Adam. Hence, our problem is more complicated than Cain&rsquo;s problem. The saints from China should ask themselves whether they have put off the Chinese tradition, history, and philosophy. It is difficult to put off one&rsquo;s ancestry, ethnicity, customs, culture, sentiments, and background. The Chinese are profoundly cultured, not only by our Chinese ancestry but also by the influence of Western culture. These elements constitute our inward being and have become veils that hinder us from understanding the Bible. Because we always read the Bible with these &ldquo;tinted glasses,&rdquo; we cannot see the true color of the Bible. Even though we have spoken about these problems in the past, we seem unable to drop them.</p>
<p>For example, our fallen nature influences us to study things for knowledge. Before a person is saved, he does not care about the Bible. However, as soon as he is saved and loves the Lord, he may immediately fall into the trap of thinking that he has to study the Bible. Some believers may even study church history, biographies of believers, and other spiritual writings. This is not bad, but we need to know that everything has its pros and cons. The Lord Jesus said to the Jewish religionists, &ldquo;You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me. Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life&rdquo; (John 5:39-40). Therefore, searching the Scriptures was like poison to the Jewish religionists.</p>
<p>Many Christians cite Acts 17:10 and 11 and argue that the Bereans were noble in that they examined the Scriptures daily. This indeed is a compliment to the Bereans. However, examining the Scriptures should not be done without coming to the Lord to receive life. A person who examines the Scriptures without receiving life may not grow, even if he is saved. Of course, we must examine the Scriptures to know the truth. Nevertheless, if we use only our mind to examine the Scriptures, our growth in life will be hindered. Everything has its measure. We are benefited when we stay within the appropriate measure; however, we will suffer when we go beyond our measure.</p>
<p>It is not necessarily profitable to study the Bible every day. We should spend more time praying. Our problem is that we know the Bible, but we are short of prayer, short of the breath of life, and short of the Spirit. The believers in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery possess much Bible knowledge. Although few among us are Doctors of Divinity, in some aspects our understanding of the Bible surpasses that of the Doctors of Divinity. They may know Hebrew and Greek, Bible history and geography, and biblical names and biographies, but their understanding of the Bible is different from our understanding. If asked concerning life and the spirit, the soul, and the body, they may say that they have never read anything concerning these items. Their study is in one realm, but our training is in another realm. They are in the realm of knowledge, but we are in the realm of life.</p>
<p>Regrettably, our knowledge of life has turned into knowledge. Some have studied and even memorized the fourteen points in <em>The Knowledge of Life</em> and the nineteen items in <em>The Experience of Life.</em> This, however, should be done with prayer. We should pray over the fourteen points in <em>The Knowledge of Life</em> so that they can get into our spirit. Each of the nineteen items in <em>The Experience of Life</em> requires thorough prayer. Because we are short of prayer and the breath of life, for many years we have been unable to come out of the snare of studying but instead have fought battles over doctrine.</p>
<p>It is difficult for Christians to be one concerning doctrine. Suppose there are one hundred thirty people here. This means that there are one hundred thirty minds, and each mind is as different as one face is from another face. The divisions in Christianity are divisions in the mind. If the Christians who love and pursue the Lord would care for the spirit and practice living in the spirit instead of caring for the mind, there would be no divisions.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING TO STRENGTHEN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>My burden is for us to see that our basic need is the breath of life, which is the Spirit, and that prayer is the only way to meet this need. We need spiritual sight to see that if our spirit is not strong and living, our effort and struggle will be in vain. If we do not pray, we will turn our attention to self-improvement. Some people are naturally inclined to asceticism and self-improvement, but this is not spiritual. The Confucianists in China focus on self-improvement and may be advanced in this area. However, just as we cannot bring the indulgence of the flesh into the church, so we cannot bring the concept of self-improvement into the church.</p>
<p>Every matter in the church is dependent on the Spirit. If we see this, we will spontaneously be willing to spend time to pray, pray-read, and call on the name of the Lord. We need to live out the reality of being joined to the Lord. He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). We need to experience being one spirit with the Lord when we talk to our spouse so that our talking will be the Lord&rsquo;s talking. This is precious. In the past our spiritual pursuit was focused on reading the Bible, studying spiritual books, and exploring various practices, but not much time was spent on prayer. This lack of prayer has caused us to suffer. Now we must drop our &ldquo;studying&rdquo; and instead pursue being one spirit with the Lord. We need to practically experience being one spirit with the Lord in all things, whether they be great or small.</p>
<p>When I speak of prayer, some people may think that I am referring to not doing anything without prayer. This is not what I am referring to. When I speak of prayer, I am referring to being one spirit with the Lord. We must always turn to our spirit in order to have genuine prayer. This is spiritual breathing. Even when a brother speaks to his relatives or friends, he should continue to pray in his spirit. He does not need to say, &ldquo;Lord, give me the appropriate words to say to my relatives and friends,&rdquo; nor does he need to say, &ldquo;Lord, keep me from losing my temper.&rdquo; These are religious prayers. He only needs to pray, &ldquo;Lord, be one spirit with me. Lead me in the spirit. May I breathe You in and experience You. Lord, keep me from turning away from You. Enable me to do things according to the Spirit.&rdquo; There is no need to be concerned with what he should say or about losing his temper. Such items are Confucian in nature. We should let these things go. The Bible requires us only to be according to the spirit and to abide in the Lord (Rom. 8:4; John 15:4). We do not need to do anything, nor do we need to ask the Lord to do anything for us.</p>
<p>Perhaps some may be confused. We have been doing things for a long time. Now we simply need to stop. However, even our stopping can become an activity. Our effort to stop ourselves can become a method. It is no wonder that the Lord did not tell us what to do. He only said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you&rdquo; (v. 4). We only need to abide in the Lord, because He is responsible for the outcome.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
