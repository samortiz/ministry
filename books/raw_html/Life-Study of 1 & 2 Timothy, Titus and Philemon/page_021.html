<h2 class=head3>14. Not a New Convert</h2><p>Verse 6 says, “Not a new convert, lest being blinded with pride he fall into the judgment of the Devil.” The Greek word rendered blinded literally means beclouded with smoke. Pride here is likened to smoke that beclouds the mind, making it blind, besotted with the self-conceit of pride. One who is blinded with pride may fall into the judgment of the Devil. This judgment refers to that to which Satan was sentenced due to his pride in his high position (Ezek. 28:13-17). The Devil was judged because of his rebellion which came from pride. The Devil was proud, blind, and rebellious. For this, he received God’s judgment.<h2 class=head3>15. Having a Good Testimony from Those Outside</h2><p>In verse 7 Paul concludes, “And he also must have a good testimony from those outside, that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil.” An elder must be right with himself, with his family, with the church, and with those outside—the society. And, according to the context, an elder must be right in intention, in motive, in character, in attitude, in words, and in deeds.<p>To fall into the judgment of the Devil is due to the pride of the elder himself; to fall into the snare of the Devil is occasioned by the reproach of outsiders. An elder should be alert not to be proud on the one hand, and not to be reproachable on the other, that he may avoid the Devil’s entanglement.<h2 class=head1>II. DEACONS</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Qualifications of a Deacon</h2><p>In verse 8 Paul says, “Deacons must similarly be grave, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not seeking gain by base means.” Deacons are serving ones. The overseers take care of the church; the deacons serve the church under the direction of the elders. These are the only two offices in a local church.<h2 class=head3>1. Grave</h2><p>Deacons are to be grave. This virtue inspires and invites honor and respect. A person who is grave is neither loose nor light.<h2 class=head3>2. Not Double-tongued</h2><p>A serpent is double-tongued. A deacon in a local church rendering service to all the saints may easily be double-tongued in contacting them. In that case, he practices the nature of the Devil and brings death into the church life.<p>Today we often use the expression two-faced instead of double-tongued. A two-faced person is hypocritical. He may speak one way to a brother in his presence and another way about the brother in his absence. Deacons should be neither double-tongued nor two-faced. If you do not have the Lord’s leading to speak frankly to a brother about his situation, simply be quiet. Do not say anything to please him. Furthermore, you should not speak negatively about him behind his back.<p>The deacons should fulfill their duty without talking too much. However, there is a great temptation to talk excessively. In their contact with the elders, the deacons may acquire information about certain matters. It is tempting to pass on this information. When a deacon behaves in this way, he becomes the information center of the church. The deacons should not be informers. Restricting the circulation of needless information will kill the germs of death in the church life.<h2 class=head3>3. Not Addicted to Much Wine</h2><p>Deacons should not be addicted to much wine. Being addicted to much wine is a sign of being unable to control oneself. A deacon in the service of a local church must exercise self-control in a full way.<h2 class=head3>4. Not Seeking Gain by Base Means</h2><p>A deacon also should not seek gain by base means. He should not seek gain from rendering service to the saints. This is seeking gain by base means (see 6:5b). A deacon, therefore, should not be fond of money.
