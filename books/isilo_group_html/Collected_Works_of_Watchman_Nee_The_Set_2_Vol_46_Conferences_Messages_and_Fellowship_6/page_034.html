Before we settle the question of fellow workers we must settle this question: What is our work? There is no possibility of solving the problem of our co-workers until the problem of our own work is solved. Does our work answer the demands of God's eternal purpose? Is our ministry fully meeting God's need? If so, we cannot require less than this from any fellow worker&mdash;that he have a clear seeing objectively, and that he have a fundamental breaking of the natural life subjectively.</p><p>In the Gospels our Lord showed us that it is He who appoints fellow workers. He chose twelve disciples, and He sent them forth in six pairs. We read of Simon "and" Andrew, James "and" John, Philip "and" Bartholomew, Thomas "and" Matthew, James "and" Thaddaeus, and Simon "and" Judas. All twelve disciples were fellow laborers. Each one labored together with the other eleven, but in a more specific sense each one had a special co-worker.</p><p>Our Lord appointed them to a special task, and for the performance of that task He sent them forth two by two. In the Gospels we read of two times six, but in Acts 2 we read of "Peter...with the eleven." Six companies of two have now become a company of twelve. When the disciples labored throughout the country, they were divided into pairs of fellow workers. When they were assembled in Jerusalem, they were not there as a testimony for the unsaved but as a testimony to the resurrection of the Lord. They could not meet in the assembly as fellow workers, so the six pairs were dissolved. But when there was a special piece of ministry that had to be done, we read of special cooperation among them again. In Acts 3 we find Peter and John going out together, and in Acts 8 we find the same two going forth as special fellow workers. The principle governing a special commission to special ministry is six times two, but the principle governing the Christian life is the oneness of all the disciples.
