   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE MANIFESTATION OF MAN'S REBELLION 1 Scripture Reading: 2 Pet 2:10-12; Eph 5:6; Jude 8-10; Matt 12:34; Rom 9:11-24</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Where is man's rebellion practically manifested?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, it is manifested in words.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second, it is manifested in reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Third, it is manifested in the thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to be delivered from rebellion, we must first deal with these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Otherwise, rebellion cannot be truly dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>WORDS Words Being the Outlet of the Heart</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a man is rebellious, his words surely will reveal rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sooner or later rebellious words will come out of his mouth, because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to know authority, a man must first meet authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a man has not met authority, he will never be able to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is useless to merely listen to messages on submission.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A man must at one time meet God, and then the basis of God's authority will be established in him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When he speaks, he will know if a word of disobedience comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even before the word comes out, the thought of it will give him an uneasy feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He will realize that he has stepped beyond his boundary and that there is a restraining within him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a man speaks words of rebellion carelessly without any restraining within, he must be one who has never met authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is much easier for a man to speak in rebellion than to act in rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The tongue is the thing that is the hardest to tame.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, when a man rebels against authority, the tongue will show it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps one agrees with you in your presence, but when the back is turned reviling words will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No words may be spoken up front, but the mouth is filled with words when the back is turned.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is because the mouth is so available.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everyone in the world today is rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Mostly people pay lip service and submit outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But in the church there should not be just outward submission; all submission should come from the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you want to know whether or not a man is submissive in heart, see if he is submissive in words.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God requires a submission of the heart from us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to meet God's authority or the problem will explode sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eve Adding Carelessly to God's Word</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Eve was tempted in Genesis 3, she added a few words: "Neither shall ye touch it" v. 3 . We have to realize the seriousness of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If man knows God's authority, he will not dare add to God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word of God is clear enough.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it" 2:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God did not say, "Neither shall ye touch it."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those words were added by Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whoever changes God's word by adding to or deleting from it proves that he has never met authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such a one is surely rebellious and unlearned.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a government sends a person as a representative to speak a word at a certain place, that person must remember precisely the words that he is to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He must not add anything else to the words.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although Eve saw God every day, she did not know authority.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She spoke carelessly, thinking that it was all right to say a few words more or less.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a mortal man serving a mortal master would not dare to add to or delete from his master's words, how much more should we who serve God be careful in doing the same?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a man speaks carelessly, it proves that he is a rebellious one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ham Exposing His Father's Failure</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Look at the behavior of Ham, the son of Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When he saw the nakedness of his father, he went out to tell Shem and Japheth 9:20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A person who is not submissive in heart always likes to see authority in failure.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Ham found the opportunity to expose his father's mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This proves that he was one who did not submit to his father's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Previously, he submitted through pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When he saw his father's mistake, he exposed it to his two brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many brothers criticize others and delight in tearing them down because of a lack of love 1 Cor 13:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>With Ham there was not just a lack of love, but a lack of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It was a manifestation of rebellion.</S>
