<h2 class="head1">IV. THE THRONE OF GOD AND OF THE LAMB</h2><p>In eternity we shall also enjoy the throne of God and the Lamb (22:3). It is difficult to determine whether the throne of God in Revelation 21 and 22 is the throne of authority or the throne of grace. In Hebrews 4 the throne is the throne of grace, but in Revelation 4 the throne is mainly the throne of authority. At the end of the Bible, the throne is both the throne of authority and the throne of grace. We know this by the picture in chapter twenty-two. Here the throne of God and the Lamb is certainly for God&rsquo;s divine administration. Thus, it is the throne of authority. However, proceeding out of the throne is not authority, but the river of water of life, with the tree of life as the life supply. This is not authority; it is grace.</p><p>We should never separate authority from grace or grace from authority. Grace and authority are one. If we have grace, we are under authority, and if we are under authority, we are surely partaking of grace. Although it is true that, as Christians, we need to reign, we should not reign by authority. Rather, we should reign through the flow of life. The elders should not exercise their eldership by means of authority. The eldership, that is, the representation of the headship, must be exercised through the flow of life. Although the throne is the throne of authority, the throne of headship, out of the throne flows the river of water of life. When you look at the throne, you see authority and headship. But when you look at the river, you see the water of life and the tree of life. This indicates that proper eldership is not the exercise of authority over others; it is the flowing of life into them. We are reigning, but we do not reign by authority; we reign through the flowing of the inner life.</p><p>Today the Lord Jesus does not reign merely with authority. He is reigning in the church, among the churches, and over all the churches through the flowing of His life as grace. The more we partake of His life, the more authority we have. The ones whom you respect in the church life are those who are mature in life. However, no one who assumes authority will be respected. Deep in the spirits of the saints there is no respect for that kind of eldership. Life is the very expression of authority. Instead of assuming authority, we need to live out Christ. The very Christ whom we live out will be our authority over others. We shall enjoy this kind of authority for eternity. The throne, the source of the life supply with the divine authority, will be our eternal enjoyment.</p><h2 class="head1">V. NO MORE CURSE</h2><p>In eternity &ldquo;there shall no longer be any curse.&rdquo; Instead of the curse, the throne of God and the Lamb will be our eternal portion. The curse came in through Adam&rsquo;s fall (Gen. 3:17) and was dealt with by Christ&rsquo;s redemption (Gal. 3:13). Since in the new heaven and new earth there will be no more fall, there will no longer be any curse.</p><p>Not many Christians understand all that the curse includes. Things such as hatred, criticism, and gossip are included in the curse. If anyone in the church in Anaheim still gossips, this means that the church is still under a small, subtle curse. If the brothers and sisters criticize one another, that also is a sign that the church is under the curse. Furthermore, if some saints are weak to the extent that they are deadened, that is a mark of the curse. For there to be no more curse means that there is no longer any gossip, hatred, criticism, weakness, or deadness. When there is no curse, everything is smooth, pleasant, strong, and living.</p><p>I do not like to be present in any home where a husband is exchanging words with his wife. Whenever I overhear such an argument, I flee because I do not want to share in the curse. I do not want to see the curse, touch the curse, or be under the curse. If I witnessed such an argument, it would be difficult to forget the impression it made on me. Each time I saw that brother and sister I would be reminded of their quarrel. A number of times, as I was approaching the home of a brother and sister, I overheard an argument between them. Immediately, I turned away and did not come back until everything had become silent. Then I knocked on the door and was greeted with a pleasant, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! Amen!&rdquo; This is wonderful. I certainly enjoy being with a husband and wife who are praising the Lord. I would like the impression made by their praises to linger with me forever.</p><p>Have you ever realized how much the curse includes? Have you ever thought that &ldquo;no more curse&rdquo; includes no more exchange of words? When there is no curse, everything is smooth, pleasant, living, bright, pure, and perfect. When we are in New Jerusalem, we shall participate in this great blessing. However, we all long to be able to say that in the church life today there is no longer any curse. May this be the situation in all the local churches.</p>
