   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the previous message we saw that in what He is, in His person, the Lord Jesus is both all-inclusive and unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A great deal is involved with His being God and His being all-inclusive and unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, the Bible says that He is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The universe is a mystery, and God is even more a mystery, but this mystery has been unfolded in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jesus Christ is the mystery of God; outside of Him, no one can find God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How all-inclusive and boundless He is!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even His coming to be a man was not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was not a man who had only the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, He was a man who had the divine nature added to His human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His human nature was mingled with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was born of a human virgin, but He was conceived of the divine Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, He was born as a man with both the human nature and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, He could be called a God-man, One who was both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When He was on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, very often even the disciples who followed Him were so amazed that they asked who this One was.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was indeed a man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He felt weary, He was hungry, He even wept and shed tears, and He slept.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way He was the same as any normal human being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He lived as an ordinary man in a carpenter's home for thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nevertheless, many times His words and actions were extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not only did He perform signs and wonders, but His words were simple yet great.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Throughout the ages no philosopher has had the boldness to speak what He spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said, "I am the life," "I am the light," and "He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We could not even dream of such words, which are simple yet full of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such mysterious, excellent, and deep words indicate that He was the infinite God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even though He was a man who was finite, in this finite man was divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, as a man He was both all-inclusive and infinite.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moreover, concerning His death, He did not die for Himself because He Himself did not need to die.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He died for us, and He did a work for us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even though He passed through death, He still worked in this death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The work which He carried out in His death also manifested His all-inclusiveness and unlimitedness.</S>
