   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AN OPEN LETTER Issue No. 25</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Praise God that His grace and power have enabled us once again to publish another volume of The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His provision and His guidance are precious.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The messages concerning the New Testament in this volume are a continuation of the last volume.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, I would like everyone to remember that each of these messages can stand alone by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The messages in this volume emphasize that the foundation of the New Testament is based upon the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As to the messages, "In Christ" and "God's Way of Redemption," one needs to read them with much prayer and God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If there is prayer and revelation, everything will become reality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Otherwise, it will merely disappear like fleeing clouds and will not be of much use.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I need to explain some more concerning the writings which appeared in the past in The Present Testimony and Notes on Scriptural Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Most of the articles are notes from my messages.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although I have spent much time in polishing them, the style and expressions are basically the same as when I originally delivered them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They would have been clearer and mistakes would have been fewer if I had rewritten them, but this was impossible because of my busy schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, I beg the brothers to forgive me if there are any mistakes in structure or expression.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Concerning those who have corresponded with me, I would like you to know I have read your letters and sympathize with you, but because of my physical weakness, busy schedule, frequent travel, and lack of help, in many cases I have been unable to answer them right away.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In some cases I have not been able to answer them at all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indeed is regrettable, but in my present situation I see no hope of improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I beg the brothers to forgive me, for if I answered all the letters, I would not be able to do any other work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the last few months, due to heart disease and other physical illness, my earthly tent is again in danger of collapsing at any moment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many times I tarry at the fork of the road, not knowing what way to take.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Humanly speaking, in many experiences I do not know whether to cry or laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But thank the Lord, for the Lord's sake nothing is too difficult and no price is too great.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the eyes of those who trust and obey, a dark, cloudy situation is still a bright and clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those lines are true: "If there is less of earth joy; give, Lord, more of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let the spirit praise Thee, though the heart be riven."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Your prayer at this time is what I treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thank you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peace be to you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A household slave of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>August 8, 1932</S>
