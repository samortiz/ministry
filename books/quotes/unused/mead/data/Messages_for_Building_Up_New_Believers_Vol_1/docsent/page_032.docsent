   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>COMING OUT FROM THEIR MIDST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO BE WELCOMED BY THE ALL-SUFFICIENT LORD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second Corinthians 6:17-18 says, Therefore come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean; and I will welcome you ; and I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me, says the Lord Almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the New Testament the words Lord Almighty are used for the first time in 2 Corinthians 6.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord Almighty is Elshadai in Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>El is God, sha is a mother s breast or milk, and shadai means something that is with milk.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Hebrew shadai means all-sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The words Almighty God in the Old Testament are also Elshadai, which should be translated as the All-sufficient God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The mother s milk is all that a child needs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The mother s breasts contain the milk; all the supply is in the breasts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The root of the word shadai is the mother s breast.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that with God we have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Second Corinthians 6:17 tells us that if we come out from their midst and do not touch their unclean things, God will welcome us and be a Father to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We shall be sons and daughters to Him, says the All-sufficient Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can see that these words have not been spoken lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord is saying, Because of Me you have left many things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have come out from their midst and are separated from them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have terminated your relationships with them and are no longer touching their unclean things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Your two hands are empty, and there is nothing left in you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now that you have done all this, I will welcome you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Please remember that everyone who feels welcomed by the Lord is separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many people do not feel the excellency of the Lord when they come to Him because they have not counted all things as refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who have not counted all things as refuse surely consider earthly things precious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such people do not know what it means for God to welcome them; they do not know what it means for God to be their Father and for them to be God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They do not know that the One who spoke these words is the all-sufficient Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Can you see the special significance of the word shadai?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The words Lord Almighty are used here because when a person has cast away everything, he needs God as the Shadai; he needs a Father who is all-sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Psalm 27:10 tells us that if our father and mother forsake us, Jehovah will take us up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In other words, He becomes our father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Psalm 73:26 says that when our flesh and our heart fail, God is the rock of our heart and our portion forever.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Herein lies the sweetness of our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There must be loss on one side before there can be gain on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The blind man met the Lord only after he was cast out of the synagogue John 9:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we remain in the synagogue, we will never meet the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when we are cast out, we see the Lord s blessing upon us immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As new believers we must come out from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only then will we taste the Lord s sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once we drop something on one side, we will taste the goodness of the Lord on the other side.</S>
