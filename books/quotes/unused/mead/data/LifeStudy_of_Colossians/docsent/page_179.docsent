   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A HEAVENLY TRANSMISSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At this point we may ask how we can enjoy Christ and have Him constituted into us when He is in heaven and we are on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The answer lies in the fact that there is a transmission taking place from Christ in heaven to us on earth by means of the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By means of this transmission, the electricity from the heavenly power plant flows into us, just as electricity flows from the power plant into our homes and into the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hallelujah for the transmission from the third heaven into us!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There s a Man in the glory Whose Life is for me Hymns, #505 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is the Man in the glory, but His life is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all need a vision of the heavenly transmission from the glorified Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, we need to stay open to this transmission so that it will not be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even a small amount of insulation will cause this transmission to cease.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Between Christ as the fullness of God and the one new man, there is our experience of the heavenly transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>May there be no insulation to hinder this divine transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>FROM THE FULLNESS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>TO THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John s writing is like Paul s in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John 1:16 says, For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fullness of Christ is the very fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of this fullness we have all received grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ultimately, the issue of our receiving of Christ s fullness will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The New Jerusalem revealed through John s ministry will be the ultimate consummation of the new man revealed through Paul s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the one hand, Paul begins with the fullness and goes to the new man; on the other hand, John goes from the fullness to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>CROWNED WITH GLORY AND HONOR</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Hebrews, Ephesians, and Revelation there are windows through which we can see the things above.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first aspect of the things above is found in Hebrews 2:9.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to this verse, we see Jesus crowned with glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On earth, He was crowned with thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But on the throne in heaven, He is crowned with glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the One crowned with glory and honor, Christ is far more precious than Judaism or Greek philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To set our mind on such things is to set it on the things which are on the earth Col 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Judaism and Greek philosophy are things on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let us look away from these things and look to the resurrected and ascended Jesus who is enthroned and crowned with glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since we have been raised with Christ, we should seek the things above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us forget our natural virtues and look at the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead of appreciating our natural attributes and character, we need to appreciate the One crowned with glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to Paul, our attention must be concentrated on the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not be attracted by anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>LORD AND CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Acts 2:36 we find another aspect of the things above.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here Peter declares, Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Jesus, the carpenter from Nazareth, has been exalted by God to be the Lord over all and the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the believers in Colosse truly had realized this, they would not have been distracted by Judaism or Greek philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today Jesus is God s Christ, God s anointed One, the Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>HEAD OVER ALL</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Ephesians 1:20-23 Paul says that God raised Christ from among the dead; seated Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule, authority, power, lordship, and every name; has subjected all things under His feet; and gave Him to be the Head over all things to the church, His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The power exercised by God in raising Christ from among the dead has made Him Head over all to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ has been crowned with glory and honor, He is the Lord of all and the Christ of God, and He is the Head over all things to His Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be sure, the vision of such a Christ should cause us to forget our natural virtues and characteristics, all of which are things on the earth, not things which are above.</S>
