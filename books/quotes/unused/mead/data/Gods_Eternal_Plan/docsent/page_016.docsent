   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen the work of the Lord as well as the kingdom and the evil intention of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we come to the position and responsibility of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the eyes of God the church occupies a very important place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Its position is that of being joined to Christ, and its responsibility is to continue the warfare that Christ fought on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ the Head has ascended, but His Body is still on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church, as the Body of Christ, is His propagation, continuing His stand and work to fight against God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ephesians 1:20-23 shows us that the power which operated in Christ not only raised Him from the dead, but caused Him to ascend to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This resurrection power is the power of ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through His resurrection the church received its life, and through His ascension the church assumed its position of authority and inherited the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way, He brought heaven to earth, and His will can be done on earth, as in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ ascended to the heavens and received the heavenly authority; now He is able to bring heaven to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Resurrection alone is not enough; there must also be ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we stand in the heavenly position, we transcend all things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the Lord ascended to the heavens, He transcended all the powers of the enemy, and God subjected all things under His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of course, this is not fully manifested at the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ ascended and became Head over all things to the church Eph 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 23 clearly shows that the church and Christ are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church is filled with Christ; it is the fullness of Christ, the overflow of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God s desire is to gain a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church, which is formed of individual saints who are put into Christ, is the corporate Christ; it is the combination of all the small portions of Christ in the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the Body of Christ, the church is the continuation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everything that belongs to Christ belongs to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The position that Christ attained is the position that the church has attained.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE CHURCH STANDING BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE CROSS AND THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The cross of Christ produced the church, and the church brings in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, the church stands between the cross and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The present age is the time for the church to practically realize the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Head has overcome; now the Body must also overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord destroyed the devil on the cross and produced the church with resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today God is establishing His kingdom on earth through His church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church must continue the victorious work that Christ has carried out against Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is responsible for bringing heaven s will down to earth and for carrying it out on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE CHURCH CONTINUING</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>CHRIST S BATTLE ON EARTH</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the millennium, he will be bound and cast into the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before that time, the church is on the earth to curb the activities of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The prayer of the church is the most effective means of curbing Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church is a miniature of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Any place that manifests God s authority is a place where the kingdom is realized Matt 12:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is our responsibility to put a halt to Satan s will.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Wherever the church is, Satan s authority will retreat.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church is on the earth to perpetuate and manifest Christ s victorious stand over Satan.</S>
