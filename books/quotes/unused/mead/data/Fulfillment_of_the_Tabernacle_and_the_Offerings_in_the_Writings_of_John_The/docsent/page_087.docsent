   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REALITY AND THE EMANCIPATOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some may say that because they are saved, they are no longer slaves of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Doctrinally speaking, this is true.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But in our actual experience we may still be slaves of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whether or not we have been freed from the slavery of sin depends on how much the dear Lord Jesus is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we need to consider from this chapter what this precious One is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this chapter the Lord Jesus indicates that He is the reality and the emancipator.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 32 He says, "And you shall know the reality, and the reality shall set you free."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then in verse 36 He goes on to say, "If then the Son shall set you free, you shall be really free."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be set free by the reality is to be emancipated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we compare verses 32 and 36, we shall see that the Son of God is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 32 says that reality sets us free, and verse 36, that the Son sets us free.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that the Son is the reality that sets us free.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What does it mean to say that the Son of God is the reality that sets us free?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the previous message we pointed out that we may say that the reality of the universe is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, to say this may be to utter something vague and ambiguous.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to see that the reality here is related to God incarnate, to the eternal God becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 28 the Lord Jesus speaks of the lifting up of the Son of Man, not of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we shall see, in verse 58 the Lord indicates that He is the I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order for the Son of God to be the reality that frees us from sin, He had to be incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He had to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If He had not become a man, He could not be the reality, and He could not set us free.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The universal reality is God incarnate, the eternal God becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This incarnated God is both the tabernacle and the aggregate of all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the reality in chapter eight includes the eternal God incarnated to be a man, and this Man is the tabernacle and the aggregate of all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the reality that sets us free.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>CHRIST IN ACTUALITY AND PRACTICALITY</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Christ whom we enjoy today is this reality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is God incarnate to be the tabernacle and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Christ we enjoy is One who includes God, incarnation, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This One even includes His descent as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As we pointed out in the foregoing message, today in His extract this Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do we not have this life-giving Spirit within us?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all need to realize that today Christ as the life-giving Spirit dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The power to overcome sin is in this extract, in this life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to see that the life-giving Spirit is the actual and practical Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Fifty years ago, I came to know that Christ is the One who sets us free from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, I did not enjoy freedom from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I had Christ, but I did not have much enjoyment of Him because I did not realize the elements, the ingredients, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I did not realize that the extract of this Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Just as anyone who is not a doctor or a pharmacist may not know the ingredients, elements, and extract of a certain medicine, so we may not know the ingredients, elements, and extract of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a result, we may have Christ in doctrine, in terminology, but we may not have Christ in actuality and practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I do not ask if you know a doctrinal Christ, but if you know the practical and actual Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Who is the actual Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Who is the practical Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The life-giving Spirit is the actual and practical Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today many Christians know only a doctrinal Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some of those who hold to traditional teachings concerning the Trinity even oppose the truth that Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is foolish to oppose this biblical truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we do not have the life-giving Spirit, we cannot have Christ in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As the extract of an herb is actually the herb itself, so the life-giving Spirit as the extract of Christ is Christ Himself for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The extract of an herb may be used as medicine for those who are ill.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The extract is not needed in order for the herb itself to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In order for the herb to exist it is sufficient that it be an herb.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In a similar way, in order for Christ to exist, there was no need for Him to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But in order for us to enjoy Him and participate in Him, it was necessary for Him to become the extract, to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today we experience Christ as this life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For this reason, we say that the life-giving Spirit is the actual, practical Christ.</S>
