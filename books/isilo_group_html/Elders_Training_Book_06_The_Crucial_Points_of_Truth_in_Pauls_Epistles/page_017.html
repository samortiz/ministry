<p>The next crucial point is found in 13:4 which says, &ldquo;For indeed He was crucified out of weakness, but He lives by the power of God.&rdquo; Apparently this portion of the Word is easy to understand. However there is a difficult element here. Christ was crucified out of, or because of, weakness. If Christ had not been weak, He would never have been arrested. Weakness here is the weakness of the body, the same as in 10:10. For Himself Christ did not need to be weak in any way. But for accomplishing redemption on our behalf, He was willing to be weak in His body that He might be crucified. If He was not willing to be weak, how could He have been crucified? He was crucified out of weakness, but He lives by the power of God. Paul told the Corinthians that he followed Christ to be weak in Him for their sake. Verse 4 continues, &ldquo;For indeed we are weak in Him, but we shall live together with Him by the power of God toward you.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">TESTING YOURSELVES<br />
WHETHER YOU ARE IN THE FAITH</h2>
<p>The crucial point in 13:5 is closely related to the previous point. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves; or do you not recognize yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?&rdquo; The crucial and difficult point here is the faith. What does it mean to test yourselves whether you are in the faith? Verses 6 and 7 continue, &ldquo;But I hope that you will know that we are not disapproved. Now we pray to God that you do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do what is good, and we may be as disapproved.&rdquo; This is one of the hardest portions in the New Testament for New Testament readers to understand. The Corinthians altogether lived not only in the natural life but also in the flesh. They considered that Paul was not so strong, not so excellent as an apostle, and even unlearned. Most Bible teachers agree that Paul was a short man. Perhaps Peter may have been a taller man. In this sense, Peter may have been more preferable than Paul. Also, Apollos may have seemed to be more learned than Paul. Among the Corinthians, some may have admired Peter as a giant, and others may have admired Apollos as a learned one. However, Paul may not have been admired among them.</p>
<p>Paul was certainly not unlearned, but he did not behave in a way to display his learning. In these two books he told us that when he came to the Corinthians he did not come with excellency of speech (1 Cor. 2:1, 2 Cor. 11:6). He had the proper knowledge, but he did not apply it in his speech. He had the adequate education, but he did not seem to use it. For this reason the Corinthians considered him as weak. Paul, standing on this point, told them that he was indeed weak. However, he charged the Corinthians to test themselves whether they were in the faith. In doing this Paul was wise. When he said this, he actually was asking them to test themselves whether they were in the faith related to knowing the apostles. Apparently in verse 5 he did not ask the Corinthians to test themselves concerning knowing the apostles, but concerning knowing themselves. However, if one is in the faith, he would not consider anyone, including himself, according to appearance. In chapter five Paul says that we know no one according to flesh (5:16). We know persons not by what we can see, but by what we cannot see.</p>
<p>Faith is the substantiating of things not seen. Paul asked the Corinthians to test themselves whether or not they were in the faith. If they were in the faith, they would not consider themselves by what they saw or by what they felt. Rather they would consider themselves by faith. They needed to be in faith. If they would have considered themselves not by faith and not in faith, they may have said that Christ was not in them. They may not have felt it to be so, and even the more they could not have seen it to be so. They needed to be persons in faith. Just as they should have considered themselves in the faith, so also they should have done the same concerning the apostles. The apostles should be regarded not according to sight or appearance, but rather in faith. Such a brother as Paul appeared to be weak. But if you would consider him by faith, you would realize that he is powerful, not in himself but in the One who is in him. To consider others in this way, you must first test yourself, by considering yourself in the faith.</p>
<p>The Corinthians regarded Paul according to the outward appearance. They regarded others in this way because they had never considered themselves by faith rather than by sight. This is why Paul told them to test themselves not by appearance but by faith. If they would not have tested themselves in the way of faith, they would have concluded that they were in the flesh. It would have seemed to them that they were not in Christ, that they had nothing to do with Christ, and that Christ was not in them. They would have considered that only the flesh and the natural life were in them. However, the Corinthians did not consider themselves in this way. They considered that Christ was in them, even though according to their appearance they were natural men in the flesh. But even though they would prefer to consider themselves not according to appearance, they still considered the apostle according to his appearance.</p>
<p>This is a very crucial point. We should always consider ourselves not by what we see or feel but in faith. When we would consider ourselves in faith, we would realize that we are a person in weakness and a person in the enjoyment of the sufficient grace of Christ. Chapter thirteen of Second Corinthians should be regarded as a continuation of chapter twelve. Putting these two chapters together we can see that we must be persons always considering ourselves as well as others not by sight or by appearance but in faith. In this state we will appear to be weak, but we will continually enjoy the sufficient grace of Christ. Whenever we feel that we are strong and see the signs of our strength, we are through with the enjoyment of the grace of Christ. This is a great lesson. If I would tell you of the lofty visions that I have received, you would all admire me. But if I would indicate to you that my vision is small, you may all put me aside. The Corinthians had almost entirely disregarded Paul. To them he was weak and was even as nothing. Therefore Paul asked them to test themselves to see whether or not they were in the faith. If they would test themselves by faith, they would learn the lesson. Without the testing by faith, they themselves would appear even as nothing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ENJOYMENT OF THE PROCESSED AND<br />
CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>The final crucial point of this book is the so-called benediction, the blessing of 13:14. At the conclusion of the first book to the Corinthians the human spirit is mentioned. First Corinthians 16:18 says, &ldquo;For they refreshed my spirit and yours.&rdquo; The second book ends in a marvelous, excellent way. Chapter thirteen verse 14 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; This is surely a great, crucial point. This is the conclusion of all the crucial points covered in the preceding chapters. In chapter one we are attached to the anointed One. By being attached to the anointed One, we enjoy the anointing, the sealing, and the pledging. Our attachment to the anointed One is altogether due to the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Not only is this attachment due to this benediction, but this attachment issues in this benediction. The attachment becomes the cause for such a blessing. In chapter two there are the captives and the incense-bearers in the procession to celebrate Christ&rsquo;s victory. To be such captives and incense-bearers, we must be in this divine benediction. If the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit are with us, then we can be such captives and incense-bearers. In chapter three are the letters and the mirrors to behold and reflect the glorious image of Christ that we may be transformed into His image. To be such a letter continually speaking Christ, and to be such a mirror beholding Christ, we must be in this divine benediction. The treasure in chapter four and the second step of reconciliation in chapter five, as well as all the other crucial points, are also related to this benediction. We must have the enjoyment of the processed and consummated Triune God as described in 2 Corinthians 13:14.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 06: The Crucial Points of Truth in Paul's Epistles &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
