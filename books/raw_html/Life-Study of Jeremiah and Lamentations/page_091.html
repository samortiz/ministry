<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Building Their Large House by Unrighteousness<br>and Their Spacious Upper Chambers by Injustice</H2><P>They built their large house by unrighteousness and their spacious upper chambers by injustice, using their neighbor's service without wages and not giving him recompense for his work (22:13). They had eyes and a heart only for their unjust gain, for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression and doing violence (vv. 14-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. As Shepherds of Jehovah's People<br>Having Scattered His Flock<br>and Driven Them Away and Not Visiting Them</H2><P>"Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of My pasture, declares Jehovah. Therefore thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who feed My people: You have scattered My flock and driven them away and have not visited them; behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your deeds, declares Jehovah" (23:1-2). The kings and the nobles were the shepherds of God's people, but they failed to do the proper shepherding.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jehovah's Punishment<br>upon the Kings of Judah with Their People</H2><P>In these three chapters we also see Jehovah's punishment upon the kings of Judah with their people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Giving the Kings of Judah with Their People<br>to Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon</H2><P>Jehovah would give the kings of Judah with their people to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, to exile them to a strange country that they might no longer return and see the land of their birth (21:1-10; 22:10-12, 25-28). In their exile, they would be in a foreign country and under the power of others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Burning the City of Jerusalem<br>and All That Is around Her</H2><P>Jehovah declared that He would punish the kings of Judah with their people by burning the city of Jerusalem and all that is around her, making it a ruin, a wilderness, that is not inhabited (21:11-14; 22:1-7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Jehoiakim the Son of Josiah, King of Judah,<br>to Be Buried with the Burial of a Donkey</H2><P>In 22:18 and 19 we have a word concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, and in verses 29 and 30, a word concerning Coniah (Jeconiah) the son of Jehoiakim. Jehoiakim was to be buried with the burial of a donkey and cast out beyond the gates of Jerusalem. Coniah was to have no seed to sit on the throne of David to rule in Judah.</P>
