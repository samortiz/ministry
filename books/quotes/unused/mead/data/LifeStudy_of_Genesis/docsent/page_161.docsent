   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Produce a Culture without God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Cain left the presence of God and went his own way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first thing he did was to build a city.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He produced a culture without God 4:16-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Bible the concept of a city is very significant, and it is possible to trace a line of cities throughout the Scriptures, beginning with Enoch, a city built by Cain, and ending with the New Jerusalem, a city built by God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The city constructed by Cain will consummate in the Great Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The city of Enoch was a counterfeit of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was not of God, but was initiated by Satan within Cain.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1 The Reason</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must realize the source of human culture and the reason for its development.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Human culture developed because humanity had lost God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Originally, God, the Creator of man, was everything to man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God was man's protection, maintenance, supply, joy, amusement, and defense.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God was everything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the garden, man had no need to do anything except to till the ground to cooperate with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God was everything to man in the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, when man lost God, he lost everything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He lost protection, safeguard, maintenance, supply, and amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This loss of God forced him to invent human culture.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because man had lost everything, he had to invent something.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2 The Process a Building a City for Self-existence</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Satan, working from within Cain, suggested to him that he build a city.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Perhaps Satan said, "Cain, you are afraid that people will kill you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For your existence you need a city to protect you."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because he lost God, Cain was afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He had lost God as his supply, joy, and defense.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The main purpose for cities in ancient times was for protection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, Cain constructed such a city for his self-protection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In a godless culture people are forced to fend for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Cain did not name the city Jehovah, but Enoch, after the name of his son.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He gave the same name to his son and to his city, for, in a sense, his city was his child and he loved it as he loved his own son.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is very meaningful to note that the name Enoch means "initiated," referring to something initiated by Cain.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Cain was the first city builder, the first city planner, and the first architect.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Cain was an inventor, an initiator.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, the first item of his invention was not the city; it was religion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Firstly, he invented religion; secondly, he invented city building.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One of Cain's descendants was Lamech.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The name Lamech in Hebrew means "strong," "powerful."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Lamech, the seventh human generation, was a powerful person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Having two wives, he practiced polygamy 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, polygamy began in the city of Enoch in the land of Nod, which means "wandering."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Lamech practiced polygamy in order to fulfill his lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Polygamy is a violation of the natural law ordained by God for man's existence.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Marriage is necessary for human existence.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, marriage must be limited according to the principle of one wife for one husband.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This principle was ordained by God to maintain human existence.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Lamech was the first to break the divine principle in marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The first of his two wives was named Adah, which means "adornment."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>She was one who adorned and beautified herself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Adah was a wife of adornment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By having these two wives, Lamech's lust was exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One day Lamech boasted to his wives.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold" 4:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Lamech was even more arrogant than his forefather Cain, boasting that he had slain a man for wounding him and had killed a young man for hurting him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, Lamech was not only a polygamist, but was a murderer and an arrogant boaster.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By reading this short portion of the Word we can see how dreadful was the first human culture, a culture without God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All these evil things must have occurred in the city of Enoch built by Cain.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This may be called the city life, which was as evil as the life in the big cities today.</S>
