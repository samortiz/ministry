   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Oneness of the Divine Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the last hour of His course on the earth, after He gave the word on the mysterious Divine Trinity dispensing and transfusing Himself into the believers in John 14 16 right before His betrayal, the Lord prayed to the Father for the oneness among all His believers that it may merge with the genuine oneness of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John 14 through 16, right before His betrayal, the Lord Jesus gave a word on the mysterious Divine Trinity dispensing and transfusing Himself into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord's word in chapter fourteen reveals that the Son is the embodiment and expression of the Father vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>7-11 and the Spirit is the reality and realization of the Son vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>17-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Father in the Son is expressed among the believers, and the Son as the Spirit is realized in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the Spirit enters into the believers, the Triune God the Father in the Son as the Spirit dispenses Himself into the believers to be their portion that they may enjoy Him as their everything in His Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The dispensing of the Triune God revealed in John 14 is for the producing of the church as the Body of Christ, which is the Father's house v. 2 , with the believers of Christ as the many members of the Body, the many abodes in the Father's house v. 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 15 the Lord Jesus is the true vine, the Father is the husbandman, and the believers are the branches vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Father as the husbandman is the source, the author, the planner, the planter, the life, the substance, the soil, the water, the air, the sunshine, and everything to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Son as the vine is the center of God's economy and the embodiment of all the riches of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit of reality, sent by the Son and proceeding from and with the Father, testifies concerning the Son v. 26 . By abiding in the Son as the vine, the believers as the branches participate in the riches of the Father in the fellowship of the Spirit and love one another with the divine love to express the Father's divine life, that is, to glorify the Father, through fruit-bearing vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>4-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, the vine with its branches is the organism of the Triune God in His divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In chapter sixteen the Spirit of reality, the Comforter sent by the Son v. 7 , comes to convict the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>8-11 and to guide the believers into all the reality, that is, to make all that the Son is and has real to the believers vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All that the Father is and has is embodied in the Son v. 15a; Col 2:9 , and all that the Son is and has is received by the Spirit and declared as reality to the believers v. 14 . This is the dispensing and infusing of all the reality of the Triune God into the believers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through the dispensing and infusing of the mysterious Divine Trinity, the believers become the members of the Body of Christ and enter into an organic union with the Triune God to participate in the oneness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After giving the word in John 14 16, in John 17 the Lord prayed to the Father for the oneness among all His believers, that it may merge with the genuine oneness of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verses 21-23 the Lord prayed, "That they the believers all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me." These verses show the merging of the oneness of the believers with the genuine oneness among the three of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The oneness among the three of the Divine Trinity is a model of the oneness of the believers in the Body of Christ, and the oneness of the believers in the Body of Christ is actually the enlargement of the oneness of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This oneness is first in the Father's name by the Father's divine life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>2, 6, 11 , then in the Triune God through sanctification by the reality of the Father's word vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>14-21 , and ultimately in the divine glory for the expression of the processed Triune God who has mingled Himself with the believers through His divine dispensing vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first level of oneness is in the Father's name and life, delivering us from the natural realm.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The second level of oneness is in the reality of the Father's sanctifying word, delivering us from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The third level of oneness is in the Father's glory, delivering us from ourselves and causing us to become fully one in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This oneness, being the mingling of the processed and consummated Triune God with His redeemed and transformed believers, is the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
