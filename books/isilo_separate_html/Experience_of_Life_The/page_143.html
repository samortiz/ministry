Now we shall continue by considering the fourth experience of this stage, spiritual warfare. This is an important experience in the fourth stage. The reason we must know the Body, know the ascension, and reign is that we may have spiritual warfare. Hence, the fourth stage is called the stage of spiritual warfare.<h2 class=head1>I. SCRIPTURAL BASIS</h2><p>The purpose of spiritual warfare is to bring in the kingdom of God. This is a subject of great significance in the Bible. We will select two most important passages as the basis.<p>Let us first read Matthew 12:26, 28-29: &#8220;If Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?...But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you. Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.&#8221; In this passage of the Lord&#8217;s words, there are several important points related to spiritual warfare. First, the Lord says here that Satan has his kingdom. Not only is there the kingdom of God in this universe, but also the kingdom of Satan. Second, the Lord says that if He casts out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto men. Hence, we see that to cast out demons by the Spirit of God is to bring in the kingdom of God, which is to engage in spiritual warfare. Third, since to cast out demons is to bring in the kingdom of God, then before the demons are cast out, it is the kingdom of Satan that reigns. It is through the demons that Satan usurps men and reigns. Fourth, the strong man that the Lord mentions here is Satan. Satan is a strong man; he has that which he usurps and has seized by force. Fifth, both the kingdom of Satan and the house of the strong man are mentioned here. The kingdom of Satan is the house of the strong man. Therefore, the people in the world are on one hand the subjects in the kingdom of Satan, and on the other hand the possessions in the house of Satan. It says here that a certain man enters into the strong man&#8217;s house and spoils his goods. This refers to the Lord coming to the kingdom of Satan to rescue men out of Satan&#8217;s usurpation and possession. Sixth, it says here also that in order for one to spoil the goods of the strong man, he must first bind the strong man. This means that when the Lord comes to rescue us, He must first overcome Satan and bind him.<p>Now let us read Matthew 6:9-10: &#8220;Our Father who art in the heavens, let thy name be sanctified, let thy kingdom come, let thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth&#8221; (J. N. Darby&#8217;s New Translation). Also, verse 13b: &#8220;For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen&#8221; (KJV). This passage of the Lord&#8217;s word concerning prayer is of great significance in the Bible. The meaning contained therein is very much related to spiritual warfare.<p>As the Lord teaches us how to pray, He begins with three &#8220;lets.&#8221; &#8220;Let thy name be sanctified, let thy kingdom come, let thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth.&#8221; These three &#8220;lets&#8221; set forth the central meaning of what the Lord wants us to pray. Then, at the conclusion, He says, &#8220;For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory.&#8221; Again three factors are revealed here. The three &#8220;lets&#8221; at the beginning and the three factors at the conclusion show us the goal of spiritual warfare.<p>&#8220;Let thy name be sanctified&#8221; means also &#8220;Let thy name be separated unto holiness.&#8221; The Bible shows us that the name of God is a great matter. After the fall of mankind, at the time of Enosh (grandson of Adam), men began to call upon the name of the Lord (Gen. 4:26). God desires that only His name be upon earth and that men call only upon His name. But when men built the tower of Babel, rebelling together against God, they put the name of God aside and propagated their own name (Gen. 11:4). God&#8217;s will is that His name be sanctified on earth and become the only name worthy of all honor. However, Satan united rebellious mankind to put aside the name of God and replace it with many other names. Thus, the name of God was made common and ordinary. Hence, the name of God is not being sanctified nor hallowed by men on earth today-an evil consequence of Satan&#8217;s reigning.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_142.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_144.html">Next</a> </body></html>
