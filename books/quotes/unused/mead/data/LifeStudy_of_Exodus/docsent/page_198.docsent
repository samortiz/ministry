   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED TO HUMBLE OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible requires more of us than any other book.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible demands that we humble ourselves and put aside our self-confidence and self-assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In coming to the Word, we need to pray that the Lord will have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we do not receive the Lord s mercy, something within us unconsciously may continue to cover us and keep us from the Lord s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let us learn to pray, Lord, have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I don t want to be covered by anything, and I don t want to have anything between You and me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, grant that there will be nothing between us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This should be not only our prayer, but also our attitude toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In coming to the Word we should not have any self-confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not presume to have the assurance that there are no problems between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We simply do not have the ground for this kind of assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although we may not realize it, there may be still a number of problems between us and Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we need to humble ourselves before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible says, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble James 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do not humble ourselves in coming to the Word, we shall be greatly hindered in receiving help from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some may think that as long as we love the Lord, everything will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, loving the Lord is somewhat general.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may love Him without ever having humbled ourselves before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Realizing that there are still apt to be negative things within us, we need to humble ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If it is difficult to clean our physical surroundings in an absolute way, how much more difficult it is to clean our heart!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Can you say that in cleaning your house you clean thoroughly?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is very difficult for anyone to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Years ago, when our youngest daughter needed minor surgery, the physician told us that he could not perform the surgery in his office.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To us, the office seemed very clean.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the doctor realized that because the ceiling of his office could not be thoroughly cleansed, his office was not a proper place for surgery to be performed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When he said this, I thought that this is also true of the ceiling of our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because our inward ceiling is not absolutely clean, it is difficult for surgery to be performed within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, we should have no confidence in ourselves, but humbly look to the Lord for mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Recently, some of the young people have completed a special training.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although they have passed through a very good training, they should not think that everything is right between them and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They should not assume that everything has been rectified or sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They still may have many problems in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we realize this about ourselves, we shall not be so confident as to think that in everything we are right with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, we shall humble ourselves before the Lord and ask Him for mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>ENLIGHTENED BY THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we have a humble attitude when we come to the Word, not having any trust in ourselves, we shall be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To have no trust in ourselves means that we have no reservations.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nothing remains as a problem between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, if instead of having a humble attitude we still have confidence in ourselves, we shall have serious problems in receiving blessing from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Perhaps you are wondering why you do not receive light from the Word, even though you have been reading the Bible regularly for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The reason may be that you have too much confidence in yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Again I say, we must let go of our confidence, humble ourselves before the Lord, and pray that He will have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should say, Lord, I do not have any confidence in myself, and I do not insist on anything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Lord, I open to You, and I ask You to have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If this is your attitude in coming to the Bible, you will receive blessing from the Word, no matter what portion of the Word you read.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even the first seventeen verses of the Gospel of Matthew will have something as a help for you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The crucial matter is that you humble yourself before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A REALM OF LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Often saints testify that they see light in reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is true.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Through the Word we do receive light.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But in my experience I have found that whenever I humble myself, do not insist on any opinion, and ask the Lord for His mercy, I have the sense that I come into a realm of light whenever I come to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even if I do not receive any particular light, I have the consciousness that I am in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever we come to the Word, we come to the light, because the Word is the embodiment of God, and God is light 1 John 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When you stand under the light of the sun, you do not need to receive light, for you are already in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Likewise, when we come to the Word with a proper attitude, we have the sense that we are in the light and under the light and are not merely receiving light.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then, the whole Bible in our experience becomes a book of light.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>No matter where we may be in our reading, we sense that the Bible is a shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As the embodiment of God, the unique light, the Word of God is a shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This light is actually God Himself in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Because the Word is the condensation of the divine light, we enter into an atmosphere of light whenever we come to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is like entering into a lighted room.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we are in a lighted room, we do not simply receive light, but we are in a realm of light.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whether or not the Bible is shining in our experience depends on our attitude and condition.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we are humble and ask the Lord for mercy, the Bible will be to us a book of light.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After reading a portion of the Word, you may not have much understanding, but you have the sense that you are in light.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This proves that the Bible is the divine Word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You do not have the sense that you are in light when you read a newspaper or magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But if you read the Word or pray-read some verses of the Scriptures with a sincere heart and in an attitude of humility, you will be conscious of having been brought into light.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Whenever we come to the Word in a proper way, we have the conviction that we have come into the light and are in a sphere of light.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then spontaneously we receive light, and we become people who are absolutely in light.</S>
