   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I can go on more along this line.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But I hope that the elders would have an impression that there are no lofty theories to the elders' management of the church; everything is a matter of practice.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the elders do not practice, there will not be much to do.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At most they will need to make some announcements of the regular meetings and to make some decisions regarding the direction of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be an elder in this way is too easy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is a waste to confer on such brothers the title of an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are too many practical things that the elders have to do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suppose the brothers and sisters in your church are cold and not at all zealous in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have to stir up something and start a fire.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you do this, right away you will see that there are many things to do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose again that there are over a hundred brothers and sisters in your locality, but few read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many brothers and sisters do not have the habit of reading the Bible; they do not have the interest in reading the Bible, nor do they receive any light in reading it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What should you do?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The elders have to come together and spend a few hours prostrating themselves before the Lord, asking for the Lord's mercy to open up His Word to them and to give the brothers and sisters a desire to love, enjoy, and crave for the Lord's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you do this, you will see that the elders have a lot to do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They will have to put in a lot of effort and energy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But I can tell the brothers and sisters that this is very worthwhile and valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is a glorious work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some people who manage their own homes raise three to five children.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The children grow from infancy to kindergarten age.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They go from kindergarten to elementary school, and from elementary school all the way to college.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the parents see this, they will be very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Dear brothers and sisters, imagine how many children there are in God's house!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This managing, shepherding, and teaching responsibility is now commissioned to you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What a glorious work this is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever you see the children of God growing and living before the Lord, how sweet your heart will feel!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No wonder the apostle Paul said: "For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Are not even you, before our Lord Jesus at His coming?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For you are our glory and joy" 1 Thes 2:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The apostle Peter also said: "And when the Chief Shepherd is manifested, you the elders serving as the shepherds will receive the unfading crown of glory" 1 Pet 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What a glorious work this is!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brothers, the way to manage a church is here.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not expect lofty words and profound wisdom or grand theories.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am here only giving you some basic points, hoping that something better will come out from you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the brothers would take this little bit of help, they will discover many riches when they put it into practice, and they will learn many practical lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After you learn the lesson and have some practical experience, you will not only be able to give the brothers and sisters some practical supply, but you will have the power of discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I do hope that the brothers would take this little advice and take this way to manage the church in the days ahead throughout all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I know that the church needs this kind of managing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Where there is such managing, there the church will be on the right track, and there the church will be built up and will be able to meet God's genuine needs in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Dear brothers and sisters, the way to build up the church is here.</S>
