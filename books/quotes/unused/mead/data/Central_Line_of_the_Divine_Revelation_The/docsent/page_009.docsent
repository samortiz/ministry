   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation THE DIVINE ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE DIVINE DISPENSING MESSAGE TWO GOD 2 Scripture Reading: Gen 1:1, 26; 2:4; Exo 3:14-15; Gen 15:2, 8; Matt 1:1, 16, 18, 20-23; Acts 2:36; 10:36; John 7:38-39; Rev 22:17; Matt 28:19; Rev 1:4, 8; 11:15; 20:6</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message, we come to the hardest point in the Bible the person of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In a sense, it is not very difficult to know the names of God, the titles of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These titles are not only revealed but also printed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But many Christians are ignorant concerning God's person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the previous message, we pointed out that the entire Scripture is the revelation of God as the unique Deity, mainly in His divine titles and His divine person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By God's titles and His person we know that He is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first time the Bible mentions God is in Genesis 1:1, which says, "In the beginning God created...."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word for God here in Hebrew is Elohim.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Elohim is a compound word, and it is a uni-plural noun.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Genesis 1:26 God speaks of Himself in the plural by saying, "Let us make man in our image."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God said, "Let Us," not "Let Me."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Us and our are plural.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is one and also plural.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The plurality of the word Elohim implies the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Genesis 1:26a, 3:22a, and 11:7a all mention God, using the plural pronouns us and our.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Isaiah 6:8 God said, "Whom shall I send?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Who will go for us?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I is singular, but us is plural, showing that God is uni-plural.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed to the Father, "That they may be one, even as We are one" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>22b, 11b .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He also prayed, "That they also may be in Us" v. 21 . God the Father and God the Son are "Us"; They are plural, yet They are one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the past we wrote some helpful small booklets on the Divine Trinity which I would suggest for your reading.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These are The Revelation of the Triune God according to the Pure Word of the Bible; What a Heresy: Two Divine Fathers, Two Life-giving Spirits, and Three Gods!; and The Biblical Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The truth in these booklets can be a great help to us in seeing the scriptural revelation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now we want to see something concerning the person of God.</S>
