   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When I was saved, all the pastors and ministers were happy to use the word denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then the Lord raised us up to condemn the denominations, and the pastors and ministers stopped using this term.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although they no longer used the term denomination, they still held on to the different names.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do you realize that every name is a division?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every denomination, every naming, is a division.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do not say that our name is "the local church."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not have a name.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The moon, for example, has no name; it is just the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should simply call the moon "moon."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some people have said that the American moon is brighter than the Chinese moon.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But there is no such thing as an American moon or a Chinese moon.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The most you can say is the moon in America or the moon in China.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is one moon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is only the one moon.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Likewise, the church is simply the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The term "local church" is not our name; it is the designation of our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are not the divisive and divided so-called churches; we are the church in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus the term "local church" denotes our nature; it is not our name.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not consider "the local church" as a name.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The most we can say is the church in a certain locality, such as the church in Los Angeles, the church in Anaheim, etc.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no king in a family.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The head of the family is not a king.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When you differ in your opinion or expression, you still do not have a king.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When you divide the land, there probably is still no king.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, once you become denominated and become a nation, you acquire a king and you are divided immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Originally, unity was based upon one God and one goal and division was caused by many different worships, even worships of different objects with different interests and purposes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually families were formed, language was expressed, the land was divided into territories, and the nations, or we may say the denominations, were formed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The result was division.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you look into the history of Christianity, you will see that it was divided in precisely this way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>During the 1930's I spoke a great deal on this matter of denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One day, upon returning to my hometown after a period of absence, some friends invited me to feast with a number of older Christian leaders who knew me quite well.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I went there, I discovered that I, a man of a little over thirty years of age, was surrounded by a group of old men, each one being more than sixty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One of them, taking the lead to speak to me, said, "Mr. Lee, in the past years in your preaching you have condemned the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We wish to ask you why, since you have been preaching against the denominations, you yourself have formed another denomination?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They thought that they had already defeated me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I replied, "I am glad to be here with you all, for this is the best time for me to clear up this whole matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Apostle Paul rebuked the Corinthians for saying, 'I am of Apollos,' 'I am of Paul,' and 'I am of Cephas.'</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some even said, 'I am of Christ.'</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Apostle Paul rebuked all of those divisive persons at Corinth 1 Cor 1:11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You all say that you are either Baptist, Presbyterian, or the Chinese Independent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Tell me from your sincere heart, if the Apostle Paul were here, would you be approved by the Apostle Paul?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They said, "No. Of course, Paul would never approve us." They were honest.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They had to be honest because I had pinned them down already.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then I continued, "Since you agree that it is not right to say, 'I am Baptist' or 'I am Presbyterian,' then where do you put me?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Will you put me in your Presbyterian denomination, or in your Baptist or Chinese Independent?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They said, "We don't put you anywhere."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then I said, "But you have to put me somewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Shouldn't I stay somewhere?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They were shocked.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then I proceeded, "By the Lord's mercy and grace, I surely love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since I love Him, I must preach the gospel to the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many have been saved through my preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Where shall I put them?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To which denomination shall I send them to the Baptist, Presbyterian, the Chinese Independent?"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They had nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then I said, "Do you see the situation?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now do you see why on the one hand I preach against divisions and why on the other hand, it seems to you that I form another division?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to come together.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are not one with you because you force us into not being one with you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now if you promise me that from tomorrow you will take down all of your signs and forget about all your different names, then I promise you that I will have fellowship with all the brothers tonight and that we will close our meeting hall immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then we can come together as one church in this city.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How about this?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At this point, they said, "No, we can't do this."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I concluded, "Since you will not do this, then who is responsible for the divisions?"</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After that night until the day I left mainland China, none of them bothered me again.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They had lost the case in the heavenly court.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They wanted to keep their divisive, denominational names.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Some wanted to say, "We are the Chinese Independent.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Nothing is better than this."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Others would say, "We are third generation Presbyterians.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>How can we renounce this name?"</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Still others wanted to say, "We are Baptists.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Baptists are much better than Presbyterians.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They only have sprinkling, which is not right, but we have immersion."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We are all familiar with this kind of fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When we came over to the island of Taiwan, the Lord blessed the work.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We increased in number from less than five hundred to more than twenty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>During a ten-day conference in Taipei in 1957, I gave at least thirty messages on the ground of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>After those ten days, all the elders felt that we should contact some of the leading free groups in the city of Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>There were at least two or three groups claiming to be nonsectarian or nondenominational, simply meeting in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>At first, we sent two or three elders to visit these groups to have a thorough talk with them regarding the unity among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then we invited each of the groups to send some of their leaders to meet with us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When we all came together, we said to them, "Brothers, perhaps you are thinking that since we are so great in number compared with you, we will maneuver the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We have a sincere heart in talking with you.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We mean business for the Lord's recovery and for the genuine unity of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We are willing to resign from the eldership and allow you brothers to be the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We are willing to put all the properties of all the meeting halls into your hands.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Furthermore, we are willing to hold a conference to tell all the saints to be one with you and to be submissive to you all.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We promise you this and we are even willing to put it in writing and sign it."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>They were pinned down immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Then they said, "Brothers, we appreciate your sincerity, but we still want to be by ourselves."</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The leaders of each group said the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We learned from this that they did not want to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Why were they unwilling to be one?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Because they enjoyed having their own little empires, their own little nations.</S>
