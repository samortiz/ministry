<h2 class="head1">BUILDING IN RELATION TO GOD&rsquo;S BLESSING</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s presence and His blessing are related to the building. The church must be built up for the spread of the gospel and for the edification of the believers. When we are built together, it will be easy to spread the gospel, and people will be edified when they come into our midst.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost Peter and over one hundred twenty brothers and sisters were gained as materials through Christ&rsquo;s death (Acts 1:14-15), as typified by the spoil gained by David in the battle. Furthermore, Peter and the disciples were built up in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, as typified by the temple built by King Solomon. They were built by God in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection through the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the people who saw the building among the disciples on the day of Pentecost repented and turned to God. The disciples did not advertise prior to their gospel preaching, as Christianity does today. People repented because they sensed God&rsquo;s presence when they came into the midst of the disciples. People were not only saved and edified but also built up because of the disciples (2:37-47).</p>
<p>Where is the spiritual power among Christians today? Some Christians advertise to promote a gospel campaign, but how many are saved? Some Christians always have revival meetings, but how many are revived? This is not God&rsquo;s way. It is not the way for the gospel to be spread, nor is it the way to edify people. God&rsquo;s way is to preach the gospel and edify people through the built-up church. When the church is built up, it will be easy for us to spread the gospel and easy for people to be edified when they come into our midst.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BREAKING ISSUING IN JOINING AND KNITTING<br />
AND PRODUCING THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>The practical way to build the church is for all the saints to be fitly joined and firmly knit together. But this is not easy. As saved persons, we have God&rsquo;s life, and the Holy Spirit lives in us. Moreover, His constraining love has given us a desire to serve Him and to live for Him, and the supply of grace has given us a desire to serve in the church. However, we have discovered that our outer man is still a problem; our opinions frustrate our coordination in the service. This is our common problem.</p>
<p>With such a problem, how can God blend us and build us up together practically? We should not think that we can have the building simply by putting a few brothers together. Nor should we think that one accord can be achieved through discussions and negotiations or by adjusting the opinions of the saints. Discussions only issue in more opinions. Hence, such meetings cannot solve our problems, nor can they issue in the genuine building up.</p>
<p>A person who desires to be built up must be willing to accept the breaking. To be broken means to no longer be whole. This is the basic requirement for the building up. If we are not willing to be broken but remain whole, we cannot be built up. In order for a tree to become part of a house, it must be broken; it cannot keep its original appearance. Some pieces of wood will be made into boards with sockets, and other pieces will be made into boards with tenons. The tenons need to be inserted into the sockets in order to be connected together. Some pieces of wood are too thick and need to be trimmed, and other pieces are too long and need to be cut. If a piece of wood were to say, &ldquo;You can use me but do not trim me; I want to keep my appearance,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am large and complete; it would be a pity to make me shorter,&rdquo; how could a house be built? There is no way to have the building up if we insist on remaining whole and are unwilling to be broken. In order to be built, we need to be broken. This is the requirement for building. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace we must learn to accept the breaking; otherwise, we have no way to be built.</p>
<p>Euodias and Syntyche were two sisters in the church in Philippi who loved the Lord and labored in the gospel with the apostle Paul, but both were in dissension, not thinking the same thing in the Lord (Phil. 4:2). The saints in the church in Philippi probably did not know how to solve this problem, so the apostle exhorted the brothers, &ldquo;I ask you also, genuine yokefellow, assist them&rdquo; (v. 3). These two sisters loved the Lord and zealously preached the gospel, but they did not think the same thing. In the church it is inevitable to have brothers and sisters like Euodias and Syntyche; they love the Lord and zealously serve Him but are in dissension. If the saints neglect such a situation, the dissenting ones will not have proper coordination, and the church will not be built up.</p>
<p>Opinions are the main cause of dissension among serving ones who love the Lord. Their opinions may be spiritual, good, and out of their love for the Lord, but opinions are nevertheless opinions. For example, a &ldquo;Euodias&rdquo; may say, &ldquo;The messages given in the meetings should be simple,&rdquo; but a &ldquo;Syntyche&rdquo; may say, &ldquo;The messages should have many details so that people can understand.&rdquo; A &ldquo;Euodias&rdquo; may say, &ldquo;Thursday night is not suitable for the Bible-reading meeting,&rdquo; but a &ldquo;Syntyche&rdquo; may say, &ldquo;Thursday night is the best time for a Bible-reading meeting; it is not suitable for any other meeting.&rdquo; If the elders decide to have a Bible-reading meeting on Thursday night, &ldquo;Euodias&rdquo; should not say anything. When it is time to arrange the chairs for the Bible-reading meeting, a &ldquo;Euodias&rdquo; may suggest that the chairs should face the same direction, but a &ldquo;Syntyche&rdquo; may say that the chairs should face the center. This may cause an argument. A person who is not broken always has an opinion regardless of the time or occasion. Without breaking, there is no building. Hence, either &ldquo;Euodias&rdquo; or &ldquo;Syntyche&rdquo; should be the first to be broken and not insist on her opinion but fully accept the fellowship from the brothers. This should not be a grudging acceptance but a willing and cheerful submission, which issues from being broken.</p>
<p>If three responsible brothers insist on their opinion and are not willing to submit to one another regarding the time for a meeting, no building up will be manifested among them. One person must be the first to submit and be broken. If a brother is broken, he will not insist on the time that he suggested, even if it is the most appropriate time. As a result, the meeting might be held at an inappropriate time, but there will be an atmosphere of building up. If we are willing to take the lead to submit, to accept the breaking, the saints whom we coordinate with will follow and also be willing to be broken. If we are commissioned by the Lord to go to a place for the work, we should not advertise the work. Instead of making a show of ourselves, we should attend the meetings, pray in the prayer meeting, and praise in the bread-breaking meeting. After the meeting we can fellowship with the saints who are open or seek an opportunity to fellowship with them. If we have been broken and have learned lessons of life, the saints will realize that our prayers are weighty, and they will receive the life supply when they contact us. Then they will be willing to receive the help. As a result, the work will spontaneously be carried out. This work will cause the church to be built up.</p>
<p>However, if we arrive in a place and announce that we are there for the work, the saints will not taste the building. A person who has been broken and built would never serve in this way. On the one hand, we are laboring, but on the other hand, we are not laboring. We are there to offer our portion spontaneously. The work should still be carried out by the local brothers, and they should still bear the responsibility. However, after a period of time the messages that they give will be our messages, and the brothers will receive the help in administrating the church. If we have been broken, we can accommodate others and supply them. We should not change their way of doing things or their arrangement. Nothing in a locality should change when we arrive. From this perspective it seems that we are not laboring. However, the church will be influenced and receive the help from us, and the saints will be coordinated and built up. Hence, we have done a great work.</p>
<p>All the responsible brothers should also serve according to this principle. We should learn to be responsible and yet not be responsible. This does not mean that we should be irresponsible but that we should learn to be broken. If our service bears the flavor of our being the most responsible ones and of the saints needing to submit to our authority, we will tear down the work. We cannot be so responsible that we take away the function of the saints. This is a tearing down, not a building up. We should let the saints function according to their portion, and instead of correcting the responsible ones, we should encourage them to coordinate. We should say Amen when they function. This is building.</p>
<p>A person who is built up is a broken person and is subdued when he serves with others. It does not matter whether he is a responsible one in a district or in a group. He simply knows that he is serving together with the other brothers and must be built with them. If he has learned the spiritual lessons, he will grasp the opportunity to supply them when they coordinate in a harmonious and cordial atmosphere. He will not have the flavor of correcting others, but he will follow the leading of the Spirit to supply them with the divine life in a harmonious atmosphere. If we have a spiritual supply, we can always supply others regardless of the place. As long as we have a spiritual supply, the saints will be built up. This is the way to bear responsibility.</p>
<p>Hence, in order to coordinate with others, we must first be broken. If we are broken and have learned genuine spiritual lessons, we can lead the brothers into genuine fellowship with the Lord. Furthermore, in such an atmosphere of harmony and oneness, people will sense that God is among us. However, if we think that we have special authority as a responsible one, the church will be finished, and there will not be any building. If we are a broken person, when the brothers want to preach the gospel, instead of adjusting them, we will agree and be built up with them. This is the way for the church to be blessed.</p>
<p>Whether a person&rsquo;s idea is good or bad, we should be the first to submit. As long as the saints do not lead people to worship idols, we should follow their proposals. We must learn not to insist on our ideas and not to remain whole. I thank the Lord when the brothers want to shape me into a board with a tenon, and I also thank Him when they want to carve me into a board with a socket. I am willing to be made shorter, and I am also willing to be trimmed. Every situation is acceptable to me. This is the way to be built with others.</p>
<p>Those who want to preserve their greatness will eventually become the smallest. Those who always argue with others about being right or wrong or about their opinions will not have God&rsquo;s presence. This is because those who desire to remain whole by insisting on their opinions damage the building and destroy the spirit of oneness. The Lord&rsquo;s presence will be with us if we are always willing to accept others&rsquo; proposals and are open to be built up with them.</p>
<p>We need to see that being built up with others and coordinating together are the most precious things to the Lord. It does not matter whether our method is right or wrong or good or bad. What matters is the spirit of oneness, the spirit of harmony. All the blessings depend upon the atmosphere of building. Hence, the apostle Paul says that we should think the same thing, have the same love, and speak the same thing (Phil. 2:2; 1 Cor. 1:10; Rom. 12:16). In order to speak the same thing, we need to be broken. As serving ones, we need to learn to be built up with others. Then others will want to be built up with us.</p>
