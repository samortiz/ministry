   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Finally, let us sing a hymn concerning the experience of resurrection:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Life out of death dear Master, is it spoken</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Of the life here, or in the better land?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nay, wherefore wait?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The vessel marred and broken,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Shall now be moulded by the Potter's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Life out of death oh, wondrous resurrection!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Seed sown in conscious weakness, raised in power;</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thy life lived out in days of toil and friction,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"Not I, but Christ" in me from hour to hour.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Life out of death a pilgrim path and lonely,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Trodden by those who glory in the Cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They live in fellowship with "Jesus only,"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And for His sake count earthly gain but loss.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Life out of death blest mission to be ever</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Bearing the living water brimming o'er.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With life abundant from the clear, pure river,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Telling that thirsty souls need thirst no more.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first stanza is a question.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Is this life out of death something of today, or does one have to wait for the future?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Based on what the writer learned and experienced, he answered: "Nay, wherefore wait?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The vessel.../Shall now be moulded by the Potter's hand."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a reference to the words of Jeremiah 18:4.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The vessel was marred already.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the potter used the same clay to make another one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is life out of death; this is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The emphasis is "here"; it is not the future or tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Stanza two tells us how wonderful this resurrection is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Seed sown in conscious weakness, raised in power."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is according to 1 Corinthians 15:43 which says, "It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The power of resurrection will be manifested in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On that day the body will be transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But even today this resurrection life will be the strength of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Thy life lived out in days of toil and friction."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many toils and sufferings are beyond what we can bear.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we tried to bear them, we would fail within a minute.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet His life has sustained us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Indeed, " Not I, but Christ' in me from hour to hour."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Stanza three includes the phrase "a pilgrim path and lonely."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Following this, it says, "Trodden by those who glory in the Cross./They live in fellowship with Jesus only.'"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is due to the fact that such a one has known the power of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The resurrection mentioned in Philippians 3 is mentioned here.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Stanza four brings in John 7.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the last day of the feast, our Lord stood up and cried with a loud voice, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This refers to the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The power of the Holy Spirit is the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those who have experienced the Lord's resurrection should also supply others with the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This resurrection life, this abundant life, will tell thirsty souls that they need thirst no more.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What a blessed commission!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we read this hymn a few more times, it will help us to understand what this life that comes out of death is, and what resurrection is.</S>
