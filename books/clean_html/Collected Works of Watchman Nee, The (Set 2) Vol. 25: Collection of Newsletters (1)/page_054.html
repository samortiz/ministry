<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Brother Witness Lee's Answering Letter</H2><P>Brother in the Lord, Hsien Hui:</P><P>I have read your letter. Thank the Lord; He really has worked in your heart! Yes, every brother or sister who is clear about the Lord's light and who wants to go the way of the Lord should leave the denominations in reality and in name. For this reason, everyone who wants to obey the Lord thoroughly should take his name off the denominational registers. Although this is but one of the thousands of things we must obey in the Bible, it is still something we must obey. We should be "faithful in the least" (Luke 16:10). Truly, we should "obey in God's light"! Truly, "obeying is the expression of loving the Lord."</P><P>Here are the answers to your questions:</P><P>(1) We should not "wait for awhile to obey" because there is no meeting in the Lord's name in the place we are. Our obeying the Lord should not be influenced by our environment. Truly, "once we are clear, we should obey." "Waiting for awhile to obey" is really "the entanglement of the enemy."</P><P>(2) Actually, going to the denominations to hear the Word does not benefit us much. (Your own experience is sufficient to prove this.) Since it does not help us, why waste the time? It would be better to follow the Lord's leading and go out at this time to preach the gospel. Once sinners believe in the Lord, you can lead them to walk in the way and meet together with you. You do not have to wait for many. You only need two or three people (Matt. 18:20).</P><P>Since we are clear that the Lord is going to tear down the denominations, it is best not to involve ourselves in any way. We must firmly maintain our position. If we are not separated, we do not have a testimony! The power of a testimony is separation. We should not be afraid of stumbling others in obeying the Lord. If we truly act according to the Lord's will and some are stumbled, we do not have to bear this responsibility before the Lord. When our Lord was on the earth, He never disobeyed God because He was worried about stumbling others. Therefore, He was "for the falling and rising up of many" (Luke 2:34). He is the faithful Rock. Yet He is also the "stone of stumbling" to those "who stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed" (1 Pet. 2:8). For this reason, when our Lord was on the earth, He received so much persecution that He became "a sign spoken against" (Luke 2:34). When we walk the Lord's way today, we shall also receive what the Lord received. If we give in a little, if we change it a little, if we move just a little, we will avoid much suffering. But, "let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach" (Heb. 13:13). Please sing Hymns #60, 33, and 131 in the Little Flock Hymnal.</P><P>When we obey the Lord in this way, we should pay attention to one matter of greatest importance: We should have a heart of love when we contact any brother or sister in the denominations. Our attitude should be meek, and our words should be polite. If we have the wrong attitude or if we say the wrong things and stumble them, we will be responsible for it before the Lord.</P><P>We are all very well here. If the Lord allows, I will go to Shanghai next week. (Parts omitted.) I pray for you. Peace be to you.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Witness Lee<br>April 28 in Chefoo</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BRIEF NEWS FROM VARIOUS LOCALITIES<br>(AS OF MAY 18, 1934)</H2><P>(1) We have heard that the two brothers who are imprisoned in Ching Chiang County will be released soon.</P><P>(2) Brother Witness Lee moved to Shanghai from Chefoo at the beginning of the month.</P><P>(3) Sister Yu Su Chen recently went to Yun Ts'ao, Wu Hu, and Hsun Cheng in Anhui province and preached the gospel. People were saved in each place, and the work in Wu Hu was even more blessed by God. Sister Miao Yun Chun has already gone from Ling Tzu to Tsinan. She has testified some to the nurses in Chi Lu Hospital. Later perhaps, she will go to Peking.</P><P>(4) The meeting in Hangchow has moved to a new address: 321 Tung Chieh Road.</P><P>(5) The meeting in Soochow is very peaceful now. Sisters Tso and Ku have decided to remain at the Gospel Hospital.</P><P>(Shanghai)</P>
