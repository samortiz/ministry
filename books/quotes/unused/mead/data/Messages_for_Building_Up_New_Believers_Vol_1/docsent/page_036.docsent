   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WHICH CHURCH TO JOIN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should join the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But there are so many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Which one should we join?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is true that some have heard the gospel through you; they may have been saved through you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But many sober-minded persons will not automatically accept your church just because you have introduced them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They will consider and want to know which church they should join out of the many.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. The Differences between the</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many Kinds of Churches</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The history of the church is very long; it spans over two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Different churches have been raised up at different times.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This results in differences based on time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Churches also have been raised up in different places.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This results in differences based on geography.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Churches also have been raised up through different servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This results in differences based on persons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here we see three differences based on time, place, and persons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because there are so many doctrines in the Bible, some have set up churches by emphasizing a particular kind of doctrine, while others have set up other churches by emphasizing other doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a result, different emphases on doctrines have created different churches as well.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a certain need arises in a certain place, certain individuals are raised up to emphasize certain teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As a result, a church is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The point of emphasis thus becomes the basis for forming churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The above factors have led to the formation of the many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How many different churches are there in the world today?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are over fifteen hundred different kinds of churches, and these are only the orthodox ones, the ones which are well established.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moreover, this number only reflects the number of different church systems; it does not take into account the various local congregations within each system.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we considered the Anglicans, Presbyterians, Methodists, and other well-established groups each as one church, there would be about fifteen hundred such churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brothers, when I put myself in your place, I can see why it is not an easy task to choose from among a list of fifteen hundred churches!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With so many churches and so much confusion, is there a right way we can take before the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thank God, there is a way!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God s Word is still with us, and we can read it and find out what God has to say.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thank God that the Bible has shown us which church we should join.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God has not left us in the dark.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>B. The Reasons for the Many Different Churches 1.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Different Places</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Let us study in detail the divisions of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some divisions have occurred because of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, the Anglican Church is actually the Church of England.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Anglican means that it came from England; in fact, it is the state church of England.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But when it spread from England to America, it became the Episcopal Church or the Church of England in America.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When it spread to China, it became the Church of England in China.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, when the Church of England in America spread to China, it became the Church of England in America in China.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Anglican Church first spread to America and then to China.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The result is the Chinese American Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What confusion this is!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Consider the example of the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Catholic Church is, in fact, the Church of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What has a Roman church got to do with us here?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is wrong for the Church in Rome to set up churches in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is a confusion of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What is the Anglican Church doing in America?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is the American Church doing in China?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What is the Roman church doing in Shanghai?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What is the Shanghai Church doing in Foochow?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every church that is founded upon a place eventually becomes a confusion.</S>
