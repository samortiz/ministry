<h1 class="title">HOW TO ADMINISTRATE THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:15-16</h1>
<p>Ephesians 4:15-16 shows how the Body of Christ is built up and how the co-workers and the elders work and administrate the church. The way indicated in Ephesians is clear and practical.</p>
<p>In a previous chapter we saw that Psalm 133 reveals oneness as the basic condition for us to receive blessing and life. Oneness brings in the blessing of life and the supply of the eternal life. We saw that the elders, deacons, and co-workers should know and hold the mystery of the faith and be able to speak it to others. This is how they shepherd the flock of God and teach the saints. To shepherd is to take care of people, to feed and supply them with life. To teach is to cultivate people to be full-grown and useful. We also saw that the elders in the various localities must learn to build every saint into the Body. The saints should be built into the Body according to their condition, not according to the expectations of the elders. The &ldquo;good&rdquo; saints are useful for the building, and the &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; saints are also useful. Everyone should be brought into the building. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we see this light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT ADMINISTRATING THE CHURCH<br />
IN A NATURAL WAY</h2>
<p>There is a stark difference between the revelation in the Bible and our past practices. Please forgive me for saying this: The elders often use natural methods to administrate and lead the churches. We have natural methods and the natural element. Most elders are in the natural man. Whether or not we are smart is of no value. The smarter a person is, the more stubborn and self-confident he is. It is easy for a brother to bring his intelligence into the church, because he thinks that he has a superior way of handling matters. To bring one&rsquo;s natural intelligence into the administration of the church is not only useless but also exceedingly harmful to the church. Our natural intelligence is a worm that gradually erodes the building of the church. Furthermore, our natural intelligence is a stronghold that can be broken only by the Lord&rsquo;s light. Therefore, we need to be subdued by the light of God.</p>
<p>We should be cautious in the appointment of elders in a local church. Most people think that a brother who loves and seeks the Lord and who is prominent and smart can be appointed as an elder. However, the foolish ones should not be elders, nor should the smart ones be elders. Foolish ones can do many foolish things, but smart ones can do things that damage the church. The foolish things that foolish ones do in the church are obvious, but the smart ones damage the church in a hidden way, because the things that they do are cloaked by their smartness. Our intelligence is of no use in the administration of the church. The church is built up not by intelligence but by the growth of the divine life. Being smart hinders the growth of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO USE ONLY SMART ONES BEING A NATURAL WAY</h2>
<p>In the administration of the church it is not right for the elders to hold everything in their hands and do everything themselves; they must trust others. The elders are overseers; hence, they should commit everything to others and ask others to do things. It is not easy for the smart elders to commit things to others. The smarter a person is, the less he is willing to trust others or to let others do things. When a smart person does things, he is confident in himself and therefore holds things in his hands, and according to his preference, he treasures those who also are smart. If an elder is smart, he will treasure smart materials; he will hunt for the smart ones in the church and commit things to these ones. Because smart people do things quickly, smart elders look for smart people to do things in a smart way. In the eyes of a smart elder, the people who are not smart are foolish. As a result, the smart ones will consider themselves to be superior to the other saints in the church. They may think that only the smart ones can administrate the church and be in charge of the church. Even though they may not say this aloud, they bear such an air and flavor.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, smart elders are not smart, but they think that they are smart. Such elders do not possess much wisdom; rather, they have a form of cleverness. There are not that many naturally wise or smart ones in the church, because God chose the foolish things of the world (1 Cor. 1:26-27). The elders should not blame the saints, nor should they blame God, saying, &ldquo;Why did You create so many foolish people? Why do You save so many foolish ones? There are many clever people in society, but very few are in the church. Lord, why did You not add more clever ones to the church?&rdquo; First Corinthians 1:26 says clearly that among those whom God saves, &ldquo;there are not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful,&rdquo; but He has chosen the foolish ones. An elder may say, &ldquo;Lord, You saved the foolish ones; how can I administrate the church?&rdquo; The Lord would answer, &ldquo;These are the ones who will enable you to grow in life. These are the ones who will allow you to lead them to grow in life. Do not think that you are clever; rather, come down from your throne of intelligence and be foolish instead! Only foolish ones can lead other foolish ones and grow together with other foolish ones. I want some foolish ones in the church to make you foolish so that you can grow.&rdquo; This is God&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p>The elders need to lead the church in a way that is different from the way people do things in society. The elders need to bring everyone into serving, to put everyone to use. In society the capable ones are valued and promoted, but the incapable ones are ignored and put aside. It is pitiful that such a worldly practice has been brought into many local churches.</p>
