   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Problem of Introspection in the Self</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A person with spiritual knowledge may be very introspective.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is more difficult for this kind of person to be delivered from the self than it is for others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such a person may be slow and cautious, and he looks at himself and analyzes himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some believers are at the opposite pole; they are careless.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>An introspective person, however, is very capable to take care of himself in the best way, but this is his problem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is hard for such a one to forget about himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He "sticks" to himself all the time and cannot get away from himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is hard for the Lord to work on such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For a person to overcare for himself is to always look at, think about, and consider himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not to care about his living, eating, and drinking; rather, it is to always consider whether he is proud or humble; whether he is really with the Lord; whether he is proper; or whether he has offended anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With such a one, ninety-nine percent of what he has may be his self, and one percent is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is mostly occupied with the self to care for the self.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this kind of person, many failures become his helpers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Failures make a person bankrupt in caring for his self.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many believers need to care for their character, but an introspective person should forget about his character.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more he builds up his character, the more he is in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This kind of character building simply helps him to analyze himself more.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Day by day he checks to see if he is genuine and real.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This becomes a very serious hindrance to his spiritual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, spiritual growth depends on the denial of the self, and the denial of the self simply means to forget about the self.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THREE ASPECTS OF THE WORK OF THE CROSS The Accomplished Fact of Our Crucifixion with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The cross refers to the blood of Christ and to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The blood is for cleansing, but the death is for dealing with negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are three aspects to the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first is the accomplished fact seen in Romans 6:6, which says that our old man has been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Galatians 2:20 also indicates that we are crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a fact accomplished by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To see the fact is the first aspect, or the first step, in the experience of Christ's work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Realization of the Accomplished Fact</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The second aspect of the work of the cross is the realization of the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord as our Savior died for us, and we died with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Along with His crucifixion for us was our crucifixion with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can see this in the type of Noah's ark.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The ark passed over the judgment of the flood with eight persons.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this way the ark suffered the judgment for the eight persons, but it also suffered the judgment with the eight persons because the eight persons were in the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the eight persons were not in the ark, how could the ark suffer the judgment for them?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The ark could suffer judgment only for the people who were in it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same way, the substitution of Christ's death for us depends on our identification with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If there is no identification, there is no substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ's death is for us because we are identified with Him and are in Him, and because we are in Him, we have died with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we receive the Lord Jesus as our Savior, we recognize that He died for us and also with us, and because He died with us, we died also.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, we hand ourselves over to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the meaning of Galatians 5:24, which says, "But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They who are of Christ Jesus recognize and realize the fact that they have died, so they put their flesh to death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With respect to the accomplished fact, we simply need to say, "I am crucified with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To realize, recognize, and admit what the Lord has accomplished is the second aspect, the second stage or step, of the experience of the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the experience spoken of in Romans 6.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the one hand, verse 6 tells us that we have been crucified with Christ, while on the other hand, verse 11 tells us to reckon that we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To reckon is to recognize a fact, just as we recognize that three plus two are five.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As we recognize that we have been crucified on the cross, we are released from the bondage and dominion of sin vv.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>18, 22 .</S>
