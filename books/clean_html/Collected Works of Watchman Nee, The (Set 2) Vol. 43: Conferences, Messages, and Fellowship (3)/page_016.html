<h1 class="series">SECTION SEVEN<br />FELLOWSHIP WITH CO-WORKERS<br />IN SHANGHAI, JUNE 1937</h1><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">THE EXPRESSION AND PRACTICE<br />OF THE TESTIMONY<br />OF THE LOCAL CHURCH</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: June 20, 1937, Lord's Day, 9:30 a.m.<br />Place: Shanghai<br />Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:18; 18:17</h1><p>Tonight I am going to talk a little about the expression and practice of the local church and also the relationship between the workers and the church. For those who have been attending our meetings regularly, we would like to explain the reason for having meetings like ours. In other words, I am going to speak about the outward expression and practice of the church, not about its content.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXPRESSION OF THE PROPER TESTIMONY<br />OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>What kind of expression should the testimony of the church have in order for it to be scriptural? Suppose we have the best kind of tea, but we have no cup. Without a cup this wonderful tea could not get into us. Christ is the living water. He can forever quench man's thirst. But without a "cup," man cannot receive anything. If we have a cup that is dirty, we still have a problem. If we drink from the cup, we take in all sorts of things other than the water, and the taste of the living water will be gone. Consider the famine in Szechuan province; there is a shortage of rice and grain. It would be very unkind for a person to sell bowls there. However, if there is rice, there is the need for the proper supply of bowls. Christ is the "rice" and the church is the "bowl." Man receives Christ through the church. The problem today is not with the rice but with the bowl. Christ is not the problem; the problem is with the church.</p><p>Along with its outward expression, we must also pay attention to the practice of the church. The work of the cross deals with the flesh. But man's ways often activate the flesh in the work of God. We may think that mistakes in our living offend the Lord, but we may never realize that applying the flesh to the work is also an offense to God (Ezek. 44:17-18). Man assumes that he has the power and wisdom to complement God's work. Today a few men gather together, pray a little, and then start a meeting or an organization. This kind of beginning can never be of the Spirit. There is no doubt that the Spirit wants to accomplish something today, but the Spirit does not work independently. Rather, He works through man. If a man is fleshly, the Spirit cannot work in him. Without the Spirit, everything is dead, even if it is scriptural. God's work is a matter of man cooperating and coordinating with the Spirit; it is neither a case of the Spirit working alone nor of man working alone.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>The church of Christ has two aspects. The first aspect, the universal aspect, is spoken of in Matthew 16. The universal church includes all the believers both past and present. There is only one such church, and we cannot add another to it. The universal church is unique. The second aspect, the local aspect, is spoken of in Matthew 18. The local church includes all the local believers at a certain time and in a certain place. It is limited to time and place. It can be counted. This is why we see expressions in the Bible such as the "church" (Acts 9:31), the "seven churches" (Rev. 1:4), and the "churches" (1 Cor. 11:16; 14:33).</p><p>There is no difference in content between the universal church and the local church, except that the local church is a miniature of the universal church. Paul said that the Corinthian believers were the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:27). This means that the local church represents the Body of Christ. The local church should represent the universal church. The universal church does not have any problems, and it will never have any problems. The universal church is above all failure. No one can ever cause the universal church to have spots or wrinkles. Even the gates of Hades cannot prevail against it. However, the local church is in the hands of man, and there is the possibility of failure. Throughout the two thousand years of the history of the local churches, there have been numerous mistakes and failures.</p>
