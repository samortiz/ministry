The messages have been previously translated into English and published as The Normal Christian Worker. These messages, however, have been newly translated and entitled The Character of the Lord's Worker, conforming to the original Chinese title. The book covers ten character traits that are crucial to the usefulness of a Christian worker in the Master's hand. The messages were given by Watchman Nee in 1948 during a training for the edification of his co-workers. The intimate and uninhibited nature of the messages derives from the willingness of the trainees to give Watchman Nee the freedom to speak and to rebuke. As such, the subjects touch the very core of a worker's being.</P></td></tr></table></div>
