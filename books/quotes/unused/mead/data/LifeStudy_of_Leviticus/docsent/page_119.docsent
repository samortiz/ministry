   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE THIRTY-SIX DISCERNMENT IN DIET Scripture Reading: Lev 11:1-24a, 26-27a, 29-31a, 41-44; Acts 10:9b-14, 27-29</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Leviticus may be divided into two main sections.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first section, comprising chapters one through ten, covers the offerings and the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second section, comprising chapters eleven through twenty-seven, covers the holy living of God's holy people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After God speaks in the first section concerning the offerings and the priesthood, He speaks in the second section concerning His people in their entirety.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The priests are not the only ones who should have a holy life and a holy living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The people of God, among whom the priests serve, should also be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Leviticus is a book of types, a book of typology.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the first seven chapters we have the different kinds of offerings, all of which are types.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The priesthood in chapters eight through ten should also be considered a type.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, all the matters in chapters eleven through twenty-seven concerning the holy living of God's holy people should also be regarded as types.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These chapters cover the living of the Israelites, God's people in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, if we have the proper understanding of the types, we shall realize that all the types in these chapters are types of the living of the New Testament believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because Leviticus is a book of types, there is the need for it to be expounded.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without the proper expounding, it is difficult for anyone to know this book.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, some have claimed that there is no need for the exposition of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to their concept, if we do not understand a certain portion of the Word the first time we read it, we should read it again and again until we do understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, this is not true of a book like Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I assure you, even if you were to read Leviticus hundreds of times, you would still be unable to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are to know this book, it must be opened to us through the proper expounding.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The book of Leviticus has been opened by God's people collectively.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It has been opened by God's people for God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This opening began with the Apostle Paul, who expounded Leviticus while writing the Epistle to the Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Peter also received some understanding of Leviticus through the vision given to him in Acts 10.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The vision of a "certain vessel like a great sheet" v. 11 in which were all kinds of animals was a fulfillment of Leviticus 11.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Acts 10, therefore, is an exposition of Leviticus 11.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From this we see that the expounding of the book of Leviticus began with the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This expounding has continued throughout the centuries, and now we are standing on the shoulders of the expositors who have preceded us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In particular, we are indebted to the Brethren, who were raised up by the Lord in England a century and a half ago.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After I was saved, I was with the Brethren for seven and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During those years, I learned much from them concerning typology and prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Brethren teachers had a lot to say about the animals in Leviticus 11.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without the help I received from the Brethren, I could not understand what is covered in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just as I am standing on the shoulders of the Brethren, you are standing on my shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I hope that in the years to come you who are standing on my shoulders will see more than I have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since the book of Leviticus is written fully in types, certain points are very difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One extremely difficult point is found in 11:3a, which speaks of whatever "divides the hoof and is cloven-footed."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here we have two matters: dividing the hoof and being cloven-footed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 7 we are told that the pig divides the hoof and is cloven-footed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What is the difference between these two things?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Chinese version of the Bible makes dividing the hoof and being cloven-footed into one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In other words, the scholars who prepared that translation thought that to divide the hoof was to be cloven-footed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The difference between dividing the hoof and being cloven-footed requires further study.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The title of this message is "Discernment in Diet."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Discernment in diet is a matter of discernment in food-stuffs, of discernment in what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eating is not a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why, then, must we take care of our eating if we are to live a holy life?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to answer this question, we need to remember that Leviticus is a book of types, and in types there are figures which bear a particular significance.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The significance is different from the thing itself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is true of the animals mentioned in Leviticus 11.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All these animals bear a great significance, for they typify persons; they are figures that describe different kinds of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is proved by Acts 10:9b-14, 27-29.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Peter "beheld heaven opened, and a certain vessel like a great sheet descending, being let down by four corners onto the earth, in which were all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of the heaven" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At first, Peter did not understand that these animals, reptiles, and birds were figures of people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Eventually he came to understand this, for in the house of Cornelius there were people, not beasts vv.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>27-28 .</S>
