<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God the Spirit Entering into the Believers<br>That They May Be Mingled with the Triune God<br>for Their Transformation</H2><P>We need to realize that every day and all the time, the three divine persons as the Divine Trinity are right within us. This is why we Christians are very different from all the people of the world: we have the Triune God within us. Outwardly speaking, we are the same as they are, but inwardly, we have the Triune God, and they do not.</P><P>This Triune God is working within us to transform us. Transformation is not merely a change in form. It is to impart some element into our being. This divine element changes us metabolically. It is not like putting cosmetics on our faces, which adds no element into us. Rather, it is a work in which some element is added into us. Every day and every hour, God is adding Himself as an element into us. This element is transforming us metabolically; something old is being discharged, and something new is being imparted. This is not just an outward change, but a transformation from within.</P><P>The dispensing of the Triune God has only one goal, which is to transform us, to change us metabolically with His divine element. In this way we have not only the human element, but the divine element as well. We are now a God-man, a person with both humanity and divinity, both the human nature and the divine nature. We are divinely human. A turtle can never become one with a human being; neither can the angels become one with man. But God has become one with us. Hallelujah, we are not "turtlely human" or "angelically human"; we are divinely human! We need to be bold to tell every creature that we are divinely human.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY<br>IN TRANSFORMING THE BELIEVERS INTO<br>PRECIOUS MATERIALS FOR THE DIVINE BUILDING</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Through the Growth in Life of the Believers<br>as the Materials for the Divine Building</H2><P>Through the growth in life, the believers become the materials for the divine building (1 Cor. 3:6-7). First Corinthians 3 tells us that we are God's plants. God has planted us on His farm (v. 9). Every plant needs growth. Within us, God is giving us the growth in life every day.</P>
