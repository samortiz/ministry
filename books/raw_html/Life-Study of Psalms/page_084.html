<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Declaring the Father's Name to His Brothers and Praising the Father in the Church</H2><P>In resurrection Christ declared the Father's name to His brothers and praised the Father in the church. His resurrection is the church-producing resurrection. Hebrews 2:11-12 says, "For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers, saying, `I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.'" He who sanctifies is Christ, and those who are being sanctified are we believers. We are both of One, that is, out of one Father. Hebrews 2:12 is a quotation of Psalm 22:22.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. His Church Ushering In His Kingdom<br>for Him to Rule over the Nations</H2><P>Christ's church ushers in His kingdom for Him to rule over the nations. Psalm 22:27-28 says, "All the ends of the earth/Will remember and return to Jehovah,/And all families of the nations/Will worship before You;/For the kingdom is Jehovah's,/And He rules among the nations." Christ has the kingdom, and He will rule among the nations.</P><P>The church ushers in the kingdom. Actually, the church is the reality of the kingdom and a precursor of the manifestation of the kingdom. Today the church is the kingdom. Romans 14:17 says the church life is the kingdom life, the kingdom of God. But this is a precursor of the coming kingdom, just as the tabernacle was a precursor of the temple. Today's church life is a miniature, a precursor, of the coming kingdom of one thousand years. The church is produced by the resurrection of Christ, and the kingdom will be ushered in by the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Following Christ's Praise to God in the Church,<br>David Advising God's People to Praise Jehovah<br>and All the Earth to Worship Him</H2><P>Following Christ's praise to God in the church, David advised God's people to praise Jehovah and all the earth to worship Him (Psa. 22:23-26, 29-31). Psalm 22:23 says, "You who fear Jehovah, praise Him!/All you seed of Jacob, glorify Him!/And stand in awe of Him, all you seed of Israel!" This means that Christ advised the Jews to learn of the church. Christ took the lead in praising God in the church, and the church follows Him to praise God. Now the seed of Jacob should follow Christ and the church. Thus far, Israel has not followed, but when Jesus comes back, all Israel will repent and be saved (Rom. 11:26-27; Zech. 12:10). Then they will join us to praise God. In David's advice at the end of Psalm 22, we see the church as the kingdom and all the people worshipping God and praising the Father.</P>
