What can be crueler than Sheol? A person may be the most lovable one, the most adorable one, or the most precious one, but when Sheol comes to claim a sinner, it will not care if such a one is lovable or adorable. No tears, sorrow, or pleading can move its heart. It does not know mercy and compassion. It has no sympathy or feeling. It is cruel. "Since I have consecrated myself to You as a chaste virgin, if You see anything in me that stirs up Your jealousy, You will surely deal with it at all cost until You completely prevail. There may be loving friends, close relatives, or dear lovers begging, pleading, and weeping, but You do not care for any of these things; You only care for Your own feeling. But this is the only way that I will be preserved."</P><P>"The coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame." Jehovah is a fire (Heb. 12:29). His love and jealousy are also like fire which burns up everything that can be burned. Everything that is not eternal, that can pass away, that is of the world, and that is of man will be burned away.</P><P>Verse 7 says, "Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned." "Many waters" signify trials that believers go through. "Floods" signify persecutions from the enemy. His love and the fire of His love will not be quenched by trials. His love and the fire of His love cannot be drowned by persecutions. If He loves us, no trial or persecution can do anything to us.</P><P>This love cannot be bought with money. In other words, it is irreplaceable. We cannot replace this love with the tongues of men and angels. We cannot replace this love with the gift of prophecy, the knowledge of mysteries, all knowledge, or all faith. Even if we doled out all our possessions to feed others and delivered up our body so that we might boast, we would still be despised. These things are merely part of the treasures of a man's house. Trying to exchange love for these things will result in being despised. Since this is the case, we will not earn His love with more work, busy times, or toiling services. We can only offer ourselves to Him so that we will become the object of His love.</P><P>Verse 8 says, "We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?" A person who lives in the Lord's love cannot forget that there are others who should have the Lord's love also. Before she goes away to see the Lord, she remembers those who are less mature. She speaks of her little sister, who has life, but whose faith and love have not grown to the point where she can develop an affection for the Lord. The maiden's union with the Lord is already complete. Therefore, she can freely express all of her feelings before the Lord.</P><P>"What shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?" The little sister does not yet know what a life of love is all about. But when the eternal Lover leads her into a fellowship of love through the Holy Spirit, what will we do with her? As far as her life is concerned, she is a little sister. As far as her life of love is concerned, her two breasts have not developed. We are concerned for this group of people and are burdened to care for them. The Lord will not be satisfied with their condition. A marriage proposal is indispensable in a believer's life. Although every believer has full liberty to accept or reject, the Lord's demand for love is the same. How should we help this little sister of ours?</P><P>The maiden brings up those whom she has always cared for and who are younger than she is; she brings them up before the Lord to discuss them with Him. Because she is living so much in the Lord's will, she can say, "We have..." She knows that her concern is the Lord's concern. Therefore, she says, "We." She knows that what she wants is also what the Lord wants. Therefore, she says, "We." The union is complete; there is no more separation. Hence, prayers are no longer requests, but a speaking forth of God's will.</P><P>Verse 9 says, "If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar." "If she be a wall." If there is anything that is of God, which causes her to build a separation between herself and that which is not of God, like a wall, then "we will build upon her a palace of silver." We will build upon her everything that is high and noble that comes from redemption. If she has established a life of separation through the Holy Spirit, we will build upon her the fruit of redemption. If she is a door, others will enter into God's knowledge through her. "We will inclose her with boards of cedar." We will add Christ's heavenly humanity to her. (Wood signifies humanity, whereas cedar is tall. Hence cedar wood signifies Christ's heavenly humanity, His glorified humanity, and His heavenly human life.) She no longer does the things that she wants to do; she does them together with the Lord. Although the words are out of her mouth, they represent the Lord's mind.</P><P>Verse 10 says, "I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favor." "I am a wall." I am already a separated person; the Lord has separated me from everything unclean, common, and ordinary. "My breasts like towers." My faith and love are based on my separation from the world. The Lord has established me, and my two breasts are no longer undeveloped; they are like towers. I have come to the point where I am a person who has obtained peace in His eyes ("found favor" can be translated "found peace"). This means that I can be at rest. Hence, a life of peace is based on a life of separation, which is based on the development of faith and love. She gives a short testimony and shows that there is no thought of self-contentment. She can say that she is a wall, and she can say that her two breasts are towers, but in the Lord's eyes, she considers herself as one who has obtained peace.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 23: The Song of Songs & Hymns &nbsp; pg 41</div><br></body></html>
