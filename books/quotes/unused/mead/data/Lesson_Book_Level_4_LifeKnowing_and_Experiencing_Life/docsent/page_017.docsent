   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to ask ourselves first, what is the experience of life?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have seen that life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God Himself flowing into us, being received and experienced by us, is life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>An experience which results from God passing through man and man passing through Him is considered an experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example: in our prayer we meet God, become enlightened, see our own fault, and deal with it before God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not that we detect our own fault, but rather, when we draw near to God, we are inwardly met by God, and thereby we see our own fault.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is light; hence when we meet Him, we see our fault in His light.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We naturally confess to God and ask for the cleansing of the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a consequence, God passes through us, and we also pass through God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such experience causes us to experience God; therefore, it is the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All experiences of life are from God and are His working within us; therefore they can cause us to touch God and experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, any such experience of God will show forth life Phil 2:13-16 .</S>
