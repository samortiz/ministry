   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO PRAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not only in preaching the gospel but in everything else as well, we have no way but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may never have learned how to pray, but because we do know how to walk in Christ, we shall find that spontaneously, throughout the day, we are praying.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is our way to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because we are one with Him, we walk in Him and find ourselves praying.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE WAY TO BE HUMBLE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Learning how to be humble avails nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Any humility you learn becomes your pride.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may think you are the most humble one in your family, that all your brothers and sisters are proud and stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This humility that you have developed is pride.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The name for the proper humility is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you walk in Christ day after day, you will be humble without any consciousness of it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By walking in Him, He will become your humility, though you will not be aware of it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE WAY TO LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just as you should not try to be humble, so there is no point in your trying to love others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All your efforts to love your wife, to be submissive to your husband, to control your temper, and to be kind are in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just walk in Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit dwelling in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When you arise in the morning, pray-read His Word and talk to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This will usher you into a walk with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not heed your emotions, your decisions, or what others are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Just walk in Christ, and you will find that He Himself is the love you need toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>EFFECT ON THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we begin our day with contacting the Lord, and continue walking in Him throughout the day, we shall have rich experiences of Him to bring to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then when there is a need to share a certain aspect of the experience of Christ, we shall be able to give a testimony along that line.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The riches we accumulate benefit the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The normal Christian life is to walk in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By walking in Him we shall be rooted and built up.</S>
