   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was godly and, no doubt, he delighted in the law of God; yet he suffered a lot and the ungodly prospered.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, he was instructed, in the sanctuary of God, to take only God Himself as his portion, not anything other than God.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was delighting in the law, but he suffered greatly while the evil ones prospered.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was bothered until he entered into the sanctuary of God, that is, into God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then he became clear.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There under God's revelation, he was instructed just to have God Himself as his portion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually he declared that he had no one in the heavens nor anyone on this earth except God, his eternal portion vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>25-26 .</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then Job's three friends came to speak with him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What they spoke was nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They told Job that he must have been wrong in something.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Otherwise, God would not punish him in this way.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These three friends spoke to Job one by one again and again throughout the book of Job Job, however, would not be subdued by them.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After passing through his sufferings, he saw God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If someone who loves the Lord is suffering, his suffering is not basically a matter of his being right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What God is concerned with is our having more of God in our inward being.</S>
