<H1 CLASS=TITLE>PREFACE</H1><P>After 1931 Brother Watchman Nee led the church in Shanghai in a study of the Gospel of Matthew intermittently for several years. This volume consists of notes taken during those studies that were later edited and polished. It covers the interpretation from chapter one through chapter twenty-five, chapter by chapter and verse by verse in sequence, and includes the exposition of all important sections. The contents are exceedingly rich and multifaceted, with a rich supply of life and the light of the truth.</P>
