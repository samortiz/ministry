   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord's Recovery in China</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the light of the entire history of the church, we can say that today is our day.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In China many of God's children have risen up to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>More and more Christians are rising up and forsaking all.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the past the church did not have the courage to preach this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It did not have the boldness to tell men that they have to forsake everything to follow the Lord, that unless they forsook everything, they could not be proper Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1943 the Holy Spirit began a great work in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many brothers and sisters obeyed the move of the Holy Spirit and offered up everything for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Later Shanghai followed and then Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I hope that today Hong Kong will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be a Christian, one must be a Christian in accordance with the truth of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To serve the Lord, one has to be absolute; it is useless to be otherwise.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In singing the hymn about Dara, we can sense the joy within her.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The most foolish thing is to be a half-way Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such a one does not have the joy of the world John 15:19 or the joy of the Lord in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He wants to have a little of the world's joy and a little Christian joy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is not absolute, and he does not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No One Can Be a Good Christian</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>without Absolute Consecration</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why must a child of God hand himself over completely and forsake everything?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is because this is the only way to be a proper Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many people do not have many problems in other areas, but they have a problem with their consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today many Christians have hundreds and thousands of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Actually, the root of their problems is only one thing a lack of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a Christian does not have a problem with his consecration before the Lord, he will not have a problem with anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE MEANING OF HANDING ONESELF OVER</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>FORSAKING EVERYTHING AND BEING DELIVERED</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>FROM THE POWER OF MAMMON</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What does it mean to hand oneself over?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It means to forsake everything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Selling one's all is a matter of being delivered from the power and bondage of mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord shows us in the Gospels that a man is bound not only by sin but by mammon as well.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible does not say that sin is versus God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, it says that mammon is versus God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible does not say that sin is man's god, but it does say that mammon is man's god.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Matthew 6 the Lord Jesus said that God and mammon are against one another.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We cannot serve two gods.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Either we serve God, or we serve mammon v. 24 . Nothing opposes God as much as mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today mammon has gained many people in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many people do not necessarily serve sin, but they serve mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We cannot serve both God and mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A Christian must not only be saved from sin but also from the power of mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should hand ourselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that we should consecrate everything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should offer up everything for the Lord's use.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the only way to be delivered from the control of mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today we have two groups of people in the church here.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One group has touched money.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The other group consists of students who are still in school.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The way to be free from the power of mammon is to sell all.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should get rid of the mammon in our pockets.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today the gospel has needs, the poor have needs, and the brothers and sisters have needs.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All these needs are beckoning us to hand ourselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Handing ourselves over means to break the backbone of mammon within us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>From now on, we should no longer be under the influence of mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Students may think that they have no problem with this word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The brothers and sisters who have touched money and who have learned some lessons about money have experienced the power of money.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This word is not easy for them to take.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Perhaps none of what we have now has come through unrighteous means.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We did not sin or cheat.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But we cannot free ourselves from its power as long as we allow mammon to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You may say that my words are too harsh and severe, but being a Christian requires one to be harsh.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord told the disciples to forsake everything for His sake and for the gospel's sake Mark 10:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have to go through the experience of thoroughly giving up everything at least once.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After we have given up everything, God's blessing gradually will bring us into contact with mammon once again, and it will try to recover its power in us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the reason some of us have to deal with our possessions once every few years.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to fear mammon as much as we fear sin.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord Jesus' cross delivered us from the judgment of sin, but we still sin and need to apply the Lord as our propitiation offering 1 John 1:7 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Similarly, the problem of mammon is not solved forever once we have given up our all.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After we have given up everything, we have to learn to deal with mammon continually.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This will ensure that we have a way to go on before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should not think that everything is settled once we have forsaken our all.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is only a beginning.</S>
