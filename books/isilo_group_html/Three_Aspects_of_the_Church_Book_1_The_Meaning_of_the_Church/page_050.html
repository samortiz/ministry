<p>Some people have once said that all the furniture and utensils in the tabernacle, according to their sizes, could fit in the altar. In other words, the capacity of the altar was sufficient to contain all the furniture and utensils in the tabernacle. Moreover, the history of the Jews also tells us that when the children of Israel journeyed through the wilderness, every time they rolled up their tents to proceed, they put all the furniture and utensils of the tabernacle into the altar. If we calculate their sizes, we know that this must be a reliable fact.</p>
<p>When a priest entered the tabernacle and handled the furniture or utensils, he had to first pass through the altar. This means that the altar is the basis for every experience in the tabernacle. This typifies that the cross is the basis for every experience in the church. In other words, the cross is the basis for every spiritual experience. No one could handle the furniture and utensils or enter the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies without passing through the altar. In the same way, every spiritual experience involves passing through the cross. The cross, as the altar, encompasses everything. On one hand the cross is for redemption and consecration, on the other hand, it is the basis for all spiritual experience.</p>
<h2 class="head5">The Laver</h2>
<p>After the altar comes the laver. The laver is for washing (Exo. 40:30-32). Those who served in the tabernacle were required to wash their hands and feet in the laver in order to be cleansed. The New Testament shows that this signifies the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5). All these types are pictures. When a person commits a sin before God, he needs both the cleansing of the blood and the washing of the water. The washing of the water cleanses his hands and feet from the dust of the earth, the filthiness of the world. The blood deals with condemnation, not contamination. The blood cleanses us from condemnation, and the water cleanses us from contamination, from uncleanness, in our being. The washing of the water signifies the Holy Spirit washing away all our defilement. The defilement we receive from our contact with the world is washed by the Holy Spirit. The Lord Jesus spoke of this washing in John 15: &ldquo;You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you&rdquo; (v. 3). Hence, this kind of washing is not related to redemption.</p>
<p>If a child wears clean clothes, his mother may charge him, saying, &ldquo;Do not make your clothes dirty. If you make them dirty, you will offend me.&rdquo; If the child then goes out to play and is careless, his clothes will become dirty, and he will be condemned by his mother. Knowing this, he will be afraid to see his mother. Hence, he has two problems: an offended mother and contaminated clothes. If he confesses to his mother and asks for forgiveness, the problem of his offense can be solved; however, there still is dirt on his clothes. This requires washing. Even though there is no barrier of offense between the mother and the child, his clothes still need to be washed.</p>
<p>Before a certain brother was saved, he worked for the government and embezzled public funds to buy a bed, a desk, and a chair. After he was saved, he began to sense that his stealing was a sin that offended God. Inwardly, he had no sense of peace. When he stole the items, this brother was outside of the linen hangings of the outer court. He was living in darkness, and he did not have any sense related to his actions. After he entered within the boundary of righteousness and purity, he immediately sensed that his stealing was a sin. At that point, he came to the cross and said, &ldquo;O God, forgive me of my sin of stealing. Please forgive me.&rdquo; When this brother confessed his sin, he received the Lord&rsquo;s redemption. Through the Holy Spirit he sensed that the Lord had already borne his sins on the cross. He then had the faith to receive the cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood. In this way, he had peace with God. The blood at the altar cleanses us from our sins, erasing our record of sin before God and cleansing us from the condemnation in our conscience.</p>
<p>Later he sat down to read the Bible, and a sense of filth related to the bed, desk, and chair was still present because they had been bought with stolen money. Such a sense of filthiness cannot be washed away by the blood. Although the blood cleanses us from the record of sin before God, it cannot wash away the defilement related to these sins. Defilement is only washed away through the laver, that is, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit. When the brother knelt down to pray, the Holy Spirit bothered him and spoke to him with power, saying, &ldquo;Go and return these things. Deal thoroughly with all the things that do not belong to you.&rdquo; After this speaking, he did accordingly, and the peace returned to him.</p>
<p>A person may steal a tie, remove the original tag, and put his name on a new tag. Once he is saved, the blood will cleanse him of this sin when he confesses; however, when he wears the tie, there will still be a sense of defilement in his being. This shows that he needs the renewing of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit continually works in us to wash us. When something is washed with water, it may not be thoroughly cleaned immediately. Sometimes more scrubbing is needed. This is similar to the washing of the Holy Spirit. He operates in us and bothers us until we are restless. Similarly, He will not stop until the new brother returns the tie to its owner and tells him, &ldquo;I believe in Jesus; He saved me. I am returning your tie. Please forgive me. I also changed the name tag on the tie, so I need to pay you some money.&rdquo; This kind of washing is related to the laver; the blood cannot wash away this kind of defilement. The blood can wash away the record of our sin before God, but the defilement within us can only be dealt with by the renewing of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The redemption of the cross deals with our problem of sin before God. This dealing is accomplished by the washing of the blood. However, according to our experience, we know that the earthly defilement still remains. We still have filthy thoughts and improper concepts in our mind, and our actions are contaminated by earthly defilements. All these require the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit, which have nothing to do with redemption and are not for the purpose of dealing with the problem of sin. The washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit are for ridding us of the inward defilement. The cleansing of the precious blood cleanses us of our sin before God; the washing of the Holy Spirit rids us of our inward filthiness. In other words, the problem of sin is dealt with at the altar, and the problem of filthiness is dealt with at the laver.</p>
<p>Worldly people see only the filthiness but not the condemnation, whereas the eyes of theologians focus too much on condemnation, overlooking the matter of defilement. The Bible, however, reveals that both aspects are of equal importance. We need the altar with the blood because of our condemnation before God, and we need the laver with the washing of water because of our defilement.</p>
<p>Whenever we desire to approach God and sense that we are condemned and defiled, we need the washing of the blood to deal with our condemnation and the renewing of the Holy Spirit to rid us of our defil ent. We may need ten minutes to make a petition regarding a certain matter, but prior to making the petition, we may need twenty minutes to seek the cleansing of the blood and the renewing of our inner being. One cannot enter the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies without spending time at the altar and the laver. If a person has not spent much time passing through the altar and the laver, he is not able to have much experience of the Holy Place and of the Holy of Holies. The altar deals with our sin, and the laver deals with our filthiness. A person who seeks spiritual experiences must pass through the altar and the laver.</p>
<p>When we enter into the Holy of Holies to contact God, we must pass through these two items in the outer court. Sometimes, we may first come to the laver and then to the altar. Our experience may not necessarily follow the sequence of first going to the altar and then to the laver. Actually, one who serves God must always go first to the laver and then to the altar. For instance, today we may need to speak for the Lord, but yesterday we offended a brother. In Matthew 5:24 the Lord says, &ldquo;Leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother.&rdquo; <em>First go and be reconciled to your brother</em> means to go to the laver. We need to first go to our brother and tell him, &ldquo;Brother, I am sorry that I offended you yesterday.&rdquo; This is the significance of going to the laver. First we go to the brother to wash our hands and feet; then we come to God and say, &ldquo;God, forgive me of my sin.&rdquo; After this, we will be able to speak for God and serve Him in the Holy Place. This is to pass through the laver and then through the altar.</p>
<p>The altar and the laver have two functions. The altar washes away man&rsquo;s record of sin before God, and the laver washes away the filthiness of man. Our record of sin is washed away by the judgment at the altar, the cross, and our filthiness is cleansed by the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit at the laver. Both the altar and the laver were made of bronze; however, the source of the two items was different. The bronze used for the laver came from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting (Exo. 38:8). This implies that the laver is similar to a mirror, reflecting men&rsquo;s true condition and contamination. The bronze used to overlay the altar came from the censers of the two hundred fifty sinful ones who were judged by God (Num. 16:19-50); thus, this bronze bears the significance of judgment. At the altar, judgment cleanses men from condemnation, and at the laver, shining rids men of their uncleanness. Because of condemnation, we need the blood; because of filthiness, we need the water. The altar deals with the matter of condemnation, and the laver deals with the need for shining.</p>
<p>When a person came to the altar, the bronze reminded him of God&rsquo;s judgment; when he came to the laver, the bronze reminded him of God&rsquo;s enlightening. When a person comes to the cross, he is reminded that the Lord was judged, and when he comes to the Holy Spirit, he is enlightened to see his true condition, his filthiness.</p>
<p>In the tabernacle, that is, within the church, the first item is the redemption of the cross, and the second item is the washing of the Holy Spirit. The cross is related to redemption, and the Holy Spirit is related to washing. A person in the outer court contacted these two items all the time, signifying that both newly saved ones and those who do not have much growth in life frequently have experiences related to the redemption of the cross and the washing of the Holy Spirit. This is often the limit of their spiritual experience. At most, they are able to testify that they liked playing mah-jongg and going to movies, but now they sense that these things offend God. They may even testify that there is a power within them that enables them to stop doing these things. This is the redemption of the cross and the washing of the Holy Spirit, experiences related to the outer court.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 1, The Meaning of the Church &nbsp; pg 50</div><br></body></html>
