Hence, the ten virgins represent the majority of the believers, who will have died before the Lord&#8217;s coming. The two men or two women in 24:40-41 represent the remaining believers, who will live until the Lord&#8217;s coming.</p><p>1<sup>3</sup> Virgins signify believers viewed from the aspect of life (2 Cor. 11:2). Believers, who are the kingdom people, are like chaste virgins. As virgins they bear the Lord&#8217;s testimony (the lamp) in the dark age and are going out of the world to meet the Lord. For this they need not only the indwelling but also the filling of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>1<sup>4</sup> Lamps signify the spirit of the believers (Prov. 20:27), which contains the Spirit of God as the oil (Rom. 8:16). The believers shine forth the light of the Spirit of God from within their spirit. Thus, they become the light of the world and shine as a lamp in the darkness of this age (5:14-16; Phil 2:15-16), bearing the testimony of the Lord for the glorification of God.</p><p>1<sup>5</sup> Went forth signifies that the believers are going out of the world to meet the coming Christ.</p><p>1<sup>6</sup> The bridegroom signifies Christ as the pleasant and attractive person (John 3:29; Matt. 9:15).</p><p>2<sup>1</sup> Five is composed of four plus one, signifying that man (signified by four) with God (signified by one) added to him bears responsibility. The fact that five of the virgins are foolish and five are prudent does not indicate that half the believers are foolish and the other half are prudent. It indicates that all believers bear the responsibility of being filled with the Holy Spirit.</p><p>2<sup>2</sup> Being foolish does not make these five virgins false. In nature they are the same as the five prudent ones.</p><p>3<sup>1</sup> Oil signifies the Holy Spirit (Isa. 61:1; Heb. 1:9).</p><p>4<sup>1</sup> Man is a vessel made for God (Rom. 9:21, 23-24), and man&#8217;s personality is in his soul. Hence, vessels here signifies the souls of the believers. The five prudent virgins not only have oil in their lamps but also take oil in their vessels. That they have oil in their lamps signifies that they have the Spirit of God dwelling in their spirit (Rom. 8:9, 16), and that they take oil in their vessels signifies that they have the Spirit of God filling and saturating their souls.</p><p>5<sup>1</sup> Becoming drowsy signifies becoming sick (Acts 9:37; 1 Cor. 11:30).</p><p>5<sup>2</sup> Sleep signifies death (1 Thes. 4:13-16; John 11:11-13). While the Lord delays His return, a majority of the believers become sick and then die.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>We have seen that the section of the prophecy of the kingdom concerning the church covers two aspects: the aspect of being watchful and ready and the aspect of being faithful and prudent....In life we need to be watchful and ready, and in service we need to be faithful and prudent....Although both these aspects are covered in chapter twenty-four, they are not covered fully. Thus, in chapter twenty-five there is the need of a complementary word for each aspect covered in chapter twenty-four....How to watch and be ready is revealed in the parable of the virgins [(25:1-13), and how to be faithful and prudent is revealed in the parable of the talents (vv. 14-30)].
