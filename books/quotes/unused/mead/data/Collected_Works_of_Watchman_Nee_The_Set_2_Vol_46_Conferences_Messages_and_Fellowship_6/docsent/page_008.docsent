   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-FOUR LIGHT AND KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LIGHT VERSUS KNOWLEDGE Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:3</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those who are perishing" 2 Cor 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Being veiled is related to perishing, but being enlightened means salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As soon as we see, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Salvation does not occur subsequent to seeing; it is simultaneous with seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Seeing is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we hear the doctrine and understand it without anything happening, it is certain that we have not seen the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We expect first to see and then to have the corresponding experience; but the moment we truly see, we have the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Seeing and experience are not two steps, but one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no interval between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not need to wait for experience once revelation breaks upon us, because we have the experience the moment revelation breaks upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Where there is mere knowledge of the Word, there are human efforts to carry out the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When there is revelation, there is no need of such efforts, because we see that everything has been done.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For instance, if we merely understand from the Word that we are proud, we will seek to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the moment we truly see that we are proud, we cease to be proud, and there is no need to try and be humble any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The light that reveals the pride slays the pride.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not need to do anything about it from the moment we see, because it is gone from that moment on.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no second step necessary; there is no need to even wait for experience, because the experience is simultaneous with revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The divine light is enough to do away with the negative, because divine light slays.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The divine light is also enough to bring in the positive, because divine light produces experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many Christians who lack the light which automatically produces experience resort to works to produce the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Works are always an indication of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Where there is light there is experience; hence, there is no need of works.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What the fire discloses the fire destroys 1 Cor 3:12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The fire that enlightens is the fire that consumes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The light that makes manifest is the light that slays.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In photography the exposure of the film and the impression of the portrait are not separate processes; they are simultaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As soon as there is an exposure there is a portrait.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Wherever there is the need of two steps first knowledge, then experience there is no Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When a sinner seeks salvation and we present Christ to him so that he sees, there is no need to tell him to pray in order to be saved, because he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When a saved person seeks sanctification and we present Christ to him so that he sees, there is no need to tell him to pray in order to experience Christ as his sanctification, because he already has the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we require that the sinner pray one sentence or that the saint pray one sentence in order to enter into these experiences, the sinner will not be genuinely reborn and the saint will not be genuinely sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we have light objectively and eyes subjectively, we will surely see.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many Christians are searching within for light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They analyze and dissect, but they fail to discover what they seek because light comes objectively.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many Christians are trying to see with their hands, instead of their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They grope around and feel all over, but discover nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not discover the truth by our feeling, but by our seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are two weaknesses which hinder the advance of believers above all others: resorting to the effort of the will in time of weakness and resorting to introspection in time of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Both of these are contrary to the New Testament and arrest spiritual progress.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are two principles which govern Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These two principles are seeing and believing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The only way to get rid of light is to shut it out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Light will find its way through the tiniest crack.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need a fundamental seeing, and we also need a daily seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Revelation comes to us in a crisis, but thereafter it comes in a process.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Progressive seeing is based on fundamental seeing, that is, the seeing that slays the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is enough power in the light of God to destroy everything that is contrary to the will of God with one stroke.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Miss Barber once said that a leaf can hide a star cf.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Matt 6:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we walk in the light, He cleanses us by the blood 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Walking in the light and cleansing by the blood are not separate experiences; they are simultaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We do not need to concern ourselves with the matter of cleansing, because cleansing is automatic as we walk in the light.</S>
