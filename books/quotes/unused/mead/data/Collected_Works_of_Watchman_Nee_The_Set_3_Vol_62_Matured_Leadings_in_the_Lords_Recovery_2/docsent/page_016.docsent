   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SERVING UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Watchman Nee: In the church there is no human authority; there is only the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church has been here on earth for a long time, but God has never entrusted its service to any human individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the church not even the elders are the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You are not the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Any move in the church service should be the result of the direction of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Anyone acting or deliberating apart from the direction of the Holy Spirit is being rebellious and seditious.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Perhaps you do not know how rebellious and seditious you were in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Neither the elders nor the deacons have any authority in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Authority is from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church cannot tolerate any kind of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Any announcement or change must be carried out in the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the brothers and sisters have been dealt with by the Spirit in a deep way, they will know immediately if a church is in rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have absolutely no intention of building up an earthly organization here.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our hope is that the authority of the Holy Spirit would flow from the most mature brothers to the youngest one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let me repeat: Neither the brothers and sisters nor the deacons and elders have any authority in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only the Holy Spirit has the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are two basic principles operating in the church love and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Where there is a lack of love, the relationship among the brothers and sisters falters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Where there is a lack of authority, the relationship with the Holy Spirit falters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Horizontally there is love, and vertically there is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the Head is not honored with His rightful authority, the church will not experience the blessing that flows from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, even the smallest arrangement in the church must not be carried out presumptuously without the direction of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The brothers and sisters have to develop a habit of asking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They should ask the responsible brothers everything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the end, the elders have to bring all the matters to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The elders are not men with sharper and quicker mentalities.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are the ones who have learned more lessons and have spent more time before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They know God's heart more.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They must be clear about God's will before they tell the brothers and sisters what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some people have been Christians for over ten or twenty years, but they still have not learned the habit of asking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I will tell you a secret.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord has given me the responsibility of examining the young brothers; I try to ascertain if they are suitable and qualified for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We examine many things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One of the things we examine is whether or not they have a habit of asking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a man does not have the habit of asking, his self is not yet broken, and he will probably serve according to his self-will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He will build a yard only to tear it down again later.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He may even do worse, tearing down the adjacent walls as well.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Unless the Lord's authority is clearly manifest among us, our service will be a mere rallying of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We will come together to build Babel, and the result will be nothing but total confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should never despise the smallest work in the church or think that a work is so insignificant that there is no need to ask anyone about it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even a work as mundane as cleaning chairs is special.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We serve in coordination by submitting to the authority of the Holy Spirit; we do not serve according to our past concepts and habits.</S>
