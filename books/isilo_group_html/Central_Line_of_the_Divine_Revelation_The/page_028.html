Yet, Lord, we confess to You that we are so slow in realizing what You are. We are also very slow in knowing ourselves. Today we come to You that we may learn how to be fearful and trembling before You. Lord, do teach us according to Your mind and according to Your economy. We do thank You that You have a divine economy for the entire universe. Lord, there are so many secrets, so many mysteries, hidden in Your holy Word. We need Your opening and Your unveiling. We even need You to point out these mysteries to us in a slow way. Thank You, Lord, that You did this while You were on the earth for three and a half years with the ancient disciples. Lord, we beg You to do the same thing with us today. Capture us and keep us in Your mind for this difficult study. Lord, we feel very sorry that it is difficult for us to overcome the poor background which surrounds us. We have picked up so many things from today's Christianity in America, the top Christian country with its science, culture, and religions. Be merciful to all of us, and take away all these veils and preoccupying things. We stand with You and tell You in a strong way that we hate all these preoccupying things. Lord, be with us in a new and thorough way. We desire to be empty with nothing in our understanding. You told us that those who are poor in spirit are blessed. Lord, let us be poor in our spirit. Say something to us, teach us, and anoint us. Give us an empty heart and a humble mind. Amen.</P><P>I was saved in April 1925. From the first day I was saved, I loved to know the Bible. For the past sixty-five and a half years, I have spent nearly every day in the Bible. On some days, I might not have opened the Bible outwardly, but inwardly, from morning until evening, the Bible was in my consideration. In the first few years in my study of the Bible, I did not realize that the Bible is not easy to understand rightly. But the longer I have continued in my study of the Bible, the more I have realized that the Bible is difficult to understand. The Bible is like a deep mine; it is altogether unlimited. The more I dig into it, the more I realize that it is endless. Although I have studied the Bible for many years, I feel that this present year is my first year to study the Bible.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
