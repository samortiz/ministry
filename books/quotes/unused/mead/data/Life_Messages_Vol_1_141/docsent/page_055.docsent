   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INVISIBLE YET REAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ lives in us, yet we cannot see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can we prove He is real?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the early days of my ministry I did a lot of gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once a professor came to me and said, "Mr. Lee, your preaching is good, and your doctrine is quite philosophical.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What you say is logical, but how can you prove that the Christ you preach is real?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I replied, "Do you have a life inside you?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"Yes," he replied.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Is it real?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I further asked.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"If so, show it to me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Otherwise, don't say any more."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He could not show me his life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I went on, "Mr. So-and-So, you are not as philosophical as you think.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You may have a doctorate in some area of science, but you are surely not a doctor of yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Tell me, how many hearts do you have?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Mr. Lee," he answered, "What are you talking about? Everybody knows we have only one heart." "Sorry, you are mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have two hearts," I told him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Besides a physical heart that pumps your blood, you have a heart that can love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Isn't this true?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He had a life, yet he could not show it to me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have a real and living Christ, but I could not show Him either.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a person He may be invisible, but He is also the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This book called the Bible differs from all other books.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we read it with an open heart, we find something moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is because it is God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In it the mysterious, invisible Christ is embodied.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we take this Word into us, it becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then when we speak this Spirit out, it again becomes the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Word and the Spirit, God's two gifts to us, are one, Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot touch Christ, but we can touch the Word; we cannot sense Christ, but we can sense the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit and the Word are the two means by which we abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this New Testament age, whenever we touch the Spirit of God, we touch the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This enriched Spirit is pictured for us in the compound anointing ointment described in Exodus 30:23-25.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may remember the meaning of the spices that were added to the hin of oil; we discussed this in Life Message Eight.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Myrrh signifies death; cinnamon, the sweetness of the death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Calamus is a plant which grows out of the mud high into the air; it speaks of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Cassia is an aromatic plant, used in ancient times to repel insects and especially snakes; it represents the sweet fragrance of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this ointment, portraying the Spirit, are the death of Christ, His resurrection, His divinity one, the measure of oil , His humanity four, the number of spices , the trinity three units of 500 shekels , and the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we have this ointment, we have an all-inclusive dose.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus every time we touch the Spirit properly, we experience this death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Holy Spirit there is a killing factor and a resurrecting factor.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I may find, for example, that my wife is bothering me too much; I get tired of her tight control over my eating.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I want forty dumplings, but she restricts me to thirty, telling me that is all she has made.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is so aggravating.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Well, when I get into the Word and truly touch the Spirit, what happens to my precious dumplings?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>My appetite for them is killed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What happens to all the bad feelings toward my wife?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The negative thoughts are all gone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When I touch the Spirit, there is first a killing, and then there is something rising up, bringing me into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once I am in resurrection, however much she restricts my eating will not affect me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But, sad to say, the sense of resurrection seems to vanish after a couple of days.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I feel low.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When I look at my wife, I can see she hasn't changed at all.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I have changed, but here she is, still the same.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Actually, I am still the same!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then again I must seek the Spirit, experience the killing, and be brought into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the way to grow in life.</S>
