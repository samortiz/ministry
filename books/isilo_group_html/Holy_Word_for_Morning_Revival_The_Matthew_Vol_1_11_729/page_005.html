Among those eight, only Isaac is counted as the promised seed (Rom. 9:7-8). Hence, Christ is his descendant to fulfill God&#8217;s promise given to Abraham and to him (Gen. 22:18; 26:4).</p><p>2<sup>2</sup> Isaac begot twin sons, Esau and Jacob (Gen. 25:21-26), but only Jacob was chosen by God (Rom. 9:10-13). Hence, Christ is his descendant to fulfill God&#8217;s promise given to Abraham, to Isaac, and to him (Gen. 22:18; 26:4; 28:14).</p><p>2<sup>3</sup> The birthright of the promised seed consists of the double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship. Reuben, as the firstborn son of Jacob, should have inherited the birthright. But because of his defilement he lost the birthright (Gen. 49:3-4; 1 Chron. 5:1-2). The double portion of the land went to Joseph through his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim (Josh. 16-17); the priesthood went to Levi (Deut. 33:8-10); and the kingship was given to Judah (Gen. 49:10; 1 Chron. 5:2). Hence, Christ, the King of God&#8217;s kingdom, is a descendant of Judah (Heb. 7:14); as such, He inherits the kingdom.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>God had promised Abraham a son. Sarah, wanting to help God fulfill His promise, made a proposal to Abraham. Sarah seemed to say, &#8220;Look, Abraham...you are nearly ninety years of age! And look at me-I&#8217;m too old! It is impossible for me to bring forth a child....I have a maid named Hagar....Surely you could have a son by her&#8221; (Gen. 16:1-2)....Many times our natural concept has some proposal to get us out of the spirit....Abraham took Sarah&#8217;s proposal (Gen. 16:2-4), and the result was Ishmael (Gen. 16:15)....Participating in Christ requires that we never rely on our own effort nor on anything we are able to do....The termination of our natural effort...is &#8220;Isaac,&#8221; the inheriting of God&#8217;s promised blessing, which is Christ.</p><p>Verse 2 also says, &#8220;Isaac begot Jacob.&#8221;...When [Jacob] and his older brother Esau were coming out of the womb, Jacob held Esau&#8217;s heel. Jacob seemed to be saying, &#8220;Esau, don&#8217;t go yet!...Let me go first!&#8221; Jacob was a real heel-holder. The meaning of the name Jacob is the heel-holder, the supplanter....Because God had already chosen Jacob, all his endeavors were in vain. Jacob needed a vision. He did not need to supplant others, because God had chosen him.... What did Jacob need? He needed God&#8217;s dealing....There was a great deal of suffering in the life of Jacob, but this suffering came from his striving, not from God&#8217;s election....[According to] Romans 9,...it is up to Him, not us....What a mercy that we have been selected to be associated with Christ and to participate in Him as God&#8217;s eternal blessing!</p><p>Jacob&#8217;s supplanting was not justified, but his seeking after the birthright surely was honored by God. Esau despised the birthright and sold it cheaply (Gen. 25:29-34).... He had lost the blessing of participating in Christ. This should be a warning to us. Jacob respected and sought the birthright, and he obtained it. He inherited God&#8217;s promised blessing, the blessing of Christ (Gen. 28:4, 14).
