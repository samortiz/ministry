[2]  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN WITNESSING Scripture Reading: Acts 9:19-21; 22:15; 1 John 4:14; John 1:40-45; 4:29; Mark 5:19 I. THE MEANING OF WITNESSING
[3]  How long will the light of a candle last?
[4]  Only by drinking the Lord s water will we not thirst again, because there is a spring that will flow out of us and satisfy us continuously.
[5]  In Mark 5:1-20 we see a person who was demon possessed.
[6]  After the demon possessed man was saved, the Lord said to him, Go to your house, to your own people, and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had mercy on you v. 19 .
[7]  After you are saved, the Lord wants you to tell your family, neighbors, relatives, friends, and colleagues that you are now a saved person.
[8]  You should tell them not only that you have believed in Jesus but also what great things the Lord has done for you.
[9]  If you realize how great the discovery you have made is and how important and wonderful your discovery is, you surely will tell others immediately, I have met the Son of God.
[10]  When Peter told the Lord, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus told him, Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens Matt 16:16-17 .
[11]  A person needs not only to go to the city, to his home, and to the synagogues to witness to others about his faith in the Lord, but also to bear a special testimony to lead others to the Lord one on one.
[12]  The moment Andrew believed in the Lord, he led his brother Peter to the Lord.
[13]  Although he did not have any special gift and did not know how to lead many people to the Lord, the Lord was gracious to him and opened his eyes to realize that he could lead at least one person to the Lord.
[14]  THE IMPORTANCE OF WITNESSING A. Being a Great Joy
[15]  The two happiest days in every believer's life are the day he believes in the Lord and the day when, for the first time, he leads another person to Christ.
[16]  However, the joy of leading another person to the Lord for the first time may be greater than the joy experienced on the day of his own salvation.
[17]  Many Christians do not have much joy because they have never spoken anything for the Lord; they have never led a person to the Lord.
[18]  CHAPTER NINETEEN LEADING MEN TO CHRIST Scripture Reading: Rom 1:16; 10:14; 1 Tim 2:1, 4; Mark 16:15
[19]  In the previous chapter we said that once a person believes in the Lord, he has to witness for the Lord.
[20]  In this chapter we want to talk about the ways to lead men to Christ.
[21]  If we do not know how to lead people to Christ, I am afraid that much of our witnessing will be in vain.
[22]  There are several things which we must do and learn if we want to lead men to Christ.
[23]  The first thing that we must do is ask God for people, asking Him to give men to the Lord Jesus and to add them to the church.
[24]  Prayer is a test; it exposes your spiritual condition before the Lord.
[25]  If your spiritual condition is proper and normal, others will be saved one by one.
[26]  As you intercede continuously before the Lord, you may find one or two persons saved after a few days or half a month.
[27]  If your prayers are not answered for a long time, it must mean that you are sick before the Lord.
[28]  / But your iniquities have become a separation / Between you and your God, / And your sins have hidden His face / From you so that He does not hear.
[29]  When a person sins, no matter what he says to himself, how much he reads the Bible, how many promises there are in the Word, how much grace God has, and how much He accepts him, his conscience will be weakened and bound.
[30]  When we believe God s word, abiding in faith rather than in doubt, we will see how real God s words are and we will find answers to our prayers.
[31]  We need to have the ambition to be a praying person, a person with power before God.
[32]  Some people are powerful before God, while others are not.
[33]  He asked the brother who led him to Christ, Please tell me the first thing that I must do for the Lord?
[34]  The brother replied, The Lord will choose a few of your companions and put them in your heart.
[35]  The key to leading men to the Lord is to emphasize the facts, not the doctrines.
[36]  Just recall what it was like when you were saved.
[37]  You did not believe because you understood the doctrines.
[38]  We mentioned earlier that you must pray before you speak to a person.
[39]  This, however, does not mean that you cannot speak if you have not prayed.
[40]  You have to speak to men even if you are seeing them for the first time.
[41]  During the past two to three hundred years, the Lord has used tracts in a particular way to save many people.
[42]  If you try to testify with your mouth, you are restricted by time and personnel.
[43]  CHAPTER TWENTY HOUSEHOLD SALVATION I. GOD S PROMISE OF SALVATION
[44]  According to the Bible, in God s dealings and communications with man, He has given man many promises.
[45]  Genesis 17:12-13 says, Every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.
[46]  He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
[47]  God called Abraham and made a covenant with him, saying, I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee v. 7 . The sign of the covenant between God and Abraham was circumcision.
[48]  All who were circumcised belonged to God, and all who were not circumcised were not of God.
[49]  God also told Abraham that his whole household needed to be circumcised, including those who were born in his house and those who were bought with his money.
[50]  Verse 11 says, This also is yours, the heave offering of their gift, all the wave offerings of the sons of Israel; I have given them to you, and to your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual due; every one who is clean in your house may eat of it.
[51]  Second Samuel 6:11 says, And the ark of Jehovah remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months; and Jehovah blessed Obed-edom and all his household.
[52]  But even if you are not the head of your household, you can still speak in faith as Rahab, saying, Lord, turn my household to You to receive Your grace and blessing.
[53]  Deuteronomy 12:7 says, There you shall eat before Jehovah your God, and you and your households shall rejoice in all your undertakings, in which Jehovah your God has blessed you.
[54]  Deuteronomy 14:26 says, You shall exchange the money for anything that your soul desires, for oxen, for sheep, for wine, for strong drink, or for anything that your soul would like; and you and your household shall eat there before Jehovah your God and rejoice.
[55]  Acts 10:2 says that Cornelius was devout and one who feared God with all his household, giving many alms to the people and beseeching God continually, and 11:14 says, ...who will speak words to you by which you shall be saved, you and all your house.
[56]  Cornelius s entire household was saved; it was not just one person who was saved.
[57]  God s Word does not say that if you believe on the Lord Jesus, you and your household shall receive eternal life.
[58]  Acts 18:8 says, Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with his whole household...and were baptized.
[59]  In the Bible there are individuals who believed in the Lord and there are households which believed in the Lord.
[60]  Notice how easy it is for God s grace to come to a household.
[61]  Acts 2:39 says, For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God calls to Himself.
[62]  Genesis 20:18 says, For the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham s wife.
[63]  Second Samuel 12:10-11 says, Now therefore the sword will not depart from your house forever because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.
[64]  Thus says Jehovah, I will now raise up trouble against you from within your house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and will give them to your companion, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
[65]  The head of a family has the special responsibility before God for bringing his whole household to the Lord and to His service.
[66]  You need to take your stand as the head of your family to declare that your household will believe in the Lord and that you will not tolerate anyone who will not believe.
[67]  Even if the little children do not believe, you can still say that your household will believe in the Lord, because this household is yours and not your children s. You are responsible for your household, not your children.
[68]  I hope that the newly saved brothers and sisters will pay attention to this matter.
[69]  Once you are saved, you should gather your family members together and declare to them, From this day forward, my household belongs to God.
[70]  You need to declare this whether or not they belong to the Lord and whether or not they agree.
[71]  Not only must he be the Lord s individually; he also must declare that his household is the Lord s. Take full control of this matter, and it will be done for you.
[72]  CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE IF ANYONE SINS Scripture Reading: John 5:14; 8:11; Rom 6:1-2; Num 19:1-10, 12-13, 17-19; 1 John 1:7 2:2
[73]  John 5 records the incident of the Lord Jesus healing one who had been sick for thirty-eight years near the pool in Bethesda.
[74]  After the man was healed the Lord met him in the temple and said to him, Behold, you have become well; sin no more so that nothing worse happens to you v. 14 . John 8 speaks of the Lord Jesus forgiving a woman who had committed adultery.
[75]  He said to her then and there, From now on sin no more v. 11 . Once we are saved, we are charged by the Lord to sin no more! As saved ones, we surely should not continue in sin.
[76]  It is possible for Christians not to sin because we have God s life within us.
[77]  To take care of this matter, we must first realize that the Lord Jesus has borne all our sins on the cross.
[78]  All the sins which we have committed, as well as those we are committing and will commit during our whole life, were borne by the Lord on the cross.
[79]  However, on the day we believed in the Lord, under God s light we only saw the sins that we had committed before we had believed.
[80]  A man can only be conscious of the sins which God shines His light upon; he cannot feel the sins which he has not yet committed.
[81]  We have covered the side of the Lord s work, which is redemption and the removal of our sins.
[82]  First John 1:9 says, If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[83]  When we sin and when we know our sin and acknowledge it as sin, God will forgive us our sin and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[84]  First John 2:1 says, My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin.
[85]  These things refer to the forgiveness and cleansing from our sins through God s promise and work.
[86]  John wrote these things to us so that we may not sin.
[87]  It shows us that the Lord has forgiven our many sins and that, as a result, we do not sin.
[88]  When we find out that we are forgiven, we do not become free to sin; rather, we will not sin.
[89]  When a child of God sins and does not confess his sin but instead remains in his sin, he loses his fellowship with God.
[90]  CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO CONFESSION AND RECOMPENSE Scripture Reading: Lev 6:1-7; Matt 5:23-26 I. A CONSCIENCE VOID OF OFFENSE
[91]  After we have believed in the Lord, we must build up a habit of confessing and recompensing.
[92]  If we have offended anyone or have come short of anyone, we should learn to confess or to recompense.
[93]  On the one hand, we have to confess to God, and on the other hand, we have to confess to and recompense man.
[94]  If a man does not confess to God nor apologize or recompense man, his conscience will easily become hardened.
[95]  Once the conscience becomes hardened, a serious and fundamental problem develops: It becomes difficult for God s light to shine into a man.
[96]  The length of time since your last confession is an indication of whether or not there is a problem between you and God.
[97]  In order to live under God s light, we need a sensitive conscience, and in order for our conscience to remain sensitive, we need to continually condemn sin as sin.
[98]  If a brother or sister s sins are unrelated to man, having only offended God, he or she only needs to confess to God; there is absolutely no need to confess to man.
[99]  Leviticus 6:2-7: When a person sins and acts unfaithfully against Jehovah, All sins are ultimately trespasses against Jehovah and lies to his fellowman in regard to a deposit or a security, or through robbery, or if he has extorted from his fellowman, or has found what was lost and lied about it, and has sworn falsely concerning any of the things a man may do to sin thereby then it shall be, when he sins and is guilty, that he shall return what he took by robbery, or what he got by extortion, or the deposit which was deposited with him, or the lost thing which he found, or anything about which he swore falsely; he shall make restitution for it in full and add to it one-fifth more; he shall give it to whom it belongs on the day he is found guilty.
[100]  Our manner of life has to be righteous, and our conscience must be void of offense before God.
[101]  God s Word says, Then it shall be, when he sins and is guilty, that he shall return what he took by robbery v. 4 . The word return is very important.
[102]  Matthew 5:23-26 says, Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
[103]  Be well disposed quickly toward your opponent at law, while you are with him on the way, lest the opponent deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.
[104]  If you are offering a gift at the altar, that is, if you are offering something to God, and suddenly remember that your brother has something against you, this remembering is God s leading.
[105]  If you remember that your brother has something against you, this means you have transgressed against him.
[106]  When you have offended and transgressed against your brother, when he is disturbed and feels that you are unrighteous, and when you have caused him to sigh before God, your spiritual fellowship with God is interrupted; your spiritual prospects are gone.
[107]  You may not have the slightest feeling that you are in darkness, and you may feel that you are all right, but the gift you offer at the altar has become void.
[108]  First, the scope of your confession should be as wide as the scope of your offense.
[109]  You should do everything according to God s Word and should not take the extreme way.
[110]  Sometimes you have offended one individual, but because you want to testify to the brothers and sisters, you tell them about it.
[111]  CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE FORGIVENESS AND RESTORATION Scripture Reading: Matt 18:21-35, 15-20; Luke 17:3-5
[112]  What should we do if a brother offends us?
[113]  What should we do when it is not we who have offended others but others who have offended us?
[114]  When we examine the above three portions of the Lord s Word, we find that we should not only forgive a brother who has offended us but we should also restore him.
[115]  Matthew 18:21-22 says, Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?
[116]  And if he sins against you seven times in a day and turns again to you seven times, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him.
[117]  God expects to see one thing from us: Whoever wants to receive grace must first learn to dispense grace.
[118]  Whoever receives grace must first learn to share grace.
[119]  If a man receives grace, God expects him to share this grace with others.
[120]  Matthew 18:28-29 says, But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, and he took hold of him and began to choke him, saying, Repay me what you owe.
[121]  When we say to the Lord, Be patient with me and I will repay you all, He not only releases us but also forgives our debt.
[122]  Verse 34 continues, His master became angry and delivered him to the torturers until he would repay all that was owed.
[123]  God delivers him to the torturers until he should repay all that he owes.
[124]  Verse 35 says, So also shall My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts.
[125]  The second half of verse 15 says, If he hears you, you have gained your brother.
[126]  There is only one reason for telling: If he hears you, you have gained your brother.
[127]  If your brother has offended you, and the matter is not cleared up, he will not be able to get through to God; there will be obstacles in his fellowship and prayer.
[128]  If it is just a matter of hurt feelings, if the issue does not pose a problem to you, and if you think you can get over it, you do not need to speak to your brother or anyone else.
[129]  If a brother has committed a mistake that will jeopardize his relationship with God, this is not a small matter, and you should go and clearly tell him about it.
[130]  Verse 16 says, But if he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
[131]  If you go to him by yourself and speak to him with a proper motive, a good attitude, and gentle words, and he still does not hear you, then go and tell others about it.
[132]  However, you must tell someone else only after he has rejected your words.
[133]  If a problem arises between two of God s children and if both of them go to the Lord and deal with it, everything will be solved easily.
[134]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR BELIEVERS REACTIONS Scripture Reading: Matt 5:38-48
[135]  More than half of our life is spent in reactions.
[136]  When we feel happy about what others are saying, we are reacting.
[137]  When we feel angry about what others are saying, we are reacting as well.
[138]  If our reactions are not proper, we are not acting according to God s nature or life within us, and we are not meeting God s standard.
[139]  Following this it says, For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? v. 46 . If others love you, your natural reaction is to love them.
[140]  If more than half our life is occupied with reactions and if our reactions are Christian-like, we can expect God to be pleased with us.
[141]  If someone wants my tunic, it is perfectly all right if I do not give it to him.
[142]  Some who are ignorant of the Bible think that the teachings on the mountain in Matthew 5 7 have to do with the law.
[143]  Why do we have to turn our left cheek when others strike our right cheek?
[144]  When the Lord grants us sufferings through man s hand, we should rather enhance His work than annul His work.
[145]  This means that we do not react by frustrating the Lord s work through man s hand.
[146]  Finally, we need to pay attention to two things concerning this life s reaction.
[147]  It is possible for a person to be free from sin immediately after he has believed in the Lord.
[148]  However, this may not be the common experience of all believers.
[149]  After believing in the Lord, many people fall back into sin instead of being freed from sin.
[150]  Romans 7:15-25 says, For what I work out, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do....For to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not.
[151]  But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that work it out....I find then the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the evil is present with me.
[152]  For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man, but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members....So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh, the law of sin.
[153]  Afterwards, you realize that you were wrong again, and you ask the Lord for forgiveness, promising Him that you will never lose your temper again.
[154]  If we fear that the Lord s Spirit will not work in us unless we rush in to help Him in times of temptation, we have not seen the Spirit as a law within us yet.
[155]  Many Christians have a wrong concept about the Lord Jesus.
[156]  They think that the Lord set up a good pattern for us while He was on earth and that we should imitate this pattern.
[157]  It is true that the Bible charges us to imitate the Lord Rom 15:5; 1 Cor 11:1; etc. . But the Bible does not tell us to do this by ourselves.
[158]  Some Christians think that they can ask the Lord to empower them simply because the Bible says, I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me Phil 4:13 .
[159]  If a Christian does not know what is meant by Christ our life, and what is meant by for to me, to live is Christ, he will not experience the Lord s life on earth; he will not be able to follow the Lord, to experience victory in Him, or to proceed on the course before him.
[160]  If you make it your goal and hope to attain such a state, if you aspire to be crucified, that is, to no longer be the one who lives but instead to have Christ living in you, you will wait forever before seeing your aspiration fulfilled, because you are hoping for something that is impossible to achieve.
[161]  Perhaps some will ask, How can we experience it is no longer I who live ?
[162]  If I am not crucified with Christ, I am still I. How can I say, It is no longer I ? Only those who are crucified with Christ can say, It is no longer I.
[163]  Even though you think that you can make it, God says that you cannot make it and that you should die.
[164]  Instead, we should bow down our head and say, Lord, You have said that I am crucified, and I will say the same thing; You have said that I am useless, and I will say the same thing; You have said that I cannot be patient, and I will no longer try to be patient; You have said that I cannot be humble, and I will no longer try to be humble.
[165]  LIVING BY THE FAITH OF THE SON OF GOD
[166]  The other part of Galatians 2:20 is also very important: And the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God.
[167]  From this point forward, we live by faith in the Son of God.
[168]  CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN SEEKING GOD S WILL Scripture Reading: John 7:17; Matt 10:29-31; 18:15-20; Rom 8:14; Psa 119:105; 1 John 2:27 I. THE NEED TO OBEY GOD S WILL
[169]  Before we were saved, we did everything according to our own will.
[170]  At that time we served ourselves and did everything to please ourselves.
[171]  We would do anything as long as it pleased us or made us happy.
[172]  However, now we have believed in the Lord and have accepted Christ Jesus as our Savior.
[173]  We no longer should walk according to our preference; we must walk according to God s will.
[174]  After becoming Christians, we will find our path filled with peace and joy if we do not walk according to our own will but learn to submit to and obey God s will.
[175]  However, we should have the assurance that not only do we want to obey God s will, but God Himself also wants us to obey His will.
[176]  Luke 12:6 says, Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria?
[177]  God s will is not only revealed through the environment and made known through the indwelling Spirit; it is also revealed to us through the Bible.
[178]  God s will is revealed in the form of principles and examples in the Bible.
[179]  Suppose someone has invited you to work, and you have the intention to do a certain thing, or someone has advised you to reconsider your future, etc. How can you know whether these things are according to God s will? First, you should look at the teaching of the Bible.
[180]  If it is God s will, what you see outwardly will surely line up with what you see inwardly and what you see from the Bible.
[181]  In seeking God s will concerning a certain matter, you should be clear about the Spirit s leading, the Scripture s teaching, and the environment s provision.
[182]  As much as it is possible, you should also fellowship with those who know God in the church to see whether they will say amen to your guidance.
[183]  This will give you additional confirmation concerning God s will.
[184]  If they can say amen, you can be sure that what you have is God s will.
[185]  The Lord Jesus says, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven v. 18 . Because the church is God s habitation and the beacon of God s light, we need to believe that God s will is revealed in the church.
[186]  First John 2:27 says, And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things...
[187]  Finally, even if we have all the right methods, not everyone knows God s will.
[188]  It is futile for a rebellious man to seek to know God s will.
[189]  If a man wants to know God s will, he must have an inward yearning to do His will.
[190]  This shows that our ears have to listen to God s word all the time if we are to serve Him.
[191]  If you have an intense and absolute desire to do God s will, God will make known His will to you even when you know nothing about the methods.
[192]  If your heart is completely inclined toward the Lord and you say, Lord, I want Your will; I really want it, God will show you His will.
[193]  CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT MANAGING ONE S FINANCES Scripture Reading: Luke 6:38; 1 Tim 6:7-10, 17-19; 2 Cor 9:6; Mal 3:10; Prov 11:24; Phil 4:15-19 I. MANAGING ACCORDING TO GOD S PRINCIPLES
[194]  In this chapter we will cover monetary offering and giving.
[195]  After a person has sold everything, he will still receive income; money will still find its way back to his hand.
[196]  Even after a person has offered up all of his money, we should not think that money will no longer have an influence on him.
[197]  After you have forsaken all of your possessions to follow the Lord, you should walk according to God s principle.
[198]  I have seen a few brothers and sisters who fell into dire need because they were unfaithful in the matter of giving.
[199]  Throughout his life, he experienced wants and trials many times, but because he knew Luke 6:38, he would tell his wife whenever he was in need, There must be something wrong with our giving lately.
[200]  As soon as I entered his house, his wife said, Mr. Nee, when you left Foochow, why did you give my husband twenty dollars? Why did you walk away immediately after handing him the money? I said, There was only one reason: I had prayed for a whole day, and the Lord told me to give it to him.
[201]  The Christian way of managing money is not to hold on to money.
[202]  The tighter you hold on to your money, the more it dies.
[203]  The more you grasp it, the more it disappears; it will evaporate like vapor.
[204]  But the more you give away, the more you will have.
[205]  God will not entrust Himself to those who hold on to their money and who will not give.
[206]  If you see a brother or sister in difficulty, and you remember him or her, God will cause that money to grow and harvest thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and even a hundredfold.
[207]  In the Old Testament, God said to the Israelites, Bring the whole tithe to the storehouse that there may be food in My house; and prove Me, if you will, by this, says Jehovah of hosts, whether I will open to you the windows of heaven and pour out blessing for you until there is no room for it Mal 3:10 .
[208]  Now read Proverbs 11:24: There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; / and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.
[209]  Many people have not scattered, and they are left with nothing.
[210]  CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE OCCUPATION Scripture Reading: 2 Thes 3:10-12
[211]  If one chooses a wrong occupation, he will not be able to go on in a positive way.
[212]  From these God-approved occupations in the Bible, we can see a basic principle: Man must receive or take from nature, or he must earn his wages in exchange for his time and labor.
[213]  Since Adam, God s eyes have been on occupations that produce, because production increases the abundance of the earth rather than imposing poverty on others.
[214]  I hope you can differentiate between pure commerce and production.
[215]  If a brother buys ten tents and resells them, he does not have the same occupation as Paul s. If I make tents at night and then sell them in the morning, I have the same occupation as Paul s. The two are absolutely different.
[216]  If you labor on something and then sell what you have labored on, this is something that can be blessed by God.
[217]  But if you buy something and then sell it, hoping in your heart that you will make money in the process, you are engaging in the lowest occupation, not only from a Christian s point of view, but also from a Gentile s as well.
[218]  I do not wish to see anyone taking the extreme way.
[219]  Do not condemn those who are engaged in commerce as soon as you meet them.
[220]  In order to be a good Christian, one needs to deal with all the basic issues in a thorough way.
[221]  If there is one basic issue that is not settled, whether it be the family or one s occupation, problems will eventually come back.
[222]  As long as there is one unresolved issue, a Christian will not be able to take a straight path before the Lord.
[223]  A new believer should know what God s Word has to say about marriage.
[224]  BASIC ELEMENTS OF A MARRIAGE A. Rendering Mutual Help
[225]  God did not say that it was good on the second day, because the firmament was the place of Satan.
[226]  Moreover, on the sixth day, God did not say that it was good ; in fact, He even said that something was not good after He created man.
[227]  If a man constantly committed the sin of pride, Paul could not have said, Since you always commit the sin of pride, you can be proud at home so that you will not be proud elsewhere!
[228]  In his first Epistle, Peter said that the wives are fellow heirs of the grace of life 3:7 .
[229]  In other words, God delights to see husbands and wives serving Him together.
[230]  Those who keep their virginity have much to gain before the Lord.
[231]  Paul s word in the New Testament is clear enough.
[232]  In 1 Corinthians 7:39, he told the widows to marry those who were in the Lord.
[233]  B. If He Does Not Care, the Lord Will Save Him
[234]  Paul said that there is no need to separate if the other party does not care.
[235]  How do you know that the Lord will not save him through you?
[236]  If he does not care and wants to continue living with you, Paul said that you should be at peace with him and should not leave.
[237]  Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife? v. 16 . If the other party wants to leave, that is his concern, not yours.
[238]  But if he does not want to leave, you have to believe that the Lord will save him.
[239]  It may not be that easy for the Lord to save others, but it would surely be easy for the Lord to save one who is already yours.
[240]  You have been engaged to someone, and now you have become a Christian.
[241]  What should you do if the other party insists on marrying you?
[242]  Here is something that you can do: Negotiate the terms with him ahead of time.
[243]  You can say, I will definitely marry you, but I would like to settle a few matters with you before marriage.
[244]  Even though you are marrying the other person, he must give you the liberty to serve the Lord.
[245]  Editor s Note: Watchman Nee dealt with the matter of concubines because of the problem at this point in China s history.
[246]  Nowhere in the Bible does God ask man to send his concubine away.
[247]  Exodus 21:9-11 specifies that if a master betroths a maid to his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
[248]  If the son properly marries another later, the maid will become a concubine.
[249]  God s ordination is clear: Her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage shall he not diminish.
[250]  If he does not do these three things to her, she shall go out free and be a slave no more.
[251]  Thus, if anyone thinks that he cannot have intercourse with his concubine, he is not keeping the law of God.
[252]  If it is mentioned three or more times, we need to integrate the different portions before we can arrive at a conclusion about God s teaching.
[253]  In the Bible God acknowledges the validity of sex.
[254]  CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE CHOOSING A MATE Scripture Reading: Gen 2:18 I. THE IMPORTANCE OF CHOOSING A MATE
[255]  When God created man, He considered Adam to be one half and Eve to be another half.
[256]  Man was not a complete man until the two halves were put together.
[257]  The only exceptions are those who have received God s gift of keeping their virginity.
[258]  Most Bible teachers agree that to God s children, mating means searching for the other half.
[259]  If you do not like his company, or if it is not something of an enjoyment to you, you should not marry him, because you are short of one basic factor of marriage.
[260]  Fourth, one has to pay attention to the family of the other party.
[261]  There is a familiar expression in the West, which says, I am marrying So-and-so, not her family.
[262]  All you need to do is to see if the other side s family has a high standard of morality or a lofty set of values.
[263]  Generally speaking, women mature and age faster than men.
[264]  In a marriage, the man should generally be five, six, or even seven to eight years older than the woman, as far as physical age is concerned.
[265]  Some people are not only affectionate but also kind.
[266]  They do not want to hurt or offend anyone and are always considerate of others.
[267]  If one chooses a husband or a wife who is also kind and considerate, who is happy to preserve the pride of others, and who never wants to embarrass others, he or she will always feel happy and optimistic.
[268]  Some people are very exact in what they say.
[269]  If you put these two kinds of people together, one may criticize the other for telling lies while the other may say that it is better to keep quiet than to speak as the other one does.
[270]  There is another aspect of personality and human consideration that we have to take care of.
[271]  When you contemplate marrying a person, you must ask whether that person can get along with others.
[272]  Marriage means a living together, and it is a big question whether or not a person can live together with others.
[273]  If a brother is at odds with his father, mother, brothers, and sisters, you can only expect an unhappy marriage if you marry him.
[274]  If a sister cannot get along with anyone and is always in conflict with others, you can be sure that there will be little happiness if you take her for your wife.
[275]  If you wait until you are married, you will see that he also will have no respect for you.
[276]  CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO HUSBAND AND WIFE Scripture Reading: Col 3:18-19; 1 Pet 3:1-7; Eph 5:22-23
[277]  We have already covered the subject of choosing a mate.
[278]  After a person is married, he should learn to close his eyes so that he does not see.
[279]  You have to learn before the Lord to close your eyes the day you are married.
[280]  Once we are married, we have to learn to appreciate each other s virtues.
[281]  In a family we need to learn to close our eyes to each other s faults and accommodate each other on the one hand, and we need to learn to appreciate each other s virtues on the other hand.
[282]  It is repugnant for anyone to be impolite to others.
[283]  You should treat everyone politely, no matter who he or she may be.
[284]  No matter how familiar you are with a friend, you should never give up your manners.
[285]  No matter how close you are to others, you will lose them the moment you give up your manners.
[286]  There is another factor crucial to our manner our voice.
[287]  We may say similar things, but the way we say it may be different.
[288]  There is another consideration which is very important for the family: One must not be selfish.
[289]  If you are married, you must live like a married person.
[290]  What should we do when there are disputes between the husband and the wife?
[291]  However, since both are adults and are children of God, they must learn to know what the other person s problem is, and where they differ.
[292]  Between the two persons in the family, there must be confession and forgiveness.
[293]  Many mistakes need to be confessed, not just ignored.
[294]  Do not be careless about your own faults; you must always confess them.
[295]  Apart from the book of Proverbs, the Old Testament does not seem to give us much teaching concerning parenting.
[296]  If we try to summarize the words in the Bible concerning parenting, the main thing parents should do is nurture their children in the teaching and admonition of the Lord and not provoke them to anger or discourage them.
[297]  The day your son is born is the day you should consecrate yourself.
[298]  You must set a high standard for what is ideal, and you must also set a standard for yourself in spiritual matters.
[299]  When you do not have children, you can do whatever you like when you are happy and give up and forget about everything when you are unhappy.
[300]  Second, parents must not only realize their responsibility and sanctify themselves for the sake of their children; they must also walk with God.
[301]  One sanctifies himself for the sake of his children.
[302]  But this does not mean that he can be loose and careless when he is by himself.
[303]  No matter how much zeal you show in your children s presence, they can easily see through you if you are not genuinely zealous.
[304]  You must not only sanctify yourself before them for their sake, but you must also be genuinely holy in yourself, walking with God as Enoch did.
[305]  Third, the father and mother must be of one mind in order for a family to be healthy.
[306]  They must be of one mind in sacrificing their own freedom for God s sake and in raising up a strict moral standard.
[307]  In addition, you should show proper appreciation for your children when they perform well.
[308]  Sometimes you are not making a promise, but giving an order.
[309]  If you open your mouth to ask your children to do something, you must make sure that it is done.
[310]  You have to make them realize that you mean what you say.
[311]  You should not tell your children that it is all right if they do not carry out your order this time, just as long as they do it the next time.
[312]  You should show your children that once you say something, they must carry it out whether or not you remember it.
[313]  For example, if you tell your child to sweep his room every morning, you must first consider whether or not it is within his ability to do it.
[314]  The biggest thing about a child is his aspirations.
[315]  I hope that we will pay attention to this matter.
[316]  In many aspects we have to teach our children according to the discipline of the Lord.
[317]  Eighth, we must lead them to the knowledge of the Lord.
[318]  You must pay attention to the matter of their repentance and then bring them to the Lord.
[319]  In this way you will lead your children to the knowledge of God.
[320]  When a child has done something wrong, he or she must be punished.
[321]  Brothers and sisters, when your children do something wrong, and you beat them in your anger, you should realize that you also should be beaten.
[322]  CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR FRIENDS Scripture Reading: James 4:4; 2 Cor 6:14-18; Psa 1; 1 Cor 15:33 I. THE BIBLE
[323]  One thing special about the Bible is that it does not say much about friendship among God s children.
[324]  But the friendship spoken of in the Bible primarily refers to friendship outside of Christ; the Bible does not say much about making friends with those who are in the Lord.
[325]  God, however, has ordained that we terminate our friendships after we have believed in the Lord Jesus.
[326]  For we are the temple of the living God, even as God said, I will dwell among them and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.
[327]  Therefore come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean; and I will welcome you ; and I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me, says the Lord Almighty 2 Cor 6:14-18 .
[328]  You have believed in the Lord and you know what righteousness is.
[329]  First Corinthians 15:33 says, Do not be deceived: Evil companionships corrupt good morals.
[330]  But many times we feel that we do not need to be so stifled when we are among them; we feel that if we loosen up a little, they will welcome us more.
