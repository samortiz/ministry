   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE CORPORATE LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE NEED FOR SHEPHERDING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I thank the Lord that in the last few years, especially since 1991, about two years after we started the full-time training in Anaheim, the Lord has been blessing us in many ways for spreading and for revival.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Everything is quite encouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The one thing we all have to admit, though, is that we are short of fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is not only our problem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This has been a problem to all Christians throughout the past two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If each regenerated believer would bear one fruit yearly, within less than twenty years, the entire world would be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, after almost two thousand years of church history, today s situation related to fruit-bearing is far short of what it should be.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since the end of World War II, the Muslim religion, not Christianity, has been the religion with the most increase.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a shame to us Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>FRUIT-BEARING BEING TO GAIN PEOPLE ONE BY ONE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Fruit-bearing is a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I studied this matter for a long time even before 1984, when I went to Taiwan to study our situation and consider how we should go on.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I found out, in principle, that fruit-bearing is not something of a mass movement.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It does not take place by great campaigns.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fruit-bearing takes place according to two principles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first principle is seen in God s creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God created only one man, Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Man s multiplication, man s fruit-bearing, is not by mass production but by individual persons bearing children to have a family.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the most, in principle, a family can bear one child a year, twins being an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After about six thousand years, the whole earth has been replenished with man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The second principle of fruit-bearing is seen in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is the vine tree and we are His branches to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As branches of Christ, according to John 15, our unique responsibility is to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Fruit-bearing is by the branches individually.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Each branch bears its fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This shows us that to have a movement to gain fruit by mass production is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The evangelists in Christianity have big gospel campaigns to convert many people, but where are those people today?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even we have the concept to have big gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may bring several thousand people together to hear the gospel, and take many names, but how many of them do we really gain practically?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our churches remain relatively the same in number year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The increase is too slow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I read something which said that a Christian group with an honest pastor who faithfully teaches the Bible and preaches the gospel will gain a yearly increase of ten percent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do we have this ten percent increase?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This shows us that there is a problem with our fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The problem, I believe, is not with our spiritual life but with our way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Recently, we have seen that John 4:14 reveals the flowing God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order for a river to flow, there must be a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is why we must study our way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I went to Taiwan in 1984, I thought that we should endeavor to baptize many people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this point we gained a success, but eventually this did not work so well.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We had a big gathering in Taipei to gain people through door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day we tried to gain three thousand, and we succeeded.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although we gained so many, not many of them are remaining fruit in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may say that whether they remain in the church or not, they are still saved persons, but this is not practical.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eventually, I found out that the proper fruit-bearing is by individual believers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why I started to speak in the United States concerning the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The vital groups are for fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They are for gaining people one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This earth on which we live is like a great sea full of fish.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since thousands of fish are passing around us day by day, how can we say that we cannot catch one of them within one year?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Is it possible for someone to fish for a year and not catch one fish?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet for many years this has been the situation among us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because I have shared concerning the vital groups, we still at least keep the name vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some call themselves vital groups, but are they vital?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some have had vital group meetings for three years, but instead of increasing, they have decreased.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because of this, some have reported to me, saying that door-knocking does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Two great heretical groups in the United States, the Mormons and the Jehovah s Witnesses, depend almost entirely upon door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They have nearly no other way for their increase.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They only use the one way of door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>According to their statistics of around 1990, the Jehovah s Witnesses in Japan say that they need to knock on six thousand doors to gain one person.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, some of us have only been going out for three weeks or three months without gaining one person and then say that door-knocking does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I do not even believe that the Jehovah s Witnesses or Mormons have the best way of door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>According to my study, we have a much better way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I have not spoken enough on the vital groups due to the shortage of time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>From this time I will speak on the vital groups for a whole term of the full-time training.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Through this speaking we will be able to see that the Lord has shown us a much better way to gain people through door-knocking than that of the Mormons and Jehovah s Witnesses.</S>
