   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FEEDING THE FIVE THOUSAND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the forerunner of the gospel was martyred, the Slave-Savior said to His disciples, Come you yourselves privately to a place in the wilderness and rest a while v. 31 . In order to rest, they went away in the boat to a place in the wilderness privately.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nevertheless, a great crowd followed them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the one hand, in this chapter we have rejection, hatred, and injustice.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the other hand, the crowd was still following the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Mark 6:34 says, And coming out from the boat, He saw a great crowd and had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd; and He began to teach them many things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His expression of compassion exhibited the Slave-Savior s virtue in His humanity, which was carried out by the power of His deity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the disciples suggested to the Lord that He send the crowd away, He answered, You give them something to eat vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>35-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Slave-Savior had compassion on the people and wanted to feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Five Loaves and Two Fishes</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all know that the Lord used five loaves and two fishes to feed the five thousand vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>38-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 6:9 tells us that these five loaves were barley loaves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In figure, barley typifies the resurrected Christ Lev 23:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus the barley loaves signify Christ in resurrection as food to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The loaves are of the vegetable life, signifying the generating aspect of Christ s life, but the fishes are of the animal life, signifying the redeeming aspect of Christ s life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To satisfy our spiritual hunger, we need Christ s generating life as well as His redeeming life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Both of these aspects are signified by small items loaves and fishes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Offering What We Have</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The five loaves and two fishes also indicate that whatever we have of the Lord we need to bring to Him so that it may become a great blessing to many others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord often uses what we offer to Him to provide for the need of others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not look down on our experience and say, We don t have much of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have not experienced much of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Look at what the Lord can do with five loaves and two fishes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord does not require more than we have.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we give Him what we have, He will bless it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we present what we have to Him, He will pour out the blessing, bestowing His unlimited blessing on what we present to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 43 says, And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here we see the result of the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This not only displayed the Slave-Savior s power of deity as the Creator, who calls the things not being as being Rom 4:17 , but also signified the bountiful and inexhaustible supply of His divine life Eph 3:8; Phil 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am burdened that we would be impressed with the pictures in 4:35 5:43 and 6:1-44.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not be bothered or disappointed by the fact that the number of those in the Lord s recovery in this country is still rather small.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is our destiny to be despised and rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may even say that God has predestinated us for this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even the God-man was despised and rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If He was rejected, then we should not expect anything different.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, the Lord s forerunner, John the Baptist, who was a landmark in history, was imprisoned and martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If such a thing could happen to John the Baptist, then we should not expect something better.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not be frightened by the fact that it is our destiny to be rejected, hated, imprisoned, and even martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead of discouraging us from taking the Lord s way in His recovery, this should encourage us to present what we have to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may have only five loaves and two fishes, but we can give this to Him for His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we give the Lord what we have, He will bestow His blessing on what we offer to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The result will be that others will be fed and satisfied, and there will be twelve baskets left over.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No matter how much rejection, hatred, and injustice there may be, we nevertheless have the kingdom life today.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this kingdom life people are healed, nourished, fed, and satisfied, and there is an abundance left over.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is an accurate picture of today s church life.</S>
