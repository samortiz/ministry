<h2 class="head2">A Conference in Meixian (Shensi Province)</h2><p>We stayed in Meixian for ten days and preached the gospel on three days. Thirty-six brothers and sisters were baptized. The atmosphere of the gospel is very burning, and the brothers are all doing very well. There are now more than ninety people in the meetings, with at least one third who have turned from the denominations (mostly from the China Inland Mission). Christianity has a sixty-year history in Meixian. Some people from the denominations told me that they started using our hymnal and reading The Present Testimony twenty years ago. The responsible brothers now are all their sons and students. We had more than ten edification meetings there, and people came from villages as far as thirty miles away to gladly receive the ministry of the word. This was the Lord's work; man cannot do anything. The responsible brother, Jia Xiu-gi, is a young brother (twenty-nine years old). We recommend him to you for some edification. Please accept him.</p><p>We have received four application forms for Kuling from Lanchow. Because we will not return to Sian until the twenty-fourth, we will be a little late in forwarding the applications. It would be best if you could send us a few more forms. I personally would like to attend the fourth session of the training and be edified by it.</p><p>Lee Yin-xin<br />February 27, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: 22 North Sichun, Meixian, Shensi province</p><h2 class="head2">A Door for the Gospel Being Opened (Tsingtao)</h2><p>I received the four copies of Messages for Building Up New Believers which you sent. They were immediately passed on to the four regions of Tsingtao for their use. Because the needs in Jiaoxian, Kaomi, and Pahe were urgent, I gave them two copies. Their condition in the Lord is very good. The Lord has manifested His special doings in Qixiaxian. After the brothers finished working there, they were arrested and taken to Chefoo, but they were later released on bail. All the brothers went to work with a mind to suffer.</p><p>Last week 340 were baptized in the church in Tsingtao, and they were filled with the Lord's presence! One woman who had to crawl on her hands and legs was healed! There were also more than twenty who had once tried to commit suicide, but who were called back by the Lord. Once they were saved, they made marvelous improvement. The door for the gospel is really opened.</p><p>Chang Tze-jieh<br />June 24, 1950</p><p>The church here has prepared three or four rooms for those who come to Tsingtao to rest. In addition, we have another floor. Is any co-worker willing to come? If anyone wants to come, please tell me, as I hope to be able to meet you in Chinan.</p><p>Chang Tze-jieh<br />July 11</p><p>Mailing Address: 4 Long Shan Road, Tsingtao</p>
