   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUILDING ON THE UNIQUE FOUNDATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verses 10 and 11 Paul speaks directly and explicitly concerning Christ as the foundation: According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, but another builds upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But let each one take heed how he builds upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here Paul indicates that he had already laid Christ as the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this universe there is just one foundation, and we should not lay another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must not say that we are of a certain person or a certain thing, that we prefer a certain matter, or that we choose a certain locality for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To speak in this way is to lay another foundation in addition to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead of laying another foundation, we need to build upon the foundation already laid.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In today s Christianity there are many other foundations, but there is virtually no building upon the foundation already laid.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord s recovery must be altogether different.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the recovery we should never lay another foundation; we should simply build on the foundation which was laid more than nineteen hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We thank the Lord that, in His mercy, He has recovered this unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many years ago, in China, we took a strong stand for Christ as the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We had to declare to those in the denominations that we could not have any foundation other than Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a result, many things had to be put aside so that Christ alone would be exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now that the unique foundation has been laid, we should build upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 3:10 Paul says, But let each one take heed how he builds upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we refer to how we do a certain thing, we usually mean the way, not the material used.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When referring to the material, we usually say, What are you building with?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not ask, How are you building?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But in the Bible these two are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How we build upon the foundation is equivalent to what we build with.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, according to the Bible, the material used in building is the way we build.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to our natural thought, the material is one thing and the way is another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The material refers to a substance, but the way refers to skill or technique.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But in the Bible the substance is the technique; the material is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, the Bible pays little attention to skill or technique, but devotes much attention to the material.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul s concern is not by what way or method we build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His concern is what material we use in building.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>TWO WAYS OF BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verse 12 Paul refers to two ways of building: But if anyone builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first way is to build with gold, silver, and precious stones; the second way is to build with wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here we have two categories of building materials.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Gold, silver, and precious stones are minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Wood, grass, and stubble are related to the plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We in the Lord s recovery all are doing the work of building.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, we must take heed how we build.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Are we building with gold, silver, and precious stones, or with wood, grass, and stubble?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul s word in 3:12 is not only for elders or co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the contrary, it is written to every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is included in an Epistle addressed to the church in Corinth, with all those who call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, this verse is intended for all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It applies to you and also to me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the building of the church we ourselves are used as material.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since we are the building material, we need to ask what kind of material we are.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Are we wood or gold, silver or grass, precious stones or stubble?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many of us may answer this question by saying that we are in the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, in a sense we are both wood and gold, grass and silver, stubble and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Using an example from the insect world, we may compare ourselves to a caterpillar in a cocoon in the process of becoming a butterfly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the one hand, we are still a caterpillar; on the other hand, there are signs that we are becoming a butterfly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The process of transformation has begun, but it is not yet complete.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are all on the way of transformation; we are in the process of being transformed.</S>
