 <h2 class="head3">3. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit<br />
All Being Eternal</h2>
<p>The Father is eternal (Isa. 9:6). The Son is eternal (Heb. 1:12; 7:3). The Spirit also is eternal (Heb. 9:14). Hence, all Three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;are eternal.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit<br />
Coexisting Simultaneously</h2>
<p>In John 14:16-17 the Son says that He will pray to the Father that the Father may send the Spirit. [In Ephesians 3:14-17 Paul says that he will pray to the Father that He would grant us to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into our inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts. Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo;] [Therefore, we do not believe that the Father ceased to exist and was replaced by the Son, then after another period of time the Son was replaced by the Spirit. We believe that the Three&mdash;Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;are eternal and co-existent.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit<br />
Coinhering and Being Inseparable</h2>
<p>[The relationship among the Father, the Son, and the Spirit of the Trinity is not only that they simultaneously coexist, but, even more, that they indwell one another mutually. Coexistence means to exist together at the same time. Coinherence, as applied to the Trinity, means that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are in one another and thus exist together.] John 5:43 tells us that the Son came in the name of the Father. This equals the Father&rsquo;s coming. John 14:10 says that the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son. Hence, the Son can testify saying, &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father&rdquo; (John 14:9). Other verses tell us of similar facts (John 6:46; 8:29; 14:26; 15:26; Luke 4:1). [The Triune God has never been separated. When One moves, the other Two also move with Him. When One is sent, the other Two also come with Him. When the Son comes, He comes in the name of the Father; when He comes, the Father comes. When the Spirit is sent, He is sent in the name of the Son; His being sent is the Son&rsquo;s being sent. Hence, the Son&rsquo;s coming is the Father&rsquo;s coming, and the Spirit&rsquo;s being sent is the Son&rsquo;s being sent. The Three&mdash;the Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;are one. They cannot be separated for eternity.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. The Three&mdash;<br />
the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;<br />
Being One</h2>
<p>The Son is the Father. [Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called...Mighty God, Eternal Father.&rdquo; In this verse, the mighty God matches the child, and the everlasting Father matches the Son. Yes, He is a child, yet He is the mighty God. The child who was born in the manger of Bethlehem was the mighty God. Just as the child and the mighty God are one, so also the Son and the eternal Father are one. The Son is the eternal Father.]</p>
<p>The Son became the life-giving Spirit. [First Corinthians 15:45 states, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; The last Adam, of course, is the incarnated Lord Jesus, and the life-giving Spirit, of course, is the Holy Spirit. There can never be another life-giving Spirit besides the Holy Spirit.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Reason for God Being Triune</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; Here we see that the Triune God is dispensing Himself into us. By having the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, we are enjoying the grace of Christ coming out from the love of God. The whole Triune God is here for our enjoyment and experience.</p>
<p>[God is the Triune God. The one, unique God has the aspect of three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all God and are eternal, coexistent, coinherent, and inseparable. To the believers, the Father is the source, the Son is the manifestation, and the Spirit is God reaching and entering into them. Thus, the Triune God is dispensed into their being to be their life, enjoyment, and complete supply.]</p>
