We confess that we are still in the natural life which we received through birth. Our concepts and our understanding of the Bible are very natural. Lord, deliver us from being natural. You have regenerated us so that we would no longer be natural, but we remain in our natural life, and we are natural even in seeking You. Lord, we need You to speak a new word to us once again. Lord, have mercy upon us and be our High Priest, the One who is easily touched by the feeling of our infirmities. Lord, speak a word according to Your high priesthood and shepherd us and take care of us, especially of the co-workers who have been speaking for years in a natural way without any real understanding. Lord, be merciful to us and bless us under Your mercy. Amen.</P><P>In the Lord's recovery we need to learn how to know the Bible in its intrinsic significance. If we know the Bible in this way, we will have a proper theology. The theology of today's Christianity is wrong or inadequate in many ways. We have been raised up, taught, and trained under the influence of this theology, and we are still under its influence. Either consciously or subconsciously, the influence of the theology of Christianity remains in our being. We need to uproot this influence and not follow the way of the old theology in presenting messages.</P><P>In the previous message we saw that the issue of Christ's being glorified is an incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers. Before we begin to consider the three aspects of this incorporation, I would like to say a further word about the universal incorporation as the issue of Christ's glorification.</P><P>I have spent more than seventy years studying the Bible, but only very recently did I see that the Bible actually unveils just one thing&#151;the universal incorporation. The purposeful God has an economy, and in His economy He intends to have a universal incorporation. Deep within Himself, God has the purpose to produce a universal incorporation. Eventually, for eternity in the new heaven and new earth, there will be the New Jerusalem, the unique goal of God in His economy.</P><P>Although we have seen that the New Jerusalem is the goal of God's economy, we did not see that the New Jerusalem is an incorporation. In Revelation 21:2 the apostle John says, "I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem," and in the next verse he speaks of the New Jerusalem as "the tabernacle of God." As the tabernacle of God the New Jerusalem is God's dwelling place. We are quite familiar with this aspect of the New Jerusalem; it has become old knowledge to us. Now we need to learn something new and see that as the tabernacle of God the New Jerusalem is the universal incorporation.</P><P>At this juncture we need to consider the Lord's word to the church in Pergamos (2:12-17), the third of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3. Pergamos in Greek means "marriage," implying union. As a sign, the church in Pergamos prefigures the church that entered into a marriage union with the world to be one with the world. As part of His promise to the overcomer in Pergamos, the Lord Jesus said, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna" (v. 17). The hidden manna refers to Christ. Manna is a type of Christ as the heavenly food that enables God's people to go His way. A portion of manna was preserved in a golden pot concealed in the ark (Exo. 16:32-34; Heb. 9:4). This hidden manna, signifying the hidden Christ, is a special portion reserved for His overcoming believers, who overcome the degradation of the worldly church. While the church goes the way of the world, these overcomers come forward to abide in the Holy of Holies, where they enjoy the hidden Christ as a special portion for their daily supply.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Issue of Christ Being Glorified by the Father with the Divine Glory &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
