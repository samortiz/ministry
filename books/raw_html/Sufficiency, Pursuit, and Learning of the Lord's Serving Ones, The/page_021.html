         <h2 class="head2">The Stratagem of the Enemy&mdash;<br />
Annulling the Ground of the Church and<br />
Bringing Discord into the Coordination</h2>
<p>In 1949 I moved from the mainland to Taiwan. From then until 1957 the work overseas did not experience problems concerning the ground, nor was there anything unpleasant in our coordination. As a result of external influences, beginning in 1957 there arose among the churches in Taiwan a problem concerning the ground as well as concerning coordination. This caused me to go before the Lord to reflect upon all the leading I had received from Brother Nee. I was clear that the confusion was the result of the enemy&rsquo;s stratagem. The enemy was trying to use every means possible to annul the ground of the church and to bring discord into our coordination. This is the enemy&rsquo;s scheme. He is not afraid of people becoming spiritual, but he hates to see the church being built up on the proper ground.</p>
<p>The serving saints need a clear vision. I have no intention to dispute or to be resentful. I know what the Lord has commissioned me to do. I also know the commission He gave to Brother Nee in his ministry in China. Furthermore, I know the purpose of my coordination with Brother Nee. These items are for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of the co-workers rejoice because they have brought people to salvation, but the co-workers do not understand the purpose of coordination. When we do not hinder the coordination, we do not cause any problems, but once we hinder the coordination, we cause problems. Our senior brother was the first to receive from the Lord the blueprint for the building up of the church. When we invite someone to help us build, we are not asking him to help us draw the blueprint or to change the blueprint, because the blueprint is already drawn. We are carrying out the building work according to the blueprint. When we ask someone to help us, we are asking him to carry out the building work according to the blueprint. For example, it is acceptable to hire an expert painter who knows how to do a paint job that will last three to five years. We can also accept the work of a good carpenter, but we cannot accept any complaints about the blueprint or attempts to change the design of the doors and the windows. Whoever comes to help us in the work should help us only on the technical side. He should not change our blueprint.</p>
<p>In 1955 Brother T. Austin-Sparks came to Taiwan, and we welcomed him. However, after he came again in 1957, we could no longer welcome his ministry. During his first visit, he helped us with spiritual matters, and we are truly grateful. However, instead of helping us during his second visit, he tried to change our blueprint, especially concerning the ground of the church. We cannot accept that.</p>
<p>We must be clear concerning the areas in which we need help. We are indeed lacking in many spiritual matters, and we need to receive help from others. However, concerning the blueprint for the building up of the church, which is related to the ground of the church and the way of coordination, we do not need to receive help from others. It is regrettable that those who have come to help us have not only offered us help in spiritual matters but have also tried to change our blueprint. For the past three hundred years of church history, none of the believers who could render spiritual help to others have surpassed Madame Guyon. It is an undeniable fact that Madame Guyon has rendered spiritual help to others, but she worshipped before the statue of Mary because she was under the influence of Roman Catholicism. We cannot agree with her in this matter. We have received spiritual help from her, but we cannot accept the way that she took, such as worshipping the statue of Mary and observing mass in the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>We can receive spiritual help from any person and from any group. But we became clear twenty years ago that we cannot allow anyone to change our blueprint concerning the ground of the church and the coordination for the building up of the church. I would emphasize again that in terms of spiritual weight, spiritual stature, and spiritual practices, we need to receive help from others. However, we cannot accept anyone who touches our blueprint; that is, we cannot accept someone who tries to change the way of the church ground and our coordination. Our blueprint is the commission for which the Lord has raised us up in this age.</p>
<p>There have been many spiritual brothers in the history of the church. Andrew Murray is one of them. A number of his books, such as <em>Abide in Christ</em> and <em>The Inner Chamber and the Inner Life,</em> are very popular. These books prove that many believers are pursuing spirituality. If no one was pursuing spirituality, these books would not have any readership or have a large circulation. However, we must ask: where is the church? There is enough of so-called spirituality. In these last days the Lord desires to accomplish His heart&rsquo;s desire. Even if not all of God&rsquo;s children are concerned with the matter of the church, He is willing to have a remnant who will fulfill His heart&rsquo;s desire. His desire is for us to keep the ground in many localities and to have the practical coordination so that He can have a practical expression of the Body of His Son. This is the desire of God&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>The co-workers did not become clear concerning the ground of the church and concerning coordination until the 1950s, even though Brother Nee had given us this blueprint earlier on, and it had enabled us to know our way forward. We welcome anyone who desires to help us in spiritual matters; we acknowledge our lack. However, concerning the blueprint, that is, concerning the ground and concerning coordination, it is unnecessary, even futile, for anyone to try to change us. If Brother T. Austin-Sparks&rsquo;s second visit had been the same as his first visit, that is, if he had rendered us help only in spiritual matters, I believe that we would have continued to invite him until today because we need the help. However, during his second visit he wanted to change our blueprint; he wanted to change our practice concerning the ground and our coordination. In his private conversation with me, all the disputes were centered on these points. From that time onward, there was a turmoil raging among us.</p>
<p>For many years Brother Nee led us to learn the ground of the church and coordination. In 1939 he returned from Europe and called a conference, in which he spoke on the Body of Christ and the building up of the church. He did not speak concerning the Body in theory but concerning our practice of the Body. Where is such a practice today? In order to have such a practice, there must be a definite ground locally as well as a practical coordination. Then believers can become a corporate vessel to be the Body of Christ. This is our vision and our goal. This vision has become clearer to us. Problems come because of the ground and coordination. These two items are vital matters. Satan is trying to destroy these two items, and we are contending for them. In recent years we have been attacked because of these two matters. This is a spiritual warfare.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF REVIVAL</h2>
<p>Let us now consider the law of revival. Every feeling that we have from our heart and everything that transpires in our environment are a basis for us to be revived and to enjoy Christ more. Titus 3:5 speaks of &ldquo;the renewing of the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; which takes place within us. The Holy Spirit is doing a renewing work in us. To renew is to revive. Hence, the renewing of the Holy Spirit is the reviving of the Holy Spirit. The work of the Holy Spirit within us is to renew us, that is, to revive us, after we are saved. This is what the Holy Spirit is doing in us.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 4:16 says, &ldquo;Though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.&rdquo; From the context of verses 7 through 9, we can see that the decaying in verse 16 refers to the effect of the environment on us. The treasure in our earthen vessels manifests the excellency of the power of God (v. 7). Hence, we may be cast down, but we are not destroyed (v. 9). All the problems that come upon us destroy our outer man, but they cause our inner man to be renewed day by day. This is revival. The renewing of the Holy Spirit in Titus 3:5 refers to what takes place within us. The decaying of our outer man in 2 Corinthians 4:16 refers to the effect of our environment. The Holy Spirit works within us for our renewing, and the decaying of our outer man through the environment is also for our renewing. This renewing is a revival.</p>
<p>Hence, everything that transpires with us and everything that we encounter in our environment tell us that we need to be renewed. In other words, we need to experience Christ and be revived according to what transpires within us and according to what we encounter in our environment. If we experience or encounter suffering, we should learn to experience Christ as our joy in suffering. If our environment is pressing on us, we should experience Christ as our joy under pressure. This is the way that we follow what the Holy Spirit is doing in us. Through the feelings in our heart and through the circumstances arranged by God in our environment, we experience and gain Christ for us to be renewed and revived.</p>
<p>I hope that we will take this word and put it into practice. The more we practice, the more we will be renewed; that is, we will experience Christ and have His life. This should be our daily and moment-by-moment practice. Every feeling in our heart and everything that transpires in our environment should be the basis for us to experience Christ. Every time that we gain Christ, we are renewed, revived, just as every time we eat or drink we are strengthened and revived. Eating and drinking are the ways that we maintain our physical existence and also grow strong. This principle applies to our spiritual life as well.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
