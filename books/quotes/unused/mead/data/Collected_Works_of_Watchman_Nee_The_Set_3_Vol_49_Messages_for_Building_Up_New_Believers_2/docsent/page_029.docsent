   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TEACHING OF MATTHEW 5</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now let us turn to another portion Matthew 5.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This chapter is different from Leviticus 6, which speaks of transgressions against man just in terms of material things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Matthew 5 deals with more than just transgressions in material things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Matthew 5:23-26 says, "Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Be well disposed quickly toward your opponent at law, while you are with him on the way, lest the opponent deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out from there until you pay the last quadrans."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The quadrans spoken of here do not refer to just physical quadrans.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They refer to the principle of coming up short in something.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord says, "Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This specifically refers to disputes among God's children and among the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you are offering a gift at the altar, that is, if you are offering something to God, and suddenly remember that your brother has something against you, this remembering is God's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Holy Spirit often gives you a necessary thought and reminds you of necessary things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When you remember something or are reminded of something, do not put the thought aside and think that it is merely a thought.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As soon as you remember something, you should carefully deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you remember that your brother has something against you, this means you have transgressed against him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Your transgression may or may not be in material things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps you have offended him by acting unrighteously towards him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The emphasis is not on material things but on that which sets others against you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A new believer should realize that if he offends a person and does not apologize and ask for forgiveness, he is finished as soon as the offended party mentions his name and sighs before God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whatever he offers to God will not be accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whatever he prays will be turned down.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not allow any brother or sister to sigh before God because of us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once he or she sighs, we are finished before God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we have done something wrong or if we have offended or hurt someone, the offended party need not accuse us before God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All he has to say before God is, "Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>So-and-so.." or, for that matter, he just needs to utter an "Oh" and whatever we offer to God will be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All he has to do is sigh a little because of us before God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must not give any brother or sister the reason or the ground to sigh before God because of us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we give him or her a reason to sigh, we will lose all our spiritual prospects and all our gifts to God will be annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you are offering a gift at the altar and remember that your brother has anything against you or has any reason to sigh because of you, do not offer up your gift.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you want to offer to God, "First go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God wants the gift, but you must first be reconciled to others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who are not reconciled to men will not be able to offer a gift to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You must "leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you see the proper way?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You must first go and be reconciled to your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What does it mean to be reconciled to one's brother?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It means to remove the brother's wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You may need to either apologize or recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, the point is to satisfy your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not a matter of adding one-fifth or one-tenth; it is a matter of reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Reconciliation means satisfying the other's demand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When you have offended and transgressed against your brother, when he is disturbed and feels that you are unrighteous, and when you have caused him to sigh before God, your spiritual fellowship with God is interrupted; your spiritual prospects are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You may not have the slightest feeling that you are in darkness, and you may feel that you are all right, but the gift you offer at the altar has become void.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You cannot ask anything of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You cannot even give anything to God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You cannot offer anything to God, much less receive any answer from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You may have offered up everything on the altar, but God is not pleased with any of it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, when you come to God's altar, you must first be reconciled to your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whatever demands he has, you must try your best to satisfy him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Learn to satisfy the righteous requirement of God as well as the righteous requirement of your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You can offer your gift to God only after you have done this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is quite serious.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should not offend others easily.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In particular, we must not offend a brother or a sister lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we offend a brother or a sister, we immediately fall under God's judgment, and it is not easy to be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In verse 25 the Lord emphasized, "Be well disposed quickly toward your opponent at law, while you are with him on the way."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Here is a brother who has suffered injustice at our hand; he is not at peace before God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord's words to us are in human terms.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our brother is like a plaintiff in a court of law.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The expression while you are with him on the way is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today we are all still on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our brother has not died and neither have we.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is here, and we are here.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He is on the way, and we are also on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to be well disposed quickly with him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is very easy for us to not be here someday; it is very easy for us to not be on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is also very easy for our brother to not be here and to not be on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>No one knows who will go first.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>By then it will be too late to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>While he and we are still on the way, that is, while both parties are still here, there is the opportunity to speak to one another and apologize.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should be reconciled to each other quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The door of salvation will not be open forever.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The same is true with the door of mutual confession among the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Brothers have often regretted that they lost their opportunity to confess to each other; the offended party is no longer on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we have any offense toward men, we should seize whatever opportunity we have to be reconciled to them quickly while we are both still on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We do not know whether or not others will be here tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We also do not know whether or not we ourselves will be here tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, we have to be well disposed with the brothers while we are still on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Once one party is no longer on the way, it is impossible to settle the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We have to realize how serious this matter is!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You cannot be nonchalant or careless about it.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>While there is still today, be well disposed with your brother quickly!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If you know that a brother has a complaint against you, you have to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You must try your best to apologize lest there be no opportunity to reconcile later.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Following this, the Lord speaks again in human terms, saying, "Lest the opponent deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out from there until you pay the last quadrans."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We will not go into biblical interpretation concerning the paying of the last quadrans.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We are only pointing out the practice of paying the last quadrans.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We have to see that this matter must be resolved properly.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we do not resolve it properly, the case will not be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The Lord is not speaking of a future judgment or of being thrown into and being released from an actual prison.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The Lord's emphasis is not on these things.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>His concern is that we would be reconciled today, that we would pay every quadrans today, not putting the matter off until later.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We must do this while we are still on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We must not put off the matter today and hope that it will be resolved later.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is unwise, and it does not pay to leave the matter to the future.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>God's children should learn this lesson well.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We must make recompense when recompense is due and confession when confession is due.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We should make recompense again and again and apologize again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We should not allow a brother or sister to harbor any complaint against us.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If our conscience is pure, and the wrong is clearly not on our side, we can be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Otherwise, if there is any wrongdoing on our part, we must confess.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We must be above reproach in our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We should not always think that others are wrong and we are right.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>It is certainly wrong to ignore the complaints of others and to instead insist that we are right.</S>
