<h1 class="title">THE PRAYER THAT APPROPRIATES<br />
THE WORD OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 6:11-20</h1>
<h2 class="head1">APPROPRIATING THE WORD OF GOD<br />
BY PRAYER</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6 ends with the crucial point of prayer. This is not general prayer; rather, it is prayer that appropriates the word of God (vv. 17-18). It is amazing that an Epistle concerning the church concludes with the prayer that appropriates the word of God. This shows that in order to have the proper church life, we must appropriate the word of God by means of all prayer and petition.</p>
<p>Chapters 3 through 5 of Ephesians cover the secrets to experiencing Christ for the church life. We must let Christ make His home in our hearts, be mingled with the Triune God, allow Christ to increase in us for our growth in life, and take Christ as our person for our renewing. These are the secrets to experiencing Christ for the church life. In order to apply these secrets, we must appropriate the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>If we have the word of God, we have Christ, the riches of Christ, the increase of God, and the reality of the Triune God. Christ&rsquo;s person and His work are in the word of God. Therefore, if we are to experience Christ, we must enter into the word of God; that is, we must allow the word of God to enter into us so that it can nourish us. The nutrients in the word of God wash and cleanse us from our old elements and bring in a new element so that we can grow, be renewed, experience the Triune God, and let Christ make His home in our hearts. This is the issue of our appropriating the word of God.</p>
<p>Even though it seems that Ephesians could end with chapter 5, we need chapter 6 to tell us how to appropriate the word of God. Paul begins verse 10 with the word <em>finally,</em> implying that the book is not yet complete. The last section of this book presents the final secret for the church life. This secret is the whole armor of God, which is our weapon to fight against Satan. The armor of God includes girding our loins with truth, putting on the breastplate of righteousness, having our feet shod with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace, taking up the shield of faith, and receiving the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God; we receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit by means of all prayer and petition (vv. 13-17). Prayer is the secret to putting on and using the whole armor of God. We should not pray for prosperity or security, but we should appropriate the word of God through prayer.</p>
<p>Some Christians pray every day, but they usually pray for blessings, security, prosperity, and healing. Very few Christians appropriate the word of the Lord through prayer. Verses 17 and 18 say, &ldquo;Receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition.&rdquo; This indicates that in order to appropriate the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, we must pray. The word of God is not mere letters but the Spirit. To appropriate the sword of the Spirit is to appropriate the word, which is the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord has given us the Bible, and His words are spirit (John 6:63). Hence, Paul says that we should appropriate the word of God, which is the Spirit, by means of all prayer and petition. <em>By means of all prayer</em> does not refer to one prayer, a few prayers, or even many prayers, but to all kinds of prayers. There is prayer and also petition. Prayer is general, but petitions are particular. We need general prayers and also particular petitions. This means that we must pray many times and in many ways in order to appropriate the word of God. We receive the word of God by means of all prayer, not by merely reading or understanding. Therefore, we must pray-read the Bible. Every word in the Bible must become our prayer. We must convert the words of the Bible into prayer.</p>
<p>The book &lsquo;<em>Lord, Thou Saidst&rsquo;</em> is a testimony of the saints&rsquo; experiences of pray-reading over the past centuries. One section of this book is on George Whitefield. George Whitefield lived around the same time as John Wesley, who was a powerful gospel preacher; both were English. George Whitefield pray-read every word of the New Testament in Greek, not in English. Prayer is the best way to appropriate the Lord&rsquo;s word. Pray-reading is the way to be filled with Christ, to live Christ, to flow out Christ, and to express Him in a prevailing way. Many saints throughout the ages have pray-read the Bible. We should pray-read in such a way as well.</p>
<p>We do not need to kneel before the Lord and pray in a feeble way. We often pray for our weaknesses, poverty, troubles, and problems with our children, school, and work. When we pray for the church, we often complain about the problems in our coordination and even accuse the saints of rebelling against the Lord, of falling away, and of not loving the Lord. These are pitiful and feeble prayers. Nevertheless, most Christians pray in such a way.</p>
<p>When we pray, we should forget everything and pray according to Ephesians 6. The primary purpose of prayer is to appropriate the word of God. We must practice this until it becomes our habit. The first thing we should do every day is to appropriate the word of God by prayer. As we appropriate the word of God, it will feed, water, refresh, empower, strengthen, saturate, and enlighten us. It will also adjust, reprove, and cleanse us. Then we will be filled with the Lord inwardly.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Great Mystery-Christ and the Church &nbsp; pg 30</div><br></body></html>
