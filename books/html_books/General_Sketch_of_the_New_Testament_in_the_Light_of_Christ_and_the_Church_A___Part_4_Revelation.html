<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1>
<p>This four-part series is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in the summer of 1964. Parts one and two were given in New York City. Parts three and four were given in Los Angeles, California. These messages were not reviewed by the speaker.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">AN INTRODUCTION<br />
TO THE BOOK OF REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 1:1-2, 9; 19:10; 1:12, 20; 21:23; 22:1; 1:14-15</h1>
<p>The book of Revelation may be compared to a jigsaw puzzle which is difficult to put together. In order to assemble this puzzle, we need to become familiar with every part of it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A BOOK OF CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>In order to see the subject of Revelation, we must first realize that this book is the conclusion of all the foregoing books of the Scriptures. First, it is the conclusion of the books written by the apostle John. John wrote his Gospels, his three Epistles, and the concluding book of Revelation. Therefore, in order to know the subject of Revelation, we must be very familiar with the Gospel of John. This may be compared to learning arithmetic; in order to understand subtraction, we must first understand addition. In the same way, we have to understand the Gospel of John before we come to the last book of the same writer. Nearly all the things found in the Gospel of John are consummated in Revelation. Not only so, almost all of the items mentioned in the twenty-one chapters of John&rsquo;s Gospel are found in the New Jerusalem at the end of Revelation. Therefore, if we do not know the Gospel of John, we cannot know what the New Jerusalem is.</p>
<p>Revelation is also the conclusion of the entire New Testament. In order to understand this book, therefore, we must understand the foregoing twenty-six books. If we do not understand the first twenty-six books, we are not qualified to understand Revelation. To know what the book of Matthew deals with helps in part to understand Revelation. Then to know what Mark deals with is a further help to understand Revelation, and so on with Luke and all the following books.</p>
<p>Third, Revelation is the conclusion of all the sixty-six books of the Scriptures. Therefore, in order to understand this book, we have to know all the books written by John, all the books of the New Testament, and all the books of the entire Scriptures. Nearly every crucial term, clause, and phrase in Revelation is taken from either the Old Testament or the other New Testament books. We must become familiar with all the terms, the phraseology, the terminology, and the titles in the entire Scriptures. If we have an adequate knowledge of all the Scriptures, we will be qualified to understand Revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS OUR LIFE<br />
AND THE CHURCH AS HIS EXPRESSION</h2>
<p>In order to know the subject of this book, we must understand what the subject of the entire Scriptures is. The subject of the entire Scriptures is Christ as our life and the church as His expression or, stated more briefly, Christ and the church (Eph. 5:32). As we have seen, the entire New Testament presents a picture of a universal man, having Christ as the Head and the church as the Body. Since the New Testament is the fulfillment of the Old Testament, the entire Scriptures are also a picture of this universal man. Christ is the very life and content of this universal man, and the church is the very expression and manifestation. Revelation as the conclusion of the entire Scriptures has the same subject. It reveals to us that Christ is the center, the reality, the centrality, and the universality. He is the life and the content of the new man, and the church is His expression and manifestation.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this book there are seven lampstands (1:12, 20). The seven lampstands symbolize seven local churches. Each local church is a lampstand to hold a lamp and shine forth the light. Chapter twenty-one tells us that God is the light and Christ is the lamp (v. 23). At the beginning there are the local churches as the lampstands in each locality to hold Christ as the lamp with God as the light. Then at the end of this book there is the ultimate, universal, great lampstand, which is the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is a city, and the city proper, which is a mountain, is of pure gold (21:2, 16, 18). At the top of this golden mountain there is the throne of God and of the Lamb (22:1). The One on the throne is Christ as the lamp and God as the light within the lamp. Therefore, the entire city proper is a golden lampstand.</p>
<p>If we carefully read chapter twenty-one and the first part of twenty-two, we will realize that the New Jerusalem is a mountain, at the center and top of which is the throne of God and Christ. The Lamb is the lamp, and within Him is God as the light. This indicates that the entire city of New Jerusalem is a golden lampstand holding Christ as the lamp with God as the light to shine forth. At the beginning of Revelation there are local churches as the golden lampstands, and at the end of the book there is the universal, unique lampstand. This shows us that Christ is the very center, the very reality, the life, and the content of the church, which is a composition of the redeemed ones of God as the expression of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS</h2>
<p>Revelation 1:1-2 says, &ldquo;The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves the things that must quickly take place; and He made it known by signs, sending it by His angel to His slave John, who testified the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, even all that he saw.&rdquo; Verse 9 says, &ldquo;I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.&rdquo; Revelation 19:10b speaks again of the testimony of Jesus saying, &ldquo;I am your fellow slave and a fellow slave of your brothers who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of the prophecy.&rdquo; We should never consider that Revelation deals only with prophecies. When it deals with prophecy, it reveals the testimony of Jesus as the spirit of the prophecy. The testimony of Jesus is mainly of two things&mdash;on the positive side, that God is brought into man and man is brought into God, and on the negative side, that all the things that Satan brought in have been terminated on the cross by Christ&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Throughout human history, many biographies have recorded the history of human lives. With every record of a human life there are many things of Satan, sin, death, the world, idols, and the kingdom of darkness. There is only one record of a human life like that of Jesus, especially as recorded in the Gospel of John. In this biography there is the record of the human life of a person who was full of God and in whom was nothing of Satan, sin, death, the world, idols, or the authority of darkness. In the universe and throughout the history of the human race there has never been a life like this one. Everyone else&rsquo;s life is a life with Satan, sin, death, the world, idols, and darkness and with almost nothing of God. By His incarnation Christ brought God into man, and by His death and resurrection He uplifted the human nature and brought it into God, producing a mutual mingling of God with man. Now all the negative things have been dealt with, put away, and terminated, and God is mingled with man. Now God abides in man and man abides in God. This is the testimony of Jesus.</p>
<p>The book of Acts is the continuation of the record in the Gospels. The four Gospels are a record of the life of Jesus, and Acts is the continuation of this life story. In the continuation of the story of this wonderful man, there is the testimony of Jesus. The testimony of Jesus is the church life. The church life is not merely a group of elders, deacons, and believers put together. The church life is the testimony of Jesus, a testimony that God is mingled with man and man is living in God, and that all the negative things&mdash;Satan, sin, death, the world, idols, and the kingdom of darkness&mdash;have been dealt with and put away.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST</h2>
<p>As we have seen, the church is a golden lampstand holding Christ as its very reality, life, and everything, and within Christ as the lamp is God as light. The beginning of this book reveals the local churches as the lampstands holding Christ with God, and at the end of this book there is a universal expression composed of all the redeemed ones as a lampstand holding Christ as the center, as the reality, as the life, and as everything, with God as the light. This is the subject of the book of Revelation. Therefore, this book is the revelation of Jesus Christ (1:1). The revelation of Jesus Christ is not only an objective revelation given by Christ, unveiling certain matters in the future; it is a subjective revelation of Christ, revealing Christ Himself to us. The word<em>revelation</em>refers to the opening of a veil to disclose something hidden behind it. In this universe there was something mysterious, secret, and hidden from human eyes and human understanding. This was Christ. However, after Christ&rsquo;s ascension the veil was opened, and Christ is now revealed to us. That Christ is revealed to us is the meaning of<em>the revelation of Jesus Christ.</em></p>
<p>Revelation is a long book of twenty-two chapters, but in brief, it may be divided into three sections. The first three chapters comprise one section, revealing Christ in the church. The second section, from chapter four through chapter twenty, the main part of this book but not the most important part, reveals to us Christ in God&rsquo;s judgment and kingdom. These seventeen chapters show us that in God&rsquo;s judgment and kingdom Christ is the very center. Thus, even this section is the revelation of Christ. It is not a revelation merely of prophecy, such as the prophecy of the beast with horns. Throughout all these chapters there is the line of the wonderful, glorious Christ who is the very essence, reality, and center of God&rsquo;s judgment and kingdom. The third section, Revelation 21 and 22, reveals Christ in eternity as the very center, centrality, and universality of all things. In eternity Christ will be the centrality and universality of God and of man. Christ is everything. The first section reveals Christ in the church, the second section reveals Christ in God&rsquo;s judgment and in His kingdom, and the last section reveals Christ in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A BOOK OF JUDGMENT BASED UPON LIFE</h2>
<p>Revelation has much to say about the church. We have seen, for example, that Christ is the lamp and the church is the lampstand. The church is the expression of Christ, but this expression must be one hundred percent purified. It must be entirely of pure gold without any mixture or alloy. Gold is purified by fire. Therefore, Revelation is a book of purging and purifying fire. The first vision in this book is a revelation of Christ as the one whose eyes are like a flame of fire and whose feet are like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace (1:14-15). When He looks at people, He burns them in order to purge away everything which does not correspond to the nature of God. This purging and burning is His judgment, and His judgment begins with the church.</p>
<p>In the first of the three sections of this book, there is the judgment of the divine burning in the church, and in the second section there is the judgment of the divine burning in the world. The last section reveals the issue, the result, of the judgment by burning. Anything which does not match the nature of God is purged away by this burning fire and is cast into the lake of fire. After all of the judgments by burning, everything in the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem is purified.</p>
<p>The apostle John, who wrote the Gospel of life, also wrote Revelation, a book of judgment. Anything which is not of the divine life will be judged. Whatever is eternal is of life, but whatever is not of life is judged, purged, and burned away. In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus is revealed as the One who is life (1:4; 11:25; 14:6). In Revelation, however, although the Lord is still the One of life, He is also the Judge. He comes in to judge according to His divine life. Anything that is of life will pass the test, but anything that is not of life will be judged, rejected, and burned. This is not a small matter. Therefore, Revelation is a book of judgment based upon life. Christ has come to impart Himself into us as life, and we must live by this life. If we do not, we will have many things which do not correspond to the nature of this life; all these things will be burned.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A PARALLEL WITH THE BOOK OF EZEKIEL</h2>
<p>The book of Ezekiel in the Old Testament corresponds to the book of Revelation. The beginning of Ezekiel also presents us with the burning testimony of God (1:4, 13, 27), just as the first three chapters of Revelation portray the testimony of Jesus. After the testimony of burning fire at the start of Ezekiel, there is a long record of burning judgment on the people of Israel and on all the nations. Eventually at the end of that book, there is the building of God, Jerusalem, with twelve gates. Jerusalem as a city with twelve gates (Rev. 21:12) is not a new thought in Revelation. It was mentioned already in Ezekiel 48:31-35.</p>
<p>In addition, at the end of Revelation there is a city with a flow of living water, and in Ezekiel there is the same thing (Rev. 22:1; Ezek. 47:1-12). A flow of living water continually issues out from the temple, the dwelling place of God. Hence, in composition and in spiritual meaning, these two books correspond to one another. The matters we have presented here will help us to see the entire book of Revelation.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE EPISTLES TO THE SEVEN CHURCHES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 2:1-17</h1>
<p>Revelation 2 and 3 contain the seven epistles to the churches, which are the last epistles given by the Lord to His church. These seven epistles were written to seven churches in Asia; however, at that time there were more than seven churches. Why did the Lord write epistles to only these seven churches? Bible students agree that these seven churches are representative of all the churches. They are a full picture of the condition of all the churches at that time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A PROPHECY OF THE FULL COURSE OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Moreover, Revelation is a book of prophecy (22:7, 18-19). Hence, what is mentioned in chapters two and three must also be in the nature of prophecy, and we must interpret the seven epistles as prophecies. In the four Gospels, the book of Acts, and the twenty-one Epistles there is no adequate prophecy concerning the course of the church on the earth. If Revelation 2 and 3 were not a prophecy of the church, there would be a gap in the New Testament. However, this gap is filled by these two chapters. The picture of the seven churches in these two chapters is a prophecy of the full course of the church during the long period from the end of the time of the apostles to the Lord&rsquo;s coming. In addition, if we do not understand these two chapters in the way of prophecy, they are not as meaningful. If we realize these two chapters in the way of prophecy, we will obtain their proper meaning, and they will be very meaningful.</p>
<p>If we compare the record of these two chapters with the facts of church history, we will realize that they correspond to one another. These seven local churches in Asia represent not only the situation of all of the churches in Asia at that time but also the seven stages of the course of the church on this earth. If we look into these seven epistles from this point of view and under this light, we will realize how meaningful and helpful they are. When we talk about the practice of the church, we all need to know and understand the seven stages of the course of the church on this earth.</p>
<p>About forty years ago in China, Brother Watchman Nee published twenty-four issues of a monthly paper entitled <em>The Christian.</em> Each issue contained many pages of meditations and exposition on the first three chapters of Revelation. This was the first time that our eyes were opened by the Lord to see what the church is. Those twenty-four issues revolutionized the young people throughout all of Christianity in China. More than 10,000 copies of each issue were distributed throughout the country. Following this, during World War II, Brother Nee conducted a study of Revelation 2 and 3 a second time in a wonderful way. I received much help from all of these writings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN EPHESUS</h2>
<p>The seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 represent the progress of the church in seven stages. The first church, the church in Ephesus, represents the stage from the end of the time of the apostles to the time when the Roman Empire began to persecute Christianity (2:1-7). That was the short period during the latter part of the first century, the initial stage of the church. All the early apostles had passed away by that time, and only John, the writer of this book, remained.</p>
<p>During this stage the church was still prevailing. However, although the church had not drifted far away from a proper condition, there was a hidden factor that became the source of her fall and degradation. She had left her first love toward the Lord. There was nothing wrong outwardly; outwardly speaking, everything was all right and normal. Within, however, she had lost her first love (v. 4). The word <em>first</em> in Greek also means <em>best.</em> The first love which the church had lost was the best love. Therefore, the Lord rebuked this church and warned her that she must repent. If she would not repent, she would suffer loss in two ways. First, the lampstand would be removed from Ephesus (v. 5). History tells us that in all the centuries since the lampstand in Ephesus was taken away, there has never been a genuine church there. This prophetic word of warning truly has been fulfilled.</p>
<p>The second loss was that the believers would not be rewarded with the enjoyment of the tree of life in the Paradise of God (v. 7). The lampstand is a matter of light, and the tree of life is a matter of life. If we lose our first love toward the Lord, we will not have the enjoyment of life, and the light will be gone. If we do love the Lord, on the other hand, we will enjoy Him as life, and we will enjoy light as the issue of this life. Life is the light (John 1:4), but in order to enjoy this life we must love the Lord. We may do many works for the Lord, and outwardly speaking we may have no problems with the Lord, but if we do not have the best, first, and fresh love to the Lord, we will not enjoy Him in a full way as our life. Then we will lose the shining of light.</p>
<p>This is a warning to us. If we intend to practice the church life, we cannot merely do something in an outward way. We must start from within by loving the Lord with the best love, the first love, and a fresh love. Then we will enjoy Him as the tree of life in the Paradise of God, and we will have the light of life. The loss of the first love was the very source, the factor, of the degradation of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN SMYRNA</h2>
<p>The second epistle is to the church in Smyrna, the church under the suffering of persecution (2:8-11). The word <em>Smyrna</em> in Greek means &ldquo;myrrh,&rdquo; and myrrh in figure signifies suffering. This church represents the second stage of the course of the church from the latter part of the first century to the time that Constantine became emperor. History tells us that during this period the Roman Empire persecuted the church. <em>Fox&rsquo;s Book of Martyrs</em> contains many stories of their suffering under persecution. I encourage the young brothers and sisters to read it; the accounts in it are very inspiring and very strengthening. One account is the story of Polycarp, an elderly brother. When arrested by the authorities and urged to renounce Christ, he answered, &ldquo;Eighty and six years have I served Him, and He never once wronged me; how then shall I blaspheme my King, who has saved me?&rdquo; The persecution by the Roman Empire reached such an extent that the authority of the city of Rome asked the Caesar not to kill any more Christians lest all the citizens of that city be cut off. By this he meant that the more they killed the Christians, the more others were becoming Christians.</p>
<p>The church in Smyrna received no rebuke from the Lord, only encouragement. The Lord told this church that He is the First and the Last, who became dead and lived again (v. 8). He is the One who was put to death by persecution but now is living. The suffering church must know the Lord as the resurrection and the resurrection power. Nothing can hold the resurrection life, not even death. This resurrection life is within the suffering church, so the church must experience Christ as resurrection. The reward to the church in Smyrna is the crown of life. Not only the tree of life but the crown of life will be a reward to the suffering church. This period in the history of the church has now been fulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN PERGAMOS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A Union with the World</h2>
<p>The third epistle is to the church in Pergamos (2:12-17). In this epistle we can see a great change in the nature and form of the church. According to history, Pergamos represents the stage of the church beginning at the time that Constantine made Christianity the state religion and encouraged people to become professing Christians, causing the church to change its nature and form. The word <em>Pergamos</em> in Greek has two meanings. The first is &ldquo;marriage.&rdquo; A marriage is a union. At this time the church became united with the world, becoming a worldly church. The church married the world and joined to it. The second meaning of <em>Pergamos</em> is &ldquo;fortified tower.&rdquo; At that time the church became something high on the earth, a high tower, not something low. When Constantine came into Christianity, made it the state religion, and encouraged people to come into it, he made it something great. This was the fulfillment of the parable of the mustard seed in Matthew 13:31-32, in which a little herb became a big tree, like a high tower.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Teaching of Balaam</h2>
<p>In the church in Pergamos there were two things which are evil before the Lord. First there was the teaching of Balaam (Rev. 2:14). Balaam was a Gentile prophet who taught Balak the king to cause the people of God to commit fornication and worship idols (Num. 22:4-6; 25:1-3). The time that Constantine came into Christianity was the start of the teaching of the heathen prophet, the teaching of heathenism. This caused the church to commit spiritual fornication by joining to the world and to worship idols. This was evil to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Teaching of the Nicolaitans</h2>
<p>The second evil matter in Pergamos was the teaching of the Nicolaitans (Rev. 2:15). In the initial stage, the church in Ephesus had only the works, the activities, of the Nicolaitans (v. 6), not yet the teaching. However, by the third stage of the church the works of the Nicolaitans had become the teaching of Nicolaitanism. By a thorough study of history we can realize that the teaching of the Nicolaitans is the teaching of the clergy-laity system, the teaching of the hierarchy, the &ldquo;holy order.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>Nicolaitans</em> means &ldquo;subduing the common people.&rdquo; The so-called clergy, the hierarchy, subdues the other people in the church.</p>
<p>In the ancient time, after the people of Israel were delivered out of Egypt, God declared that they were a kingdom of priests (Exo. 19:6). However, due to the failure of the people of Israel in worshipping the golden calf at Sinai, only one tribe out of the twelve tribes became priests. Originally, God ordained that the whole nation of Israel would be a kingdom of priests, but due to that failure only one tribe became the priests. These priests became an intermediary class between God and the children of Israel. This became the system of the priesthood in Judaism. The New Testament, however, tells us clearly that all the believers are priests of God (1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:6). All the genuine believers, who have been redeemed by the blood of Christ, are priests. There is no intermediary class between the believers and God. All the believers are on the same level, have the same rank, and are in the same class. There is no clergy, no laity, no hierarchy, and no intermediary class.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, at the end of the time of the apostles some rose up to be the Nicolaitans. The epistle to the Ephesians says that the church there hated the works of the Nicolaitans (2:6). Although by that time those practices had already begun, it was not yet a teaching, but in the third stage of the church those works became a teaching. This was completely fulfilled in the history of the church. After Constantine made Christianity the state religion, thousands of unregenerate people were baptized into Christianity as members. They were not regenerated; they did not have the life of God. They did not have the Holy Spirit, and they were not the living members of Christ&rsquo;s Body. Therefore, they did not know how to function, and they were not able to function, so some began to teach that certain persons should be trained to be the clergy. A small number were trained to be the priests, the clergy, while the vast majority of the nominal Christians took care of their worldly living. It was in this way that the intermediary class of the clergy came into existence. This is something very evil in the Lord&rsquo;s eyes, and it must be overcome.</p>
<p>Today we must recover the universal priesthood. Every Christian must be a functioning member and a serving priest. In the church there must be no class, or we may say, there must be only one class&mdash;not clergyman or layman but brother. Some people today speak of a &ldquo;lay ministry&rdquo; or &ldquo;lay preachers.&rdquo; However, we are neither clergymen nor laymen; we are the priests and the members. We are all members of the Body of Christ, and we are all priests of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Enjoying Christ in a Hidden Way</h2>
<p>In the epistle to the church in Pergamos the Lord promises to give the hidden manna to the one who overcomes (v. 17). This corresponds with the parables in Matthew 13. Pergamos was a fortified tower, like the great tree in Matthew 13:31-32, in which everything was exposed for outward show. In principle, however, the precious things are hidden (v. 44). In this age Christ is the hidden manna. Therefore, we must be the hidden church. We must learn to be hidden and not exposed. We should not advertise ourselves in a worldly way. To do so is to be married to the world and commit spiritual fornication. It is not only to have idol worship but to become an idol. We must learn to be hidden. Since this is the age for Christ to be hidden, we as His Body must also be hidden. Then we will enjoy Him as the hidden manna.</p>
<p>The more we are hidden, the more we will experience Christ as the hidden One and experience the white stone (Rev. 2:17). <em>White</em> in Revelation signifies being justified, approved, and accepted by the Lord (3:4-5, 18). We should not try to be accepted or admired by people. We must not be afraid to be criticized and persecuted. Rather, we should try to be justified and accepted by the hidden Lord. When we become the hidden ones, we sense the Lord&rsquo;s hidden approval.</p>
<p>Upon the white stone is a name which the Lord gives. This name is known only by us and the Lord; no one else knows it because it is a secret. We need to have secret, hidden experiences of Christ. Then there will be something secret between us and Him. While the entire Christianity is married to the world and has become a great tree, a high tower, we must be hidden&mdash;hidden from the great tree, hidden from the high tower, hidden from spiritual fornication, and hidden from idol worship.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE EPISTLES TO THE SEVEN CHURCHES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 2:18&mdash;3:22</h1>
<p>Revelation is a book of prophecy in symbols, and the seven epistles in chapters two and three contain many symbols. If we understand them only according to the words, they are not as meaningful, but when we understand them according to the symbols, they are much more meaningful. The titles, names, and events in these chapters are symbols, showing us that by the third stage of the church the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans had caused the church to change in form and in nature.</p>
<p>In the degradation of the church, the church and government with its politics were improperly mixed. This was according to the teaching of Balaam (2:14). By this teaching the church was united with the world. This was spiritual fornication, and along with this there was also idol worship. We can trace this progress in the history of the church.</p>
<p>In addition, there was also the teaching of the Nicolaitans (v. 15), the teaching of the hierarchy, the difference between the clergy and the laity.<em>Nicolaitans</em> is derived from two Greek roots&mdash;<em>nikao,</em> meaning &ldquo;to subdue&rdquo; or &ldquo;conquer&rdquo; and <em>laos,</em> meaning &ldquo;laity&rdquo; or &ldquo;common people.&rdquo; It denotes the subduing of the laity. This resulted in a clerical class, an intermediary class. This brought something of Judaism into Christianity. This was another improper mixture. The teaching of Balaam brought the church into union with the world, and the teaching of the Nicolaitans mixed the church with Judaism. History tells us that during the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries, these things happened exactly in this way. The church adopted the forms and rituals of Judaism as well as some of its terminology and titles.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN THYATIRA</h2>
<p>The fourth epistle is to the church in Thyatira (vv. 18-29). History tells us that about two centuries after Constantine made Christianity the state religion of the Roman Empire, in the latter part of the sixth century, this state religion became the Roman Catholic Church. When the bishop of Rome began to be considered as the pope, the Roman Catholic Church was officially and formally formed. This began another stage of the church.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church was prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 13:33, in which a woman took leaven and added it to fine flour. This woman is the evil Jezebel in Revelation 2:20. Jezebel was the pagan wife of Ahab, king of Israel. By her marriage to Ahab, the people of the kingdom of God became mixed with paganism. In the eyes of the Lord, the Roman Catholic Church became the same as this woman, bringing many heathen practices into the church.</p>
<p>Jezebel calls herself a prophetess, teaching the Lord&rsquo;s people (v. 20). According to the principle in the New Testament, the Lord never allows a woman to teach with authority (1 Tim. 2:12). In the same way, the church itself must not teach, because in the eyes of the Lord the church is in the position of a woman. Only the Lord Himself is the man, the one who has the right to teach, the right to say yes or no, right or wrong. However, according to history and the present situation, people in Catholicism say, &ldquo;The church says....&rdquo; It is hard to convince people in Catholicism. If we tell them, &ldquo;The Bible says,&rdquo; they answer, &ldquo;The church says.&rdquo; No matter how many passages we quote from the Scriptures, they have one reply: &ldquo;The church says.&rdquo; In this way, they do not care for the Bible; they care only for what the church says. The church has the highest authority; whatever the church says is right. This &ldquo;church&rdquo; is the evil woman, Jezebel. The Roman Catholic Church is a teaching woman.</p>
<p>By the teaching of this woman, many pagan and heathen things were brought into the church, causing fornication and idol worship (Rev. 2:20). The famous Roman Catholic cathedrals are full of idolatry, containing images of Peter, Paul, and many other so-called saints, as well as of Jesus and Mary. Many people come into these &ldquo;churches&rdquo; with candles just to worship these idols. Many of the evil mysteries within the Catholic Church have been exposed by writings in the past. If we read the history of the church, we will discover the actual fulfillment of the prophecy of the Lord in this epistle to Thyatira. The fulfillment was exactly as the Lord prophesied. The thousand years from the sixth century to the time of the Reformation in the sixteenth century was a period of darkness.</p>
 <p>The three women in Matthew 13, Revelation 2, and Revelation 17 are the same person. In Matthew 13:33 a woman takes leaven and hides it in three measures of meal; in Revelation 17:1-6 the evil woman is riding on a beast; and in 2:20-23 this same woman is called Jezebel. These three women all refer to the Roman Catholic Church. It is the Roman Catholic Church that brings leaven into the fine flour, it is the Roman Catholic Church that is the harlot riding on the beast, and it is the Roman Catholic Church that is Jezebel, corrupting Christianity. In 1929 Mussolini signed an agreement to give the Vatican to the pope as his territory. From that time the Vatican became an independent state with its own jurisdiction, conducting diplomatic affairs. It is truly a Jezebel.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN SARDIS</h2>
<p>The churches in Revelation 2 and 3 represent the stages of the history of the church. The latter stages of the church have more to do with us today than the first ones, so we must be more familiar with them. The church in Sardis depicts the fifth stage of the history of the church, the church during the Reformation (3:1-6). The Greek word for <em>Sardis</em> means &ldquo;remainder&rdquo; or&ldquo;restoration.&rdquo;No doubt, the Reformation which began at the time of Martin Luther was the fulfillment of the prophecy in this epistle. Although the Reformation was good, everything in it was very weak. According to history, none of its works were completed (v. 2). This is why the Lord says, &ldquo;You have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead&rdquo; (v. 1).</p>
<p>On the one hand, many things were recovered in the Reformation, but on the other hand, many of those things withered away. In the reformed churches, that is, the Protestant churches, there is always recovery then withering, followed by more recovery and more withering. There are many revivals, each followed by a falling away. The history of the Protestant churches is a history of revival and falling, recovery and withering. Nothing there is strong, adequate, living, or permanent. Therefore, the Lord is not satisfied with Sardis, the reformed church.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church became an international church, mixed with all the nations but under one head, the pope. Although during the Reformation the church gave up its international character, it fell to become the national churches. Luther himself admitted that this was wrong, but he could not avoid it because the political influence was too great. Luther was one of the greatest servants of the Lord, and we do not want to criticize him, but we must speak the truth. He was strong in dealing with the pope yet weak before the kings. We cannot say why he was this way; perhaps it is simply because he was human. He dealt strongly with Catholicism and the pope, but he was weak in dealing with the German king. The German king eventually formed the state church of Germany, and other nations followed suit. This is why today we have the national churches. In Denmark, the king is the head of the Danish church, which is the Lutheran Church. Likewise, in England the queen is the head of the Church of England, the national church.</p>
<p>After the national churches came into existence, many seeking ones were not satisfied with them. They became the dissenters and began to form dissenting churches, the private churches such as the Presbyterian Church and the Baptist Church. In the eyes of the Lord, both the national churches and the private churches are weak and full of deadness, so the Lord rebuked them. The reformed churches did not satisfy the Lord&rsquo;s heart because they did not fully return to the normal condition of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN PHILADELPHIA</h2>
<p>About three hundred years after the Reformation, the sixth stage of the church began, symbolized by the church in Philadelphia (vv. 7-13). In the epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 there are several meaningful names, such as Balaam, the Nicolaitans, and Jezebel. Now verse 7 speaks of Philadelphia, which means &ldquo;brotherly love.&rdquo;According to the history of the church, the prophecy in this epistle was fulfilled in the practice of the Brethren, whom the Lord raised up in the early part of the nineteenth century. During their first twenty years, the Brethren were marvelous. The Brethren recovered many spiritual matters, and they opened up the Word of God. They truly came back to the normal condition of the church. The Brethren absolutely repudiated and forsook all the things brought into the church by the teaching of Balaam, the teaching of the Nicolaitans, and the teachings of Jezebel.</p>
<p>Certain Bible teachers such as D. M. Panton tell us that the Brethren movement was more powerful than the Reformation, although many people today do not know much about it. The Reformation had too much to do with political matters, and to a great extent it became a worldly movement. The Brethren, on the other hand, did not advertise themselves, and they had nothing to do with worldly affairs. Some of the Brethren were lords and ladies in society, but when they were gained for this testimony, they renounced their titles. In the entire history of the church, there has never been a group of believers as the Brethren who gave up the world in such an absolute way.</p>
<p>The Brethren were rich in the recovery of the truth. More than ninety percent of the fundamental teachings in Christianity come from the discoveries made by the Brethren teachers. The Scofield Reference Bible is very popular in the United States today, but Scofield was just the &ldquo;salesman,&rdquo; not the &ldquo;factory,&rdquo; of his teachings. The truths in almost all the notes in his Reference Bible and the teachings in his correspondence course came from Brethren writings. C. H. Mackintosh was one of many great teachers among the Brethren. D. L. Moody, a great American evangelist in the last century, once said that if someone were to burn all the books in the entire world, he would be satisfied to have just one copy of the Bible and a set of Mackintosh&rsquo;s<em>Notes on the Pentateuch.</em> To Moody, all Christian writings except these meant little. Besides Mackintosh, there were many other great teachers among the Brethren, including J. G. Bellett and William Kelly. C. H. Spurgeon once described William Kelly as one whose mind was as big as the universe. To read the books by the Brethren is a great help.</p>
<p>The Brethren were very influential in their time. In the middle 1800s a certain hurricane caused much damage to the island of Jamaica. Very soon after the news went out, the Brethren in many different parts of the world sent material gifts to rescue the brothers on that island. The money sent by their gifts totaled more than the money sent by the British government.</p>
<p>The Brethren were outstanding in three things&mdash;in brotherly love, in keeping the Lord&rsquo;s word, and in not denying His name (v. 8). They had much brotherly love. They were truly &ldquo;the brothers.&rdquo; Moreover, they dropped every kind of name and title, telling others that they met only in the name of the Lord, and they always kept the word of the Lord. Brotherly love, keeping the Lord&rsquo;s word, and not denying His name were prominent among them, and they dropped all other things. Among them there was no clergy or laity. Brother Watchman Nee once told us that even a cook among the Brethren knew the Bible better than a missionary. Even the small brothers among them were very clear about the Word.</p>
<p>The Brethren began meeting around 1825. By 1829 there were meetings in Italy, and within a short time they spread quickly, even to Arabia.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN LAODICEA</h2>
<p>The seventh stage of the church is symbolized by the church in Laodicea (3:14-22). Today some wrongly teach that the church in Laodicea represents the fallen, cold reformed churches. However, if we thoroughly study the history of the church, we will see that Laodicea represents the degraded Brethren. In this epistle the Lord did not rebuke them for anything except spiritual pride. There is no mention of sinfulness or the teaching of Balaam, the teaching of the Nicolaitans, or the teaching of Jezebel. There was no problem with them except their pride. They claimed to be wealthy and rich and to have need of nothing, but in actuality they were neither cold nor hot, but lukewarm (vv. 15-17a).</p>
<p>The Brethren had a very good start over a century ago, but after about twenty-five years, many of them fell into degradation. When we attend their meetings in Europe, England, or America, we can sense the fulfillment of this epistle. We thank the Lord that some of them are still in the condition of Philadelphia, but not many are. They are spiritually proud and rich in knowledge, but they do not have much spiritual experience. They do not have much living faith or the eyesalve for their eyes that they may see the spiritual things. They have even lost the presence of the Lord; the Lord is outside their door (v. 20).</p>
<p>In the reformed churches there is still the teaching of Balaam, the teaching of the Nicolaitans, and even to some extent the teaching of Jezebel. In Laodicea, however, we cannot find these things. Therefore, Laodicea represents not the reformed churches but the degraded Brethren, who are fallen not due to sin but due to pride. They say, &ldquo;We know what is taught in Genesis, and we know what is taught in Revelation. We have a great teacher who gave an exposition of Daniel and other teachings. Who can know more than we do?&rdquo; In this way they have become proud, being rich in knowledge and right in doctrines. However, the Lord says that they are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked (v. 17b). They do not have much experience of the Lord, they do not have much living faith, and their eyes are not truly opened but are blinded by doctrines. They have the mental knowledge and the doctrines, but they do not have light in their spirit. Therefore, they need to pay the price (v. 18).</p>
<p>If we read the epistle to Laodicea again, and if we visit the Brethren assemblies, we will have to admit that this is the exact fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s prophecy in the seventh epistle. This is the real Laodicea, with lukewarmness, the blindness of knowledge in the mentality, and the lack of anything living. Then we will say, &ldquo;Lord, be merciful to me.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHOOSING TO BE THE CHURCH IN PHILADELPHIA</h2>
<p>Please refer to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/GenSketch4/systematic-chart.pdf">systematic chart of church history</a> at the beginning of this chapter, taken from <em>The Orthodoxy of the Church</em> by Watchman Nee. As this chart indicates, the stages of the church represented by Ephesus, Smyrna, and Pergamos have all concluded. None of these three churches exists today. However, the church in Thyatira, the fourth stage of the course of the church, exists today and will remain until the end of this age. In the epistle to Thyatira the Lord clearly indicates that this church will remain until He comes (2:25). Today the Roman Catholic Church not only exists but is flourishing. In addition, the church in Sardis, the reformed church, will also exist until the Lord&rsquo;s coming (3:3). Likewise, Philadelphia and Laodicea will also remain until the Lord&rsquo;s return (v. 11).</p>
<p>Today, before the Lord&rsquo;s return, four kinds of churches remain before us&mdash;the Roman Catholic Church, the Protestant churches, the church of brotherly love, and the degraded Brethren. If we were born five hundred years ago, there would have been no choice before us; there was only one kind of church. After the Reformation, however, there were two kinds of churches. Then as of about one hundred forty years ago, there were three kinds. Today in this century there are four choices related to the church. Of course, we may all agree that we can have nothing to do with Thyatira, but some people still argue for Sardis. Strictly speaking, though, Sardis should not be a choice. Can you be satisfied to be a part of Sardis? I left Sardis in 1927. In actuality, only two kinds of churches remain before us. Will we be the church in brotherly love, or will we be Laodicea? Once we become Philadelphia, we can never again be Sardis, but we must be careful that we do not become Laodicea.</p>
<p>Although Ephesus lost its first love, it remained at the level of normality, as indicated by the first part of the systematic chart. Therefore, the church in Ephesus was still good, desirable, and lovable. After this, Smyrna, the suffering church, also continued at the level of normality. However, at the time of Pergamos, the church became abnormal, and Thyatira continued the same trend. Sardis turned back to the normal level but came only halfway. The writings of Luther tell us that Luther himself was not satisfied with the Reformation, although regrettably many of his followers were satisfied. We praise the Lord that Philadelphia came all the way back to the level of normality. However, not long afterwards it degraded and fell below the level of normality. This systematic chart is a clear diagram showing us the real situation of Christianity today.</p>
<p>All four kinds of churches before us will remain until the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. Now we must ask ourselves which of the four we will choose. I believe we are all clear as to which is the one that will satisfy the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SCENE AROUND THE THRONE<br />
IN THE HEAVENS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 4&mdash;5</h1>
<p>Chapters four and five of Revelation show us the scene around the throne in the heavens after Christ&rsquo;s ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THRONE OF GOD</h2>
<p>The first main item mentioned in chapter four is the throne of God set in heaven (v. 2). The throne of God is the very center of the entire universe and the very source of all things. In Revelation, the throne of God is not the throne of mercy but the throne of divine authority for judgment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOD OF LIFE AND REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>The One who is sitting upon the throne is God Himself. In verse 3a there are two figures which signify God&mdash;jasper and sardius. The One who sits on the throne is like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance. Two in the Bible signifies a testimony. That two kinds of precious stones describe the appearance of God signifies that the appearance of God is a testimony, a witness, testifying what kind of God He is. Precious stones are not originally found in nature; they are formed by a process from other materials. This signifies that God is not natural but different from all natural things. In addition, the color green in the Scriptures signifies life, and red signifies redemption. A jasper stone is dark green and semitransparent, symbolizing that God is the God of life in its transparency, pureness, and brightness. Sardius, a precious stone with a red color, signifies redemption. God is a God of life and redemption. Life and redemption are the main items of the person and work of God. The bread at the Lord&rsquo;s table signifies life, and the cup stands for redemption. The very God who directs the entire universe is a God of pure and transparent life, and He is also a God of redemption. He has the appearance of green jasper and red sardius.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A RAINBOW AROUND THE THRONE</h2>
<p>Around the throne of God is a rainbow (v. 3b). The rainbow is first mentioned in the Scriptures as a sign that the very God of life and redemption is the One who establishes and keeps His covenant (Gen. 9:12-17). That the covenant in Genesis 9 was made for the sake of the inhabited earth indicates that although God will judge this earth with its inhabitants, He still remembers His covenant concerning the earth and will keep it. According to Revelation 4:3, the rainbow around the throne was like an emerald in appearance. An emerald is of a grass-green color, signifying the growing things, the lives on the earth. The rainbow declares to us that God will keep His covenant for the sake of the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TWENTY-FOUR ANGELIC ELDERS</h2>
<p>Verse 4 speaks of the twenty-four elders around the throne. There are many expositions of Revelation with many differing opinions. What we are speaking here is not the result of quick and simple decisions concerning the truth. Rather, what we are saying is based upon many studies of all these expositions. Some people say that the twenty-four elders here are the elders of the church, including the twelve apostles. However, we cannot agree with this. The scene revealed in chapter four encompasses the entire universe, and the elders and apostles of the church cannot be the elders of the entire universe. These elders must be the leading ones among the angels. According to the record of the Scriptures, the angels are the most ancient ones in God&rsquo;s creation. Therefore, their leading ones are the real elders in the universe.</p>
<p>The praise of the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures are further proof that the elders here are not the redeemed elders in the church. In verse 9 the four living creatures give &ldquo;glory and honor and thanks&rdquo; to God, while the praise of the twenty-four elders in verse 11 speaks of &ldquo;the glory and the honor and the power.&rdquo; Because the living creatures represent the redeemed ones, they give thanks to the Lord for His redemption. Instead of thanks, however, the twenty-four elders give praise to the Lord for His power. The twenty-four elders are the leading angels who have been appointed to authority; they have the power to rule in the universe, so they praise the Lord for His power.</p>
<p>In verses 11-13 of chapter five, there are two kinds of hosts praising God. There are the angelic hosts, the angels, and there is the rest of creation in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, and in the sea. Of all of these, there are two groups of representatives. The twenty-four elders as leading ones represent the angels, and the four living creatures represent the rest of creation (v. 14). The twenty-four elders take the lead among the angels to worship and praise God, and the four living creatures lead the rest of creation to worship and praise God. This further indicates that the twenty-four elders are the leading ones among the angels.</p>
<p>That the twenty-four elders have golden crowns upon their heads means that they were given the power to rule as kings (4:4). From the beginning of creation, the Lord appointed the angels to have the power and authority to rule the universe. But at the second coming of the Lord, the earth will be handed over to the Lord and His overcomers. The angelic elders are also clothed in white garments, similar to the clothing of the priests. On the one hand, they have the authority to rule the universe, and on the other hand, they are the priests serving in the presence of God. In 5:8 each of the elders has a harp, which is for praising the Lord in His presence, and they have bowls of incense. The incense signifies Christ, while the bowls are the prayers of the saints. The angelic elders, as the most ancient of the creatures, praise the Lord, and they bring the saints&rsquo; prayers to God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES</h2>
<p>In the scene around the throne in the heavens there are also four living creatures, having the appearance of a lion, a calf, a man, and an eagle (4:6-8). These four living creatures resemble the cherubim in Ezekiel 1:5-10 and 10:14-15. The cherubim in Ezekiel 1, however, have four wings, while the living creatures in Revelation 4 and 5 have six wings (4:8), like the seraphim in Isaiah 6:2. The living creatures, therefore, must be a combination of the cherubim and the seraphim. As the seraphim, they are for God&rsquo;s holiness (Isa. 6:3), and as the cherubim, they are for God&rsquo;s glory (Ezek. 10:18-19; Heb. 9:5).</p>
<p>Moreover, Colossians 1:20 indicates that in addition to man, all other creatures except the angels need God&rsquo;s redemption. Therefore, the four living creatures represent not man only but the entire redeemed creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEVEN LAMPS OF FIRE</h2>
<p>Revelation 4:5 speaks of the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne. Authorities on Greek tell us that the word for<em>lamp</em> here denotes a torch. Common lamps are good for indoor use, but when we move, walk, and do things outdoors, we need a torch. This corresponds with the view of the book of Revelation, which speaks of God going outside His house to judge the world. These seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God. This does not mean, however, that God has seven Spirits. God&rsquo;s Spirit is one, but in the intensified function and work of God&rsquo;s operation, God&rsquo;s Spirit is sevenfold. Therefore, He is the seven Spirits.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A SEA OF GLASS MINGLED WITH FIRE</h2>
<p>The seventh item presented here is a glassy sea like crystal before the throne (4:6). In Revelation 15:2 this sea of glass is mingled with fire. The better students of the Scriptures tell us that this glassy sea will eventually become the lake of fire. Originally it is a sea, but eventually it becomes a lake. In front of the tabernacle there was the laver for washing (Exo. 30:17-21), and in front of the temple stood a bronze sea with ten bronze lavers (1 Kings 7:23, 38). The people of Israel crossed the Red Sea and the Jordan River, and we Christians are baptized in water to deal with all the negative things. In the entire universe there is a sea to deal with every negative matter. Eventually, this sea will become the lake of fire.</p>
<p>If we combine all these seven items, we have a full picture of the scene in the heavens. In the universe there is a throne, and the One who sits on the throne is the very God of life and redemption. He will judge the earth, but He will never forget His covenant with man concerning the earth. Before Him and around Him there are the elders of the universe, representing the angels, and the four living creatures, representing the redeemed creation. Coming out from the throne are the seven &ldquo;torches,&rdquo; the seven lamps of fire, the sevenfold Spirit in God&rsquo;s operation and judgment. Then whatever God judges becomes the &ldquo;dirt&rdquo; of the universe which is swept into the glassy sea.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST QUALIFIED TO OPEN THE SCROLL<br />
AND ITS SEVEN SEALS</h2>
<p>Revelation 5:1 says that on the right hand of the One who sits upon the throne there is a scroll sealed up with seven seals. This scroll is a book of mystery. Verse 2 says, &ldquo;And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?&rdquo; There was a challenge, but there was no answer: &ldquo;And no one in heaven nor on the earth nor under the earth was able to open the scroll or look into it. And I wept much because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look into it&rdquo; (vv. 3-4). While John was weeping, the glad tidings came that there is One in the universe who is worthy, who is the Lion of the tribe of Judah and the Root of David. He has overcome so He may open the scroll and its seven seals. After hearing this, John turned and saw not a Lion but a Lamb. To the enemy Christ is the Lion, but to the redeemed ones He is the Lamb. This Lion-Lamb is the unique One who is worthy to open the scroll and its seven seals (vv. 5-6).</p>
<p>The scroll is the new covenant enacted by the Lord Jesus with His own blood for the whole universe. Without this scroll, this covenant, the universe could not exist. Moreover, the scroll is sealed with seven seals. All the mysteries, all the things which happen in the created universe, are recorded in this scroll.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus took the scroll and was about to open its seals, two hosts in the universe worshipped and praised Him. The first host is the angels represented by the twenty-four elders who take the lead to worship Him. The rest of the creation is represented by the four living creatures who also take the lead to worship (vv. 7-8). The praise from the twenty-four elders contains seven items: power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing, while the praise from the four living creatures includes blessing, honor, glory, and might (vv. 12-13). This scene in the heavens reveals the One who is worthy to open the scroll and its seals, who is the overcoming Lion and the redeeming Lamb.</p>
<p>Some expositors say that from chapter four, Revelation begins to speak of things in the future, but this is not accurate. Chapters four and five portray the scene in heaven immediately after the Lord&rsquo;s ascension. When the Lord accomplished redemption and ascended to the heavens, He became the One who was worthy to open the secrets, the mystery, of God&rsquo;s economy in the seven seals.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SEVEN SEALS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 6&mdash;9</h1>
<p>In the book of Revelation there are four big sevens&mdash;the seven churches, seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls. These four sevens are the composition of the entire book. In the previous chapters we saw the seven churches. Now chapter six begins to speak of the second seven, the seven seals.</p>
<p>At the time that this book was written, the church and in particular John, its writer, were under the persecution of the Roman Empire. Revelation speaks of the Roman Empire and of the Caesars, but even if the writing had fallen into the hands of a Caesar, it would not have been understood. This is because John wrote this book in a way that can be compared to a jigsaw puzzle. Therefore, unless we have spiritual understanding, we cannot understand its contents. Because we have the spiritual wisdom today, we can understand Revelation and put the puzzle together to give us a clear picture.</p>
<p>Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/GenSketch4/chart-70weeks.pdf">&ldquo;The Chart of the Seventy Weeks and the Coming of Christ, with the Rapture of the Saints&rdquo;</a> at the beginning of this book. In 1940 I spent many days to compose this chart, and since that time I have labored in the Lord to improve it. This chart helps us to see the sketch of Revelation, putting together the jigsaw puzzle. Without such a chart it is difficult to understand this book.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NUMBER SEVEN</h2>
<p>The number seven in the Scriptures is always composed in one of two ways: four plus three or six plus one. The first seven mentioned in the Scriptures is in the first two chapters of Genesis. The number seven there is composed of six plus one, six days with another day. The seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls in Revelation are composed both of four plus three and six plus one.</p>
<p>The number four signifies the creatures, as represented by the four living creatures, while the number three represents the Triune God. Four plus three signifies an improvement from the creature to the Triune God, while three plus four indicates a degradation from the Triune God to the created things. The seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls are composed of four plus three, indicating improvement. On the contrary, the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 are arranged as three plus four, indicating degradation. The first three churches form one group, and the last four form another. In the first three epistles, for example, the Lord says, &ldquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches,&rdquo; and then He gives a promise to the overcomers (2:7, 11, 17). In the last four epistles, the Lord first gives a promise to the overcomers and then says, &ldquo;He who as an ear&rdquo; (vv. 26-29; 3:5-6, 12-13, 21-22). This indicates that in the churches many things are degraded. Therefore, they need the Lord&rsquo;s judgment. Due to the Lord&rsquo;s judgment, there is a real improvement. Without the Lord&rsquo;s judgment, the things in the hands of man always degrade, but due to God&rsquo;s judgment, there is an improvement.</p>
<p>Seven is also composed of six plus one. Six signifies man, since man was made on the sixth day, and one represents the unique Creator. Therefore, six plus one signifies the created man plus the Creator, which is an improvement.</p>
<p>The number twelve in the Bible is composed not with six but with four multiplied by three. Twelve signifies that God and man, man and God, are mingled together. In the age of the church there is seven, signifying God plus man, but in eternity there will be twelve, signifying God mingled with man. Addition turns into multiplication to produce twelve, the mingling of God with man in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRST FOUR SEALS&mdash;<br />
THE GOSPEL, WAR, FAMINE, AND DEATH</h2>
<p>The first four seals are represented by four horses (6:1-8). The first horse is white, the second is red, the third is black, and the fourth is pale. Each of the four horses carries a rider. It is easy to see that the rider of the second horse is the personification of war. In war, people are killed, so this horse is red, which is the color of blood. The rider of the third horse is also not a person; he is the personification of famine. He holds a balance in which wheat and barley are weighed, indicating a great shortage of food, and the oil and wine should not be harmed because they are precious during a famine. This famine is due to war. The fourth rider is death. Famine follows war, and death follows famine. Due to the lack of food, there is famine and pestilence, which cause many to die. Thus the fourth rider is also not an actual person but a personification.</p>
<p>Now we must find out who or what the first rider is. Most Bible expositors are of two opinions. One school says that the rider is Antichrist, while the other school says that the rider is Christ. Both interpretations are against the principle in this chapter, because the other three riders are not real persons but personifications. In order to be consistent, the first rider must also be something personified. The rider of the first horse is the gospel. As the gospel of peace, the rider carries a bow in his hand with no arrow, for the arrow has been shot on the cross. On the cross the arrow hit the enemy, Satan, and defeated him. Now the victory has been won.</p>
<p>If we read this portion carefully, we will see that the four horses do not run one after the other. Rather, this is a four-horse race; all the horses are running at the same time. Immediately after the ascension of Christ, these four matters began to run like horses in a race. According to history, as soon as Christ ascended, the horse of gospel preaching started to run. Simultaneously, war proceeded, followed by famine and death. These four horses encompass all the events that have transpired in human history since the day of Pentecost, including military, political, financial, and educational matters. Not one matter is not included in these four horses.</p>
<p>Without these four horses, there is a big gap in the scriptural prophecy of human history. If the four-horse race will occur in the future, as expositors such as J. N. Darby taught, there would be no prophecy telling us what would transpire from the time of the Lord&rsquo;s ascension until the great tribulation. We would know only the ascension of the Lord followed by the great tribulation. Darby held the view that even Revelation 4 takes place after the church is taken from the earth. This view, however, does not fit the context of these chapters. Rather, the four horses in chapter six give us a picture of what happens from the Lord&rsquo;s ascension to the time of the great tribulation.</p>
<p>Everything that has happened on the earth among the human race is included in these four horses. Commerce, for example, is related to the third horse. The big corporations today are not doing a great work. In principle, they are still saying, &ldquo;a choenix of wheat for a denarius and three choenixes of barley for a denarius&rdquo; (v. 6). They are producing bread for eating according to the principle of commerce. In the same way, the military establishment is working for the second horse.</p>
<p>These four things&mdash;the preaching of the gospel, war, famine, and death&mdash;are four horses running a race, and they are still here with us today. The Lord is very wise in giving us this picture as a full history of the human race from the time of Christ&rsquo;s ascension to the beginning of the tribulation. On what horse are we? We have to say that we are on the first horse, the preaching of the gospel of peace, which goes forth conquering and to conquer. We have to preach the gospel; we must not stop the white horse. We do not care about bread, related to the third horse, and we are not afraid of the second or fourth horse. We are with the first horse, the preaching of the gospel as the victorious rider, the overcoming one.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FIFTH SEAL&mdash;THE CRY OF THE MARTYRED SAINTS</h2>
<p>The first four seals are one group. Following this, verses 9 through 11 speak of the fifth seal. At this point the time is near to the end of this age. The souls of the martyred saints underneath the altar cry out, saying, &ldquo;How long, O Master, holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?&rdquo; (v. 10). This does not take place exactly at the start of the tribulation but very close to that time. These martyrs have been very patient, waiting for a long period of time until the four horses will have almost finished their race. Because the Lord has not yet avenged their blood, they are still crying out.</p>
<p>These are the souls of the martyrs who were killed for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. They are not yet resurrected; they are still <em>underneath the altar.</em> The altar is a type of the cross, which was set up on the earth. Hence, <em>underneath the altar</em> must indicate a place somewhere under the earth. This is the Paradise mentioned in Luke 23:43 and pictured in 16:22-26. The souls of the righteous ones, the martyrs, are now in Paradise waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s avenging.</p>
<p>To be underneath the altar also has another meaning. To be underneath the altar is to be a drink offering, poured out before the Lord upon the altar, as Paul was (Phil. 2:17; 2 Tim. 4:6).</p>
<p>When the fifth seal is opened, the end time is very close; it is very near to the time of God&rsquo;s avenging. Therefore, the Lord told the martyrs to rest yet a little while (Rev. 6:11). Moreover, the Lord gave each of them a white robe. The color white indicates justification; the martyrs are justified in the eyes of the Lord. However, they have to wait until the number of their fellow slaves who are about to be killed for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony is completed. We have to believe that more will suffer death for the Lord before His coming. In particular, more will be killed during the time of the great tribulation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SIXTH SEAL&mdash;<br />
THE SHAKING OF THE EARTH AND HEAVEN</h2>
<p>When the sixth seal is opened, there is a change in the signs of the universe (vv. 12-17). The heaven changes, including the sun, the moon, and the stars, and there is a great earthquake. There will be two calamities of the shaking and changing of the earth and the hosts in heaven. The first will occur at the beginning of the great tribulation (vv. 12-14; Joel 2:30-31; Luke 21:11), and the second will occur after the great tribulation (Matt. 24:29-30; Joel 3:11-16; Luke 21:25-26). What is covered in the sixth seal is the first calamity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VISIONS INSERTED<br />
BETWEEN THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH SEALS</h2>
<p>It is a help in reading the book of Revelation to realize that there are insertions between certain chapters. Chapter seven is the first insertion, between the sixth and seventh seals. Therefore, chapter eight actually continues chapter six.</p>
<h2 class="head2">144,000 of the Twelve Tribes Sealed</h2>
<p>Revelation 7:1-8 speaks of the one hundred forty-four thousand of the remnant of Israel, who are sealed by God. In principle, when we read Revelation we need to apply the things in it literally, unless doing so does not give the proper meaning; in that case, we should interpret them symbolically. This portion of chapter seven should be understood in a literal sense. These chosen and sealed Israelites do not refer to Christian Jews. The believing Jews are reckoned as members of the Body of Christ and are not to be considered among the Jewish people. Even among the Jewish people, however, there will be a certain number who truly will be serving God at the end of this age. They also will be the people of God.</p>
<p>In verses 1 to 3, the four angels holding the four winds of the earth are given the order not to harm the earth, the sea, or the trees. Later, as a result of the first four trumpets, the earth, the sea, and the trees are damaged (8:7-9). Before the Lord judges the world with the damage of the four trumpets, however, God will be mindful of those among the Jews who have the fear of God, and He will care for them by sealing them.</p>
<p>The number of those sealed is one hundred forty-four thousand, which is twelve thousand from each of the twelve tribes. As we have seen, twelve is three times four, indicating the mingling of the Triune God with humanity. Twelve is also the number of eternal perfection and eternal government. The one hundred forty-four thousand does not include the entire nation of Israel, because the tribe of Dan is not represented among them (vv. 5-8). According to Ezekiel 48:1, however, in the coming millennium Dan will still be counted among the tribes of Israel. The one hundred forty-four thousand here includes only the remnant of the Jews who truly fear God. Before the judgment of the four trumpets, God will preserve these few from the coming calamities.</p><h2 class="head2">The Redeemed Saints<br />
from the Time of the Rapture to Eternity</h2>
<p>The insertion between the sixth and seventh seals shows us how God will be mindful of His people, both of Israel and of the church. Before the damage brought in by the seven trumpets, God will take care of His people, desiring, if possible, to save them from these calamities. After the one hundred forty-four thousand among the Jews are sealed, Revelation 7:9-17 shows the general state of the redeemed ones from the time of their rapture into the presence of God to eternity. If we compare the scene in verses 9 to 17 with chapters twenty-one and twenty-two, we can see that it corresponds with the condition in eternity. Therefore, it transpires after the rapture of the saints.</p>
<p>Through many years of careful study, we have seen that even before the sixth seal some overcomers will be raptured. We say this because it is from the beginning of the sixth seal that God&rsquo;s judgment on this earth changes. Before the sixth seal, all the calamities brought in by the four horses are natural; due to war, there is the shortage of food and there is pestilence, resulting in death. Beginning from the sixth seal, however, the calamities are supernatural. The sun, the moon, and the stars are changed, and the earth suffers an extraordinary earthquake. Some of the overcomers will be raptured before these supernatural calamities begin. In this way, the insertion of chapter seven indicates that before the damage of the supernatural calamities, God will take care of His people who fear Him, both among the Jewish people and within the church.</p>
<p>Here I cannot go into much detail. I can only give you a hint about these matters. In order to see these things clearly, please refer to the chart mentioned above and read Revelation again, many times if possible. In my Bible, the book of Revelation is nearly worn out. This book is a big jigsaw puzzle, and we must be familiar with each piece in order to put it together.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SCENE IN HEAVEN BEFORE THE SEVEN TRUMPETS</h2>
<p>Revelation 8:1-5 describes the scene in heaven before the trumpeting of the seven trumpets. In this scene the prayers of the saints are brought to God by Christ. These prayers of the saints are symbolized by the golden censer, not the incense that is added to the censer. The incense added to the censer signifies the resurrected Christ, who is added to the prayers of the saints. In this way, the prayers of the saints are very effective and affect the throne of God in heaven. As a result, the fire of the altar is cast to the earth. On the one hand, the casting of fire to the earth is the answer to the saints&rsquo; prayers, which are made effective by Christ as the incense. On the other hand, the fire is the judgment of the subsequent trumpets. Therefore, the judgment of the trumpets is the answer to the prayers of the saints with Christ added to them. Because God hears the saints&rsquo; prayers, which are made effective by Christ as the incense, the answer to those prayers is poured out from the throne in heaven.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEVENTH SEAL</h2>
<p>The content of the seventh seal is the seven trumpets. The seven trumpets added together equal the seventh and last seal, which extends into eternity. The seven trumpets comprise the seventh seal, and within the seventh trumpet are the seven bowls. As we have seen, the number seven in Revelation is composed of four plus three. The first four seals comprise one group, and the last three are another. Seven is also composed of six plus one. Revelation 6 speaks of the first six seals, while chapter eight begins to speak of the seventh seal.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The First Four Trumpets&mdash;Judgment on the Earth, the Sea, the Rivers, and the Heavens</h2>
<p>At the first trumpet, hail and fire mingled with blood are cast to the earth, burning up the third part of the earth, the third part of the trees, and all green grass (v. 7). When the second angel trumpets, the third part of the sea becomes blood, and the third part of the creatures in the sea and the third part of the ships are destroyed (vv. 8-9). At the third trumpet, the third part of the rivers and fresh waters are damaged (vv. 10-11). When the fourth trumpet sounds, the third part of the sun, the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars are smitten (v. 12). One-third of the earth with the trees, one-third of the sea with all the things in it, one-third of the fresh waters, and one-third of the things in the heavens are damaged by the first four trumpets.</p>
<p>Today people say that whatever happens to the earth is natural, but at that time they will realize that what is happening is supernatural. That only one-third of everything is damaged will indicate that there must be a sovereign One who is arranging these things. Moreover, as the fourth seal, Death and Hades damage only the fourth part of the earth (6:8), but the four trumpets damage the third part, indicating that the damage is intensified.</p><h2 class="head2">The Fifth Trumpet&mdash;Judgment on Men</h2>
<p>After the first four trumpets, a warning is issued to all the people who dwell on the earth (v. 13). In principle, we are sojourners on this earth, not those who dwell in it. Do not be &ldquo;those who dwell on the earth.&rdquo; As Christians we should not settle down. Rather, we should be a migrating people. We are the children of Abraham, who migrated, traveled, and sojourned all the time. Some may need to migrate from the west coast to the east coast, passing through Idaho, Missouri, Chicago, and other places in the Midwest, Boston, Washington D. C., Florida, and then on to Mexico, Central America, and South America. Do not be settled; do not be &ldquo;those who dwell on the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warning in verse 13 consists of three woes, in which Satan, who is cast down from heaven to the earth, damages the earth as much as possible. Verses 1-11 of chapter nine speak of the first woe, which is also the fifth trumpet. When the fifth angel trumpets, a star out of heaven falls to the earth. By reading this book carefully, we can realize that this star is the fallen Satan. In Luke 10:18 the Lord said that He saw Satan falling like lightning out of heaven; that was the judgment of Satan. Revelation 9:1 contains the execution of that judgment, which also corresponds with 12:9-10.</p>
<p>After being cast out of heaven, Satan is given the key of the pit of the abyss. When he opens this bottomless pit, many evil spirits come out in the demon-possessed locusts (9:1-3). At the time of Moses, locusts were a great judgment on the Egyptians (Exo. 10:12-15). The fifth trumpet, however, will be a woe of supernatural locusts. These locusts will have tails like scorpions to sting people and torment them for five months. Due to this suffering, people will seek death, yet death will flee from them. These locusts will do a great deal of damage, which will be a real suffering. We do not like to say much beyond this, as some do with their wondrous interpretations of the locusts. We do not care for such interpretations; we only receive what is according to the Word of God.</p>
<p>Revelation 9:11 says that these strange locusts have a king, who is the angel of the abyss. Many believe that this angel is Satan, but this is not so. According to 11:7 and 17:8, the beast, Antichrist, is the one who comes out of the pit of the abyss. The Antichrist, as the king of the demon-possessed locusts, has a name in Hebrew, Abaddon, meaning &ldquo;destruction.&rdquo; This word is used also in Job 26:6, 28:22, and Proverbs 15:11. He also has the name Apollyon, which in Greek means &ldquo;destroyer.&rdquo; The Antichrist will be the destruction and the destroyer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Sixth Trumpet&mdash;Further Judgment on Men</h2>
<p>The sixth trumpet is the second woe, which is more serious and intensified than the fifth trumpet (Rev. 9:12-21). Verses 12 through 15 say, &ldquo;The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are yet coming after these things. And the sixth angel trumpeted, and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the golden altar which is before God saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates. And the four angels were released, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year that they might kill the third part of men.&rdquo; The first four trumpets damaged only the earth with the trees, the seas, and the rivers, and the things in the heavens. They did not directly damage men&rsquo;s bodies. At the fifth trumpet, however, the scorpions sting men&rsquo;s bodies, and at the sixth trumpet not only are men&rsquo;s bodies damaged, but the third part of men are killed (v. 18).</p>
<p>Verse 16 says, &ldquo;And the number of the armies of horsemen was two hundred million; I heard their number.&rdquo; I do not like to suggest too freely where these two hundred million horsemen will come from, but we should consider what part of the world can produce this many horses; that is where the trouble will arise. Verses 17-21 continue to show us what the sixth trumpet will be like. This entire portion of the earth at this time will be full of armies&mdash;the army in verse 16 alone will have two hundred million horsemen&mdash;and a third part of men will be killed. That will be a real woe to the human race.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SEVENTH TRUMPET</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 10&mdash;11</h1>
<p>The great tribulation will be a period of three and a half years (Dan. 7:25; 12:7; Rev. 12:14), which is forty-two months (11:2; 13:5), or twelve hundred and sixty days (11:3; 12:6), which is the last half of the last week in Daniel 9:24-27, beginning from the sixth seal, very close in time to the first five trumpets (Rev. 6:12-17; 8:7&mdash;9:11). A certain kind of tribulation on the earth will have begun before this time, but not in an intensified way. As we have seen, the second through fourth seals are a picture of the damage occurring from the time of the Lord&rsquo;s ascension to the end of this age. These damages are natural calamities. At the sixth seal, however, there is a sudden supernatural change in the signs in the heavens&mdash;the sun, the moon, and the stars&mdash;and on earth. At this time, the Lord begins to sound an alarm to the people on this earth. He warns them that this earth is not trustworthy, and because the Lord will shake this earth, they should not become settled in it.</p>
<p>The earthquake of the sixth seal is the beginning of the supernatural calamities. After the sixth seal, there are the four trumpets. The first trumpet damages the third part of the earth and the trees, the second trumpet damages the third part of the sea and the things in it, the third trumpet damages the third part of the springs and rivers, and the fourth trumpet damages the third part of the sun, the moon, and the stars. God intends these four trumpets to be a warning to the people on the earth not to trust it and settle down on it. However, although God will shake the earth and judge the third part of the earth, the sea, the fresh waters, and the things in the heavens, there will not yet be any direct injury to human beings. In this way, the sixth seal and the first four trumpets are only alarms, warning those people dwelling on this earth that they need to repent before God, turn from the earth, and seek God.</p>
<p>Following this warning, the tribulation will be intensified. By the time of the fifth trumpet, Satan will have been defeated in heaven and cast out of heaven to the earth. Then he will do whatever he can to damage the earth. Satan will open the pit of the abyss to release the multitude of evil things, the demon-possessed locusts with tails like scorpions who sting men&rsquo;s bodies and cause suffering for five months. We cannot realize such a thing because we have never experienced it.</p>
<p>The sixth trumpet brings even more intensified tribulation&mdash;two hundred million horsemen who kill the third part of men. At this point, one third of the earth, one third of the sea, one third of the fresh waters, and one third of the heavens have been damaged. Now, because men would not be warned by the first four trumpets but continue to do things against God, one third of the population is cut off.</p>
<p>At the time of the fifth trumpet Satan is cast to the earth, and at the same time Antichrist rises from the abyss to be the king of the evil things from the pit of the abyss. Moreover, the fifth trumpet as the first woe has something of scorpions (9:10), whereas the sixth trumpet as the second woe has something of serpents (v. 19). The Lord Jesus mentioned both serpents and scorpions in Luke 10:19. The serpent represents Satan, and scorpions are related to serpents. This indicates that during the time of the fifth and sixth trumpets, Satan will come down to this earth, and along with his incarnation, Antichrist, he will damage the earth.</p>
<p>These facts make it clear that the great tribulation of three and a half years will be intensified at the time of the fifth and sixth trumpets. Then, after the sixth trumpet, something even more serious occurs. The wrath of God will be exhausted in the seven bowls which will intensify the fearful damage and calamities.</p><h2 class="head1">THE VISIONS INSERTED<br />
BETWEEN THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH TRUMPETS</h2>
<p>Revelation 10:1&mdash;11:13 is the second insertion in this book, between the sixth and seventh trumpets. As we have seen, chapter seven is the first insertion, between the sixth and seventh seals, and later we will see that there is a third insertion between the sixth and seventh bowls (16:13-16). Why is there the need of an insertion between the sixth and seventh trumpets? It is because this point is very close to the time when the Lord Jesus will come back to take possession of the earth, which He has redeemed and which He has the full right to possess. Moreover, at the time of the sixth trumpet and before the seventh, the two witnesses come to the earth to testify strongly to people that they must repent to God. At least these two matters are mentioned in the second insertion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Coming to Possess the Earth</h2>
<p>Revelation 10:1 says, &ldquo;And I saw another strong Angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud.&rdquo; Chapter eight also speaks of &ldquo;another Angel&rdquo; (vv. 3-5). That Angel is Christ Himself. <em>Clothed with a cloud</em> indicates that this is a time prior to that spoken of in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17. In Revelation 14:14, which corresponds to 1 Thessalonians 4, the Lord sits on a cloud, but in Revelation 10:1 He is clothed with a cloud, that is, hidden in a cloud.</p>
<p>Revelation 10:1 continues, &ldquo;And the rainbow was upon His head, and His face was like the sun, and His feet like pillars of fire.&rdquo; The rainbow indicates that when the Lord Jesus comes back to take possession of the earth by His judgment, He will remind Himself of His covenant concerning the earth. Fire, as mentioned in verse 1, is for judgment, and pillars signify strength and steadfastness.</p>
<p>Verse 2 says, &ldquo;And He had in His hand a little opened scroll. And He placed His right foot on the sea and the left on the land.&rdquo; This scroll is the same one mentioned in chapter five. In chapter five He took the scroll, and now He has it in His hand. For someone to set his foot on something, as in 10:2, means that he is taking possession of it, just as God told the people of Israel to possess the land of Canaan by treading it with the soles of their feet (Deut. 11:24; Josh. 1:3). This indicates that at this time the Lord is ready to come back to possess the earth and the sea.</p>
<p>Verses 3 to 6 say, &ldquo;And He cried out with a loud voice just as a lion roars. And when He cried out, the seven thunders uttered their own voices. And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write, and I heard a voice out of heaven saying, Seal the things which the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them. And the Angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up His right hand to heaven and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that there shall be delay no longer.&rdquo; That the Angel lifted up His right hand to heaven indicates that Christ is ready to judge the earth and possess it through His judgment. That there shall be delay no longer means that there will be no more time of toleration in God&rsquo;s judgment upon the earth.</p>
<p>Verse 7 says, &ldquo;But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he is about to trumpet, then the mystery of God is finished, as He has announced the good news to His own slaves the prophets.&rdquo; At this time there is no more mystery; everything is completed and unveiled. God announced this good news to the prophets. In the Old Testament time God preached a kind of glad tidings to the prophets concerning His eternal purpose; now at this point what He preached is accomplished. This is a great verse, telling us that at the time the seventh trumpet is sounded, the mystery of God is finished.</p>
<p>Verses 8 through 10 say, &ldquo;And the voice which I heard out of heaven, I heard again speaking with me and saying, Go, take the opened scroll in the hand of the Angel who is standing on the sea and on the land. And I went to the Angel and told Him to give me the little scroll. And He said to me, Take it and devour it, and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey. And I took the little scroll out of the hand of the Angel and devoured it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth; and when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter.&rdquo; When we take the word of God, it is very sweet, but when we begin to experience it, we often taste bitterness.</p>
<p>Verse 11 continues, &ldquo;And they said to me, You must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.&rdquo; The word <em>again</em> is very important. Chapters four through eleven comprise the first section of prophecy in this book. The second section of the prophecy of this book is chapters twelve through twenty-two. From this point, John must prophesy again in the second section.</p>
<p>At the time between the sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet, the Lord Jesus is ready to come back to take possession of this earth through His judgment. As such, He is the One with the scroll, the &ldquo;title deed,&rdquo; in His hand. He has the right to take possession of this earth because He has redeemed it. At this point, He is ready, and the time is near, for the seventh trumpet is about to be sounded. At the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet, the mystery of God will be completed.</p><h2 class="head2">The Temple Measured and the Court Cast Out</h2>
<p>Revelation 11:1 says, &ldquo;And there was given to me a reed like a rod, and someone said, Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship in it.&rdquo; Revelation 21:15 mentions a golden reed for measuring, but there it is not like a rod. A rod is used for judgment. In chapter eleven there is still the need of judgment because of the sinful and worldly things on the earth. In chapter twenty-one, however, there is no need of a rod because there is nothing left to judge in the New Jerusalem. To measure something is with the intention of taking possession of it. Hence, the reed in 11:1 is for measuring with judgment in order to possess.</p>
<p>The temple of God mentioned in verse 1 is the temple in the heavens, and the altar is not the altar of burnt offering but the incense altar, because it is with the temple, not outside of it. The measuring of the temple of God and the incense altar in the heavens indicates that during the great tribulation the heavens will be preserved from being damaged, because in that three and a half years Satan will be cast out of heaven and down to earth.</p>
<p>Verse 2 continues, &ldquo;And the court which is outside the temple cast out and do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months.&rdquo; The outer court of the temple signifies the earthly temple and Jerusalem on the earth. That it is not measured means that God will give it up and will not take possession of it. The holy city, Jerusalem, will be given up to the Gentiles to be trampled for forty-two months. The insertions in the book of Revelation speak about matters close in time to the events in the nearby chapters. This is why we say that the last half of the last week, the forty-two months mentioned in verse 2, will begin with the sixth seal, which is very close to the time of the first five trumpets in chapters eight and nine.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Two Witnesses</h2>
<p>Verse 3 says, &ldquo;And I will cause My two witnesses to prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.&rdquo; According to the ancient Jewish calendar, a month had thirty days. Three and a half years, that is, forty-two months times thirty, is a thousand two hundred and sixty days, as in verse 3. During the last half of the last week of this age, the two witnesses will come to prophesy, clothed in sackcloth. According to the Old Testament, for people to put on sackcloth means that they are mourning, not joyful (Isa. 22:12; Joel 1:13). Revelation 11:4 says, &ldquo;These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth.&rdquo; The olive trees and the lampstands are seen in Zechariah 4. The two olive trees produce oil for the lamps of the lampstand, so they are called the two sons of oil (v. 14).</p>
<p>Bible students are of two schools of opinion concerning these two sons of oil. The first school says that these two witnesses are Enoch and Elijah, whereas the second school says that they are Moses and Elijah. All Bible students agree concerning Elijah, but they disagree whether the other is Enoch or Moses. We should understand who the two witnesses are according to the record of what they will do. Some things they will do are what Moses did in Egypt, and other things correspond to what Elijah did. In addition, Revelation 11:4 says that the two witnesses stand before the Lord of the earth. On the mountain where the Lord was transfigured, Moses and Elijah came to stand before the Lord (Matt. 17:1-13). Moreover, after Moses&rsquo; death, Satan contended with Michael for the body of Moses (Jude 9). Michael must have sought to preserve the body of Moses for a definite reason, which was for him to appear on the Mount of Transfiguration and to be one of the two witnesses. During the great tribulation, God will send Moses and Elijah back to give a strong testimony for Him.</p>
<p>Verses 5 through 7 say, &ldquo;And if anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. And if anyone desires to harm them, thus must he be killed. These have the authority to shut heaven that no rain may fall during the days of their prophecy; and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they desire. And when they have completed their testimony, the beast who comes up out of the abyss will make war with them and will overcome them and kill them.&rdquo; Shutting heaven is what Elijah did (1 Kings 17:1), and turning water to blood is what Moses did (Exo. 7:17, 19). The beast here is the Antichrist, the man of sin. He is not an ordinary person but an extraordinary one coming up out of the bottomless pit. This beast will make war with the two witnesses.</p>
<p>Revelation 11:8 says, &ldquo;And their corpses will be on the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.&rdquo; This great city is Jerusalem. By this time the earthly Jerusalem will become full of sin like Sodom and worldly like Egypt. Verses 9 and 10 continue, &ldquo;And those of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations see their corpses for three and a half days, and they will not allow their corpses to be placed in a tomb. And those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them and make merry; and they will send gifts to one another because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.&rdquo; Three and a half days is similar to the three days in which the Lord was in the tomb (Luke 24:46) and the four days in which Lazarus was dead (John 11:39). Because the two witnesses are &ldquo;troublemakers,&rdquo; people will celebrate when they are killed and will leave their bodies on the street.</p>
<p>Revelation 11:11-12 says, &ldquo;And after the three and a half days, the breath of life out of God entered into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those beholding them. And they heard a loud voice out of heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them.&rdquo; This indicates that the two witnesses will be raptured. Then verse 13 says, &ldquo;And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and seven thousand men were killed in the earthquake, and the rest became terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.&rdquo; Literally, <em>men</em> in verse 13 is &ldquo;names of men,&rdquo; or as Robert Govett says, &ldquo;men of names,&rdquo; implying people of renown.</p>
<p>The last half of the last week, that is, the three and a half years, will be the period of the great tribulation. During this time these two strongest of witnesses will come to give a strong testimony to the earth. They will be killed by Antichrist, resurrected miraculously as a testimony to the whole earth, and raptured in a special rapture to the heavens.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SEVENTH TRUMPET</h2>
<p>Revelation 11:14 marks the beginning of the seventh trumpet. It reads, &ldquo;The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is coming quickly.&rdquo; The second woe is the sixth trumpet, while the third woe is a part of the seventh trumpet. Verse 15 continues, &ldquo;And the seventh angel trumpeted; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever.&rdquo; At the time the seventh trumpet sounds, the mystery of God will be finished, and the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of God and Christ.</p>
<p>Verses 16-18 say, &ldquo;And the twenty-four elders who sit before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshipped God, saying, We thank You, Lord God the Almighty, He who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and have reigned. And the nations became angry, and Your wrath came, and the time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to give the reward to Your slaves the prophets and to the saints and to those who fear Your name, to the small and to the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.&rdquo; <em>Your wrath</em> in verse 18 is the wrath of the seven bowls, the final wrath of God on the world. In addition, at the close of this age, before the millennium, the dead will be judged concerning who should share in the resurrection of life before the millennium and who should be left to the resurrection of condemnation after the millennium at the judgment of the great white throne.</p>
 <p>The giving of the reward to His slaves the prophets occurs before the millennium. At the start of the thousand years the Lord will reward His servants, and at the end of the thousand years the Lord will judge the resurrected dead. Destroying those who destroy the earth is carried out in part in Revelation 16 to 18. The Lord destroys the religious Babylon, for example, in chapter seventeen and the material Babylon in chapter eighteen. By this we can see that the seventh trumpet includes many matters, even the things into eternity future.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SCENE IN HEAVEN AFTER THE TRUMPETING<br />
OF THE SEVENTH TRUMPET</h2>
<p>Revelation 11:19 is a crucial verse, which says, &ldquo;And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple; and there were lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and great hail.&rdquo; The lightnings, voices, thunders, and earthquake correspond exactly to 16:18, indicating that these two verses refer to the same time.</p>
<p>Careful students of the Bible realize that the book of Revelation with twenty-two chapters has two sections. The first eleven chapters form one section, and the last eleven form another. In chapter four there is a throne in heaven with a rainbow; the prophecy in the first section is under the vision of this throne. In chapter eleven, however, there is another vision, not of the throne but of the temple in heaven, and not with a rainbow but with an ark. The throne with a rainbow is the source and center of the prophecy of the first section of this book, while the temple with the ark of testimony is the source and center of the prophecy of the second section.</p>
<p>As we have seen, the throne refers to God&rsquo;s authority, and the rainbow refers to God&rsquo;s covenant concerning the earth. Therefore, the first section of the prophecy of this book tells us that the very God who is on the throne with authority is about to execute His judgment on this earth. However, while judging this earth, He still remembers His covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SECOND SECTION OF REVELATION,<br />
GIVING DETAILS CONCERNING GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL PURPOSE</h2>
<p>The second section of the prophecy of Revelation is not a direct continuation of the first section. It may be compared to Genesis 2, which is not a direct continuation of Genesis 1. Genesis 1 gives a complete record of God&rsquo;s creation in a general way, but more details are needed in order to show us God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. In chapter one alone it is difficult to see the eternal purpose of God. These details are in Genesis 2, which contains many figures, telling us that man was created with three parts in order to partake of the tree of life so that he will be transformed to be gold, bdellium (pearl), and onyx, the precious materials for the building up of the New Jerusalem as the eternal &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; the eternal wife of the Lamb.</p>
<p>The prophecy in the first section of Revelation unveils matters extending into eternity, but it only gives a general record of how God, who is on the throne in the heavens, comes to judge the earth to clear up the situation that He may reign on the earth for eternity. It does not show us the purpose of God in detail. Therefore, there is the need of a supplement, the second section of this book, to give us details concerning God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and how God will fulfill His purpose as the One who dwells in the temple with His testimony. Now God is not only the One on the throne but also the One in the temple. He is not only the One with a rainbow but the One with the ark of testimony.</p>
<p>The first section of Revelation shows us God&rsquo;s judgment to clear up the things on the earth, based on the fact that He is the unique One with authority on the throne and a rainbow as a reminder to Him. The second section, however, speaks not merely of God&rsquo;s judgment but of how God has an eternal purpose to build up a temple as a habitation for Himself with Christ, the ark of the testimony, as the content. God is the One who dwells in the temple with the testimony for His expression and satisfaction. Therefore, the second section speaks of God doing things to prepare a habitation, a temple, for Himself that He may have His testimony within it as its content.</p>
<p>In the first part of the prophecy of this book, from chapter four to chapter eleven, we cannot realize what God is seeking after. We can only see that God, as the One on the throne with the rainbow, is judging to clear up the situation on the earth. In the second section, however, we can trace what God is seeking after. He desires to have a habitation with His testimony. Now He is in the temple, but one day the temple will be replaced by a city. God is not satisfied with the temple in which He dwells, so He is preparing another, bigger habitation, which is the city of New Jerusalem. In this city there is no more temple (21:22).</p>
<p>In the temple in 11:19 there is not a rainbow but the ark of testimony, that is, Christ. Christ, the testimony of God today, is in the temple in the heavens, but God needs to work Him into the city. Then the city will take the place of the temple in the eternity to come, and Christ will be the very ark of testimony in that city. Today this ark of testimony is in the temple, but God&rsquo;s intention is to work this ark from the temple into the city. This is the central thought of the second part of this prophecy.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE UNIVERSAL BRIGHT WOMAN<br />
AND THE TWO BEASTS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 12&mdash;13</h1>
<p>The first chapter of the second section of Revelation reveals a woman who brings forth a man-child (12:1-18), and the last two chapters of this section also reveal a woman (21:2, 9; 22:17). At the beginning of this section there is a wonderful, glorious, universal woman, clothed with the sun, with the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. This woman eventually will be the wonderful and beautiful bride to match God, as the very habitation of God, the holy city, with God&rsquo;s testimony in it.</p>
<p>Between Revelation 12 and 22, however, there is another woman. This woman is the great harlot, the sinful woman sitting upon a scarlet beast (17:1-6). She is the evil woman in Matthew 13 and Jezebel in Revelation 2. This sinful woman is related and affiliated with politics, the kings of the earth, to form the mystery, Babylon the Great, which is also a city. Therefore, in the second section of Revelation there are two women and two cities in contrast. In order to understand these two women, we need to understand the entire Scriptures because the entire Scriptures give us the record of the two cities of Babylon and Jerusalem. Babylon began from Babel in Genesis 11, while Jerusalem began from the tent of Abraham in Genesis 12. The tent pitched by Abraham, which was in contrast to the city of Babel, later became Jerusalem. These two cities, Jerusalem and Babylon, were always in conflict. Eventually it was an army from Babylon that came to destroy Jerusalem. Following this, the recovery of the destroyed Jerusalem was carried out by those who came back from Babylon. Hence, the whole story of the Old Testament from Genesis 11 to the end of Malachi is simply a record of these two cities. After this, the New Testament reveals two women, which are the fulfillment of the two cities.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIVERSAL BRIGHT WOMAN</h2>
<p>Revelation 12:1 says, &ldquo;And a great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.&rdquo; This great sign corresponds with Joseph&rsquo;s dream in Genesis 37. According to verses 9 and 10, the sun represents Joseph&rsquo;s father, the moon represents his mother, and the eleven stars represent his eleven brothers. In principle, therefore, the sun, the moon, and the twelve stars together represent the entire company of God&rsquo;s redeemed people.</p>
<p>This woman is a universal woman, a heavenly woman, a sign seen in heaven. Because this woman is not earthly but heavenly, we cannot say that this woman is Mary, the mother of Jesus, as some Bible students claim. Mary is too small; she is not universally great. Others claim that this woman refers to the people of Israel. However, the people of Israel are not God&rsquo;s heavenly people but His earthly people. There are many reasons that prove that these other understandings of the woman are not correct.</p>
<p>This woman represents three main dispensations. The sun represents God&rsquo;s people in the New Testament age. Luke 1:78 tells us that when the Lord Jesus came the first time, the sun visited us from on high. The dispensation of the New Testament is the dispensation of the sun shining on the earth. That the main part of the woman&rsquo;s being is clothed with the sun indicates that the main part of this woman is the people of the New Testament age. The twelve stars represent the patriarchs; before the age of the law, the patriarchs were shining and glorious as stars. The moon under her feet represents God&rsquo;s people in the dispensation of the law, which was not glorious. Just as the moon reflects the glory of the sun, the Old Testament time only reflected the glory of the New Testament. Therefore, the moon is not on the head of the woman but underneath her feet.</p>
 <p>In the eyes of God all His redeemed ones are a woman. The Old Testament tells us that the redeemed Israel was a woman before God, and the New Testament says the same thing about the church. Therefore, this woman is a composition of all the redeemed ones in these three main ages&mdash;the age of the patriarchs, the age of the law, and the age of grace&mdash;but the main part of this woman is the redeemed ones of the New Testament time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Great Red Dragon against the Woman</h2>
<p>Verses 2-4 say, &ldquo;And she was with child, and she cried out, travailing in birth and being in pain to bring forth. And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold, there was a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems. And his tail drags away the third part of the stars of heaven, and he cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, so that when she brings forth he might devour her child.&rdquo; The dragon signifies Satan, who is no longer a small serpent but a great red dragon. Red here signifies the shedding of blood caused by Satan&rsquo;s murders (John 8:44). The dragon corresponds with the beast in chapter thirteen, because they both have seven heads and ten horns (v. 1). According to 17:3 and 9-10, the seven heads are the seven Caesars of the Roman Empire, and the ten horns are the ten kings of the coming restored Roman Empire. The seven diadems represent glory and authority, which Satan always seeks. The stars of heaven refer to the angels in heaven (Job 38:7; Isa. 14:12). That his tail drags away the third part of the stars of heaven indicates that Satan has deceived one third of the angels, who will be cast to the earth with him (Rev. 12:9).</p><h2 class="head2">The Man-child Born</h2>
<p>Verse 5a says, &ldquo;And she brought forth a son, a man-child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod.&rdquo; <em>Man,</em> in <em>man-child,</em> is a meaningful and strong word. In the Scriptures, woman signifies weakness, while man signifies strength. We must keep in mind that chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen are written in a symbolic way. They are a record with signs. Thus, the woman here is not an actual woman; she is a symbol, a sign. In the same way, the man-child here is also a sign. In this picture, there is a woman, signifying something weak, out of whom comes a man-child, signifying something strong. This indicates that the man-child is the stronger part of this woman. Within the woman, the weaker part, representing all the redeemed people of God, there is a stronger part, who are the overcomers.</p>
<p>This man-child will shepherd all the nations with an iron rod. Revelation 2:26-27 tells us who this one is. It says, &ldquo;And he who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations; and he will shepherd them with an iron rod.&rdquo; The ones who shepherd the nations with an iron rod are the overcomers. In the first three chapters of Revelation there are the seven churches, which are weak as a whole. They are a weak woman, but the Lord calls out the overcomers from among them. The overcomers are a small number who stand up to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose when the majority of the people of God have failed Him.</p>
<p>This principle of the overcomers runs throughout all the Scriptures. At the time when Moses brought the people of Israel out of Egypt, God&rsquo;s purpose was that the entire nation of Israel would be a kingdom of priests. However, they failed God in His purpose. Only one tribe, the Levites, stood up to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. In this way they became the overcomers at that time. The people of Israel were a weak woman, and the tribe of Levi was the overcomers. In the book of Judges, all the judges such as Gideon were overcomers. The majority of God&rsquo;s people failed to carry out His purpose, so a small part stood up to be the overcomers. In the recovery of God&rsquo;s people in the Old Testament time, God&rsquo;s intention was to have all His people come back from Babylon to Jerusalem. However, very few of them came back as a remnant with Ezra and Nehemiah. Those who came back to Jerusalem became the overcomers standing in the position of God&rsquo;s people to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. Today it is the same. The church as a whole has failed God today in His purpose, so the Lord is calling the overcomers. A small remnant will answer the Lord&rsquo;s call to rise up and represent the church to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. These become the overcomers; in principle, they are the man-child.</p>
 <h2 class="head2">The Man-child Caught Up to God<br />
and to His Throne and the Woman Fleeing</h2>
<p>Revelation 12:5b-6 says, &ldquo;And her child was caught up to God and to His throne. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place there prepared by God so that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.&rdquo; To be caught up to God refers to the rapture. However, the place of rapture is not the place mentioned in 1 Thessalonians 4:17. This verse tells us that the majority of the church will be caught up to the air, not to the throne of God. The times of the raptures in Revelation 12 and 1 Thessalonians 4 are different, and the places to which they are raptured are also different.</p>
<p>The woman will be nourished for a thousand two hundred sixty days, that is, for three and a half years. This indicates that the overcomers will be caught up, raptured before the three and a half years. This is why we cannot accept the teachings of the pre-tribulation rapture or the post-tribulation rapture by themselves. Here is a woman, signifying the totality of God&rsquo;s redeemed people, who brings forth a man-child, a part of the woman, who is caught up to the throne of God before the last three and a half years of this age. After the rapture of the stronger part, the main part of the woman will still remain on the earth. The proper understanding of the rapture is that there will be more than one.</p>
<p>Revelation 14 mentions another rapture, the rapture of another group of overcomers called the firstfruits (vv. 1-4). As we shall see later, these two groups of overcomers are not the same, but both groups will be raptured to the throne before the tribulation of three and a half years. In this way, a part of God&rsquo;s people will be raptured before the three and a half years, while the majority of the people of God will be left on the earth to pass through the great tribulation.</p><h2 class="head2">War in Heaven</h2>
<p>Verses 7-9 say, &ldquo;And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels went to war with the dragon. And the dragon warred and his angels. And they did not prevail, neither was their place found any longer in heaven. And the great dragon was cast down, the ancient serpent, he who is called the Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole inhabited earth; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.&rdquo; <em>Dragon</em> indicates greatness, cruelty, and killing; <em>serpent</em> refers to the cunning one who always deceives; <em>devil</em> means accuser or slanderer; and Satan is the rebellious one.</p>
<p>Satan is cast down at this point because the overcomers, the man-child, are caught up to God. The principle here is that where the man-child is, there is no ground for the enemy. Satan has been judged on the cross of Christ, but this judgment needs to be executed. The church should carry out this judgment, but it has failed, so the overcomers must rise up to take the position of the church to execute God&rsquo;s sentence on Satan. Therefore, where the overcomers are, there is no ground, no place, left for the enemy of God. After the overcomers are raptured and caught up to God&rsquo;s throne, there will be no more place there for the enemy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Overcoming the Enemy</h2>
<p>Verses 10-11 continue, &ldquo;And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ, for the accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night. And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death.&rdquo; Our attitude must be that because of the blood we overcome the accusing one, Satan. All the time Satan accuses us before God and in our conscience. A seeking believer may deal with his conscience until it becomes a pure conscience. However, when the conscience becomes pure, it is easy for it to be weak; many times a keen conscience becomes a weak conscience. When our conscience is weak, the enemy always accuses us, causing us to constantly feel that we are not right. Sometimes a believer is caught by the enemy to such an extent that when he stands, he feels wrong, and when he sits, he feels wrong; when he speaks, he feels wrong, and when he is silent, he feels wrong. He always feels wrong. This is the accusation from the enemy. On the one hand, we do have to deal with our conscience, but on the other hand, we have to stand against the enemy by the covering of the blood. We have to not only claim but proclaim the power of the redeeming blood. We must have a strong conscience by the cleansing of the blood. We cannot stand against the accuser by ourselves. We have to stand against him by the blood.</p>
 <p>We also need to have the word of our testimony. When our conscience is weak, we cannot have a word of testimony, but when our conscience is void of offense, we have the boldness to give a word of testimony. A weak conscience always shuts our mouth, so we must have our conscience cleansed by the blood. Then we will have a pure conscience, a conscience void of offense, and we will have the boldness to give the word of our testimony.</p>
<p>We must also have the proper attitude. Whatever we are testifying by our word, we have to put our life into it, even unto death. We do not care about our life; this is the proper attitude. In order to overcome the enemy, we need to apply the blood, have a strong word of testimony, and put our life into our testimony. There is no other way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Dragon Persecuting the Woman</h2>
<p>Verses 13 and 14 say, &ldquo;And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the man-child. And to the woman there were given the two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent.&rdquo; These two wings indicate the protection extended by God to His people. After God&rsquo;s people fled from Egypt, the Lord told them that He had borne them on eagles&rsquo; wings and brought them to Himself (Exo. 19:4). During the last three and a half years, God will do the same thing to the remainder of His people who will be left on the earth to pass through the period of the great tribulation. The woman is nourished for a time and times and half a time. <em>A time</em> is one year, <em>times</em> is two years, and <em>half a time</em> is half a year. During this time, God will nourish the remaining believers just as He nourished His people in the wilderness for forty years.</p>
<p>Revelation 12:15 says, &ldquo;And the serpent cast water as a river out of his mouth after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away by its current.&rdquo; Satan will send armies, signified by <em>waters,</em> to destroy the people of God. Jeremiah 46:7-9; 47:2-3; and Isaiah 8:7-8; 17:12-13; and 59:19 tell us that the armies of the enemies of God&rsquo;s people come like a flood. During the three and a half years, the devil will send his evil spirits to cause great armies to come to persecute the people of God. However, Revelation 12:16 says, &ldquo;And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Dragon Making War<br />
with the Rest of the Woman&rsquo;s Seed</h2>
<p>Verses 17 continues, &ldquo;And the dragon became angry with the woman and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus.&rdquo; Those who keep the commandments of God are those Jews who by that time will fear God, and those who have the testimony of Jesus are the New Testament believers. These two groups of people are a part of the woman, the composition of all the people of God. The stronger part, the man-child, has been raptured by this time, but these two groups still remain on the earth. During the last three and a half years of this age, the Jews who fear God and the Christians who remain on earth will be persecuted by Satan and by the Antichrist.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TWO BEASTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Beast out of the Sea&mdash;Antichrist</h2>
<p>Verse 18 says, &ldquo;And he stood on the sand of the sea.&rdquo; <em>He</em> denotes the dragon, and <em>the sea</em> is the Mediterranean Sea. Then 13:1 says, &ldquo;And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns ten diadems, and on his heads names of blasphemy.&rdquo; This beast, the fourth beast mentioned in Daniel 7:7, is Antichrist. In Revelation 9:11, 11:7, and 17:8 we are told that Antichrist will come up out of the abyss. Here we are told that he will come up out of the sea, as is mentioned also in Daniel 7:3. This indicates that Antichrist will come from two sources. His spirit, which exists in the abyss before he is born, will come up out of the abyss. His body will come from one of the Gentile nations around the Mediterranean Sea. In biblical figure, the land signifies the nation of Israel, and the sea signifies the Gentile nations (Rev. 17:15; Isa. 57:20).</p>
<p>The seven heads and ten horns of the beast are those of the dragon (Rev. 12:3). This indicates that the beast is one with the dragon. The ten horns are the ten coming kings (17:12; Dan. 7:24); the seven heads are the seven Caesars (Rev. 17:10). The ten horns correspond with the ten toes of the great image mentioned in Daniel 2:42-44. The word here indicates that the Roman Empire, Antichrist, and the ten kings are one with Satan.</p>
<p>Revelation 13:2a says, &ldquo;And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion.&rdquo; According to Daniel 7:4-6, the leopard, which is characterized by swift and cruel movement, was the symbol of Alexander the Great, the king of Greece. The bear, characterized by its destroying feet, was the symbol of the monarchy of Medo-Persia. The lion, characterized by its devouring mouth, was a symbol of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. Since Antichrist, the beast, is like these three, he will have all their characteristics, as mentioned in Daniel 7:4-7. He is the totality of all the evil powers in human history.</p>
<p>Revelation13:2b continues, &ldquo;And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.&rdquo; This indicates that the dragon makes the beast one with him so that on behalf of the dragon the beast can resist God and persecute God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>Verse 3 says, &ldquo;And one of his heads was as it were slain to death, and his death stroke was healed. And the whole earth marveled after the beast.&rdquo; <em>One of his heads</em> refers to one of the Caesars, who will be slain and resuscitated. <em>His death stroke was healed</em> means that the Caesar will be resuscitated from death (17:11). Because of this the whole earth will marvel and follow after him. Revelation 13:4 continues, &ldquo;And they worshipped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like the beast? And who can make war with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verse 5 says, &ldquo;And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and authority was given to him to act for forty-two months.&rdquo; These forty-two months will be the period of the great tribulation. Those Christians who fail related to God&rsquo;s purpose will be left to pass through this period. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;And he opened his mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, which tabernacle in heaven.&rdquo; The tabernacle in heaven includes the raptured believers, who by this time will be in heaven.</p>
<p>Verse 7 continues, &ldquo;And permission was given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them; and authority was given to him over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.&rdquo; This indicates that expositors such as J. N. Darby were incorrect in saying that every saint will be raptured before the tribulation. During the forty-two months Antichrist will make war with the saints, that is, those who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus (12:17). As we have seen, the dragon will raise up armies to persecute the remnant of the seed of the woman; these are the armies of the beast, the Antichrist. Therefore, Revelation 12 and 13 speak of the same things in two aspects, showing that Satan works together with the Antichrist, the Antichrist cooperates with Satan, and the two become one.</p>
<p>Verses 8-10 say, &ldquo;And all those dwelling on the earth will worship him, every one whose name is not written in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world. If anyone has an ear, let him hear. If anyone is for captivity, into captivity he goes; if anyone kills with the sword, with the sword he is to be killed. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.&rdquo; Verse 10 once again mentions the saints, those who are left on the earth. Under persecution they need endurance and faith.</p><h2 class="head2">The Beast out of the Earth&mdash;the False Prophet</h2>
<p>Verse 11 says, &ldquo;And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.&rdquo; This beast is not Antichrist, but the false prophet who comes up out of the earth. That he is a lamb in form but a beast in actuality indicates that he is false. Whereas Christ as the Lamb of God with seven horns has the seven Spirits of God (5:6), this false lamb with two horns sends out unclean spirits (16:13).</p>
<p>Verse 12 of chapter thirteen continues, &ldquo;And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his sight, and he causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose death stroke was healed.&rdquo; As a prophet he speaks so that people follow him to worship the first beast, the Antichrist. Because Antichrist will be killed and miraculously resuscitated, people will worship him. This will be the message of the false prophet. Just as the prophets of God today preach the resurrection of Christ, at that time the false prophet will preach the resuscitation of the Antichrist. Verse 13 says, &ldquo;And he does great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth before men.&rdquo; This will be to counter what Elijah will do as one of the two witnesses (11:5). This false prophet will show people that what Elijah can do, he himself can do also.</p>
<p>Verses 14-15 say, &ldquo;And he deceives those who dwell on the earth on account of the signs which he was given power to do before the beast, commanding those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast, who had the stroke of the sword and revived. And power was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast that the image of the beast might even speak and cause whoever would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.&rdquo; <em>Breath</em> in verse 15 may be translated <em>spirit.</em> Since the beginning of the history of man there has never been an idol which could speak, but at the end of this age there will be an idol with a spirit in it which will speak; that will be a real miracle. However, those who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus&mdash;the real Jews and the faithful believers&mdash;will not worship the beast and his image, so many of them will be killed.</p>
<p>The coming Antichrist will be a very extraordinary person. Both the Antichrist and the false prophet will be persons returned from the dead. The first beast, Antichrist, comes out of the abyss (9:11; 11:7; 17:8), and the second beast, the false prophet, comes out of the earth. This false prophet may be Judas Iscariot. In Acts 1:20, Peter refers to Judas by quoting Psalm 109:8, which says, &ldquo;May his days be few; / May another take his office.&rdquo; Verse 6 of this Psalm says, &ldquo;Appoint a wicked man over him, / And let an adversary stand at his right hand.&rdquo; This indicates that Satan stood with Judas, the one who betrayed the Lord Jesus. In addition, Acts 1:25 says that after Judas died, he went &ldquo;to his own place,&rdquo; not to his people as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did (Gen. 25:8; 35:29; 49:33). In John 17:12 the Lord Jesus also said that Judas is the son of perdition, while 2 Thessalonians 2:3 tells us that the Antichrist is the son of perdition. Only these two persons are called the sons of perdition. Lastly, in John 6:70-71 the Lord Jesus called Judas a devil. By joining all these points together, we can believe that this false prophet will be Judas, who will come back from the dead. Who among men is as qualified to be the false prophet? Judas is the one most qualified.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Number of the Beast</h2>
<p>Revelation 13:16-18 say, &ldquo;And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the freemen and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, and that no one may be able to buy or sell except him who has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred sixty-six.&rdquo; Because the book of Revelation was written during the time of the Roman Empire, John could not write it in plain words. Since it was written in such a mysterious way, wisdom is needed to understand.</p>
<p>Six hundred sixty-six is the number of the beast, the number of a man, and the number of the name of that beast. Some people have spent much time to find the meaning of this number, and I have learned from their studies. This man is Caesar Nero. In Hebrew and Greek, letters represent numbers. The number represented by the Hebrew letters of the name <em>Nero</em> is 306, and the number represented by <em>Caesar</em> is 360; the total comes to 666. Therefore, Caesar Nero is the name of this man and the name of the beast.</p>
<p>Of all the numbers from one to ten, the most negative number is six. In the Scriptures the number seven is formed either by six and one, signifying the creation plus the Creator, or four and three, signifying the creature plus the Triune God. The number six, however, is one short of seven, signifying humanity created on the sixth day but short of God and corrupted by Satan. The number of the beast, Antichrist, the man of lawlessness in 2 Thessalonians 2, is 666, nothing but humanity short of God, damaged and corrupted by the devil. In contrast, the Greek name for <em>Jesus,</em> according to the numeric value of the Greek letters, adds to 888, eight being the number of resurrection. He is the resurrection (John 11:25), and everything about Him is in resurrection. In addition, in reference to the Antichrist the word <em>beast</em> is used thirty-six times in Revelation, which is six times six, while <em>Lamb,</em> referring to Christ, is used twenty-eight times, which is four times seven. The Antichrist is nothing but corrupted humanity without God, while Jesus is humanity mingled with God in resurrection.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FIRSTFRUITS, THE HARVEST,<br />
AND THE WINEPRESS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 14</h1>
<p>We must remember that chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen of Revelation were written symbolically. Therefore, we should not understand them literally. We have seen this clearly in chapters twelve and thirteen; chapter fourteen is the same in principle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRSTFRUITS OF THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>Revelation 14:1-5 says, &ldquo;And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads. And I heard a voice out of heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder; and the voice which I heard was like the sound of harp-singers playing on their harps. And they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand, who have been purchased from the earth. These are they who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He may go. These were purchased from among men as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. And in their mouth no lie was found; they are without blemish.&rdquo; Zion in verse 1 is not the Mount Zion on the earth but the one in the heavens (Heb. 12:22). The sound of harp-singers in verse 2 is for praising. That the hundred and forty-four thousand are purchased from the earth indicates that they are redeemed ones, a part of the church.</p>
<p>The firstfruits here are before the throne of God; they are no longer on this earth. This means that they have been raptured. They are on Mount Zion in the heavens, before the throne of God. Verses 14-16 of the same chapter mention the ripened harvest. The firstfruits and the general harvest are mentioned in type in Leviticus 23:10 and 22, Exodus 23:19, and 34:26. The firstfruits are brought from the field not to the barn but into the temple for God&rsquo;s satisfaction and enjoyment. The majority of the harvest, however, is left in the field until it ripens. After ripening, it is brought not to the temple but into the barn, the place between the field and the farmhouse. This means that the general harvest of the believers is not taken to the throne of God but to the air (1 Thes. 4:17).</p>
<p>In Revelation 12, the rapture of the man-child, who fights against God&rsquo;s enemy, is not merely a matter of prophecy, nor is the rapture for the sake of the believers themselves. Rather, it is for a function before God. God needs the man-child to be raptured to the heavens to fight the battle with His enemy that the enemy might be defeated and cast down to the earth for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose. In the same principle, the firstfruits in chapter fourteen do not merely enjoy the rapture, but they satisfy God&rsquo;s need. On the one hand, the man-child fulfills God&rsquo;s purpose by defeating His enemy, while on the other hand, the firstfruits are for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. As the firstfruits offered to God in the temple for His satisfaction, they enjoy the rapture in order to take care of God&rsquo;s need.</p>
<p>We should not pay as much attention to the prophecies themselves as to our maturity, so that we may be the firstfruits to satisfy the heart of God. For us to give God this enjoyment, we need to be matured. If we are still &ldquo;green&rdquo; and childish, how can we be the firstfruits and be raptured? Instead, the Lord will have to leave us in the field until we ripen.</p>
<p>The firstfruits are the faithful followers of the Lamb. They follow Jesus and are not defiled by the earthly things. They are the part of the redeemed ones that mature first. As such, they satisfy God&rsquo;s heart. They will be raptured not merely to the air but will transcend the air to be taken to the temple of God, the throne of God, for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. There is no need for more definitions or interpretations concerning the firstfruits. We only need to see the foregoing spiritual meanings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ETERNAL GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Revelation 14:6 and 7 say, &ldquo;And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having an eternal gospel to announce to those dwelling on the earth, even to every nation and tribe and tongue and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give Him glory because the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who has made heaven and earth and the sea and the springs of waters.&rdquo; The four Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles speak of the gospel of the kingdom and the gospel of grace; these books do not have such a term as the eternal gospel. We should not confuse these different terms. The eternal gospel is neither the gospel of the kingdom nor the gospel of grace. Moreover, this gospel will not be preached by redeemed men but by an angel. The gospel of the kingdom and the gospel of grace are preached by redeemed men. Angels have no right, no position, to preach the gospel of grace. In Acts 10, an angel appeared to Cornelius to tell him to send for Peter to preach the gospel, but the angel could not preach the gospel directly (vv. 1-8). The eternal gospel, however, is different; it is preached by an angel.</p><h2 class="head2">The Items of the Eternal Gospel</h2>
<p>To fear God, giving Him glory, and to worship Him are the two items of the eternal gospel (Rev. 14:7). The gospel of grace also contains two items&mdash;repent and believe (Mark 1:15). Men must repent of their sins and believe into the Son of God. The eternal gospel, however, mentions nothing about repentance or believing. We must be careful in reading the Scriptures. The eternal gospel is a matter of God&rsquo;s dispensation. The terms, the items, the contents, of this gospel are one hundred percent different from the gospel of grace preached by believers. Whereas the gospel of grace is one of repentance and faith, the eternal gospel is for people on the earth only to fear God and worship Him. This is due to the fact that at this time the Antichrist and his followers persecute God&rsquo;s people, having no fear of God. Therefore, the angel warns them to fear God and do nothing to wrong the people of God.</p>
<p>During the great tribulation, the Antichrist will set up his image for people to worship. This idol will even be able to speak, seducing many people to worship it. Therefore, the angel warns people to worship God and not the image. To fear God means to not persecute God&rsquo;s people, and to worship God means to not worship Antichrist&rsquo;s image. This is the reason why an angel preaches a special gospel to the people on the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Judgment on the Nations at Christ&rsquo;s Return</h2>
<p>There are three parables in Matthew 25. The parable of the ten virgins is related to the Christian life (vv. 1-13), and the parable of the talents is related to Christian service (vv. 14-30). These two parables which speak of life and service pertain to the believers. The third parable is the parable of the sheep and the goats (vv. 31-46). If we read it carefully, we can see that it is not related to Christians but to the nations, the Gentiles who remain at Christ&rsquo;s coming back to the earth, after He has destroyed those Gentiles who follow Antichrist at Armageddon (v. 32). Not only the goats but even the sheep are of the nations.</p>
<p>Second Timothy 4:1 tells us that Christ Jesus will judge the living and the dead. At His coming back before the kingdom of one thousand years, Christ will judge the living Gentiles. Then at the end of the one thousand years, He will judge the unbelieving dead. In this way He will be the One who judges the living Gentiles and the dead unbelievers. The parable of the sheep and the goats in Matthew 25 gives us a picture of how the Lord, after His coming back, will judge the living Gentiles.</p>
<p>When I was young, I was bothered by this parable because I knew that we are not saved by works. The sheep, however, will be reckoned as good ones merely by their works, and the goats will be reckoned as evil ones also by their works. I could not understand how this could be a judgment that included believers. Later I received light to realize that this is the judgment exercised by the Lord Jesus on the living Gentiles, that is, on those unbelievers who remain on the earth at His coming back.</p>
<p>The Lord will judge the nations according to the way they treat the least of His brothers during the tribulation (Matt. 25:40). If they treat His brothers well, they will be reckoned as sheep. If they treat His brothers badly, they will be reckoned as goats. The criteria for the way they treat the Lord&rsquo;s brothers is whether they give something to eat and drink to the ones who are hungry and thirsty, clothe the ones who are naked, and visit the ones who are in prison. These are the conditions of persecution which the little brothers of Christ will suffer. If those of the nations treat the persecuted brothers of Christ well, the Lord Jesus will reckon them as sheep when He comes back. Otherwise, they will be reckoned as the goats. This judgment is based on the eternal gospel.</p>
<p>At the end of this age, the Antichrist will come and seduce the Gentile nations to follow him to rebel against God and persecute God&rsquo;s people until the time the Lord comes back. While the entire Gentile world is following Antichrist in this way, God will send an angel in the air to announce the eternal gospel to warn people to fear God, to give Him glory, and to worship Him. This will be a warning not to do anything against God and not to persecute His people. After this warning, Christ will come back to defeat Antichrist and exercise His judgment on those Gentiles who are still living on this earth. That judgment will not be based on the gospel of grace, for the dispensation of the gospel of grace will be over at that time. Rather, that judgment will be based on the eternal gospel.</p>
<p>Those who listen to this gospel and fear God will not dare to persecute the believers or the Jews who are God&rsquo;s people. If possible, they will do something to help them. This will be similar to today&rsquo;s situation in China, for example. The Communists persecute the Christians, but some Gentiles fear God and secretly share their food and clothing with them. The situation in the great tribulation will be like this in principle. Some will listen to that gospel, fear God, worship Him, and treat the Lord&rsquo;s brothers, the weaker ones among God&rsquo;s people, well. This will be the basis of the Lord&rsquo;s judgment on the nations when He comes back.</p><h2 class="head2">The Eternal Gospel and Its Result</h2>
<p>The parable in Matthew 13:47-50 corresponds to the one in Matthew 25. Of the seven parables in Matthew 13, the first six relate to the church and the kingdom. These include the parables of the sower, the wheat and the tares, the great tree, the leaven, the hidden treasure, and the pearl of great value. The seventh parable is the parable of the net cast into the sea. The net signifies the eternal gospel preached to the Gentile world by an angel. A net is cast into the sea to gather from every living species, which are brought to the shore and divided into the good and the foul.</p>
<p>Pearl, which also comes from the sea, signifies the regenerated and transformed ones. In contrast, the things brought up from the sea by the net refer to the ones who are not regenerated and transformed. Even the ones that are good are naturally good. The eternal gospel will be a net to bring the whole Gentile world to the presence of the Lord so that He may exercise His judgment upon them based on the contents of this gospel, that is, on whether they treated the least of Christ&rsquo;s brothers well or badly.</p>
<p>In order for some to reign in the millennial kingdom, there must be people there to reign over. All the sheep, the good ones, will be transferred into the millennial kingdom to be the nations, the people, on this earth. The Jews, however, will be the priests in the millennial kingdom helping people to know God (Zech. 8:20-23), and the overcoming believers will be the kings (Rev. 2:26-27; 12:5; 20:4, 6).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FALL OF RELIGIOUS BABYLON</h2>
<p>Revelation 14:8 says, &ldquo;And another angel, a second one, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great, who has made all the nations drink of the wine of the fury of her fornication!&rdquo; Babylon has two aspects, the religious aspect (17:1-18) and the political, material aspect (18:1-24). Verse 8 in chapter fourteen refers to the religious Babylon, the Roman Catholic Church. The wine of the fury of her fornication refers to the teachings, the doctrines, and the heresies of the Roman Catholic Church, which has made almost the entire world drunken. At the beginning of the last three and a half years of this age, Antichrist and the ten kings under him will turn against the Roman Church. That will be the fall, the end of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WARNING AGAINST THE WORSHIP OF ANTICHRIST</h2>
<p>Verses 9 to 12 say, &ldquo;And another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also shall drink of the wine of the fury of God, which is mixed undiluted in the cup of His wrath; and he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb. And the smoke of their tormenting goes up forever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name. Here is the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.&rdquo; The cup of His wrath mentioned in verse 10 will be the seven last plagues, the plagues of the seven bowls, spoken of in chapter sixteen. These plagues will be poured out on Antichrist, his kingdom, and his people.</p>
<p>Verse 12 speaks of two kinds of people. Those who keep the commandments of God are the genuine Jews, and those who keep the faith of Jesus are the New Testament believers. This again proves that during the last three and a half years, during the great tribulation, some New Testament believers and some genuine Jews who fear God and keep His commandments will remain on this earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HARVEST OF THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>Verse 13 says, &ldquo;And I heard a voice out of heaven, saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.&rdquo; Those who die in the Lord are those who are martyred under the persecution of Antichrist.</p>
<p>Verses 14 to 16 continue, &ldquo;And I saw, and behold, there was a white cloud, and on the cloud One like the Son of Man sitting, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand. And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, Send forth Your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come because the harvest of the earth is ripe. And He who sat on the cloud thrust His sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped.&rdquo; In 10:1, the Lord is clothed with a cloud, but at this time He is sitting on the cloud. This indicates that He is now in the air. That this One has a golden crown proves that He is the Lord.</p>
<p>Revelation 14 indicates that the rapture will occur in parts. In the physical type, firstfruits are reaped early, while the general harvest may be reaped a few weeks later. The firstfruits are the fruits which ripen first. Because the rest of the harvest is green, it is left in the field until the earthly waters, the earthly supply, are dried up. Then it will be mature and ready to be reaped. Whereas the overcomers as firstfruits are raptured to the temple of God, the majority of the believers as the harvest are raptured to the air (1 Thes. 4:17), that is, to the barn, which is between the field and the farmhouse.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GATHERING OF THE GRAPES</h2>
<p>Verses 17 to 20 say, &ldquo;And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. And another angel came out of the altar, he who has authority over fire, and he cried with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripened. And the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the fury of God. And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress up to the bridles of the horses for a thousand six hundred stadia.&rdquo; After the firstfruits and the general harvest are reaped, the grapes are gathered into the winepress.</p>
<p>The great winepress of the fury of God in verse 19 is the war at Armageddon (16:12-16). <em>Outside the city</em> in 14:20 means outside of Jerusalem. <em>Armageddon</em> is a Hebrew compound of <em>Har,</em> meaning &ldquo;mountain,&rdquo;and <em>Megiddon,</em> that is, Megiddo (Judg. 5:19; 2 Kings 23:29; Zech. 12:11), northwest of Jerusalem, meaning&ldquo;slaughter&rdquo;;hence, &ldquo;the mountain of slaughter.&rdquo;At the end of the great tribulation all the worldly forces who follow Antichrist will be gathered together to fight against Jerusalem. They will surround Jerusalem with the intention of destroying it, but they will not realize that they are being gathered as grapes for the winepress. The Lord will come back to tread the winepress, destroying a great number of the evil Gentile forces. Their blood will be as deep as the bridles of the horses, and it will flow from Bozrah (Isa. 63:1) to Armageddon, a distance of 182 miles.</p>
<p>According to the order of Revelation 14, the rapture of the firstfruits will take place before the great tribulation. Following this, the eternal gospel will be preached due to the persecution carried out during this period of three and a half years. Antichrist will set up his image for people to worship, and he will persecute the saints who remain on the earth. Therefore, the saints will undergo much suffering. Because of the suffering of the tribulation, the believers will be helped to grow and ripen, just as the green harvest is left in the field under the hot sun to be ripened. When the believers ripen, they will be reaped, that is, raptured. Then the Lord will come back to judge the unbelieving Gentiles who are reckoned as grapes for the winepress. When wheat becomes ripe, the water within the grains is dried up, signifying that for believers to ripen and mature means that all the worldly things within them are dried up. However, when grapes are ripe, they become full of water, signifying that the worldly people will be full of sin and sinful things. As such, they will be ripe and ready to be judged. Then the Lord will collect them and tread them in the winepress of His fury.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE OUTPOURING OF THE SEVEN BOWLS<br />
AND BABYLON THE GREAT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 15&mdash;17</h1>
<p>The treading of the winepress of the fury of God will occur at the very end of this age (Rev. 14:17-20). Following this, Satan will be thrown into the abyss, and the thousand-year kingdom will begin. Therefore, the things mentioned in Revelation 15, 16, and 17 do not follow the treading of the winepress in time. After chapter fourteen, the record of the Scriptures comes back to give further details of other important things and crucial matters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OUTPOURING OF THE SEVEN BOWLS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Praise of the Late Overcomers</h2>
<p>Revelation 15:1-2a says, &ldquo;And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful, seven angels having seven plagues, the last plagues; for in them the fury of God was finished. And I saw as it were a glassy sea mingled with fire.&rdquo; In 4:6 the glassy sea is like crystal, but in chapter fifteen the glassy sea is mingled with fire. This glassy sea eventually becomes the lake of fire (20:14). The glassy sea is only mingled with fire, but when it becomes the lake of fire, its contents are intensified; it is all fire and no glass. In chapter four when the glassy sea is first mentioned, God had not yet judged all negative things with fire. By chapter fifteen, however, many items have begun to be judged with fire through the first six trumpets (8:7, 8, 10; 9:17-18). Therefore the sea of glass is now mingled with fire.</p>
<p>The sea of glass is the &ldquo;trash can&rdquo; of the whole universe. Whatever God does not want, He throws it into this sea. It is also foreshadowed by the laver in front of the tabernacle and temple of the Old Testament. The laver collected all the dirt that was washed away by the priests.</p>
<p>Revelation 15:2b speaks of &ldquo;those who come away victorious from the beast and from his image and from the number of his name standing on the glassy sea, having harps of God.&rdquo; These are the late overcomers who pass through the great tribulation. <em>To stand</em> means not only to live but to be raised up to live. That these overcomers are standing indicates that they were martyred and then resurrected and raptured to stand above the glassy sea. According to verse 3, &ldquo;They sing the song of Moses, the slave of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and wonderful are Your works, Lord God the Almighty! Righteous and true are Your ways, O King of the nations!&rdquo; This refers to the song of Moses sung by the Israelites who passed triumphantly through the Red Sea (Exo. 15:1-19); the Red Sea in Exodus 14 and 15 corresponds to the sea of glass in Revelation 15. Verse 4 continues, &ldquo;Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy; for all the nations will come and worship before You, for Your righteous judgments have been manifested.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Scene in Heaven<br />
before the Outpouring of the Seven Bowls</h2>
<p>Verses 5 to 8 say, &ldquo;And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened, and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in clean bright linen and girded around the breasts with golden girdles. And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the fury of God, who lives forever and ever. And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power, and no one could enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.&rdquo; As we have seen, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven is the central thought of the second portion of the prophecy in this book (11:19). That no one could enter into the temple means that no one was able to pray to stop the wrath of God. God will give no ground for anyone to stop Him until His wrath is fully poured out.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The First Six Bowls</h2>
<p>Chapter sixteen continues, &ldquo;And I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the seven bowls of the fury of God into the earth&rdquo; (v. 1). Again, the temple is the center of the revelation. Verse 2 is the first bowl: &ldquo;And the first went and poured out his bowl into the earth; and there came to be an evil and malignant sore upon the men who have the mark of the beast and worship his image.&rdquo; This is God&rsquo;s dealing with the worshippers, the followers, of the beast.</p>
<p>Verse 3 is the second bowl: &ldquo;And the second poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like that of a dead man; and every living soul that was in the sea died.&rdquo; In the second trumpet, one third of the creatures in the sea died, but at this time everything in the sea dies. How awful that will be!</p>
<p>Verses 4 to 7 speak of the third bowl, saying, &ldquo;And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of waters; and they became blood. And I heard the angel who had power over the waters saying, You are righteous, who is and who was, the Holy One, because You have judged these things; for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and You have given them blood to drink; they are worthy of it. And I heard the altar saying, Yes, Lord God the Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verses 8 and 9 are the fourth bowl: &ldquo;And the fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given to it to burn men with fire. And men were burned with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God, who has the authority over these plagues, and they did not repent so as to give Him glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In principle these four bowls are like the four trumpets in 8:7-12. The four trumpets damage the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the heavens. The first four bowls also deal with the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the sun. The bowls are the same in principle, but in degree they are more intensified. All these plagues deal with the kingdom, the followers, and the worshippers of the beast.</p>
<p>The fifth bowl is in 16:10-11, which says, &ldquo;And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues for pain and blasphemed the God of heaven for their pains and for their sores; and they did not repent of their works.&rdquo; We cannot image what kind of darkness and pain this will be, for we have never experienced it.</p>
<p>Verse 12 continues, &ldquo;And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared.&rdquo; This indicates that the trouble which will follow later comes from the east, the direction of the Euphrates.</p><h2 class="head2">The Gathering at Armageddon<br />
and a Warning to the Remaining Believers</h2>
<p>Verse 13 says, &ldquo;And I saw, out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits as frogs.&rdquo; As a satanic trinity, Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet will work as one. Verses 14 to 16 continue, &ldquo;For they are spirits of demons doing signs, which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth to gather them to the war of the great day of God the Almighty. (Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he who watches and keeps his garments that he may not walk naked and they see his shame.) And they gathered them to the place which in Hebrew is called, Armageddon.&rdquo; As we have seen, Armageddon is the place of the winepress of the fury of God (14:17-20).</p>
<p>Although these events will transpire close to the end of the three and a half years, the warning in 16:15 indicates that even at that time there will still be some believers remaining on the earth. Because of this, the best Bible students differentiate between the firstfruits and the harvest. Revelation 16:15 is a warning to the living majority of believers who still remain on this earth.</p>
<p>In a field of grain, some of the stocks of grain are higher; these are the firstfruits which ripen first. Because the majority of the crop is still green, it requires a few more weeks to ripen. Therefore, we should not think that there is only one rapture. Even the rapture of the overcomers is of more than one kind; Revelation 12:5 mentions the rapture of the man-child, and 14:1-5 speaks of the hundred and forty-four thousand firstfruits who are raptured to the throne of God.</p>
<p>The truth of the partial rapture is also strengthened by the Lord&rsquo;s word to the church in Philadelphia in 3:10 which says, &ldquo;Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth.&rdquo; The hour of trial is the great tribulation. Here, the Lord promised the overcomers in the church in Philadelphia that since they have kept the word of His endurance, He will keep them not only out of the trial, but out of the hour of trial. To be kept from the hour of trial is to be raptured before the time of the great tribulation. Therefore, these three passages&mdash;Revelation 3:10, 12:5, and 14:1-5&mdash;tell us that some believers will be raptured before the hour of the great tribulation, before the last three and a half years of this age. Different portions of the rapture are indicated by 14:14-16 and 16:15. In addition, there is another small rapture, the rapture of the two witnesses in 11:12. They are raptured in a particular way because they are special witnesses.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Seventh Bowl</h2>
<p>Revelation 16:17-19 says, &ldquo;And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air; and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying, It is done. And there were lightnings and voices and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as had not been since man appeared on the earth, such an earthquake, so great. And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And Babylon the Great was remembered before God to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of His wrath.&rdquo; Verse 17 once again mentions the temple. The great city in verse 19 is Jerusalem, and Babylon the Great here is the material aspect of Babylon. The fall of religious Babylon is mentioned in 14:8, while the fall of material Babylon is mentioned here in 16:19. In 14:8 the religious Babylon, the Roman Catholic Church, made the nations drunk with the wine of the fury of her fornication, while in 16:19 the Lord makes the material Babylon drink the wine of the fury of His wrath.</p>
<p>Verses 20 and 21 continue, &ldquo;And every island fled, and the mountains were not found. And great hail, every stone about the weight of a talent, came down out of heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God for the plague of the hail, because the plague of it is exceedingly great.&rdquo; The situation at that time will truly be awful! Every hailstone will have the weight of a talent, which equals about one hundred pounds. This will be a great plague. Because God will thoroughly damage the kingdom of Antichrist, not many people from this part of the world may remain until the coming back of the Lord Jesus. The number of the living Gentiles whom the Lord will divide into the sheep and the goats in Matthew 25 will be made fewer by all these calamities which will be increasingly intensified.</p><h2 class="head1">BABYLON THE GREAT AND HER DESTRUCTION</h2>
<p>Chapters twelve through fourteen of Revelation are written in the way of symbols. Chapters fifteen and sixteen, however, contain both signs and literal words. Following this, chapters seventeen and eighteen are again written in symbols.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Religious Aspect&mdash;the Great Harlot</h2>
<p>Revelation 17:1-2 says, &ldquo;And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits upon the many waters, with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and those who dwell on the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.&rdquo; The harlot symbolizes religious Rome, the apostate Roman Catholic Church, and the waters symbolize many peoples and nations. In the eyes of the Lord the Roman Catholic Church today is a harlot, an evil woman, who is &ldquo;sitting&rdquo; upon so many people. The Roman Church claims nearly one-fourth of the population of the earth. Even today, the kings, the political leaders on the earth, are committing spiritual fornication with her. The ambassadors, ministers, and leaders of many nations are sent to the Vatican; this is to commit fornication with the great harlot. The kings of the earth and those who dwell on the earth truly have been made drunk with the wine of the teachings, the heretical doctrines, of Roman Catholicism.</p>
<p>Verse 3a says, &ldquo;And he carried me away in spirit into awilderness.&rdquo; In order to see this vision, we need to be in our spirit andapart from the world. Many people are not clear about the vision of the great harlot because they have not come&ldquo;outside the camp&rdquo; (Heb. 13:13), to a place apart.</p>
<p>Revelation 17:3b and 4 continue, &ldquo;And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication.&rdquo; Scarlet is dark red, which is a sign of the Roman Catholic Church. All the cardinals, for example, wear scarlet, and within the Vatican we can see many items of scarlet. Moreover, scarlet corresponds to the color of the great red dragon (12:3).</p>
<p>This woman is also clothed in purple (17:4). Purple is a blend of blue, the heavenly color, and red, the earthly color. Catholicism mixes the heavenly things with the earthly things. She is also gilded with gold, precious stone, and pearls. Although the Vatican is full of these precious materials in a literal sense, the gold, precious stone, and pearls here are signs, having the same meaning as the precious materials of the New Jerusalem in chapter twenty-one. When we look at the Roman Catholic Church, we can see many things of God, but these things are misused by her. Although the Roman Church has some things of God, she also has many pagan and heathen things mixed with them. This reminds us of the parable in Matthew 13:33, in which a woman hides leaven in three measures of meal. The meal signifies Christ as food to both God and man, and leaven signifies the many pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters brought in by Catholicism. Even certain declarations by the pope have some truth in them, but within Catholicism there are pagan, heathen, and heretical things mixed with the truth.</p>
<p>The great harlot holds in her hand a golden cup full of abominations. <em>Golden</em> signifies something of God, but the cup is full of abominations. According to Deuteronomy 7:25 and 26, abominations refer to idols. Outwardly the cup is of God, golden, but within it is full of idols. The Roman Catholic Church is exactly this way. She claims that she preaches the truth of God, but this so-called church is full of idols, full of abominations.</p>
<p><em>The unclean things of her fornication</em> in Revelation 17:4 refers to spiritual things mixed with politics, which is fornication. The golden cup is full of idols and full of the mixture of spiritual things with political things.</p>
<p>Verse 5 says, &ldquo;And on her forehead there was a name written,MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.&rdquo;Here there is not only one harlot but many. I must take the boldness to say that the harlots are the denominational churches into which the evils of Catholicism have been transmitted. These transmitted evils include the celebration of Christmas and Easter. These are evil pagan practices which were transmitted to the &ldquo;reformed&rdquo; churches. The birth of Jesus is the fine flour, but Christmas with the Christmas tree and Santa Claus is leaven. In the same way, the resurrection of the Lord is fine flour, but Easter is leaven. Also, to be a servant of the Lord is proper, but to have the title of <em>Reverend</em> is an evil transmitted into the church. Many of the Lord&rsquo;s children who are otherwise pure in the eyes of God are still holding on to these things. It is difficult for the Christians in the United States to be rid of this leaven.</p>
<p>Some in the Church of England and other &ldquo;reformed&rdquo; churches have considered going back to Catholicism. This shows that the Roman Church is the mother harlot, and the many denominations are the daughter harlots. We should not say that <em>harlots</em> refers only to denominations that do not have many real believers. There are many real believers in the Roman Catholic Church. A few hundred years ago there were a number of spiritual persons within the Roman Church such as Madame Guyon, Brother Lawrence, and Father Fenelon. They were spiritual but under the influence of that leaven. Even Madame Guyon visited images of Mary. We must be careful concerning the leaven.</p>
<p>Verse 6 says, &ldquo;And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And I marveled with great marvel when I saw her.&rdquo; The Roman Church does not kill the saints directly but does so indirectly through the Roman Empire. History tells us that more saints were killed by the Roman Church in this way than by the other persecutions of the Roman Empire.</p><h2 class="head2">The Interpretation of the Woman and the Beast</h2>
<p>Verse 7 says, &ldquo;And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast who bears her, who has the seven heads and the ten horns.&rdquo; The picture of the harlot riding on a beast depicts the union of the Roman Catholic Church with the Roman Empire. This is religion united and mingled with politics.</p>
<p>Verse 8 continues, &ldquo;The beast that you saw was and is not and is about to come up out of the abyss and go into perdition. And those who dwell on the earth, those whose name is not written from the foundation of the world in the book of life, will marvel when they see the beast, that he was and is not and will be present.&rdquo; As we have previously seen, the beast is one of the Roman Caesars. That the beast formerly was, means that before the time of the writing of Revelation inA.D. 90, the beast had been on the earth. By the time this book was written, however, he was not; that is, he already had died. However, in the future, he will come up out of the abyss. After this one died, his spirit was captured by the enemy, Satan, and kept in the abyss, which is not the same place where the spirits of the dead are presently kept. Moreover, verse 8 says that he will go into perdition. After a certain time, he will perish in the lake of fire.</p>
<p>Verses 9 and 10 say, &ldquo;Here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are the seven mountains where the woman sits and are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain only a short time.&rdquo; If we have wisdom, we can understand that verse 9 refers to the city of Rome. History tells us clearly that Rome was built on seven mountains; it is even called &ldquo;the city of seven mountains.&rdquo; At that time the writer of this book, the apostle John, was not free to write about Rome and the Caesars in plain words. He had to write this book in symbols so he would not be in trouble.</p>
<p>The seven heads are the seven mountains, and they are also seven kings, that is, seven Caesars of the Roman Empire. History tells us that there had been twelve Caesars by that time, but verse 10 does not speak of twelve; rather, it speaks of seven particular Caesars. <em>Fallen</em> in verse 10 is a negative word (Judg. 3:25; 2 Sam. 1:10, 25, 27). These seven Caesars had died, or were yet to die, in an unnatural way. The first five of them were Julius Caesar, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, all of whom either were murdered or committed suicide before John wrote this book. The sixth, Domitian, who was also murdered, was living when this book was written. Therefore, it is said of him that he &ldquo;is.&rdquo; The other, that is, the seventh, had not yet come.</p>
<p>Revelation 17:11 says, &ldquo;And the beast who was and is not, he himself is also the eighth and is out of the seven and goes into perdition.&rdquo; On the one hand, the beast is the eighth, but on the other hand, he is out of the seven. This requires wisdom, and students of the Bible have spent much time to find the secret to understand it. When the seventh Caesar comes, he will remain a short time and then be killed. We conclude this from 13:3, which says of the beast, &ldquo;One of his heads was as it were slain to death, and his death stroke was healed.&rdquo; According to this verse, Antichrist will be slain and resuscitated. In that resuscitation the spirit of Nero (the fifth Caesar) will come out from the abyss and enter into the body of the seventh to make him the eighth. On the one hand, the beast is the eighth, but on the other hand, he is a combination of the body of the seventh and the spirit of the fifth.</p>
<p>Since 17:11 says that the beast &ldquo;was and is not,&rdquo; and because the number of the name of the beast denotes Caesar Nero (13:18), we know that Antichrist will be resuscitated by the spirit of Nero, the fifth Caesar, who will enter into the body of the seventh Caesar, thus producing the eighth. Therefore, the beast is not an ordinary person; he is very extraordinary. However, he goes into perdition (17:11b); that is, he will be thrown into the lake of fire.</p>
<p>This is the way to put together Revelation 13 and 17, just as we would put together a difficult jigsaw puzzle to get the whole picture. Students of the Bible have spent much time to find out these things. About thirty years ago, D. M. Panton, a good student of the Scriptures, received this light. However, he made a big mistake, saying that Mussolini was the seventh Caesar. He even published two photographs together, one of Mussolini and the other of Nero, showing people how much alike they looked. We should not try to make predictions such as these.</p>
<p>Verse 12 speaks of ten horns, which are ten kings. These are lesser kings which at that time had not received a kingdom. In the future, they will receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast. These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast (v. 13). These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them at the battle of Armageddon, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings (v. 14a). They who are with Him, the called and chosen and faithful, will also overcome them (v. 14b). These are the followers of Christ, the ones who have been raptured, who fight the battle against the Antichrist and his army at Armageddon. Verse 15 concludes by interpreting the &ldquo;many waters&rdquo; in verse 1: &ldquo;And he said to me, The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Destruction of the Harlot by the Beast</h2>
<p>Verses 16 to 18 say, &ldquo;And the ten horns which you saw and the beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked and will eat her flesh and burn her utterly with fire. For God has put it into their hearts to perform His mind and to perform one mind and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God are accomplished. And the woman whom you saw is the great city, which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.&rdquo; During the last three and a half years of this age, the ten kings and Antichrist will agree together to destroy the Roman Catholic Church, the great harlot. That will be the end of the Roman Church.</p>
<p>According to history, the great city in verse 18 is Rome. Chapter seventeen is the record of the fall of religious Babylon. The fall of political, material Babylon is seen in chapter eighteen.</p>
<p>According to Revelation, the Roman Catholic Church will flourish and prevail until the end of this age. In 1929 Mussolini signed an agreement with the pope to give the Vatican to the Roman Catholic Church. At that time the Vatican became an independent, religious nation. This helped the Roman Church to become more powerful and more involved in political affairs. Today she is truly flourishing. This is a strong sign and a confirmation that Communism will not prevail throughout the world. Communism and Catholicism are the strongest of enemies. If Communism were to prevail, Catholicism would be ended. This is against the prophecy of the Scriptures. Therefore, we should not believe the lies of Communist propaganda. According to prophecy, Catholicism will prosper until Revelation 17 at the end of this age.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE EVENTS FROM THE DESTRUCTION<br />
OF BABYLON TO THE JUDGMENT<br />
OF THE GREAT WHITE THRONE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 18&mdash;20</h1>
<p>The goal of Revelation is the New Jerusalem in chapters twenty-one and twenty-two. First, however, we must come to chapters eighteen through twenty.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BABYLON THE GREAT AND HER DESTRUCTION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Material Aspect</h2>
<p>Revelation 18:1 says, &ldquo;After these things I saw another Angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was illumined with His glory.&rdquo; This Angel is Christ, for only Christ&rsquo;s glory can illumine the earth. In 8:3-5 Christ as another Angel offers incense with the prayers of the saints, and in 10:1 Christ as another strong Angel comes to take possession of the earth. Now in 18:1-3 Christ as another Angel comes to judge and overthrow the political and material Babylon.</p>
<p>As we have seen, Revelation 17 is the record of the fall of the religious aspect of Babylon the Great. Chapter seventeen impresses us with the fact that the great harlot, the apostate Roman Catholic Church, will be more and more prevailing until the end of this age. The harlot has been riding on the beast, signifying both the Roman Empire and the Antichrist, to utilize its political power. From the time of Constantine the Great who made Christianity a national religion, the Roman Church has very much utilized the political situation. This union of religion and politics, which is fornication, will continue until the day Antichrist with his ten kings will turn against the Roman Church to destroy her and burn her with fire. That will put an end to her. According to 17:17 this will be something of God&rsquo;s doing. Verse 17 says, &ldquo;For God has put it into their hearts to perform His mind and to perform one mind and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God are accomplished.&rdquo; The Roman Catholic Church has very much utilized the Roman Empire, but it will be of God that eventually the Roman Empire will bring the Roman Church to an end. This is something divine and sovereign.</p>
<p>Revelation 18, however, records the fall of Babylon, the city of Rome, mainly in its political and material aspects. That this is the material aspect is shown by verse 10, which speaks of &ldquo;the great city,&rdquo; and verses 11 through 13, which speak of the traffic of merchandise. The Lord will come back purposely to judge the material Babylon and bring it to an end.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Application of the Prophecy<br />
of Babylon the Great<br />
with Respect to Communism Today</h2>
<p>During the time I was in college, the Russian Bolsheviks, the Communists, sent people to indoctrinate and poison the Chinese young people. I saw how these Communists worked among the students, and a number of my schoolmates were gained by them. That is why most of the Communist leaders today are my age.</p>
<p>The intention of the Communists is to create their own version of the kingdom of the heavens. In 1939 a young, proud Chinese man, who frequently would listen to my ministry, came to me and said, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, you preach the kingdom of the heavens, but we are working it out.&rdquo; He did not tell me that he was a communist, but by the terms he used I immediately recognized that he was. The intention of the Communists is to establish a new kind of human society, regardless of the cost to human life. They would even sacrifice most of the human race as long as they could gain a small number from the young generation. This is their devilish goal.</p>
<p>When I came to the West in 1958, many Christian friends expressed their deep concern that the Communists would take over the Western world, including America and western Europe. This surprised me very much. I could not understand how so much of the Western world could be deceived by the false propaganda of the devilish Communists. In 1958 I was invited to London and Denmark. While there even the most spiritual persons expressed to me the fear that all of Europe would soon fall to the Communists. In their messages, they tried to prepare the hearts of the saints to face the same situation that the dear brothers in mainland China had faced. Since I had come from China, they asked me what I felt about that. I am a small person with no famous name and no theological degree, but I boldly said, &ldquo;Dear friends, do not believe the lie. Be at peace. Those devilish people will never take over your country.&rdquo; Today, of course, western Europe is still safe.</p>
<p>The saints in Denmark and England wondered how I, not being a king, a prime minister, a president, or even a prophet, could predict this. Therefore, I gave them the reasons. I told them that in the minds of the Communists, they have only two enemies today, one religious and one political and military. Their religious enemy is Roman Catholicism, and their political enemy is the United States. Therefore, their goal is to get rid of these two. If they achieve this goal, they can be successful worldwide and have their &ldquo;kingdom.&rdquo; However, according to the prophecy of the divine Word in Revelation 17, Catholicism will be very prevailing until the end of this age. This is a strong sign that Communism will never be prevailing in a worldwide way. Moreover, what we see in Revelation 18 is not Communism. Rather, it is one hundred percent contrary to Communism. In Communism there is no commerce with selling and buying as is portrayed in verses 10 through 13, so this chapter is another strong sign that at the end of this age Communism will not be prevailing in the world. Therefore, be at peace. The Lord will preserve the situation on the earth for His purpose.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB</h2>
<p>Revelation 19:1-6 is the praise of the great multitude of the saints, the angels, and all creatures. After this, verse 7 says, &ldquo;Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.&rdquo; On the negative side, the praise to God is for the fall of Babylon the Great, while on the positive side, it is because of the readiness of the glorious bride. These two women are the main focus of the prophecy in chapters twelve through twenty-two. In these chapters we see the destruction of the harlot and the readiness of the bride. One woman is brought to an end, and the other woman is made ready for the marriage of the Lamb.</p>
<p>Verse 8 continues, &ldquo;And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints.&rdquo; Strictly speaking, the fine linen is not the righteousness (that is, Christ) that we received for our salvation (1 Cor. 1:30). Rather, it is the righteous acts which are our living out of Christ. In this sense, we may speak of two steps of justification. The first step is to be justified in Christ that we might be saved, while the second step is to be justified in the eyes of God by a daily walk, a living, of righteousnesses. This living, this daily walk, the righteousnesses signified by the fine linen, is the outworking of Christ as life within us. The first aspect of justification is sufficient for us to be saved, while the second aspect is required for us to attend the marriage of the Lamb.</p>
<p>The word <em>righteousnesses</em> in Revelation 19:8 is plural, referring to righteous deeds. The righteousness that is Christ Himself is sufficient for us to be justified and saved; this is righteousness in the singular number. The use of <em>righteousnesses</em> in the plural, however, proves that what is mentioned in verse 8 is not Christ as our righteousness for us to be justified. Rather, it is righteous deeds, the daily walk, the Christian living, which Christ as our life works out through us. This outworking of the inner life is the white linen with which we are clothed. In order to attend a feast, especially a wedding feast, we must dress in a proper way. In the same way, we need the proper clothing in order to attend the wedding feast of the Lamb.</p>
<p>Verse 9 says, &ldquo;And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they who are called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true words of God.&rdquo; This wedding feast of the Lamb will last for one thousand years. The thousand years will be a wedding day, for with the Lord a thousand years is as one day (2 Pet. 3:8). To be invited to attend the wedding feast is to have the privilege of sharing the millennial kingdom as co-kings with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAR AT ARMAGEDDON</h2>
<p>Revelation 19:11 through 13 say, &ldquo;And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sits on it called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. And His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems, and He has a name written which no one knows but Himself. And He is clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and His name is called the Word of God.&rdquo; The One on the white horse is the wonderful Christ Himself. His being clothed with a garment dipped in blood is related to His treading of the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God (v. 15; Isa. 63:1-3). That His name is called the Word of God means that He is the expression, the testimony, and the speaking of God.</p>
<p>Revelation 19:14 says, &ldquo;And the armies which are in heaven followed Him on white horses, dressed in fine linen, white and clean.&rdquo; These armies are the saints, those spoken of in 17:14, which says that the beast and the ten kings &ldquo;will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and they who are with Him, the called and chosen and faithful, will also overcome them.&rdquo; <em>They who are with Him</em> are the overcoming saints who become the heavenly army. The Lord does not want to fight the battle by Himself. In principle, when the Lord deals with the enemy, He needs the saints as His armies.</p>
<p>The fine linen in 19:14 is the fine linen of the bride of the Lamb in verse 8, indicating that those who attend the wedding feast become the armies to fight the battle.</p>
<p>Verse 15a says, &ldquo;And out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword, that with it He might smite the nations; and He will shepherd them with an iron rod.&rdquo; This is the fulfillment of Psalm 2:8-9, which tells us that Christ will rule the nations with an iron rod.</p>
<p>Revelation 19:20 says that the beast and the false prophet were seized and &ldquo;cast alive into the lake of fire, which burns with brimstone.&rdquo; These two had already died but were raised again, not by God but by Satan. Now they will be the first to go directly into the lake of fire, without passing through further death or resurrection like all the others who perish.</p>
<p>Verse 21 says, &ldquo;And the rest were killed with the sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Him who sits on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh.&rdquo; This takes place at the battle of Armageddon which is the treading of the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God. The grapes in this winepress are the kings, armies, and followers of Antichrist. Their intention is to fight against Christ, but God&rsquo;s intention is to bring them together into the winepress so that Christ can come to tread on them and bring them to an end.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MILLENNIAL KINGDOM</h2>
<h2 class="head2">In the Best Resurrection</h2>
<p>Revelation 20:1-3 records the imprisonment of Satan for one thousand years in the abyss. Following this, verses 4 and 5 say, &ldquo;And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and of those who had not worshipped the beast nor his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. The rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.&rdquo; In Greek, the word <em>first</em> here is the same word as <em>best</em> in Luke 15:22, which speaks of &ldquo;the best robe&rdquo; which the father gave to the returning prodigal son. Therefore, this phrase in Revelation 20:5 may be rendered &ldquo;the best resurrection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many Christians have a wrong concept about resurrection. In Philippians 3:11 the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;If perhaps I may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead.&rdquo; In 1:24-25 he says that he would remain on the earth for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, and in 3:20 he indicates that we should wait for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. This means that Paul gave no indication here that he expected to die, yet he still aspired to attain to a certain kind of resurrection. The word for <em>resurrection</em> in 3:11 is not the ordinary word for resurrection; it has something added to it to make it <em>out-resurrection.</em> The out-resurrection from the dead is the outstanding resurrection, the best resurrection. This may be compared to a graduation. Someone may graduate from school, but his may not be the best graduation. Only the top few graduates have the best graduation. This resurrection, the best resurrection, includes not only those overcomers who have died but also the raptured living overcomers, such as the firstfruits in Revelation 14:1-5, who have part in the issue of the first resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head2">With the Priesthood and the Kingship<br />
for One Thousand Years</h2>
<p>Revelation 20:6 says, &ldquo;Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.&rdquo; As we have seen, the first resurrection is not the ordinary resurrection; this is the best resurrection, the resurrection with the kingship. The ones spoken of here are resurrected not only to live but also to reign, to be co-kings with Christ. Many believe that no matter what kind of Christians they are after they are saved, they will suddenly be kings when the Lord Jesus comes back. This is ridiculous. Everyone who intends to be a king must be disciplined. Many times I look at myself and ask, &ldquo;Do I look like a king?&rdquo; If the Lord Jesus came today and put us on thrones as kings, we ourselves might tell Him that we are not qualified. God&rsquo;s intention is not merely to save us but to save us to be priests and kings. One born into a royal family needs much training and discipline to become a proper king. Many Christians are poor, having only been saved but never having loved the Lord or agreed to hand themselves over to Him to be disciplined and trained. How can they be His co-kings? Those in chapter twenty who live and reign with Christ are not merely the saved ones. After being saved, they passed through certain kinds of experiences which made them adequate and prepared to be kings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAST REBELLION</h2>
<p>Revelation 20:7 and 8 say, &ldquo;And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war. Their number is like that of the sand of the sea.&rdquo; Gog and Magog are mentioned in Ezekiel 38 and 39. Ezekiel 38:2 says, &ldquo;Son of man, set your face toward Gog of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him.&rdquo; Magog refers to a people from the remotest part of the north (Gen. 10:2; Ezek. 39:1-2), and Meshech corresponds to today&rsquo;s Moscow. Therefore, most Bible students agree that Gog and Magog refer to Russia. This gives us a hint to understand today&rsquo;s world situation. Eventually, the problems between men on the earth and God will be focused on that region.</p>
<p>According to Revelation 20:8 and 9, even after the thousand-year reign of Christ, the human race on earth will still be rebellious due to the work of the devil. Verse 9a says, &ldquo;And they went up upon the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city.&rdquo; In 19:14 the overcoming saints are called the armies in heaven. After the war at Armageddon, during the thousand years, the armies of heaven become the camp of the saints who reign as co-kings with Christ. In addition, the beloved city is Jerusalem, the dwelling place of the remnant of Israel. These two people&mdash;the camp of the saints and the beloved city&mdash;will become the target for the enemy&rsquo;s attack. Satan will stir up the rebellious human race to do their best to destroy the believers and the Jews. However, verse 9b continues, &ldquo;And fire came down out of heaven and devoured them.&rdquo; Following this, the devil was cast into the lake of fire, where the beast and the false prophet were (v. 10).</p><h2 class="head1">THE JUDGMENT OF THE GREAT WHITE THRONE</h2>
<p>Following this, there is the judgment of the great white throne. Verses 11 and 12 say, &ldquo;And I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose face earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened; and another scroll was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by the things which were written in the scrolls, according to their works.&rdquo; <em>Him</em> in verse 11 must refer to the Lord Jesus, who is to be the Judge of the living and the dead (John 5:22; Acts 10:42; 17:31; 2 Tim. 4:1; Rom. 2:16). The old heavens and the old earth will flee away from Him; that is, they will pass away.</p>
<p>Revelation 20:12 speaks of two kinds of scrolls. The first scrolls are a record of the works and deeds of the unbelievers, while the second scroll is the book of life.</p>
<p>Verse 13 continues, &ldquo;And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, each of them, according to their works.&rdquo; If the dead who are in the sea are the same as the dead who are in Hades, why is there the need to mention the dead in the sea separately? This requires much study. Mr. G. H. Pember gave us a clear understanding of this. He said that the dead who are in the sea may not be human beings but the spirits (the demons today) of the living beings of the preadamic age. This is why demons go into the sea after being cast out of human beings (Matt. 8:31-32; 12:43). In the restoration of God&rsquo;s creation, on the second day, God made an expanse to separate the waters below from the waters above (Gen. 1:6-7). In both places&mdash;in the air and in the sea&mdash;there are evil things. The evil things in the sea are the demons. Revelation 11:7 and 17:8 tell us that the beast comes out of the abyss, but 13:1 says that he comes up out of the sea. This may indicate that the sea is the mouth of the abyss.</p>
<p>Revelation 20:14 and 15 say, &ldquo;And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.&rdquo; Now at the end of Revelation 20 everything is cleared up. All the &ldquo;dirt&rdquo; has been thrown into the &ldquo;trash can&rdquo; of the universe, which is the lake of fire.</p>
<p>Moreover, 21:1 says that &ldquo;the sea is no more.&rdquo; The sea is a problem to God. In Genesis 1 the waters on the earth were a problem that God had to deal with. On the negative side, God worked to limit the sea, while on the positive side, He worked to bring forth the land in order to grow something for His purpose. The good land of Canaan is a further progression of the land. The land is a type of Christ. On the third day Christ resurrected from the death waters, and by His resurrection He brought forth much life. The sea is a place where the enemy of God is, so God must eliminate it.</p>
<p>Eventually at the end of the Scriptures there are two consummations, the New Jerusalem on the positive side and the lake of fire on the negative side. God produces the New Jerusalem from the land, and He reduces the sea into a lake. What was originally a large sea is now in a lake, the lake of fire. We may compare this to cleaning a house. At first we may have a big mess, but after we clean it up, the mess is restricted to a small trash can. In the same way, all the dirty and wrong things in the universe will be restricted to a small location, the lake of fire. The sea will be limited to a lake, but the temple will be enlarged to be a city. The sea is limited and reduced, while the temple is enlarged. There will be no more sea, nothing dirty or waste. The beast, the false prophet, the dragon, their followers, the dead in the sea, the dead in Hades, and death and Hades themselves will together be cast into the universal &ldquo;trash can,&rdquo; the lake of fire. In this way, everything negative will be cleared up.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 21:1-11</h1>
<p>From this point we must spend much time to have a thorough view of the glorious city of New Jerusalem. This is the best &ldquo;sightseeing&rdquo; in the entire universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TWO ENDS OF THE SCRIPTURES</h2>
<p>The two ends of the holy Scriptures&mdash;the first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation&mdash;correspond to and reflect one another. The first two chapters mention the heavens and the earth (Gen. 1:1), while the last two chapters speak of the new heaven and the new earth (Rev. 21:1). In the first two chapters is a garden which was the center of God&rsquo;s old creation (Gen. 2:8), while in the last two chapters there is a holy city as the center of God&rsquo;s new creation (Rev. 21:2, 10; 22:14, 19). In the garden at the beginning of the Bible there was the tree of life (Gen. 2:9), while in the city at the end of the Bible there is the tree of life again (Rev. 22:2, 14). Likewise, in the beginning there is a river with three precious materials&mdash;gold, bdellium (pearl), and onyx&mdash;in the scenery of creation (Gen. 2:10-12), while at the end there is the river of water of life with the same three precious materials&mdash;gold, pearl, and precious stones&mdash;built up to be a city (Rev. 22:1; 21:18-21). Moreover, in the garden at the beginning there is Eve as a bride (Gen. 2:22), while at the end the city itself becomes the bride (Rev. 21:2, 9).</p>
<p>In addition, right after the first two chapters of the Scriptures the serpent came in, bringing sin, death, and the world (Gen. 3:1-5), while just before the last two chapters of the Scriptures the serpent is cast into the lake of fire with sin, death, the world, and all negative things (Rev. 20:10). The first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation must be put together, but between these two ends the troublesome one came in, and it took a long time to cast him out again. A great part of the construction of the Scriptures, from Genesis 3 through Revelation 20, is for dealing with the serpent.</p>
<p>The Scriptures tell us simply about a garden and a city. God&rsquo;s intention is to build the garden into a city for His habitation to fulfill His eternal purpose. Although this seems simple to accomplish, the frustrating one came in. We may plot the course of the Scriptures with a line. At Genesis 3 the line takes a deep, downward curve in the shape of a serpent. Bringing the line back up to the normal level is a story that takes a long time, perhaps six thousand years. On this long line God accomplishes His redemption and applies His salvation. Finally, at the end of the Scriptures the serpent is cast out, and God&rsquo;s purpose is fulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW EARTH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The First Heaven and the First Earth<br />
Having Passed Away and the Sea Being No More</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:1a says, &ldquo;And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away.&rdquo; All the old things have passed away and everything, even the heavens and the earth, has been renewed. How are they renewed? It is by God&rsquo;s judging fire. Second Peter 3:10-13 tells us that all things will be burned. To be burned is to be purified for renewing. After being burned, the old heaven and the old earth are renewed to become the new heaven and the new earth.</p>
<p>Verse 1b says, &ldquo;The sea is no more.&rdquo; Although there will be no more sea of water, there will be a lake of fire. At the beginning of Genesis, the earth was covered with deep waters. That was a chaos, waste and void, with nothing in order and no light. Then God came in to bring light, an expanse, and the dry land, which emerged from the covering water on the third day as a clear type of Christ. At that point, all the water was gathered together to form the seas. From the entire Scriptures we can realize that God&rsquo;s work of creation and redemption throughout all the generations, on the positive side, has been to bring forth something from the earth to satisfy Himself and, on the negative side, to abolish the sea. As a result of this, at the end of the Scriptures there is the New Jerusalem as the positive issue, result, and consummation of God&rsquo;s work, and there is the lake of fire as the negative issue and result of His work. God has been working throughout the ages to abolish the sea. Ultimately, He will restrict the sea within a lake and consume the water in fire. Therefore, the New Jerusalem and the lake of fire are the two ultimate issues of God&rsquo;s work in creation and in redemption.</p><h2 class="head2">New Jerusalem Coming Down to the New Earth</h2>
<p>Verse 2 says, &ldquo;And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&rdquo; Many Christians think that this describes a great heavenly mansion. They are expecting to go to heaven, but one day this city will come down out of heaven. We may want to go to heaven, but God wants to come down to earth.</p>
<p>The holy city is prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. We can trace in the Scriptures who the bride and husband are. In the Old Testament God told the people of Israel many times that He was their Husband and that they as His redeemed people were a bride to Him(Isa. 54:5; 62:5;Jer. 2:2; 3:14; 31:32; Ezek. 16:8; Hosea 2:16, 19). In the New Testament, John 3:26-30 tells us that the disciples of John the Baptist were jealous and came to John to tell him that people were following after Christ. John said, &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice.&rdquo; Christ comes as the Bridegroom for the bride, the church.</p>
<p>The church is only part of the bride in Revelation 21. The children of Israel in the ancient time are also a part of this bride. Hence, in Revelation 12 there is a wonderful woman clothed with the sun, with the moon underneath her feet, and a crown of twelve stars on her head. This refers to the three main dispensations in the Scriptures&mdash;the dispensation of the patriarchs, the dispensation of law, and the dispensation of grace. The stars signify the patriarchs, the moon signifies God&rsquo;s people in the age of the law, and the sun signifies God&rsquo;s people in the age of grace. All the redeemed ones within these three dispensations together comprise this wonderful, universal woman, who is the very bride. However, in chapter twelve she is not yet prepared as the bride. She is not prepared until chapter twenty-one because after the thousand years all the redeemed ones will be matured, perfected, and built up together as the universal bride. At this point every part of this wonderful bride will be ready.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Peoples on the New Earth</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Tabernacle of God Being with Men</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:3 says, &ldquo;And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.&rdquo; John saw the holy city as a prepared bride, but a voice told him that it is a tabernacle. This corresponds with the teaching of the entire Scriptures. In the Old Testament times, the people of God were a bride to God on the one hand, and the dwelling place of God on the other. Among the children of Israel there was first the tabernacle and then the temple. However, the physical tabernacle and temple were not the real dwelling place of God; they were signs of the people of Israel themselves as the very tabernacle, temple, and dwelling place of God. In the New Testament the church is both the bride of Christ (Eph. 5:25-32; 2 Cor. 11:2) and the temple, the dwelling place of God (Eph. 2:21-22; 1 Cor. 3:16). When we come to the end of the entire revelation of the Scriptures, we still see these two aspects. The redeemed ones are composed together as the bride of Christ and as the tabernacle of God. The bride is a counterpart to Christ, and the tabernacle is a dwelling place to God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">God Tabernacling with Them</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:3 says that God will tabernacle with the peoples on the new earth. This means that God&rsquo;s presence, God Himself, will always be with them. In this chapter the first item of God&rsquo;s blessing is His presence. It is by God&rsquo;s presence that the peoples on the new earth can be His people and that God can be their God. Without the presence of God, they could never be the people of God, and God could never be the very God to them.</p>
<p>The promise of God&rsquo;s presence in verse 3 is to the peoples on the new earth. However, God&rsquo;s redeemed ones will enjoy His presence in a more subjective way. God will dwell only with the peoples on the new earth, but He will dwell in His redeemed ones. This is the greatest blessing. No blessing is greater, sweeter, or higher than the presence of God Himself within us. This blessing will last for eternity. What else can we want? To have God Himself dwelling in us and to have His presence always with us is more than wonderful. Many today are seeking for other blessings, but we must realize that God&rsquo;s eternal blessing to us is Himself. We cannot say what the eternal presence of God will be like, but to some extent we have the foretaste of the presence of God today. Whenever we have the sense of the presence of God, everything is fine. Regardless of whether or not there is a change in our circumstances, as long as we have the presence of God within us, everything is all right.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Wiping Away Every Tear from Their Eyes</h2>
<p>Verse 4 continues, &ldquo;And He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death will be no more, nor will there be sorrow or crying or pain anymore; for the former things have passed away.&rdquo; In the new heaven and new earth there will be full satisfaction and rest; there will be no more cause for tears.</p>
<p>Moreover, death will be no more, nor will there be sorrow, crying, or pain. Because sin will have been dealt with, death will be cast out. Sorrow is within the heart, crying is the outward expression, and pain is suffering in the body; all these will be no more, for the former things will have passed away.</p><h2 class="head2">The Sons of God in Eternity</h2>
<p>Verses 5 and 6a say, &ldquo;And He who sits on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And He said, Write, for these words are faithful and true. And He said to me, They have come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End.&rdquo; As the Alpha and the Omega He is the start and the completion. At the end of the Bible He declares Himself to be not only the Alpha but also the Omega, meaning that once He begins something, He will complete it regardless of all the frustrations. We should not be disappointed. When we look at the condition of the church today, we may say that it is a mess. How can God accomplish His purpose with such a situation? However, we must remember that Christ is the Alpha and the Omega. He will complete what He has begun. After a long record of not only sixteen books of the Bible but twenty-six, thirty-six, forty-six, fifty-six, and finally sixty-six books, Revelation 21 and 22 eventually will come, because Christ is the Alpha, and He is also the Omega.</p>
<p>Verse 6b and 7 say, &ldquo;I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely. He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be God to him, and he will be a son to Me.&rdquo; To thirst in verse 6 is to thirst not merely after God&rsquo;s redemption or God&rsquo;s work but after God Himself as the living water. Verse 7 says that those who overcome will be not merely God&rsquo;s peoples as in verses 3 and 4, but God&rsquo;s sons. The peoples of God do not have God&rsquo;s life and nature. We are not merely the peoples of God but the sons of God, possessing God&rsquo;s life and nature.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Bride, the Wife of the Lamb</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:9 says, &ldquo;And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.&rdquo; This verse uses two terms, <em>the bride</em> and <em>the wife of the Lamb.</em> The bride is the wife on the first day of marriage. On the wedding day she is the bride, but afterwards she becomes the wife. The New Jerusalem will be the bride in the millennium for one thousand years, the wedding day, and will be the wife in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. Only the overcomers will be the bride in the millennium, but all the redeemed ones eventually will be the wife for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Holy City</h2>
<p>Verse 10 says, &ldquo;And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.&rdquo; In chapter seventeen the apostle John was brought into the wilderness to see the great city, Babylon, but here he is brought to a high mountain to see the holy city, Jerusalem. In order to see God&rsquo;s goal we must be on a high place, a mountain. The Lord&rsquo;s word concerning the kingdom in Matthew 5 through 7 was spoken on a mountain; those in the plains needed to climb the mountain to hear it. The parables in Matthew 13, however, were spoken on the seashore in a mysterious way; the crowd did not understand them. In order to understand the real meaning of those parables, the disciples had to enter inside the house to have an intimate conversation with the Lord (v. 36). Once again, though, the prophecies in Matthew 24 and 25 were spoken by the Lord on the Mount of Olives; those who listened to Him had to climb the mountain.</p>
<p>In the same principle, we must be in spirit and be brought out of the world to the highest level, to the mountain. Then we will see the vision of the goal of the divine purpose. Many Christians today cannot see the things in Revelation no matter how many times they read it. When they read chapters twenty-one and twenty-two, they are blinded. They do not have the light, the insight, because they remain on the &ldquo;plain.&rdquo; We need to be in spirit and be brought up to a high mountain. Then we will see the vision and have the real sight.</p>
<p>In 14:8 and 17:5 Babylon is the great city, but in 21:10 the New Jerusalem is the holy city. The principle of Babylon is to be great, but the principle of the New Jerusalem is to be holy. Do we prefer greatness or holiness? Today many seek to be great preachers, great ministers, and great evangelists, the greater the better. This is the principle of Babylon. We must learn to be small, the smaller the better. We must learn to be holy and separated. We should not make ourselves great or advertise ourselves. To be small requires that we are separated, but to be great requires much mixture. The more mixture something has, the more it becomes great. As Babylon the Great, the apostate Roman Catholic Church is great because she is a mixture of many things. The principle of the church and of the New Jerusalem is that it is a holy city, not a great city. The great city will be burned, but the holy city will be the Lord&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Her Glory and Appearance</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:11 says that the New Jerusalem had the glory of God: &ldquo;Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal.&rdquo; In 4:3 the appearance of God, the expressed God, is like jasper. This indicates that the entire city of New Jerusalem has the expression, the appearance, of God. In appearance the entire city is exactly the same as God. Both God Himself and the entire city are like jasper.</p>
<p>This means that the church must bear the appearance of God; it must be full of God&rsquo;s expression. We cannot be the expression of God if we are great rather than holy. The more we become great, the more we will lose the expression and appearance of God. We will have not jasper but bricks, with which the city of Babel was built. Bricks are composed of earthly material and are manufactured by man. What is the difference between Babel and the New Jerusalem? Babel was built with bricks, while the New Jerusalem is built with precious stones.</p>
<p>When the children of Israel were in Egypt, they took clay and straw and burned them into bricks, and with these bricks they built two treasure cities for Pharaoh. This was something of human manufacture. Today many so-called churches are building with bricks. To build with bricks equals building with wood, grass, and stubble in 1 Corinthians 3:12. God&rsquo;s building is built with precious stones which bear the same appearance and expression as God. How much we have to be purified, sanctified, separated, and made holy! We must be separated from all mixture. What kind of work are we going to do? Are we going to gather straw and burn clay to manufacture bricks and build with them?</p>
<p>When the children of Israel were brought out of Egypt, they received a vision from God to build the tabernacle. The tabernacle was full of gold, and the breastplate and shoulder plate of the high priest were full of precious stones. When the high priest was serving in the tabernacle, the scene there was full of gold and precious stones. This is a picture of God&rsquo;s building. The church must be a composition of precious stones built up together to express God and have His appearance.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 21:12-21</h1>
<p>In this chapter we shall consider further aspects of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Her Structure and Measurement</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:12-13 says, &ldquo;It had a great and high wall and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel: on the east three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">Having the Four Directions<br />
of the Dwelling Place of God</h2>
<p>East, north, south, and west is the spiritual order of the directions of the tabernacle, conveying the thought of God&rsquo;s dwelling. The four directions of the tabernacle begin from the east, the direction the entrance faced. When someone would come into the tabernacle, he would enter from the east. Then from the east he would turn to the table of the bread of the Presence on the north, the lampstand on the south, and the incense altar toward the west. Then to the rear of the incense altar was the Holy of Holies. In the writing of the holy Scriptures, the Holy Spirit was very careful to record the details in Revelation 21, showing that the holy city is the tabernacle of God. East, north, south, and west are the directions of God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Having Three Gates on Four Sides<br />
in a Balanced Way</h2>
<p>That the city of New Jerusalem has four sides, each side with three gates, indicates that it is in the center of the universe, and it is the very center itself. If, for example, someone puts a building in the corner of a lot, it can have gates only on two of its sides because the other two sides do not face onto the property. For a building to have gates on four sides, each opening onto the lot in balanced proportions, it must be in the center.</p>
<p>In my lifetime I have come in contact with many believers. I can testify under the covering of the Lord&rsquo;s blood that I have never met a person so balanced in so many directions as Brother Watchman Nee. This was one of many reasons why I was willing to submit myself to him, even though he was only two years older than I. His balance was a great help to us and to the churches in the Far East. By the mercy of the Lord, the churches in the Far East have always been balanced in many ways.</p>
<p>A few times in recent years some believers who attended our meetings told us that we are like the &ldquo;holiness&rdquo; churches. Later, others came and said that we are like the Baptists, the Presbyterians, and the Brethren. When someone asks us if we are Brethren, we say, &ldquo;Yes, in a sense, but not in every sense.&rdquo; Still others thought we are Pentecostals. It is difficult to say what we are. We are nothing, yet we seem to have everything. We must not denominate ourselves, and if we are balanced in every way, it will not be easy for others to denominate us.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem has twelve gates on four sides, not only one gate on one side. We should never build in the &ldquo;corner of the lot.&rdquo; We must never go to any extreme or take our stand in a corner. If someone pulls us to one side, we should lean toward the other side as well. We should not be a &ldquo;cake not turned&rdquo; (Hosea 7:8), with one side burned and the other raw.</p>
<p>However, to be in the center is not to be neutral. The best way to be great is to compromise by staying neutral, but we should be holy not great. We are part not of the great city, Babylon, but of the holy city, New Jerusalem. Therefore, on the one hand, we must be absolute and uncompromising, but on the other hand, we must be balanced.</p><h2 class="head3">Being Perfect and Complete<br />
in Three Equal Dimensions</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:16 says, &ldquo;And the city lies square, and its length is as great as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed to a length of twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.&rdquo; To interpret these symbols we need wisdom, and we need the entire Scriptures. In both the tabernacle built by Moses and the temple built by Solomon the Holy of Holies was equal in three dimensions. The Holy of Holies in the tabernacle was ten cubits long, ten cubits wide, and ten cubits high (Exo. 26:2-8), while the Holy of Holies in the temple was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high (1 Kings 6:20). In the entire Scriptures only these three structures&mdash;the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle and the temple in the Old Testament and the New Jerusalem in the New Testament&mdash;are equal in three dimensions. This indicates that the entire New Jerusalem is not only the tabernacle of God but also the Holy of Holies. In the Old Testament tabernacle there were two sections, the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies, but in the New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God there is only one section. This means that the veil between the two sections is gone.</p>
<p>That the dimensions of the New Jerusalem are equal in three directions indicates that it is perfect and complete in every way, absolutely straight, and not in the least oblique. Nothing is too short or too long. Anything this perfect must be something of God Himself; only God Himself is so perfect.</p>
<p>The measurements of the three dimensions are twelve thousand stadia. Twelve thousand is twelve times one thousand. Psalm 84:10 says that a day in the courts of God is better than a thousand, and 2 Peter 3:8 says that to the Lord a thousand years is as one day. In addition, the kingdom age will be one thousand years (Rev. 20:4-6). In the Scriptures, therefore, one thousand is the number of fullness. Moreover, that the city was twelve thousand stadia in three directions implies the Triune God in the Holy of Holies.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Pure and Transparent</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:18 says, &ldquo;And the building work of its wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.&rdquo; The city is the New Jerusalem as a whole, while the wall is built around the city for separation. While the city is pure gold, the wall is jasper. The wall, which is jasper, gives the appearance of the city, while the city proper, which is surrounded by the wall, is pure gold, like clear glass. Gold in biblical typology signifies God&rsquo;s divine nature. Second Peter 1:4 tells us that we have become partakers of the divine nature. The divine nature within us is likened to pure and transparent gold with no mixture or alloy.</p>
<p>Many times we are not transparent but opaque because we are still living in the soulish life. According to our experience, the more we live in the soul, the self, and the flesh, the more we are opaque, but whenever we are willing for the cross to deal with our self, flesh, and natural life, we become clear and transparent within. Very often brothers ask me how to know the leading of the Lord. There is only one way; we have to apply the cross to ourselves again and again. In order to be clear about the Lord&rsquo;s will and guidance, we must stay on the altar. The more we apply the cross and are dealt with by the cross, the more we are clear and transparent, and the divine nature within us is clear as glass.</p>
<p>The divine nature is transparent. Although it is gold, it is not opaque gold. Opaqueness is due to our fallen nature. If we still remain in the self and in the flesh, we cannot be clear. This is why we have to be broken. With just a little bit of breaking, the light will shine out from within. We may think that light comes from above, but in actuality it comes from within. The light is within us already, but something is covering it. When our self, the flesh, the natural life, and the old man are broken even a little, the light shines out and we are clear. God&rsquo;s divine nature is pure gold, like clear glass.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Produced by the Experiences of Christ<br />
through Heat and Pressure</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:19 and 20 say, &ldquo;The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.&rdquo; The city proper is gold, signifying the divine nature within us. The divine nature is our common portion. As long as we believe in the Lord Jesus, we all have the divine nature. However, we are different with respect to the precious stones. Some believers only have the gold, the divine nature, which they received when they were saved. They do not have much of the precious stones built up within them. The precious stones signify the work of the Holy Spirit within. At the time we were saved, we received the divine nature, but after that, how much we have of precious stones built in us depends on how much we allow the Holy Spirit to work within us. The work of the Holy Spirit after we are saved is the work of building something of Christ in us, signified by the precious stones.</p>
<p>Gold is an element originally created by God. Precious stones, however, were not originally created by God. They are a compounding of other elements under the processes of burning heat and high pressure. Trees, for example, are burned into carbon and then pressed over a long period of time to become precious stones. We must be burned and pressed. Do not be frightened by this word; many of us have this kind of experience. Many times the Lord arranges an &ldquo;oven&rdquo; for us. Sometimes the Lord uses a high temperature, and other times He uses a lower one, just as a sister knows at what heat to bake something. Many times the Lord has put me into the oven in this way. Even the dear ones around us become a high heat to us. Sometimes our wife is not sufficient for this; we also need some children to &ldquo;burn&rdquo; us. A wife may &ldquo;burn&rdquo; her husband, and then the children cooperate to also burn him. However, the sisters do not have an easy life either. Many husbands are a burning heat to burn their wives. We praise the Lord for the burning and pressing. Originally, we are only wood, grass, and stubble (1 Cor. 3:12), so we need the burning and pressing that we may become precious stones.</p>
<p>We gain the real experiences of Christ not by speaking about them but by the work of the Holy Spirit, and many times these experiences are of burning and pressing. At times we may meet a brother and realize that with him there is something very precious, not precious in doctrine but precious in the experiences of being burned and pressed. In 2 Corinthians 1:8 Paul said that he was pressed beyond his power. This was so that he could become a precious stone. The gold is common to us all; every regenerated person has gold from the day he is saved. But how much of the precious stones do we have? How many precious experiences of Christ by the working of the Holy Spirit under burning and pressing do we have? These experiences are good for the building, protection, separation, and expression of God. The expression, protection, sanctification, and separation always depend on this kind of precious experiences of Christ.</p>
<p>People often misuse Romans 8:28, which says that all things work together for good. We should not quote verse 28, however, while forgetting about verse 29, which says that we are being conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s Son. All things do not work together for our peace, joy, or enjoyment. Rather, all things work together for good to burn us and press us that we may be conformed to the image of the Son of God. Some may testify that formerly they had a poor house, but due to circumstances they received a better house; all things worked together for good that they would receive a new house. Many people testify in this way, misusing Romans 8:28. We should turn this kind of testimony upside down. If one day we lose our house and are put out onto the street, we should say, &ldquo;Thank You, Lord. All things work together for good that I may be burned and pressed in order to be conformed to the image of the Son of God.&rdquo; We need the mercy of the Lord. Our circumstances are not in our hands. They are in His hands. He knows how to handle us.</p><h2 class="head3">The Foundations of the Wall<br />
Being Different in Color and Brightness</h2>
<p>In the city proper there is only one kind of gold, but in the foundations of the wall there are twelve kinds of precious stones. The experiences of Christ within each of us are different. The divine nature is common to us all, but the expression of the divine nature through us is different. Peter, John, and Paul each had their own spiritual characteristics and were different in color and in brightness. Therefore, we should not try to make others uniform with us. We should not try to convince others to be the same as we are. Rather, we need to appreciate their color and thank the Lord for their brightness.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Built Vertically in the Proper Order</h2>
<p>The different precious stones are built up together as the foundations of the wall in a particular way. Are the twelve foundations twelve blocks built horizontally or twelve layers built up vertically? A vertical layering gives a better arrangement of the colors of the twelve stones. In addition, a horizontal building has no order, but a vertical arrangement keeps a proper order. Anything built vertically is strong. Our physical body, for example, is living and strong when it is vertical, but a horizontal body is dead, or at least sleeping. It is difficult to keep a dead or sleeping person vertical; only a strong, living person stays vertical. The Body of Christ is vertical in three dimensions. This maintains a proper order. We must always keep our position in the right order, appreciate and respect others&rsquo; experiences, and try our best to coordinate and fit in with others. This is the Lord&rsquo;s way to build up His church.</p>
<p>We should not have any kind of organization, but we do need an order in the Body. A sister may desire to bear responsibility like a brother, and a brother may desire to be free from responsibility like a sister. We may compare this to the eyes, nose, and teeth on a face all wanting to line up horizontally. What kind of a face would that be? There would be no beauty or proper function in such a face. According to the human thought, the lips are lower than the nose, and the nose is lower than the eyes. However, it is not a matter of being lower or higher; it is a matter of proper position and function. We need to learn to keep a vertical order. There is no organization in a living organism, but there is a living order. When all the members of the church are fitly framed, everyone keeping a right position in order, there is real beauty, strength, and function. Beauty, strength, and function come from the proper order.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Having the Enlarged Appearance of God<br />
Based on His Faithfulness</h2>
<p>According to its colors, the foundations of the wall of the city have the appearance of a rainbow. In 4:3 God, who has the appearance of jasper, is sitting on the throne surrounded by a rainbow, while in chapter twenty-one there is a city with the appearance of jasper surrounded by the foundations of the wall in the colors of a rainbow. The rainbow is a sign of God&rsquo;s covenant, reminding us that God will keep His covenant. This city is built upon an unshakable foundation. It is built upon God&rsquo;s unchangeable covenant, His unchangeable faithfulness. Its foundation is as sure as God&rsquo;s faithfulness.</p>
<p>In chapter four there is the appearance of jasper surrounded by a rainbow, and in chapter twenty-one there is also the appearance of jasper surrounded by a rainbow, but it is now enlarged. Earlier, only God Himself had the appearance of jasper, but now God with a Body has this appearance. God&rsquo;s appearance and testimony have been enlarged, but His faithfulness remains the same.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Entering into the City<br />
by the Death and Resurrection of Christ</h2>
<p>Verse 21 says, &ldquo;And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.&rdquo; Every gate was a pearl of great size. The materials of the New Jerusalem are gold, precious stones, and pearls. These three kinds of materials are also found in Genesis 2:11-12. As we have seen, gold signifies God&rsquo;s divine nature. In addition, precious stones signify the inner work of life by the Holy Spirit. Pearls are produced by an oyster in the waters of death. When an oyster is wounded by a grain of sand and the grain remains in the wound, the oyster secretes its life-juice around it and makes it into a precious pearl. This depicts the death and resurrection of Christ. Christ as the living One came into the death waters and was wounded by us. As we remain in His wound, the secretion of His resurrection life transforms us. Originally, we were only small grains of sand, but now we are regenerated and are being transformed into precious pearls.</p>
<p>The three materials of the city signify the threefold work of the Triune God. Gold signifies God the Father as the nature of the city. Pearl signifies God the Son who died and resurrected, by whose death and resurrection we have been regenerated. Precious stones signify the work of the inner life by the Holy Spirit by which we are being transformed into something precious.</p>
<p>The entrance into the city is the gates of pearl. We enter into the spiritual things, into the kingdom of God, by regeneration. Through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection we have been regenerated, affording us an entrance into God, into the spiritual things, and into God&rsquo;s kingdom. Moreover, through our experience of the death and resurrection of Christ we have an entrance and opening for the increase of the church. The more we experience His death and resurrection, the more we will be broken to produce an opening for the increase.</p><h2 class="head3">Walking on the Way of the Divine Nature</h2>
<p>Verse 21b says, &ldquo;And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.&rdquo; After entering through the gates, we begin to walk on the street. After we are regenerated, we have the divine life and nature within us as our way. To walk on the street of gold after being regenerated is to walk on the way of the divine life and nature. We know this from our own experience. Whenever we have a revival, we renew our experience of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, and we begin again to walk on the street of gold, on the way of God&rsquo;s divine life and nature.</p>
<p>What is the Lord&rsquo;s way? The Lord Himself is the gate, the door, and He is the way (John 10:7; 14:6). By His death and resurrection, we enter into the spiritual realm, into God Himself, and into His kingdom, the realm and sphere of God. By this we have the life and nature of God which becomes a way for us. After entering into the spiritual realm, we walk on the way of the divine nature and live, act, and behave according to the divine life. We may apply this in the following way. A brother may ask us what kind of shirt he should buy. If we truly know how to walk on the street of gold, we will not tell him what to buy. We should simply say, &ldquo;Do not come to me; I am not your way. The street of pure gold, the divine life and nature within you, is your way. Now you must walk on that way.&rdquo; There is only one way, and no one can get lost on this way.</p>
<p>Our way is the Lord Himself as the divine life and nature within us, and this way is our leading. If we have the way, we have the leading. In America today there are freeways and expressways. Wherever we want to go, we simply get on a freeway, and it takes us there. This illustrates that the way is the leading itself. The Lord Himself must be life to us, and He must be our nature within. Then He will be our way, and if He is our way, He will be our leading, and it will be easy for us to go on. In the New Jerusalem, in the church, in the spiritual realm, there is only one way.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Walking on the One Way toward the One Goal</h2>
<p>There are three gates on each of the four sides of the wall of the New Jerusalem, and at the center of the city there is the throne. When we were young, we spent much time to study how twelve gates could have only one street which leads to the throne of God. First we must point out that the wall of the New Jerusalem is a hundred and forty-four cubits high, but the city proper is twelve thousand stadia in height (Rev. 21:16-17). That the wall is lower and the city is higher indicates that the city proper is like a mountain, like the city situated upon a mountain in Matthew 5:14. Moreover, the throne of God is in the center on the top of this mountain. Therefore, the one street must be a spiral that reaches all twelve gates.</p>
<p>Regardless through which gate we enter, we are on the same street. On this street there is no left lane, right lane, or multiple lanes. We are all in one lane, following one after another as we march to Zion. Whether we come from America, Africa, Australia, Europe, Asia, or any other direction, we are all on the same street. In this way we become one army, one church, one people, marching in the same lane toward the same goal. This lane is God Himself in His divine life and nature as the way of pure gold.</p>
<h2 class="head3">A Real and True Picture of the Church</h2>
<p>The entire city of New Jerusalem is nothing other than God Himself wrought into and mingled with humanity. This is a full and true picture of what the church must be today. The more we experience God in Christ as our life and nature, the more we are on the way. On this way there is the flow of living water, and in the flow of living water there is the tree of life.</p>
<p>From our experiences we can testify that all the things we have said here are true. We have experienced these things, and we are still experiencing them. When we passed through the pearl gates, the death and resurrection of Christ, we received the divine nature, and we began to walk in and live by this nature. At the same time the Holy Spirit is working within us to transform us into precious stones for the building up of the wall. Through the work of the Son and the Holy Spirit with the nature of God the Father, the Triune God dispenses Himself into us to transform us into His image.</p>
<p>No human words can exhaust the telling of these wonderful matters. I have ministered from Revelation 21 and 22 many times, but I have never once finished. If you would give me more time, I would still not be able to finish. What is in these two chapters is too rich.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 21:12-21</h1>
<p>In this chapter we shall consider further aspects and applications of the structure and measurement of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Having a Great and High Wall<br />
for Separation and Protection</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:12a says of the New Jerusalem, &ldquo;It had a great and high wall.&rdquo; The first item of the structure and measurement of the New Jerusalem is the wall. A wall is for separation. Within the wall is something of God, while outside the wall is everything else. As Christians and as the church, we must be separated unto God, that is, holy. Holiness is our separation, and the separation is our protection. Where there is a wall, there is protection for everything within it. Many Christians and Christian churches, however, have no separation, so they do not have the protection.</p>
<p>According to verse 18 the building work of the wall is jasper. As we have seen clearly, jasper signifies the appearance of God. This means that the appearance, likeness, and holiness of God in His glory are the separating wall for our Christian life and for the church. In our Christian life and church life we must have God&rsquo;s appearance, God&rsquo;s likeness, and God&rsquo;s holiness in His glory as our separating wall. In the garden of Eden there was no wall to protect it; Adam himself was the only protection, so the serpent came in. The holy city, however, has a wall, which is the appearance, likeness, and holiness of God in glory. This is the separation for the church and the protection for our Christian life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being a Living Composition<br />
of the Old and New Testament Saints</h2>
<p>Verse 12b says that on the twelve gates of the New Jerusalem there were names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel. This indicates that this city includes all the redeemed saints of Israel in the Old Testament times. In addition, verse 14 says that the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. This proves that this city also includes the New Testament believers, who are represented by the twelve apostles. On the gates are the names of the twelve tribes, and on the foundations are the names of the twelve apostles. Putting those names together, it is easy to realize that this city is a composition of all the redeemed saints of the Old Testament and the believers of the New Testament.</p>
<p>Luke 13:28-29 tells us that in the coming kingdom of God, there will be not only Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and other Old Testament saints but also believers who will come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south. Many New Testament believers and Old Testament saints will be together in the kingdom. Hebrews 11:8-10, 13, and 16 tell us that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the other Old Testament saints eagerly waited for the city which has the foundations, which is the New Jerusalem. According to these verses, it seems that the New Jerusalem will be for only the Old Testament saints. However, verses 39 and 40 tell us that the saints in the Old Testament times could not obtain the promise of the city which has the foundations apart from us, the New Testament believers. Hebrews 11, therefore, corresponds with Revelation 21, showing us that the New Jerusalem is a living composition of both the Old Testament saints and New Testament believers.</p>
<p>The bride, the wife of the Lamb, is a living person, and God&rsquo;s tabernacle and temple are also a living person. This city, therefore, is a corporate person, a living composition of persons. Just as the church today is not a physical building but a building composed of living persons, in the same principle the New Jerusalem to come will be a living composition of redeemed, regenerated, and transformed persons built up together.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Measured by the Standard of the Divine Nature Mingled with Humanity</h2>
<p>Verse 15 says, &ldquo;And he who spoke with me had a golden reed as a measure that he might measure the city and its gates and its wall.&rdquo; A golden reed was used as the measure. The measuring instrument was in the form of a reed, but its nature and material was gold. As we have seen, gold signifies the divine nature of God, but what is a reed? Isaiah 42:3 and Matthew 12:20 speak of the Lord Jesus, saying, &ldquo;A bruised reed He will not break,&rdquo; and in Matthew 11:7 Jesus spoke to the crowds concerning John the Baptist, saying, &ldquo;What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?&rdquo; According to these verses, a reed signifies humanity. The golden reed, therefore, signifies the divine nature in human form as the standard of the measurement of the city.</p>
<p>Since the entire New Jerusalem is the manifestation of the divine nature in humanity, it is in harmony with the measure of the golden reed. The city is measured not by gold alone nor by a reed alone, but by a golden reed. This means that it has not only the divine nature and not only humanity, but the divine nature and humanity mingled as one. The church is the mingling of God with man, that is, the divine nature in the human form. A brother may be a typical American with a typical human life, living, and form, but he can still be full of God. This is the principle of the golden reed, something human in form but divine in nature.</p>
<p>Today some believers seem to have the gold only without the reed. It seems that they are no longer human. If someone has no more human form, he has become like the monks in Buddhism or the nuns in Roman Catholicism. What kind of creature is this? The four living creatures in Revelation 4 have only the face of a lion, the face of a calf, the face of a man, and the face of an eagle. Not one has the face of an inhuman monk. The more truly spiritual we are, the more human we are; the more we become a genuine human. The sisters, for example, should not be worldly and modern, but neither should they be peculiar. They should be as human as God created them. This is the significance of the golden reed&mdash;the divine nature manifested in the human form.</p>
<p>If the brothers and sisters among us are peculiar and so &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; that they are not truly spiritual, the church will be strange. The brothers may be so spiritual that they do not know how to be fathers, and the sisters may be so spiritual that they do not know how to be wives. They may say it is too human to be a husband or wife; they think that they should be divine and not human. We should not think that such a church is wonderful. It is not a wonderful church; it is a peculiar church. It can only be measured by the gold but not by a golden reed. How much is the Lord expressed in a full way among us in our living as wives, husbands, students, teachers, and businessmen? No Christian should be a monk or nun; everyone should be very human. All the fathers, mothers, children, in-laws, brothers, sisters, students, teachers, businessmen, and laborers must be very human, yet full of God. They must have the divine nature expressed in humanity. This is according to the measure of the golden reed in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>When I was a young student in college, I did not want to be human in any aspect. I did not want to be like ordinary people in the way I cut my hair or in the clothes and shoes I wore. I thought that the more peculiar I was, the more spiritual I would be. Eventually other people did not know what kind of &ldquo;creature&rdquo; I was. Later I was adjusted by the Lord. I realized that this was not spirituality but peculiarity. True spirituality is the divine nature manifested in humanity. Consider the Lord Jesus while He was on this earth. With Him there was nothing peculiar. He was very ordinary in His human life. This is the divine nature manifested in the human life as the measure of the holy city.</p><h2 class="head3">Being Not Natural but in Resurrection</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:17 speaks of another aspect of the holy city. It says, &ldquo;And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.&rdquo; As we have seen, the record in Revelation contains symbols. The meaning for the symbols in verse 17 is given in Luke 20:36, which tells us that in the resurrection man will be equal to the angels. It is only in resurrection that man is like the angels. This indicates that the wall in Revelation 21:17 is in resurrection. There is nothing of the natural life in it. Therefore, we have to be human, but we must not be natural. To be natural and live in the soul-life is wrong, but to be properly human is necessary. We must be in resurrection, and all our work and activities must be in resurrection. We must be according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.</p>
<p>The wall as the appearance and separation of the church life must be one hundred percent in resurrection. Whatever we do or express must be in resurrection. All natural things, the soulish life, and the old nature have to be terminated by the cross. The church life must be truly human but not in the natural life. Therefore, we need the Lord&rsquo;s salvation and deliverance. In both the West and the Far East I saw a number of brothers who insisted that we must be human. However, what they meant by being human was being natural. We should not be like monks; we should be human, but we must be human in resurrection. We must be human wives and husbands, but we must be human wives and husbands in resurrection. Our natural life, soulish life, self, self-intentions, self-centeredness, and everything of the self must be put on the cross. Then a sister can be the best wife in resurrection; she can be very human yet one hundred percent in resurrection.</p>
<p>We should not dress in a peculiar way like monks, and the sisters should not dress like nuns. Rather, we need to be human. However, we may be human in a completely natural, soulish, or fleshly way. In our clothing we may be not only human but fleshly, worldly, natural, and soulish. Therefore, we need the dealing of the cross. Whether or not we have the reality of the expression of God must be checked both by the measure of the golden reed and by the measure of a man, that is, of an angel. These two measures are very important, practical, and real. We may say that we are spiritual and bear the proper expression, but we must be measured by the golden reed&mdash;by the divine nature lived out in humanity&mdash;and by the measure of a man, that is, of an angel. Does our living and daily life correspond to this measure? If not, regardless of how spiritual we think we are, we are not truly spiritual.</p>
<p>Once while I was speaking to a church in the Far East, I told the saints that to be a Christian, a child of God, we need to learn how to be human. After the message a brother came to me excitedly. He said that for a long time he had felt that the brothers and sisters there did not know how to be human, because they said that to indulge in sports and movies was not proper. This brother&rsquo;s feeling was that as humans we need to do many things like this, and that these things are not sinful. However, I knew this brother&rsquo;s daily life, so I told him that to be human does not mean to be worldly, fleshly, and soulish. If we learn the lesson of being measured by the golden reed and keep the principle of the measure of a man, that is, of an angel, we will know the proper way to be spiritual. The proper way is to be very human but fully in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Having Eternal Perfection<br />
in the Divine Administration</h2>
<p>The wall of the New Jerusalem is a hundred and forty-four cubits high (v. 17). A hundred and forty-four is twelve times twelve, signifying that the New Jerusalem is full of God&rsquo;s perfection in His eternal administration. The number twelve is the mingling of three with four. Three represents the Triune God, and four represents the creature. Twelve, therefore, signifies that God is mingled with His creature. The separating wall in our Christian life and church life must be the mingling of the Triune God with humanity, full of eternal perfection in the eternal administration. Such a wall is high enough to keep out all the evil things; the serpent can no longer creep in. The high wall with the standard of eternal perfection, of the divine administration, and of the mingling of the Triune God with His creatures is our separation and protection.</p><h2 class="head3">Having Gates for Communication and Entrance</h2>
<p>Verses 12, 13, and 21 speak of the gates of the New Jerusalem. We thank the Lord that in the holy city there is not only a wall but also twelve gates. The wall is for separation and protection, while the gates are for communication and entrance. If there were no gates, how could people enter in? We need a wall with gates. A gate is a break, an opening, in a wall. On the one hand, we need to build up the wall, but on the other hand, we need breaking to create an entrance into the city. Sometimes we sense that a dear brother has a strong wall without any gates. No one can enter in through him. I have seen this kind of spiritual persons. The more spiritual they become, the more they are not able to bring people to the Lord. They cannot beget spiritual children because they have a wall with no entrance. We need a breaking in order to reach out to others that they may enter in through us.</p>
<p>Many dear Christians have no wall at all; they are too open. But other spiritual ones have a wall with no openings. This is a problem. We need the wall, and we need twelve gates, three gates in each of the four directions. How many gates do we have? Can people be saved and enter into the church through us? Some local churches have a wall without gates, so there is no way for people to enter in. If anyone wants to be saved and come into the church, it seems that they have to climb over the spiritual persons, that they must be holy and spiritual before they can enter in. Do we want this kind of Christian life and church life? The wall in our Christian life and church life must have adequate entrances in four directions. Then no matter what direction people come from, there is an entrance for them to get in. We say that we are not sectarian or exclusive, but where are our entrances? Do we have twelve gates toward creation in four directions?</p>
<p>In each direction, no matter where people come from, there must be an entrance for them. The gates are toward the Far East in the east, Africa and South America in the south, and Europe to the west. There is even an entrance for the Russian Bolsheviks from the north. The entrances are toward all directions. The entrances are also toward all classes of people, whether they are doctors or gamblers. There are twelve gates in four directions for people to enter in.</p>
<p>That there are three gates on each side signifies that the three of the Trinity&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;work together to bring people into the holy city. This is indicated in the three parables in Luke 15. The Son as the shepherd came to die for us to bring us back to God. The Spirit as the seeking woman enlightens our heart to cause us to repent, to make a decision to come back to the Father. Then the loving Father receives the returning prodigal son. The three parables in Luke 15 show us the three steps taken by the Triune God to bring fallen man back to Himself.</p>
<p>In our Christian life and church life, we must have the separating wall of the holiness and appearance of God in His glory, but our separation must provide adequate entrances for people to contact us and enter in. We need the breaking to create openings in the wall, which are the Triune God as the three gates in four directions. In some places the saints have asked me for the way to bring people into the church. The way is to have more breaking to create the openings, not by human hands but by the Triune God. This breaking is accomplished by the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Consider from Luke 15 how the Son came to sacrifice His life to bring us back to God, how the Spirit diligently enlightens the darkened heart, and how the Father loves the fallen sinners and awaits their return. If we are willing for the Triune God to break us to create the openings, many people will be brought into the church life through us because the entrances, the gates, will be open.</p>
<p>We should not be too spiritual and boast that we are separated, holy, and not worldly. If we are this way, then we may want to see people saved, but they will not come; we may distribute tracts, but there will be no response. This indicates that we are still too whole. We should fall down, prostrate ourselves, and cry to the Lord, &ldquo;I do not care about my spirituality. I would rather see people be saved and helped by the church.&rdquo; If we do this, the gates will be open. When our spirituality is broken, there are the gates, the openings and entrances, for the weak and sinful ones to come through. Then there is no need for them to use their own effort to climb over the high wall. We need to build up the wall, but we must not build up a wall that is whole, without entrances.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Balanced in Every Aspect and on Every Side</h2>
<p>It is too easy for us to go to extremes. On the one hand, we may have no wall at all, but on the other hand, we may build a wall without entrances. We may have no desire to reach others for the Lord. We may prefer to stay within the wall and exclude others. Therefore, we need to be balanced. Hosea 7:8 speaks of a &ldquo;cake not turned,&rdquo; a cake burned on one side and raw on the other. We need to be turned again and again. We must build the wall, but there must be the breaking and cutting to create gates in every direction. Some Christians need to build the wall higher, but those who have built the wall need breaking to create gates for people to enter through.</p>
<p>To build three gates on each of four sides will balance us and balance the church. In order to construct a building with three gates on four sides, it must be erected at the center of the lot. If it were built on a corner of the lot, it could not have gates on all four sides. For a building to have three gates on each of its four sides is the best way to position it in the center of the lot and keep it balanced in every aspect. We may be a very good church, but we may be a church &ldquo;in the corner&rdquo;; we may not have gates on all sides. This means that we are not balanced; we have slipped toward a corner and have gone to an extreme. A building with three gates on four sides, one that is easy for people to come into, must be adequately balanced and properly in the center.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem as the building of God is the very center of the entire universe. In every aspect and from every side it is one hundred percent balanced. It is neither too much to one side nor too much to another. The local expression of the church in the city where we live must also be in the center, not geographically but spiritually. It must not go too far in any direction, leaving only one or two sides with entrances. The church must be very balanced in every aspect and appear the same from every side. It must not be in any extreme but in the very center of God&rsquo;s testimony, having four sides full of gates for people to enter in.</p>
<p>The messages in this book are not a mere study of the prophecies of Revelation. Rather, I have a strong burden to tell you that to have twelve gates will keep us balanced and make us the very center of God&rsquo;s universe. May the Lord be merciful to us that we may be delivered from any unbalanced position and kept in the very center, balanced in every way and aspect. May we learn these lessons and apply them to our daily life, our Christian life, and our church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 21:22-27; 22:1-21</h1>
<p>In this chapter we shall consider further aspects of the New Jerusalem and the concluding sections of Revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Enlarged Temple</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:22 says, &ldquo;And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.&rdquo; The temple is the place where we contact God and serve Him. In the ancient times, in order to serve the Lord and worship God, the Israelites had to go to the temple. In the holy city, however, there is no need to go to a certain place to serve God, for God Himself in Christ will be the temple. We will serve God in God Himself.</p>
<p>Today in the New Testament time, the principle is the same in spirit. There is no need to go to a temple, because we are in Him and we serve the Lord in the Lord Himself. Today He is so dear, near, available, present, and direct to us. His presence is always with us, and His presence today is our dwelling place. It will be more so in eternity. There will be no need for a temple in order to contact God because God and the Lamb will be the temple. In the New Jerusalem God Himself in Christ will be everything to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Her Light and Lamp</h2>
<p>Verse 23 continues, &ldquo;And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.&rdquo; God is the light, and the Lamb is the lamp. That the light is in the lamp signifies that God is in Christ. Since God Himself in Christ is the light, the glory of God will illumine the holy city. Therefore, there will be no need of the sun by day or the moon by night.</p>
<p>In the ancient times the outer court of the tabernacle was lit by the sun during the day and by the moon at night, and the Holy Place was lit by the lampstand. In the Holy of Holies, however, there was no sun, no moon, and no lampstand. The light in the Holy of Holies was God Himself in His eternal glory. In the same way, in the holy city in eternity future there will be no need of the sun or of the moon because God Himself will be the light. This indicates that the entire city of New Jerusalem will be the Holy of Holies. As we have seen in a previous message, the measurements of the city in three dimensions also prove that the city is the Holy of Holies. Besides the New Jerusalem, the Holy of Holies in both the tabernacle and the temple is the only structure in the entire Scriptures that was equal in three dimensions. Similarly, in the entire Scriptures the Holy of Holies is the only other place where there is need of no light other than God. This shows us that in eternity the holy city will be the Holy of Holies. Again we say, in the New Jerusalem God Himself in Christ will be everything to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Nations around Her</h2>
<p>Verse 24 says, &ldquo;And the nations will walk by its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.&rdquo; Even after the millennium the nations will live on the new earth as the peoples (vv. 3-4). These nations will have kings, who will bring their glory into the city. In Genesis 31:1, <em>wealth</em> literally means <em>glory;</em> Jacob&rsquo;s wealth was his glory. Therefore, the glory of the nations in Revelation 21:24 refers to splendor, including wealth. In eternity, we the redeemed ones will be the royal family ruling over the nations.</p>
<p>Verse 25 continues, &ldquo;And its gates shall by no means be shut by day, for there will be no night there.&rdquo; Although this verse says that there will be no night, it still uses the phrase <em>by day.</em> This indicates that in the new heaven and new earth there will still be the distinction between day and night, but in the New Jerusalem there will be no such distinction. This is because in the holy city, just as in the Holy of Holies, there is no need of the sun or of the moon for God Himself will be the light. Moreover, at that time we the redeemed ones will have a body in resurrection which will never be tired, so we will not need nighttime for sleeping. Rather, we will serve God continually. For us, there will be no night but only day, because in the holy city God Himself will be the &ldquo;sun&rdquo; which will never go down.</p>
<p>Verses 26 and 27 say, &ldquo;And they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it. And anything common and he who makes an abomination and a lie shall by no means enter into it, but only those who are written in the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life.&rdquo; Anything common is in contrast with the holy things (Lev. 10:10; Ezek. 44:23). <em>Common</em> means not only unclean or defiled but also natural or fleshly. Anything natural, even if it is good, is common. Nothing common will have the right to enter into the holy city or to have a share in it, because the city will be holy. In the same principle, anything of the church must be holy and separated; whatever is common or natural has no place in the church.</p>
<p>Verse 27 also speaks of making an abomination, referring to the worship of idols. Moreover, lies are from Satan. Therefore, common things, abominations, and lies are all related to Satan, and they have no share in the holy city.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE AND THE TREE OF LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The River of Water of Life</h2>
<p>The final chapter of the Scriptures, Revelation 22, begins, &ldquo;And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street&rdquo; (v. 1). The two&mdash;God and the Lamb&mdash;are on one throne, indicating that God is in the Lamb. This is similar to 21:23, which tells us that God as the light is in the Lamb as the lamp. For eternity God is in Christ. Outside of Christ, we cannot meet God. If we want to find God, we must find Him in Christ. God dwells in Christ, who is His very embodiment. God as the light is in Christ as the lamp, and the one throne is the throne of God and of the Lamb.</p>
<p>Out of this throne comes a river of water of life. Whereas the throne is a matter of authority, the flowing river is a matter of fellowship. The fellowship of life is simply the flow of the Holy Spirit. The throne at the peak of the city and in the center of it represents the divine authority, and from this throne flows a river as the fellowship of the entire city. It is by this flowing that the entire city enjoys the divine fellowship and communication, and in this fellowship there is the divine authority. Authority always goes together with fellowship.</p>
<p>By reading the Old Testament together with the New Testament, we can see that God&rsquo;s building always needs the kingship and the priesthood. In order to build up God&rsquo;s habitation, we need the kingship for authority and the priesthood for fellowship. In Zechariah 6:12-13 the Lord Jesus is the One who builds up God&rsquo;s temple with two statuses, as the King for authority and as the Priest for fellowship. In order to build up a local church in a proper way we need the headship, kingship, authority, and throne of God, and we also need His priesthood as the real fellowship. This is signified by the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Tree of Life</h2>
<h2 class="head3">One Throne, One River, One Street,<br />
and One Tree of Life</h2>
<p>Verse 2 says, &ldquo;And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.&rdquo; The New English Bible translates the latter phrase of verse 2 as &ldquo;the leaves of the trees.&rdquo; This is a thoroughly wrong translation. In the New Jerusalem everything is unique. There is one throne, one river, one street, and one tree of life. The editors of The New English Bible may have wondered how one tree could be on this side and on that side of the river. In the middle of the spiraling street there is the river of water of life, and the tree of life in the middle of it grows and spreads to the two banks of the river.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Walking under the Lord&rsquo;s Headship<br />
by the Inner Flow</h2>
<p>A street is a place where we walk and move. Our daily walk and move must be according to the divine flow. If we do not have the flow, we do not have the Lord&rsquo;s leading; that is, we are not on the Lord&rsquo;s way. Whatever we do and wherever we go must be according to the flow within us. If we choose a certain shirt at the department store, the flow within us may stop. If so, we should not buy that shirt. We may have no way, no &ldquo;street,&rdquo; to buy that shirt. On the contrary, if there is a flow, there is a way. We may say that we have the Lord&rsquo;s leading to do something, but do we have the flow? If the flow stops, what we are doing is not the Lord&rsquo;s way. If what we do is on the Lord&rsquo;s way, there must be a flow within us. Sometimes even when ministering in certain places, I have had no way to speak. Because there was no flow, I had to stop.</p>
<p>The inner flowing comes out of the throne of God. In order for us to have the flow, God in Christ must be enthroned within us, and we must be under His authority. If we rebel against God and are not under His authority, we will not have the flow. If we enthrone Christ, honor and respect Him on the throne, and submit to His authority in everything, right away we will have the flow within. The inner flow is the way we follow, and the inner flow comes from submitting to the throne. Many times we are rebellious within. All sins come from rebellion; rebellion is the root of all sins, and rebellion comes from the self. Even in small matters we may not submit to the Lord. We put the Lord aside and place ourselves on the throne. Because of this, the flow within us stops. However, if we repent, enthrone Christ, submit to Him, and take His authority and headship, the flow within us will be recovered.</p><h2 class="head3">Receiving the Life Supply by Following the Flow</h2>
<p>In the flow there is the tree of life, the life supply. We can prove this by our experience. When we have the flow within us, we have the way, and when we follow the flow, we are satisfied and nourished. We have something to feed on, and we are satisfied, strengthened, liberated, refreshed, and revived day by day.</p>
<p>Verse 2 says that the tree of life produces twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month. Our experience should not be like the children of Israel who ate the same food, the manna, every day for forty years. We should have new fruit, that is, new experiences of Christ. Some dear brothers and sisters enjoy the same fruit for twenty years. They testify of their experience of Christ one year, and many years later they testify of the same experience. Eventually they lose their taste to repeat their testimony. Their experiences are good but too old. We need new experiences of Christ.</p>
<p>Christ is unlimited and unsearchably rich. The river of living water is the flow of the Holy Spirit, and the tree of life is the living Christ. That the tree of life grows in the flow of the river signifies that the living Christ is in the flow of the Holy Spirit. Wherever the living flow of the Spirit is, there is the living Christ. We all need to experience the river of life and the tree of life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Leaves of the Tree<br />
Being for the Healing of the Nations</h2>
<p>The last part of verse 2 says that the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. The nations on the new earth will be those people who remain after the final judgment on the rebellious mankind at the end of the millennium. They will be transferred from the millennial kingdom to the new earth to be the nations. The believers are the regenerated ones who are born anew to be kings in God&rsquo;s royal family and components of the New Jerusalem. The restored nations, however, are not regenerated but simply restored according to God&rsquo;s dispensation for them.</p>
<p>The one thousand years of the coming kingdom will be a period of restoration. All creation, including the plants, the sun, and all things, will be restored to their original condition in creation. According to Isaiah 30:26 the light of the sun in the millennium will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days. Due to the fall of man, the entire creation became degraded, but at the time of the millennial kingdom, all things will be restored. Even the human race will be restored. During this time if someone lives to a hundred years of age, he will only be a lad (65:20). After this, the restored human race will be transferred from the millennial kingdom to the new earth to be the nations and the peoples under the rule of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>How can the peoples of the nations live forever, not having been regenerated? It is by the leaves of the tree of life. Whereas the regenerated believers eat the fruit of the tree of life, the restored nations are healed by the leaves of the tree of life. Leaves here are a symbol. Leaves are the covering of a tree, like clothing, and in the Scriptures clothing typifies man&rsquo;s deeds (Gen. 3:7). That the restored nations are healed by the leaves of the tree of life signifies that they take the deeds of Christ as their outward guide and regulation. Living by the example of the Lord Jesus will heal the nations and solve their problems. We the regenerated believers, however, will enjoy Christ as our life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BLESSINGS OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEEMED IN ETERNITY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">No More Curse and Having the Throne of God and of the Lamb</h2>
<p>Revelation 22:3a says, &ldquo;And there will no longer be a curse. And the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it.&rdquo; In the new heaven and new earth there will be no curse because sin and death will be gone. However, there is an additional principle here: Where the throne of God is established, there the curse is gone. To have a curse means that we do not have the throne. If the throne of God is within us, we will have no curse.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Serving God and the Lamb</h2>
<p>Verse 3b goes on to say, &ldquo;And His slaves will serve Him.&rdquo; We will not only rule and reign with the Lord, but we will serve Him as priests. To reign with the Lord is the aspect of kingship, while to serve the Lord is a matter of the priesthood.</p><h2 class="head2">Seeing the Face of God and of the Lamb,<br />
and the Name of God and of the Lamb<br />
Being on Their Forehead</h2>
<p>Verse 4 continues, &ldquo;And they will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads.&rdquo; That those who serve God will see His face indicates that genuine service leads us into fellowship and the presence of the Lord. Whether or not our service is proper can be checked in this way: Does our service lead us into the Lord&rsquo;s presence? The more some people serve, the more they do not have the fellowship of the Lord and the more they lose His presence. This means that their service is wrong. The right way to serve is that the more we serve, the more we see His face. Moreover, because His name will be on the foreheads of God&rsquo;s redeemed, people will quickly recognize that these persons belong to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being under the Illumination of the Lord God</h2>
<p>Verse 5 says, &ldquo;And night will be no more; and they have no need of the light of a lamp and of the light of the sun, for the Lord God will shine upon them; and they will reign forever and ever.&rdquo; The light of a lamp is made by man, and the light of the sun is natural light. In the holy city we will have no need for human-manufactured light or natural light. The outer court of the tabernacle in the ancient times required the light of the sun, and the Holy Place needed the light from the lampstand. However, in the Holy of Holies there is no need for the sun or a lamp because there God Himself is the light. Again, this proves that the holy city is the Holy of Holies.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Reigning Forever</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s redeemed in eternity will reign forever and ever. On the one hand, they will be priests coming to the Lord to serve Him, while on the other hand, they will be kings going to the people to reign over the nations. First Peter 2:5 and 9 speak of two kinds of priesthood, the holy priesthood and the royal priesthood. According to the holy priesthood, we go to God, while according to the royal priesthood we go to people. When we go to the Lord to pray for others, we are the holy priests, and when we come out from the presence of the Lord to minister to people, we are the royal priests. When we come into the Lord&rsquo;s presence, we are priests according to the order of Aaron, and when we come out from the presence of God to minister something of God to people, we are priests according to the order of Melchisedec, who ministered bread and wine (Heb. 5:6, 10; 6:20; 7:11, 17; Gen. 14:18). For eternity God will be everything to us. He will mingle Himself with us, dwell among us, and make us one with Him to serve Him as priests and reign with Him as kings.</p>
<p>In Revelation 22:1 through 5, God sits on the throne with authority as the very center of the holy city. Out of the throne issues the flowing river of water of life, and in this flow there is the supply of life. Along this flow there is a street. Moreover, this very God in Christ is our temple, and He is the light in the holy city. God Himself in Christ is everything to us. As we read this portion of the Word, we mainly find God Himself. The water we drink, the food we eat, the street we walk on, the temple in which we serve, and the illumination by which we live will all be God Himself in Christ. At that time God will be everything to us. Other than God we will need nothing.</p>
<p>How do we enter into this experience? It is by the gates of pearl, the death and resurrection of Christ. Therefore, we have to be regenerated and transformed. All the natural, sinful, and old things must be filtered out by the cross, by the death of Christ, at the pearl gates. Only that which is regenerated and transformed can pass through the pearl gates. Then, after entering by the pearl gates, we walk on the way of the divine life and nature. In this way we have the flow of life, and in this flow of life there is the supply of life. Day by day we enjoy the Holy Spirit with the all-inclusive Christ as our supply. We are under the headship, the kingship, and the authority of God in Christ in the fellowship of the flowing Holy Spirit. In this way the Triune God is mingled with us, and the work of the Holy Spirit produces precious stones that are good for the building.</p>
<p>These experiences must be the model, pattern, reality, and goal of every church as a local expression of the Body of Christ. In the church there must be nothing sinful, fleshly, soulish, worldly, or individualistic. Everything must be divine and even human, yet in resurrection. Everyone must be regenerated, transformed, and built up together in harmony to express God.</p>
<p>In the picture of the holy city we see the Triune God. God is the light and Christ the Son is the lamp. Moreover, God in Christ is on the throne, and out of the throne the Holy Spirit flows as the living water to bring God&rsquo;s authority and the life supply of the Son to minister to God&rsquo;s redeemed. In this way the entire city will feed on the Triune God, live by the Triune God, and be mingled with the Triune God to be built up together as one corporate Body to express Him, serve Him, and reign with Him to fulfill His eternal purpose. This is all that I can say with human utterance. This is wonderful!</p>
<p>Moreover, this must be our goal. All our daily walk, living, work, and activity must be toward this goal. This is the ultimate conclusion of the entire Scriptures. God&rsquo;s eternal plan is to reach this goal. After reading Revelation 21 and 22 we can look back at the sixty-six books of the Bible and see that this is the very goal of all of God&rsquo;s work, both in creation and in redemption. God&rsquo;s goal is to have the corporate Body of Christ to express the Triune God. This must also be our goal today.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S LAST WARNING<br />
AND THE APOSTLE&rsquo;S LAST PRAYER</h2>
<p>Revelation 22:6 through 21 are the Lord&rsquo;s last warning and the apostle&rsquo;s last prayer. In verse 7a the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this scroll.&rdquo; How important it is that we keep the prophecy of this book! In verse 10 the Lord continues, &ldquo;Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this scroll, for the time is near.&rdquo; Although the apostle John did not seal the prophecies of this book, God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan, has sealed this book for centuries. This book is an open book, for the mysteries in it have all been unsealed, but to many believers it remains sealed. It is very difficult to find any Christians who truly understand this book.</p>
<p>Verse 11 continues, &ldquo;Let him who does unrighteousness do unrighteousness still; and let him who is filthy be filthy still; and let him who is righteous do righteousness still; and let him who is holy be holy still.&rdquo; We must be careful. If we are unrighteous or filthy and do not deal with this problem, the Lord may allow us to remain in this condition.</p>
<p>In verse 13 the Lord says He is the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. That this word is similar to the word of God Himself in 21:6 proves that the Lord Jesus is the very God. Verse 15 goes on to speak of those who are outside the city. This refers to the lake of fire where the sinful ones who cooperate with Satan will be.</p>
<p>Verse 16 continues, &ldquo;I Jesus have sent My angel to testify to you these things for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright morning star.&rdquo; In His divinity, Christ is the Root, the source, of David, and in His humanity Christ is the Offspring, the issue, of David. This reveals the two natures of the Lord Jesus. The bright morning star mentioned here will appear only to the watchful ones. The slumbering believers will not see the morning star; they will see Christ only as the sun in a general way.</p>
<p>Verse 17 says, &ldquo;And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him who hears say, Come! And let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely.&rdquo; The first two instances of <em>come</em> refer to the Lord&rsquo;s coming, while the third <em>come</em> refers to the thirsty ones. On the one hand, &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; is the cry of the Spirit and the bride and of all those who hear this response. On the other hand, the Spirit and the bride yearn that the thirsty sinner also will come to take the water of life for his satisfaction.</p>
<p>Finally, verses 18 to 21 say, &ldquo;I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this scroll; and if anyone takes away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this scroll. He who testifies these things says, Yes, I come quickly. Amen. Come, Lord Jesus! The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING THE HEAVENLY VISION<br />
AND TAKING GOD&rsquo;S ULTIMATE INTENTION<br />
AS OUR UNIQUE GOAL</h2>
<p>May we all look to the Lord that He will reveal these things to us in our spirit, that from this day on we will have a heavenly vision. Then, once we have seen the heavenly vision, we can never say that we have not seen it. We must be able to say to the universe, &ldquo;I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision&rdquo; (Acts 26:19). May the Lord be gracious to us that we may truly see that God&rsquo;s ultimate intention, eternal purpose, and ultimate goal is to gain a Body for Christ as the corporate expression of the Triune God. Today we must take this as our unique goal and give ourselves to it. May the Lord be merciful to us.</p></body></html>
