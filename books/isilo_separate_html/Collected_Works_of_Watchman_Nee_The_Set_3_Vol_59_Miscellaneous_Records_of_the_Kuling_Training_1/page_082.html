If a man receives enough light, he will feel the need for salvation. The same can be said about the experience of authority; it depends on the amount of light a man has received. If a man receives enough light, he will touch authority. His inner being will shrivel and be brought to submission. When grass is exposed to the scorching sun, it can do nothing but wilt. Once a man touches authority in a genuine way, several things will happen.</p><p>First, those who have touched authority look for authority wherever they go. They seek out objects of submission. This is the normal response of a person who has touched authority. He no longer is the same as what he used to be, having no fear of anything or anyone. The church is a "training institute" that trains Christians in the lesson of submission. Submission cannot be found anywhere in the world, and a Christian can only learn submission in the church. Such submission is from the heart; it is not an outward performance. Once a man learns submission, he searches for authority wherever he goes.</p><p>Second, those who have touched authority are tender. Once a man touches God's authority, he is softened. Something within him wilts away. He is not able to be tough in himself any longer. He is fearful of making mistakes, of falling into disobedience. It is easy to change such a person. Tenderness is a clear sign of an encounter with authority. Those who have touched authority are quite afraid of offending authority, even if by accident.</p><p>Third, no one who has touched authority wants to be an authority. Those who have touched authority have no desire or interest in being an authority. A man who has met authority always remains under authority; he is always afraid of making mistakes. However, many people like to be God's counselors; they like to rule over others. These ones do not know anything about authority. I do not like to be anyone's counselor or to give any proposals or opinions. I do not like to rule over others, but those who have a natural inclination for these things have never touched authority. Even if we are an authority, we have to realize that there is authority above us. How do we know that our charge to those under us is acceptable to those above us? Those who like to be God's counselor love to be an authority over others. No one is qualified to be God's counselor, but many people want to be one. A genuine authority goes through much deliberation, consideration, and prayer before he proposes anything or makes any decision. He is afraid of initiating anything that goes against the will of his authority, that is, the will of those above him. Problems often arise between husbands and wives because there is no realization of authority. When husbands and wives argue, authority is not the first priority; in fact, authority is set aside. A husband often says to his wife, "I am the authority. You must submit to me." A husband who says this does not know what it means to be an authority. This is how problems arise in many instances.</p><p>Fourth, those who have touched authority are very discreet with their tongues. A man who has genuinely touched authority has a disciplined mouth. His mouth is restricted, shut up, and he is fearful of any careless speaking. One of the greatest tests of a person is his words. Those who have touched authority are sensitive to any word that is out of place, any criticism, or any word of rebellion. Those who know authority are as sensitive to authority as they are sensitive to sin. This sensitivity is like the physical sensations of the body; as soon as it is triggered, there is a reaction.</p><p>Fifth, those who have touched authority are fully aware of rebellion in others, just as a person who has had a genuine experience of salvation knows whether or not others are saved. Similarly, those who have had a genuine experience of dealing with sins know whether or not others are involved in sin. Once we touch authority, we can turn around and identify the many rebellious acts in others. We find rebellious words here and there and find offenses against authority in many people. We find that many brothers and sisters whom we used to admire or revivalists whom we once respected have a spirit of rebellion behind them. We would not dare to criticize them, but we pity them, saying, "Such a brother or sister could have been a wonderful authority. Yet he has never touched authority himself. Oh, how much we need God's mercy!" Such a consciousness instills fear in us and prayer for others. If we have never touched authority, we are lawless, and we will not be conscious of any lawlessness in others. The first manifestation of lawlessness is rebellion, which comes from Satan. Once we touch authority, we detect the lawlessness and rebellion that is running rampant everywhere. We realize that the principle of lawlessness has saturated the whole earth and even permeated the church. We can bring the brothers and sisters into the same submission one by one by first touching authority and submitting to it ourselves. I hope that after three or five years, we will all be different. Everyone has to come under authority before he or she can be useful. We hope to see the testimony of authority manifested everywhere among the brothers and sisters. This will be something unseen and unheard of anywhere on earth. If we subject our words and our spirit to those in authority, the church will have a testimony of submission and will be able to go on. If the church is submissive, many attacks from the enemy will be eliminated. Only after we have judged ourselves can we condemn the mistakes in others, and only then will our condemnation be accompanied by much supplication. If we all learn this lesson, the church will take a big step in the way of recovery. It is easier to submit to authority than to be an authority. When we touch authority, our first reaction is to seek to submit to others and not to seek for submission from others. Unless we are brought to this point, God cannot use us to be an authority.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_081.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_083.html">Next</a> </body></html>
