If we are special and insist on anything other than the common faith, the oneness will surely be damaged, and divisions will occur
The best way to eat and partake of Him, who is life, is to exercise our spirit by calling on His name and pray-reading His Word
Those of us who were in the meetings when these messages were released can never forget their timeliness and impact
We are grateful that this word can be made available to all of the Lord's children in every place at this time
When we say the speciality of the church life is the faith, we mean the faith which is the object of our believing
Paul said he fought the good fight and kept the faith , and he also charged Timothy to fight the good fight of the faith
As the Son of God He came in the flesh with the Father and in the name of the Father ; hence, He is called the Father
He was with God, and He was God in eternity past , not only coexisting, but also coinhering with the Father all the time
As the Lamb of God slain on the cross and shedding His physical blood for our sin and sins, He is our Redeemer
As the ascended Christ He is the Lord of all , the Head of all things , the Head of the church , and the Lord of lords and King of kings
In resurrection He is our life the One who lives in us and Gods power and wisdom to us to be our righteousness sanctification and redemption
As the Body of Christ, the church is universally one; as the expression of the Body of Christ, a local church is locally one
Ephesians 4:13 says, 'until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith' , and then in verse 14 there is the wind of doctrine
We should not think that any of these doctrines or practices are included in the speciality of the church life
During the last five centuries, since the time of Martin Luther and the Reformation, Christians have been divided by all kinds of doctrine
Some say that a person may be regenerated, but he could never be baptized in the Holy Spirit without speaking in tongues
He experienced the Lord's healing by grace, but the charismatic or Pentecostal believers say healing is by the gifts
Concerning the rapture there are different schools of teaching such as pretribulation rapture posttribulation rapture and partial rapture
There have been teachings upon teachings, and all the Christians have been divided and are still being divided by the differing doctrines
Our Christian faith is composed of the beliefs concerning the Bible, God, Christ, the work of Christ, salvation, and the church
If we take something away, we will surely be divisive, and if we add something to it, we will also be divisive
On the one hand, by the fourteenth century nearly everything that God had given and committed to the Body had been lost
On the other hand, with those fourteen hundred years, the so-called church had picked up many heretical, dark, and sinful things
Whatever the church lost was something given by the Head, and whatever the church picked up was something injected from Satan
In the 1700s some of the dear saints who were in the Lord's recovery began to pay their attention to the church life
Under his leadership, they began to practice the church life, and to some extent it was proper and also quite wonderful
At the beginning, the Brethren were very good in the matter of life; but later they were distracted from life to doctrine
Because the Brethren were so dogmatic and legal, there arose a group of people who did not care for any legality
All of these-the inner life, evangelism, and the Pentecostal movement-were the Lord's reactions to the dead rituals and dead doctrines
Today people spread all kinds of rumors that Witness Lee is different from Watchman Nee, particularly concerning the church
The recovery of the proper church life as was pointed out by Brother Nee is the recovery of the unique oneness and the reality of the church
In the book, Further Talks on the Church Life, he spent much effort to illustrate and show us the genuine oneness of the church
Chapter four of this book illustrates four kinds of unity, of which only one is the proper and genuine unity of the church
The recovery of the church life is basically dependent on the recovery of the oneness and reality of the church
Each of the different materials may be good, but the foreman knows from experience which material will make the best product
By this way they will experience and enjoy the Lord have the growth in life and be preserved in the oneness as the ground of the church life
A local church might be built up by teaching, but if you use it as the basic way to build up a local church, you will suffer some loss
He definitely disagreed with the teaching that tongues are the unique manifestation of the baptism of the Spirit
Today Brother Nee's teachings have become so prevailing, not only among Chinese-speaking Christians, but also throughout the whole world
Paul knew that the best way to build up the church was not with teachings, nor with the gifts, but by the Spirit with life
When we come to the generality and the practicality of the church life in the forthcoming chapters, this will become more and more clear
Many things are not within the circle of the speciality, our Christian faith, but in the realm of the practicality, which is for practice
If Paul could have passed through those seven days without any trouble, that would have proved that what he did was right
On some occasions Paul would say that we should eat; and on the other occasions he would say that we should not eat
Today many Christians are talking about the Body in Romans 12, but nearly all of them have neglected Romans 14
Also, when a brother comes and insists to only eat vegetables, we should say to him that we have no problems with it
He also said in verse 26, 'I consider then that this is good because of the present necessity, that it is good for a man to be as he is'
If the circumstances are such that it is good for you to be single and love the Lord with all that you are, that is proper
We do not know what will happen tomorrow in the church in Seattle or the next week in the church in Moses Lake
There is something better-the exercise of the spirit, the growth in life, the pray-reading, and the feeding on the Lord
We have seen that a good number of people were raised up by the gifts, and a good number of saints were edified by the teachings
If you hold the concept that the meetings have to be quiet, yet you get into a meeting that is noisy, do not be bothered
If your concept is to have a noisy meeting, a meeting that is full of praisings, and you come to a meeting that is quiet, do not be bothered
As to the matter of eating, whether a Christian brother eats this or another eats that, neither should criticize the other
Concerning the matter of eating things sacrificed to idols, Paul did not say yes or no; he only took care of the other's conscience
If we are special, if we are definite and specific in anything other than our faith, surely the oneness will be damaged
The main cause for the divisions among Christians is the neglect of caring for the generality of the church life
In the Old Testament in the book of Hosea there is a verse in which the Lord likened Ephraim to an unturned cake
We should be general, but still there are certain persons with whom we cannot be general, nor with whom we should be general
We think that if one loses his temper it is something serious; or if one commits something immoral it is more serious
If someone neglects to hear the church, we consider it almost as nothing because we do not have the church consciousness
Even though in the church life we must be general, certain ones in some things might not respect the church nor listen to it
Day by day we may say this; yet, still we are not over-emphasizing it because this is something specific in our Christian faith
He also says that if someone does not obey his word in this epistle, we should note that man and have no company with him
Only a local church that is proper, genuine, and normal has the position to apply verses such as Romans 16:17 and 2 Thessalonians 3:6, 14
Paul told us that a Christian brother or sister who practices any of these things has to be put away from among the church
Titus 310 says clearly that a man who is sectarian after he is admonished once or twice reject because division damages the Body of Christ
The apostles taught that Christ is the Son of God incarnated to be a man and that He is the One who gives us eternal life
If one of those will admit that Christ was resurrected, he will say that He was only resurrected spiritually, not physically
During the normal time in their history, all the Israelites in the Holy Land were one, taking Jerusalem as their unique center
Suppose that in Babylon most of the remaining Hebrews were spiritual, godly, even having some giants of spirituality among them
Suppose that those in Syria and Egypt were not as good as those in Babylon, but at least better than the returned ones
History tells us that not long after the return from captivity and the building of the temple, Christ came the first time
Regardless of how spiritual those in Babylon were, they were not the people with the proper standing for Christ to be born through them
Only the returned ones standing on the proper ground fulfilled God's purpose to rebuild the temple and to bring Christ to this earth
As long as we are standing on the proper ground with all the proper balances, we will be here until the Lord comes back
Among these people some teach that if you do not speak in tongues, you cannot receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit
During the last half century, almost no one was as prevailing as Brother Watchman Nee, but he never spoke in tongues
God's basic consideration and caring is only for Himself, for humanity, for Christ, and for the Body of Christ, the church
By reading these books, we have come to know about the different practices among Christians during the last nineteen hundred years
The history of the Lord's recovery shows that in the past four or five hundred years almost all the teachings have been recovered
The epistle to the church in Sardis in Revelation 3 refers prophetically to the church during the time of the Reformation
Today the situation of Christianity is almost like this: dressing people up and beautifying them, yet being short of life
If you check with them, asking what is life, and how can we grow in life, most would answer that they do not know
If one eats properly and sufficiently, the nourishment from the food will take care of all kinds of disease and weakness
If the saints feed on the Lord Jesus properly, after a certain time all the deadness will be swallowed up by life
In chapter fourteen of 1 Corinthians he said that when he comes to them again, if he comes speaking in tongues, what shall he profit them
In 1 Corinthians after Paul said, 'I gave you milk to drink,' he said, 'I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow'
He also declared that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit and that he who is joined unto the Lord is one spirit
The normal, proper thing is that we need all the teachings and also the gifts, but we need them for the growth in life
Paul, in the book of Ephesians, said, 'Until we all arrive at a full-grown man' -not a highly-educated man, but a full-grown man
If we practice this, we all will grow until we arrive at maturity, at a full-grown man, and no one among us will still be a babe
If we are going to eat something, we first of all need to know the nature, the element, the essence, of the food that we are going to eat
He is not only God, not only Man, not only our Redeemer, not only our Savior, not only our Lord; He is even the Spirit
In John chapter six, when the Lord said that He was the bread of life and that they must eat Him, the Jewish disciples were bothered
The Apostle Paul, in Ephesians, a book on the church, charged the believers to 'receive the word of God, by means of all prayer'
Many of today's Christians have itching ears wanting to hear teachings, but few of these teachings are healthy
If one does not care for his itching ears, but only for his hungry spirit, surely he will appreciate all these teachings
Neither is there a verse in this book that tells us we have to wait until something falls upon us from the heavens
When you come to the meeting, or when you are home, or when you are in other places, say something, prophesy, for the Lord
The concept of the Bible is that today the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit is in our spirit and we have a strong spirit
We do not only have a strong spirit; we also have a rich spirit because the Lord who is rich is within our spirit
If we do believe that the word in 1 Corinthians 14:31 is the word of God, we must receive it and put it into practice
Sometimes when we come to the meetings a little tired or even a little lazy we would ask the Lord to give us a vacation a rest from speaking
Many times when we feel tired and have the feeling that we cannot speak anything, there is still a kind of urging within to say something
On other occasions, you come to a meeting, thinking you have a word to speak, and speak it, but the word was a poor one
They begin to love one another, and as a result, one's shirt and shoes are upon the shoulders and feet of the other
Regardless of how much we love each other, we still must keep a distance of discernment in the spirit and be restricted
If for some reason a brother needs a shirt or a pair of shoes we have to love him and do something to meet his need but not in a fleshly way
Inside the envelope we may also put a note telling him that the enclosed money is from the Lord to him for purchasing a shirt
The envelope will be given to him by the church, and when he opens it and reads the designation he will be very much touched by the Lord
Genuine love was expressed toward the brother; and it was a glory to the Lord; yet, the whole thing was hidden from him
Materially, he could not know who gave him the gift, but spiritually he realized the love of the Lord in the giver towards him
Today when people speak about the Body ministry, they consider that two, three, or four ministering is the Body ministry
In Matthew 28:19, Mark 16:15, and Luke 24:47 we are told to go and preach, but in the Gospel of John we are told to go and bear fruit
If after a long period of time a married couple does not have children, this indicates that something is wrong
Although in a spiritual sense, some members that are brought forth may be crippled, blind, deaf, or lame, it is still good
Do not be troubled thinking that if we bring forth many, the church cannot take care of them and some will die
If we are proper, on one hand, we bring many unbelievers to the meetings and, on the other hand, we take care of several new believers
While Peter was suffering persecution in Jerusalem, he might have thought that Saul of Tarsus surely was going to hell
The church is not built up with the persons we intend to have, but with the persons God has chosen before the foundation of the world
We cannot predict whether our children, our parents, our cousins, our schoolmates, or our neighbors will be the church people
In Acts 8:1 we see that persecution came against the church in Jerusalem, thus scattering the saints and forcing them to migrate
Acts 11:19 shows that the scattered ones preached the gospel as they went, and some local churches were raised up
For the sake of the Lord's recovery, we should not be narrow sighted and only set our eyes on the local church in the city where we reside
