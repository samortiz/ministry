   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE TWO THE GOSPEL OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The gospel of God is the subject of the book of Romans 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christians are accustomed to saying that there are four gospels, the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, Paul also refers to his epistle to the Romans as a gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The gospel in the first four books of the New Testament concerns Christ in the flesh as He lived among His disciples before His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After His incarnation and before His death and resurrection, He was among His disciples, but not yet in them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The gospel in Romans concerns Christ as the Spirit, not Christ in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Romans 8 we see that the Spirit of life who indwells us is simply Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Christ in the four gospels was among the disciples; the Christ in Romans is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Christ in the four gospels is the Christ after incarnation and before death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As such, He is a Christ outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Christ in Romans is the Christ after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As such, He is the Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is something deeper and more subjective than the Christ in the gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Keep this one point in mind: that the gospel in Romans concerns Christ as the Spirit in us after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we only have the gospel concerning Christ as in the first four books of the New Testament, our gospel is too objective.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need the fifth gospel, the book of Romans, to reveal the subjective gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our Christ is not merely the Christ in the flesh after incarnation and before resurrection, the Christ who was among His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our Christ is higher and more subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is the Spirit of life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is such a subjective One.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Though John chapters 14 and 15 revealed that Christ will be in His believers, yet that was not fulfilled before His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The book of Romans is the gospel of Christ after His resurrection, showing also that He is now the subjective Savior in His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So, this gospel is deeper and more subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I. PROMISED IN THE SCRIPTURES</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This gospel was promised by God through the prophets in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that the gospel of God was not an accident; it was planned and prepared by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible shows us that this gospel was planned by God in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before the foundation of the world, God planned to have this gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So, numerous times in the Holy Scriptures, from Genesis through Malachi, God spoke in promise through the prophets regarding the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>CONCERNING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This gospel of God concerns a Person, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Of course, forgiveness, salvation, etc. are included in the gospel, but they are not the central point.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The gospel of God concerns the Person of the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This wonderful Person has two natures the divine nature and the human nature, divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A. Come Out of the Seed of David</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul mentions Christ s humanity first, not His divinity, saying that He was born out of the seed of David according to the flesh 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is His human nature, His humanity.</S>
