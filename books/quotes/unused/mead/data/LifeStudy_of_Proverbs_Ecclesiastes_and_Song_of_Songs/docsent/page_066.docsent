   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>As we will see when we come to the end of Song of Songs, the lover of Christ eventually sighs because she is still in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>She longs to be fully like Christ, who has absolutely nothing to do with anything of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She has been remade by God to be a new creation, yet according to God's economy, God has allowed a part of the old creation to remain with her.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may have some success in pursuing after Christ and may attain a certain amount of satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But then we may ask, "How can I maintain this?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How can I keep myself in this condition?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At this point the self comes in.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Self comes in under the false cloak of introspection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, self is constituted with introspection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Introspection is to examine yourself by looking into yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible teaches us to always look away unto Jesus Heb 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not look at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our self is not worthy to look at.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, every spiritual person who reaches a situation of satisfaction in Christ eventually falls into introspection, not only examining the self but also analyzing it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When I was a young believer, I looked at myself quite often.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I did not like to do anything that would not glorify the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But actually I was not caring for the Lord; I was caring for myself and for what others thought of me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Looking into ourselves in this way is the greatest weakness in the spiritual life and the greatest enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In helping others who are seeking to be spiritual, we may encourage them to pray and to confess their shortcomings to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such prayer and confession are normal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, in some cases we should encourage others to cease from confessing and simply believe that the blood of Jesus cleanses them and that God is faithful and righteous to forgive them 1 John 1:7, 9 , reminding them that God is faithful to honor Christ's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we are introspective, we may confess the same matter again and again, thinking that the more we confess, the more forgiveness we will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This kind of confession comes from the satanic self; it is the result of analyzing ourselves in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only the cross of Christ can deliver us from such a situation caused by introspection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we need to be called to be delivered from the self through our oneness with the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we become one with the cross, hiding ourselves in the clefts of the rock and in the covert of the precipice, we will be delivered from the self.</S>
