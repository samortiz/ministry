	 <h2 class="head1">THE RESULT OF THE GOSPEL REVIVALS<br />
OF TRADITIONAL CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>Since the time of the Reformation of Martin Luther, most of the gospel revivals in Christianity eventually were followed by a situation of death. At the beginning of the twentieth century, in 1904, there was a great revival in Wales in Great Britain. The leader of the revival was a worker in the coal mines. As a result of this revival, the theaters closed, and no one went to the sports events. The gospel was preached to such an extent that there was no place left to preach the gospel, because everyone was saved. This was a genuine revival. However, in less than thirty years the situation in Wales became cold and dead with no signs of the revival. Even though the gospel fever had reached a peak, only a few decades later almost no one in the second generation remained.</p>
<p>The revival in Wales is not the only example. Every gospel revival has had the same result. The Pentecostal movement began in America and was brought to China. A Chinese pastor in the southern part of Shantung Province joined the Pentecostals and led the Chinese Pentecostal movement from 1929 to 1930. There were many miracles, and they spread throughout northern China within a short time. However, by 1933 the Pentecostal movement no longer existed in most parts of northern China. Regretfully, this is the result of all revivals.</p>
<p>During the time of the Reformation, Protestantism began to emphasize the letter of the law and ordinances; therefore, the Lord raised up a group of believers in the Catholic Church in the 1600s called the mystics. Madame Guyon, who focused on the inner life, was one of these believers. Fifty years ago we received much spiritual help from their writings, and we translated some of their books. One of the books we translated was the autobiography of Madame Guyon. Today, however, not many in Christianity know about the mystics. Later, a group of people who emphasized the inner life continued the line of truth taught by the mystics, and they were prevailing for a period of time. We also received much help from these believers. The prominent believers of this group were William Law and Andrew Murray. However, even in America not many believers are interested in the writings of the inner-life believers.</p>
<p>As we study church history, we see that the way of the denominations is dead because they abandoned the home meetings and the small group meetings. If the home meetings and the small group meetings are healthy, the churches will not die; on the contrary, they will be living. Some Communist countries appear to be closed to Christianity. However, even though the missionaries have left these countries, there is still a small number of local believers who suffer persecution. Persecution does not cause the number of believers in these countries to decrease, because these believers meet in home meetings and small group meetings. They do not have pastors or preachers; they have only the small members. Everyone preaches in the homes and speaks in the homes. This is the way the gospel is spread.</p>
<p>Christianity has tried every method, but eventually the result was death. We are not an exception to this. In October 1984 we began to change the system because we saw our deadened condition. Changing the system was a revolution, but we were not overthrowing other people&rsquo;s lives; we were overthrowing our own lives. We must change. The young ones must change, and the older ones must change. We love the Lord and the church, but we are still unable to lead people to salvation. This is our situation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE STUDYING THE TRUTH<br />
IN THE HOME MEETINGS AND THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>The saints who are not in the meetings do not have peace, but if the meetings are held in the old way, the saints will not receive the supply to maintain them in their life and work. According to the old way, even after listening to messages for twenty to thirty years, the saints can only sit and listen to more messages. The saints have listened to too many messages. We must no longer remain in this situation. The Lord needs to gain a group of people who have intimate fellowship with Him and who live before Him. Furthermore, these people should have a meeting with their family at least once a week. They should also contact other families once a week or at least every other week and meet with the families they contact. In these meetings they should not merely sing hymns and praise the Lord; they should also study the truth together.</p>
<p>Shortly after we changed the system, we encouraged the saints to read <em>Truth Lessons.</em> Every lesson in <em>Truth Lessons</em> contains an outline and text that explains the outline. These lessons should not be read in a dead and formal way. Instead, we should read the lessons in a living way; we should pray-read them, read with emphasis, with repetition, with explanations, and even read them by singing. We need to use different ways for the contents of <em>Truth Lessons</em> to enter into us.</p>
<p>In the past the saints only listened to messages in the meetings. They listened to messages for thirty years but were unable to speak the truth. This can be compared to a person who goes to school for thirty years but still does not know simple arithmetic. It is difficult for a student to retain anything if he only listens to famous lecturers at school but is not required to do any homework. Our old method of meeting was unable to educate the saints. We must change our habit because it cannot meet the need.</p>
<p>We need to live before the Lord by fellowshipping with Him and studying the truth. The Lord &ldquo;desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth&rdquo; (1 Tim. 2:4). We need to know the Lord&rsquo;s new way. In the new way we gained many new ones through knocking on doors. If we want these new ones to remain, we must take proper care of them. This requires that we have home meetings. In addition, we need to read <em>Truth Lessons</em> in the small group meetings. We need to teach the truth so that everyone learns the truth. If we do this, we will spontaneously be able to speak the truth in the Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings, and we will be able to clearly expound justification and sanctification. There is no need for us to speak like a famous evangelist and give a long message. We simply need to speak in an ordinary way and explain that justification is God considering sinners to be righteous according to His standard of righteousness based on the redemption of Christ. It would be wonderful for all the saints to learn to speak in this way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONTINUING STEADFASTLY TO PRACTICE<br />
ALL THE ITEMS OF THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>Concerning knocking on doors, the saints may be able to go out every day for two or three weeks, but for the long run they will not be able to go out every day. Hence, we must fellowship concerning what to do for the long run. We need to develop the habit of using at least one evening a week either to preach the gospel by door-knocking or to care for the new ones in their home. We need to be persistent and do these things continually. If every saint baptizes two people every three months, we will be able to baptize eight people a year. However, we should not be too quick and baptize too many people. We must be sure that we can care for the new ones in a home meeting after their salvation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, as long as we all go out once a week to knock on doors, every saint should be able to baptize eight people a year. It may be that only two of the eight will remain and the remaining six will not remain, that is, that only one-fourth will remain. With this rate of growth, we will triple in one year. We should consider this. In our old way of meeting, it was not easy for us to gain one person in eight to ten years, and the ones whom we did gain did not always remain. With the new way, however, if we build up the habit of going out to contact people every week, in one year we can gain eight people, and one-fourth of these eight people, that is, two people, should remain. This is a two hundred percent rate of increase.</p>
<p>May the Lord gain a group of people among us who love Him, fellowship with Him, live before Him, experience Him daily, speak for Him, and speak Him forth when they come to the meetings. For this to happen, we must exercise to constantly live in fellowship with the Lord, to live and act before Him, and to labor upon Him so that we will be able to speak for Him in the meetings.</p>
<p>We must first meet in home meetings and then in small group meetings. In the small group meetings we should speak to one another about what we gained in our fellowship with the Lord and in our experience of Him. It may be that we are touched by the Lord after reading Matthew 18:20 in the morning. Then later in the day when we are in our small group meeting, we may speak with the saints and say, &ldquo;Brothers and sisters, this morning I read Matthew 18:20, where it speaks of being gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name, and I really appreciate the Lord&rsquo;s words. I feel that in our meeting we are gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name, and we are enjoying His presence. I also feel that when I come here to be with you, I am being gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name and I enjoy His presence.&rdquo; This may seem like an ordinary word, but if we all speak such a short, ordinary word, our speaking will be full of flavor. This should be our living.</p>
<p>In addition to the home meetings and the small group meetings, we also need to attend larger meetings, in which we either study the truth or listen to the testimonies of other saints in order to obtain a supply. If all the saints function in this way, the church will be living.</p>
<p>We have no intention of canceling the big meetings, but the church must have many different kinds of meetings. We need home meetings, small group meetings, district meetings, meetings in the halls, and meetings in which the entire church gathers together. If we have a large meeting facility, we can do many things and have different kinds of meetings there every week. May we all endeavor to meet in this way.</p>
