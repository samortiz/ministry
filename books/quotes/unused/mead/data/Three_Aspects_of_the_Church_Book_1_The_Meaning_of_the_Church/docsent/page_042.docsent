   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH 5 THE TABERNACLE 1 The Tabernacle</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we will see how the tabernacle typifies the church Exo 26:15-30; 36:20-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The tabernacle came into existence when the people of Israel left Egypt and came to Mount Sinai to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The tabernacle was the center of children of Israel, and the twelve tribes of Israel encamped around the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The tabernacle also was the means through which they served God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the people of Israel gathered together, they met at the entrance of the tabernacle 29:42 ; hence, the tabernacle was called the Tent of Meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a type, the tabernacle, or Tent of Meeting, bears four significances.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, the tabernacle typifies the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 1:14 says, The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Tabernacled in Greek means pitched a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The incarnation of the Lord Jesus was God s tabernacling among men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He dwelt among men through His tabernacling in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, the first significance of the tabernacle is that the Lord Jesus was manifested in the flesh among men.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just as the tabernacle was God s dwelling place for man to enter and meet God, so Christ is the dwelling place of God for man to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In other words, the incarnation of the Lord Jesus provided God with a tabernacle, a place for Him to dwell on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord s coming to the earth in the flesh was His becoming a tabernacle, in which God could dwell on the earth among men.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just as man was able to fellowship with God in the tabernacle, man was able to contact God in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second, the tabernacle typifies the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The tabernacle as God s dwelling place on earth is an exact portrait of the church as God s dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ephesians 2:22 says, In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This verse points out that the church is God s dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Moreover, the church is the enlargement of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Just as Christ is the tabernacle of God, so God s dwelling place on earth is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Third, the tabernacle typifies the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every saint is a temple of the Holy Spirit 1 Cor 6:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, the tabernacle also typifies the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Fourth, the tabernacle typifies the coming New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Revelation 21:3 clearly says that the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God with men; God will tabernacle with men there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In terms of the church as a whole, the church is the tabernacle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In terms of the members of the church, every believer is a tabernacle of God, a temple of God, a habitation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the future the totality of all God s redeemed throughout the ages will be a great tabernacle, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The New Jerusalem will be the habitation of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before this reality becomes manifest, there is a picture, a type in the Old Testament, which portrays how God will obtain a dwelling place, a tabernacle, on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this chapter, we will focus on the second significance of the tabernacle, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Base of the Tabernacle</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a tent, the tabernacle had a simple construction and thus required a solid base in order to stand firm.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The base of the tabernacle was composed of sockets made of the expiation silver spoken of in Exodus 30:11-16; thus, silver denotes redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The sockets made of the expiation silver typify that the base of the church, that is, the standing of the church before God, is the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Exodus says that each socket was a talent of silver 38:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One talent is approximately one hundred pounds, or forty-five kilograms cf.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rev 16:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There were one hundred silver sockets in the tabernacle, representing a significant amount of weight.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the silver sockets were not weighty, they would not have been able to stabilize the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>During the journeying of the children of Israel s journeying in the wilderness, the whole tabernacle would have blown away if the base of the tabernacle had not been stable.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, in order to stabilize the tabernacle, the silver sockets had to be very weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The tabernacle s ability to stand firm when it was erected depended on the silver sockets underneath.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This shows that the church has a standing, a base, before God, which is stable and unshakable and which cannot be swayed or shaken by any turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This base is Christ s redemption, typified by the silver sockets.</S>
