   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST AND CHRISTIANITY CHAPTER FIVE CHRIST VERSUS DOCTRINES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our Christian faith is based upon the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is different from all other religions which are attained through meditation, conjecture, and searching.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We believe that the Bible is God's revelation to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, it is His spoken word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We also believe that God has become a man, who is the very Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God, the Bible, and Jesus Christ constitute the basis of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE POSITION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us begin by looking at the position that Christ occupies in our faith, or we may say, in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, Christianity has been altered and is not what it ought to be.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the present we will not mention what Christianity ought to be.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, we will only draw a comparison between Christianity and other religions in order to see the distinctiveness of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We will not try purposely to exalt Christianity and debase other religions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We will only draw an objective comparison between them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, let us consider Confucianism.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, followers of Confucius never formally assert that theirs is a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Confucianism merely exercises great influence on Chinese culture, education, ethics, and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One thing, however, is certain: the teachings and doctrines of Confucius are of foremost importance, while the person Confucius is not as crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I do not mean that Confucianism has no concern for Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The man indeed was an extraordinary person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, in order to be a part of Confucianism, one only needs to understand the doctrines of Confucius, abide by his teachings, and be thoroughly acquainted with his books.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It does not matter whether one understands the man Confucius or not.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The principles, doctrines, and teachings of Confucius are the essence of the religion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE DOCTRINES OF BUDDHISM</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Next let us consider Buddhism.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The founder of Buddhism was Sakya Muni.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once he preached to his disciples about evil persons being reincarnated through the Wheel of Rebirth after death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is something that attracts man's attention.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But in all of Buddhism, the point of emphasis is doctrines and theories.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Concerning the man Sakya Muni, although he has a history and biography, they are something parenthetical.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They do not form the crux of Buddhism.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The center of the religion is not the man Sakya Muni.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whether there was such a person is unimportant to today's Buddhism.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All that is needed are the doctrines and teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>FOUNDERS ONLY LEFT THEIR DOCTRINES</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Other religions such as Taoism and Mohammedanism are all of the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After each founder set up a religion and left his teachings, doctrines, and regulations as the content of his religion, the founder himself was disassociated from the religion and had little to do with it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>CHRISTIANITY BUILT ON CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But our faith is entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From its outset, Christianity is built on the man Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not built on the doctrines and teachings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is amazing that when you open the Bible, you will not find too many chapters of doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Passages where pure doctrinal issues are expounded are rare and of less concern to people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What concerns one the most is the man Himself and what kind of person He is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All who have read the Bible know that the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth are not outstandingly voluminous.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His person draws our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He alone is the foundation of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The word Christ came from Greek, meaning the Anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to the Chinese, when a man takes up a task, he is given a letter of employment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Jewish equivalent of this is anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When God summons a person for a work, He pours oil on the person as a seal of commission.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ is the very God who was set apart to come to earth to be a man for the manifestation of God, in order that man may know God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ is the Anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is commissioned to such a task.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>CHRIST DEMANDS OTHERS TO BELIEVE IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Due to this basic distinction, Christ is different from the founders of other religions.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once He asked His disciples, "Who do you say that I am?"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Over and over again He demanded that His disciples believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He said that he who believes in the Son has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Again He said, "He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me" Matt 10:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Unless a man loves in this way, he is not worthy to be His disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Words such as these have been uttered only by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>No other religious leader ever said anything like that.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Confucius never said to Yen-weh or Tze-lu, "Believe in me," nor did he ever say, "Love me."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Neither did any of the other leaders, such as Sakya Muni or Mohammed, demand of their disciples faith in them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All it takes to be their disciples is to believe in their doctrines.</S>
