   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXERCISING WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 5:1-16 we see in the second place that Paul instructed Timothy to exercise wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His word not to upbraid an elderly man, but to entreat him as a father is a word of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is a matter of wisdom not to rebuke sharply an elderly man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In dealing with saints of different ages, we need not only love, but also wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to realize whom we are contacting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Are we speaking to an elderly brother or sister?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then we must speak to them as a son to a father or mother.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Are we contacting a younger brother or sister?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then we must speak to them as a brother to a brother or a brother to a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, we should speak one way to a father, another way to a mother, and in other ways to brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, in our human family we do not speak in the same way to all members of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not talk to our father in the same way as we do to our mother.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we speak the same way to all members of our family, we are indeed foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In all our relationships with saints of different ages we need wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we exercise wisdom, we shall speak differently to saints of different ages.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The brothers will talk to brothers in a way appropriate to brothers, but they will speak to sisters in a way appropriate to sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must not speak to a young sister in the same way as we do to an elderly man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, one sister may embrace another.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But a young sister should not show her love for a brother, young or old, by embracing him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not love the saints in a foolish way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, always exercise wisdom, realizing whom you are contacting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>IN ALL PURITY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Third, all our dealings with the saints must be "in all purity" 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every contact with the brothers and sisters in the church life must be pure in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to be pure in our motive and intention.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the contact between brothers and sisters there is especially the need for all purity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For this reason, a brother and sister who are close to the same age should not talk privately in a closed room.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Either another brother or another sister should be present.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Consider the example of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He spoke to Nicodemus in a house alone at night, but He talked to the Samaritan woman out in the open during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates that the contact between brothers and sisters must be in all purity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the church life the traffic in fellowship between brothers and sisters cannot be avoided.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not exercise all purity, we may fall into some kind of snare.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many have fallen into a snare because they were careless and failed to exercise purity in their contact with others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we would emphasize again and again that the contact between brothers and sisters must be in all purity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we have indicated, our contact with all the saints, brothers and sisters, elderly and young, must be pure in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In speaking to an elderly sister as a mother, you need to be pure in your motive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is evil to have impure motives.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To have an impure motive means to seek gain for ourselves, to seek some kind of advantage or promotion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In our contact with all the saints in the church life we should have just one motive to minister Christ to them that they may grow in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>DOING OUR DUTY</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The fourth point I would bring out in this message is the matter of our duty.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to be human, we need to exercise wisdom, we need to have all purity, and we need to do our duty.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the church life everyone must have certain duties to perform.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No one should be idle or a busybody.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In 5:4 Paul says, "But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show godliness toward their own household and to render a return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Return here denotes requital, recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To render such a return is to show gratitude to one's parents.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In verse 13 Paul speaks of those who "learn to be idle, going around from house to house; and not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some are idle, seemingly having nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But their idleness causes them to become busybodies.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They go around from house to house gossiping and "speaking things which they ought not."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No one in the church should be idle, and no one should be a gossip or a busybody.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead, everyone should have something to do, some proper duty to perform.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Realizing the need for all the saints to do their duty, Paul tells Timothy not to allow a widow to be enrolled who is under sixty years old v. 9 . He then tells Timothy to refuse younger widows, for they may set aside their first pledge, or faith vv.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Setting aside "their first pledge" means to break a pledge or promise.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This indicates that some younger widows promised, pledged, to devote themselves in their widowhood to some service of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In verse 14 Paul goes on to say, "I will therefore that younger widows marry, bear children, rule the house, give no occasion to the opposer for reproach."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Childbearing and house affairs are a rescue and safeguard to idle busybodies.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is God's ordination to restrict and protect women since the fall Gen 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Paul's word in verse 14 about younger widows marrying is somewhat of a contrast to what he says in 1 Corinthians 7:8.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The word in 1 Corinthians was Paul's wish in his earlier ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In 5:14 we have his advice in his later ministry, according to his experiences concerning young widows.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The difference here indicates that even in his God-inspired teachings, Paul was not legal.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the contrary, he could be very flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This indicates that, in the New Testament, concerning some matters there is no legality.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In certain cases, the way we take may vary according to the actual situation.</S>
