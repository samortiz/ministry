[1]  It includes forgiveness and cleansing of sins, redemption from the demands of the law, reconciliation to God, sanctification, justification, freedom from bondage, regeneration, and much more!
[2]  But now we have many experiences of the life of God because the moment we were regenerated, His life came into us.
[3]  Originally we were born of our parents, but now we are born once more, this time of God.
[4]  WHAT WE RECEIVE THROUGH REGENERATION The Life of God
[5]  The first and primary thing we receive through regeneration is the life of God.
[6]  All that God is and all that is in God, are in the life of God.
[7]  The divine nature of God is also contained within the life of God.
[8]  After regeneration our heart is soft toward God, and our spirit is alive toward God.
[9]  When God regenerated us, He put His life into our spirit, enlivening our dead spirit, and He also put His Spirit into our spirit.
[10]  These two verses show us that the Spirit of God dwelling in us is the Spirit of Christ dwelling in us and the Spirit of Christ dwelling in us is Christ Himself dwelling in us.
[11]  Since Christ is the embodiment of God, and since regeneration causes us to receive Christ, it also causes us to have God.
[12]  When it mentions Christ dwelling in us, the emphasis is on His living in us as our life Gal 2:20 , and when it mentions God dwelling in us, the emphasis is on His working in us Phil 2:13; Heb 13:21; 1 Cor 12:6 .
[13]  "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead" 1 Pet 1:3 .
