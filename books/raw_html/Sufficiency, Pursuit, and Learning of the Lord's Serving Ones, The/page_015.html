         <h2 class="head1">LACKING SPIRITUAL PURSUIT</h2>
<p>Although we serve regularly and coordinate, we have only an outward form. Our personal spiritual life might also be merely an outward form. Our experiences of fellowshipping with the Lord and touching Him through pray-reading and prayer can become an outward form. This outward form is an empty shell because we have lost our living pursuit of the Lord. The Bible shows that we cannot stop pursuing the Lord, because the Lord is inexhaustible (Deut. 8:7-9; Eph. 3:8). His riches are boundless and unlimited, and His breadth, length, height, and depth, like the dimensions of the universe, are unsearchable (v. 18).</p>
<p>When the apostle Paul was in prison, he said, &ldquo;Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue&rdquo; (Phil. 3:12). In verse 13 he said, &ldquo;I do not account of myself to have laid hold; but one thing I do: Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before.&rdquo; His fresh and unlimited spiritual pursuit caused him to forsake all that he had gained in the past, all that was old, so that he could gain Christ to the fullest extent. Paul not only forsook his past experiences in Judaism; he also did not linger in his past experiences of Christ. As one who ran the race, Paul knew only to run forward. He did not look back.</p>
<p>Our problem is that we linger in what we gain, and we treasure our experiences. For example, a brother who gains some knowledge concerning the cross lingers in that knowledge. However, genuine spiritual experiences include leaving behind what we have gained. When we pass through something, we must put it aside. This is to run the race. If we do not run in this way, we will run in circles and will not advance. The apostle ran the race; he pursued by forgetting what was behind and stretching forward to what was before.</p>
<p>Some saints have seen and gained something, but their tone is different from that of the apostle Paul. Paul said, &ldquo;Not that I have already obtained,&rdquo; but some of the serving ones boldly claim to have gained something, as if they have reached the ultimate destination, and they do not have any more goals. In Ephesians Paul saw a very high vision, but after that, he still said, &ldquo;Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue.&rdquo; Even though Christ and the power of His resurrection are both familiar topics in our messages, we need to endeavor to pursue and to experience these boundless riches.</p>
<p>We must see the enemy&rsquo;s twofold scheme. On the one hand, he uses discouragement to destroy our appetite to pursue, and on the other hand, he uses self-conceit and self-contentment to stop us from being desperate. In the end, there is no genuine pursuing. The main symptom of our problem is that we lack an earnest pursuit because we are either self-abased or self-contented.</p>
<p>Song of Songs is a book in the Bible that focuses on pursuing. From the first chapter, Song of Songs speaks of pursuing. It says, &ldquo;Draw me; we will run after you&mdash; / The king has brought me into his chambers&mdash; / We will be glad and rejoice in you; / We will extol your love more than wine. / Rightly do they love you&rdquo; (1:4). In verse 7 the seeker cries out from the depths of her being, and says, &ldquo;Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock?&rdquo; Within the seeker there is a longing to pursue. Debates and research cannot help us to pursue. The elders need to lead the saints to have a living pursuit. We must genuinely pursue the Lord. Discouragement causes us to stop pursuing, and self-satisfaction also causes us to stop pursuing. Our urgent need is to pursue the Lord. If we do not pursue the Lord, we cannot give messages concerning pursuing the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A FRESH AND LIVING ENJOYMENT</h2>
<p>Undoubtedly, we need to know how to work; that is, we need the skills to work. Some saints work diligently, but there is no result. They can be compared to a hen that lays eggs that do not hatch. However, when a different co-worker joins them, there are results. This is a matter of knowing how to work. Caring for flowers and plants is an example. When Brother A cares for a plant, it withers and dies in a couple of months, but when Brother B cares for the same plant, it blooms and bears fruit. This is a matter of skill. In spiritual service, however, the primary matter is not skill but whether or not we are living. The key to being living lies in our enjoying the Lord, having fresh fellowship with Him, entering into His presence, and pursuing Him daily.</p>
<p>Some co-workers are eloquent when they preach the gospel, but not many people are touched. When Brother James M&rsquo;Kendrick, who wrote <em>Seen and Heard,</em> gave his first message, he could not utter one word, but he had a fervent heart to save sinners. He stood at the podium and could not stop his tears. This touched the audience. He did not know how to give a message, but he had a burden for the gospel. We should not rely on our gift. Gifts are superficial. Our gift should be developed from life, but many saints treat gifts as an outward matter. We should not overvalue a gift.</p>
<p>Those who have a genuine spiritual pursuit are beside themselves. On the morning of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection Mary went to the tomb to find the Lord. She was not as clear-headed as Peter and John. When Peter and John went to the tomb and saw that the tomb was empty, they became clear that Jesus had resurrected, and they went away to their own home. Mary, however, knew only to seek the Lord; she did not care for the empty tomb or the handkerchief. She knew that the Lord was not there, and she wanted to see the Lord (John 20:1-13). This seems to have been a foolish pursuit. Nevertheless, genuine pursuit is foolish. To have a genuine pursuit is to be desperate before the Lord to the extent that we care for nothing but meeting the Lord.</p>
<p>A brother who genuinely pursues the Lord might stand up in a meeting and say that the other saints are able to gain something when they pursue the Lord, but he does not seem to gain anything. This word is weighty. Or he may say that he has been pursuing the Lord but cannot touch Him and that he cannot give a good message, but he can testify of the Lord&rsquo;s love. Such a word brings in an atmosphere of spiritual pursuit and a sense of the Lord&rsquo;s love. I once heard a brother give a message in which he arrogantly told the congregation that they were not spiritual. When we speak concerning the spiritual condition of others, we should be desperate. It is not right to merely shake one&rsquo;s head and say, &ldquo;We are not doing well; we are not doing well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our speaking should bring the saints to tears so that they can touch the Lord. Do not think that declaring &ldquo;I have seen Christ!&rdquo; will cause the saints to touch Him. We should be able to lead the saints to touch the Lord even without mentioning Christ. If we see that our prayer is powerless, that we do not know how to lead the meetings, and that our spiritual pursuit seems futile, we will have a heavy burden when we speak concerning our condition. This is the way to lead the saints to touch Christ.</p>
<p>If we truly want others to touch the Lord, there is no need to shout that we have seen Christ. Similarly, declaring that we need to live in Christ will not cause others to live in Christ. It is not a matter of shouting slogans or making declarations. Even if a brother does not feel that he has seen much, if he has a heart to pursue and is not self-abased or proud, when he tells the saints that he still does not know our glorious Lord, the saints will meet Christ and touch something spiritual.</p>
<p>It is not necessarily our testimony that will touch others. Rather, our words will indicate that there is something within us. Our words will show that we have the desire to forget that which is behind and stretch forward to that which is ahead so that we may know Christ. This principle can be applied to all our service.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
