	<h2 class="head2">Not Being Stopped by the Unpromising Ones</h2>
<p>You should not stay in any home over thirty minutes. Set up a rule to visit at least four families when you go out for two hours. Going out for three hours, you must visit six families. Sometimes we are not so wise because we got stuck with one family for the entire time and we caught nothing. Our time was occupied with vain talk and was wasted. Within fifteen or twenty minutes you will realize whether or not this person is promising. If he is not, leave in a polite way and make an appointment with him for the next meeting. Then go to the next door. Maybe in the first hour you would knock on four doors and not one is promising. But in the second hour, you may have two doors which are very promising and you may baptize two people. This means that you are not stopped by the four unpromising families. If you would leave the unpromising ones and go on to knock on other doors, you will find a promising home. The more doors you knock on, the more chances you would have to gain a home.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Exercising Our Spirit and Faith with Boldness</h2>
<p>Remember to exercise your spirit. Do not just exercise your spirit at the time you talk. Before you go, you have to pray. Go to knock on doors always by exercising your spirit. Faith is not in our mind; faith is in our spirit (2 Cor. 4:13). If we only exercise our mind, faith is gone. Exercise your spirit to believe. Believe that the door will be opened to you. Believe that the persons will be convinced. Believe that persons will believe. You have to exercise your spirit and faith with boldness. Use the booklet up to a certain point; even five minutes of reading would be too much. While the person is reading, exercise your spirit to pray something from within&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, catch this one. Lord, touch this one. Lord, open him up that I may lead him into prayer.&rdquo; Then the Lord will answer your prayer, and this one may say, &ldquo;Not bad.&rdquo; That is a sign that it is the time for you to take the lead to bring this person into prayer. You have to do this in boldness. When you pray, he would not pray, yet you must exercise your boldness to say, &ldquo;Follow me. What I say, you say.&rdquo; Do not ask him, but give him a kind of commandment. Tell him to follow you to pray. Most people would follow you, and most people would repeat what you say in prayer. Then after the prayer, direct him to be baptized.</p>
<p>You have to exercise your faith. If you believe, then the person you are talking to will believe. Too many times it was not that they would not believe, but that we would not believe. In my natural life, I am a timid person. It is hard for me to talk to people and at a certain time to pray with them. But I learned the lesson to exercise my spirit to talk to people and at a certain point to pray with them. When the person says that he does not know what to pray, just ask him to say what you say. Make it so simple. With boldness take the lead to bring people into the spirit to contact the Lord. After they pray, say, &ldquo;Let us be baptized.&rdquo; Then one of the helpers would say, &ldquo;This is very good!&rdquo; And the young sister would go to the wife to say, &ldquo;Let us fill up the bathtub with water for the baptism.&rdquo; The Bible never tells us in any case that people should wait to be baptized. When Saul was waiting, Ananias said, &ldquo;Why do you delay? Rise up and be baptized...&rdquo; (Acts 22:16). You have to stand on the fact that your new contact prayed to receive the Lord. If you would bring Him into baptism and he would call on the name of the Lord, he would complete the steps for salvation (Mark 16:16; Acts 22:16). After he is baptized, you need to go to visit him regularly so that the life within him can grow, develop, blossom, and bear fruit.</p>
<p>You may feel that this fellowship is legal, but there is even a law in maintaining our human life. Are you going to get air? You need to breathe. Breathing is very legal. If you say that you do not like this legality, this means that you do not want to breathe. If you do not want to breathe, you will expire. What we have shared in this chapter is the way to bring people into salvation. It is a very short way and very living. People will believe not because of miracles but because of touching the Spirit. After a person is saved in this way, it would be very easy for us to bring him on in the divine life. If you bring people in through blessings, through miracles, or through happiness, later it would be hard for you to turn them to the spirit. You would have a poor start, a wrong start. All the elders in all the churches need to put all these points into practice. May all of us rise up and exercise our spirit to form the visiting teams and to practice the new way of gospel preaching.</p>
