	 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE MULTIFACETED CHURCH LIFE</h1>
<p>The Gospel of John and the book of Colossians are two books in the Bible that speak of Christ as life in a clear and definite way. These two books use plain words, not types or parables, to speak concerning life. In the Gospel of John the Lord said, &ldquo;I am...the life&rdquo; (11:25). The Lord did not say, &ldquo;I am your life.&rdquo; Hence, in this verse He spoke of life from an objective aspect, not according to the subjective experience of the believers. However, in Colossians Paul says, &ldquo;Christ our life&rdquo; (3:4). This is not only a fact; it is also related to the subjective experience of the believers.</p>
<p>When we consider our history, we see that, according to scriptural principles, the Lord has led us along a comprehensive path. Not only are there facts, but there are also subjective experiences. In this message I am not emphasizing facts; I am emphasizing experience. For many years the Lord has given us a comprehensive leading. We have studied many Christian groups to see their strengths and their weaknesses. When we compared our observations to our experience, we learned that the Lord&rsquo;s way, which is the same as the way shown in the Bible, is multifaceted.</p>
<p>The revelation contained in the sixty-six books of the Bible is multifaceted. For example, the four living creatures mentioned in Ezekiel are also in Revelation. Each of the four living creatures has four faces: at the front is the face of a man; on the right, the face of a lion; on the left, the face of an ox; and at the back, the face of an eagle. What are the four creatures? Are they men, lions, oxen, or eagles? Based on the revelation in the Bible, we can say that the four living creatures are multifaceted.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES<br />
THE PROBLEMS IN THE CHURCH BEING DUE TO<br />
A LACK OF MULTIFACETEDNESS</h2>
<p>Christians throughout the centuries, especially Christian leaders, have been prone to make the mistake of not being multifaceted. Christians can be compared to the four living creatures; they have the aspect of being a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle. Some Christians, however, emphasize only the aspect of being a man, and they kick aside the lion, slaughter the ox, and chase away the eagle. Anything that such a Christian suggests is disapproved by the believers who are lions, opposed by those who are oxen, and denied by those who are eagles. In the end, only the believers who emphasize being a man accept this narrow emphasis. Similarly, some Christians are lions, and they devour, chew up, and even step on everyone else. The result of this is only failure. We need to see the problems in church history so that we may appreciate our need to be multifaceted.</p>
<p>Seven or eight years ago I finished writing the biography of Brother Nee in English, but because of the Spirit&rsquo;s forbidding, I delayed its publication. In 1981 I held trainings in Hong Kong and in Taipei on church history. As I stood at the podium, I realized that there were many things that I could not speak about, because I would expose the errors and weaknesses of many saints. I had no feeling in my spirit to mention many names or events, even though these were things that I had personally experienced, seen, and even suffered. They were not things that I had merely heard about. The purpose of these events in our history was for no other reason than to allow us to see light and to learn many lessons. Many of the problems that we have experienced in our history were because some of the brothers did not have the view of being multifaceted.</p>
<p>Brother Nee was saved in 1920, and in 1922 he began to have the church life. He continued in the church life until he was imprisoned in 1952. He practiced the church life for about thirty years. Most of the experiences that I passed through were with him. I saw saints enter the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and within a very short time they had problems. Some saints did not have problems, but they left and started their own groups. In 1949 I came to Taiwan, and in 1952 I began to hold formal trainings until 1982. That was another thirty years. During those thirty years I did not merely observe problems and storms. I experienced them and even became the target of the storms, because all the arrows were directed at me. During our first thirty years, Brother Nee was the target of the storms, and I was shielded under him as a great umbrella. But after thirty years the umbrella was gone, and I became the target. All the storms were centered on me. I have experienced many situations.</p>
<p>These storms occurred because there was a lack of being multifaceted. All the ones who created problems, who came into our midst and then went out from us, loved the Lord. However, some were men, some were lions, some were oxen, and some were eagles. They could not come together with one another. Humanly speaking, how can a man and a lion stay together? How can lions and eagles get along? It is impossible. But in Christ all things are possible. The center of the four living creatures is Christ. In Christ, men, lions, oxen, and eagles can all come together and be one. Christ is the center, and He is multifaceted.</p>
