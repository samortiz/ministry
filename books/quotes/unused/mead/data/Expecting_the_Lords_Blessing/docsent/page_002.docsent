   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We must notice something in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why does the Lord do two miracles that are almost the same in nature and in action?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I am afraid it is because this lesson is not easy to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why does He feed the five thousand and then feed the four thousand?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Two miracles of almost identical nature are repeated twice in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must learn this lesson, but it is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many people still do not look to God's blessing, but instead look at the few loaves in their own hands!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The loaves in our hands are so pitifully few, but we still base our plans on them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more we plan in this way, however, the harder the work becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes it becomes impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am somewhat comforted by the words spoken by a brother one hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He said, "When the Lord wants to work a small miracle, He puts me in a difficult situation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He wants to work a great miracle, He puts me in an impossible situation."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our situation is difficult, and it even seems impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many times it is really hard, and we are like the little boy with just a few loaves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can only hope for a miracle, and this miracle is the Lord Himself taking them up and blessing them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brothers and sisters, the miracles are produced by the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His blessing changes and multiplies the loaves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The miracles are based on the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When there is a miracle, five thousand or four thousand people are fed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Without a miracle, even two hundred or five hundred denarii worth of bread are not enough to satisfy that many people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord was training the disciples, bringing them to the point of looking to Him for His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many times we do not have the capacity to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The outward environment is difficult, even impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If our eyes are fixed on the circumstances, we will not have any way to deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, the Lord repeatedly brings us through.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These times are the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we have blessing, everything goes well and nothing is difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without the Lord's blessing, everything goes wrong and nothing is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord wants to bring us to a point where His blessing takes the first place, a point where we have never been.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Lord brings us to such a point, He will have a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the Lord does not bring us to this point, we will have to say that even two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today the problem is that we cannot meet the need in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All of our money combined is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All of us combined is insufficient, but the Lord has a way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Lord's work, the basic problem is the Lord's blessing; nothing else matters.</S>
