Everyone who belongs to the Lord has his portion and has Christ living within. Everyone has received something special, and this becomes the special portion of his service. We serve the Body with what we have received of Christ.</p><p>Our portion of service in the Body of Christ is based on our knowledge of Christ. This knowledge is not a common knowledge; common knowledge is not enough. Only by having a specific knowledge of Christ can we have a specific ministry to serve the Body of Christ. Our special service is based on our special knowledge of Christ. We can only serve after we have learned something that others have not learned, something special from the Lord, some special knowledge of Christ. The eyes see, the ears hear, and the nose smells. Every part has a special function. It is not necessary for all the members to see, hear, or smell. Yet every member has something special that they can do; that is their ministry. What is our special ministry? It is what we have learned from the Lord, what we have acquired in a particular way from Him. Once we have a special knowledge of Christ, that knowledge becomes our particular ministry. Only those who have a special ministry can serve the Body and cause the Body to grow. Only that which comes from above can cause the Body to grow. Only after we have learned something from the Lord can we transmit the life of the Head to the Body, and only then can we supply the church with what it does not have. Therefore, every member must press on continually and must receive from the Lord what the Body has not yet received and transmit that to the Body of Christ. Today the Lord is seeking men into whom He can dispense His life and through whom the life of the Body can grow. Through these ones the church will receive a measure of life which it has not yet received. The measure of the church's stature will increase, and they will become a channel of life to the Body. When the life which they have received from the Lord flows out to others, the stature of the Body of Christ grows. God is increasing the stature of the Body of Christ through the members.</p><p>The meaning of serving the Body of Christ is to receive life from the Head for the supply of the Body. It is to transmit the life that is in the Head to the church. When the eyes see, the body sees. The eyes supply the body with their seeing; this is what it means to serve as members. The hands cannot detect the smell of an object; it takes the nose to serve the body with its smelling function. Smell is the specific ministry of the nose. The ears serve the body with their hearing. Hearing is the specific ministry of the ears. The result of the work of every ministry is the growth of the stature of the Body. In other words, it is the Body gaining more of Christ. The ministry of the members is the ministry of Christ to the church; it is to dispense Christ to others.</p><p>Service in the Body of Christ is based on the knowledge of Christ, and this knowledge does not come from doctrines; rather, it comes from the experience of life. One great problem is that many people replace life with doctrines. Doctrines are useless. Even if one becomes very familiar with doctrines and can recite and speak about them, he can still be completely blind and ignorant. A man does not receive help through understanding doctrines. Understanding doctrines only provides more thoughts for the mind. God needs life to express the doctrines. God first gives us life, and then He gives us the doctrines. This is true in both the Old Testament and New Testament.</p><p>God first gained Abraham as a man of faith. When others see Abraham, they see the doctrine of faith. Abel saw that man could not come to God without the shedding of blood. Hence, Abel carries with him the doctrine of justification in the blood (Rom. 5:9).</p><p>First there is life, and then there is the doctrine. First there is the problem, and then there is the solution. First there is the experience, and then there is the doctrine. Martin Luther went through painful experiences in search of justification. One day God showed him that man is justified by faith. Through faith he was justified. Later we were given the doctrine of justification by faith. First there is life, and then there is doctrine.</p><p>We must never spend all our time in researching, analyzing, or studying doctrines. These are works of reeds; they will not help us when we are faced with real difficulties. The only things that will be of any use to us are the experiences that God brings us through. Experience must come first; then doctrine can follow.</p><p>The New Testament begins with the Gospels. The Epistles are after the Gospels. The Gospels tell us what Christ did, and the Epistles explain the reasons. First there are the experiences of Christ, and then there are the doctrines of Christ. First we have the life of Christ, and then we have the teachings of Christ.</p><p>If a man does not have a special knowledge of Christ, he cannot have a ministry. A man will have a ministry only after he receives something special from Christ. Whatever special function a member has becomes the ministry of that member. The hand has its special functions, and these special functions become its ministry. God allows all kinds of pain, discipline, and trial to come upon us in order to constitute us with His word and so that we can have something to give to the Body. Other than Christ and other than life, nothing will minister to the Body of Christ. Christ is life, and the church will be built up only when Christ is supplied to it. Those who do not have life can kill a prayer meeting even when they say, "Amen." In contrast, those who have life can supply a prayer meeting with a simple word of "Amen." When a person of life sits in a meeting, others will feel the life. The measure of knowledge of Christ determines the amount of life supplied to the church.</p><p>Today God is looking for men. He wants to deposit great measures of Christ's life into them so that they can become a supply to others. Life requires a channel. God wants man to become a channel of life, through whom life can be transmitted to the Body. If life stops in you, you will not be able to supply others with life, and the church will suffer loss. You will be spreading death, not supplying life to the church. Failures of individuals invariably cause damage to the church. This is why all the members suffer when one member suffers in the Body of Christ. You may fail or neglect your prayer in your private room, but the Body will be the one who suffers. Every member affects everyone else. We must not live by ourselves; we must hold to the Head and seek fellowship. Before we make any decision, we should first seek fellowship. Everything has to be in the Body, through the Body, and for the Body. We should do things in the Body and not as individuals. We should do things through the Body and not through individuals, and we should do things for the Body and not for individuals. May God open our eyes to see the Body, and may we serve the church with our ministry, a ministry which comes from our knowledge of Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_075.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_077.html">Next</a> </body></html>
