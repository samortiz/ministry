   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Through the Watering on the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>by Its Gifted Members</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church grows through eating, and also through the watering on the Body of Christ by its gifted members 1 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We believers are living plants who have been planted into Christ 1 Cor 3:6a, 9b .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is our good ground, our earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is the rich soil into which we have been planted and in which we grow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once a plant has been planted, it needs to be watered.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Southern California used to be very dry with very little plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then southern California began to receive water from the state of Nevada, and the result is that it has become very green and beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The sprinklers in many yards in southern California water the lawns to keep them green and growing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In a spiritual sense, we need such watering so that we may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul said, I planted, Apollos watered 1 Cor 3:6a .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need the watering by the gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For our spiritual growth, we need the food that the Word provides, and we also need the watering that the gifted ones provide.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you are in the meetings of the church, you will be blessed with much watering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Regardless of how much time you spend reading the Bible in your home, it cannot replace the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some saints may become unhappy with the elders or with some brother or sister in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They may reason, I do not need to go to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have the Bible, so I will stay home and read my Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord is omnipresent, so I will dedicate the meeting time to stay at home and read my Bible for two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, they will find that such an attempt leaves them short of the great benefit received in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may say that you do not like the meeting, but whether you like the meeting or not, the sprinklers are there sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Regardless of how much you endeavor to get something in your home away from the meeting, there is no sprinkler watering you in your home.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church meeting may not seem so good to you, but you will still be watered in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sometimes some saints may sleep in the meeting, but they still experience the watering.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the meetings of the church, we are always dealing with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we have fellowshipped, God the Spirit is totally involved with this book.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we go to the meetings of the church, we are always touching His Word, so we are always receiving something of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some have said to me, Brother Lee, you should not ask the saints to read so many verses.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It seems that sometimes there are fifty verses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I responded that even fifty verses is not that many.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Psalm 119 has one hundred seventy-six verses.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It would be wonderful if we could read this entire psalm in some meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Years ago, when the saints were still meeting at Elden Hall in Los Angeles, they came together for a prayer meeting and pray-read the entire book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The saints who were in that meeting testified how wonderful it was.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we are in the meetings of the church, we get thoroughly watered because we are under the sprinkling, the watering.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The gifted members of the Body of Christ, the servants of God, are like the sprinklers on the lawns; they have the ability to sprinkle us with water.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more they talk to us about the Bible, the more they sprinkle us with water.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can testify that when we come to a ministry meeting and listen to the speaking of the gifted persons with all the Bible verses, we can never be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whether or not we understand everything, we always go away from such meetings with the water of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I do not have much knowledge in fields other than the Bible, but by the Lord s mercy, I somewhat know this holy book.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I can open this book and water the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>My speaking in the ministry of God s word is the sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to come to the meetings of the church and of the ministry to take a shower or a bath in the water of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Through the Giving of Growth in Life</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>to the Members of Christ by God</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The intrinsic growth of the church is through the giving of growth in life to the members of Christ by God 1 Cor 3:6c .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The gifted ones may do the planting and the watering, but it is God who gives the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why I must always take some time to pray before I come to speak in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I pray that the Lord would be one with me and infuse me with Himself so that whatever I speak would be in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I believe He has richly answered these prayers because quite often, as I am speaking, I feel supplied within to speak with new light and instant utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need the feeding from the Bible directly, and we need the watering from the ones who know the Bible more.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God goes along with our reading of the Word and with the speaking of the gifted members to give us the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The feeding and the watering are the top means used by Him to give His life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we get into the Word, we are feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we get under the speaking of the word, we receive the watering.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then God gives the growth.</S>
