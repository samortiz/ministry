   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTY-ONE THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF CHRIST 1 Date: August 4, 1937</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Singapore</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading: Rom 4:25; Heb 9:22; Lev 17:11; Exo 12:13; Acts 17:31 THE TWO ASPECTS OF GOD'S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have already seen the purpose of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's original goal is for man to have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, man fell and complicated God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today God not only needs to give life to man, but He also must deal with the things that prevent Him from reaching His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, God's work in us has two aspects: The first aspect remedies man's shortcomings, whereas the second aspect fulfills His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The remedial aspect deals with sins, which hinder man, whereas the fulfilling aspect dispenses God's life into man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In reading through the Bible, we can see that God's work has two aspects and that they are both accomplished through the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus said that no sign or miracle would be given except the sign of Jonah Matt 12:39; 16:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The sign of Jonah points to death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is a miracle?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A miracle is something that God alone can perform.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Aside from death and resurrection, there is no other sign.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's work is altogether centered around death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The death and resurrection of Christ have four aspects two are negative, and two are positive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The two negative aspects of death and resurrection are for dealing with sins; the two positive aspects of death and resurrection are for dispensing God's life to man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These four aspects of death and resurrection enable us to reach God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this conference, we hope to see the relationship between these four aspects of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Tonight, for the sake of clarity, we will only touch these four aspects in a brief way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This will give us a clear picture as we consider each one in detail later.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE FOUR ASPECTS OF</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The death and resurrection of Christ have four aspects: First, the substituting death and resurrection; second, the identifying death and resurrection; third, the releasing death and resurrection; fourth, the denying death and resurrection, that is, the self-denying death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Bible these four aspects of death and resurrection are distinct and different.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we are not clear concerning these four aspects of death and resurrection, our work will only produce confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The substituting and identifying death and resurrection are for dealing with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The releasing and self-denying death and resurrection are for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can consider Christ's death in these four aspects: substituting, identifying, releasing, and denying.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the future we also will look at resurrection in these four aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These four aspects of death and resurrection are my subject in this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brothers and sisters, do not think that these four aspects of death and resurrection are too difficult to comprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you consider them carefully, you will see that the first two aspects are for dealing with sins and the last two aspects are for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Bible the first aspect of death is denoted by the blood, the second by crucifixion, the third by the flesh, and the fourth by the bearing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible shows us the blood, the crucifixion, the flesh, and the bearing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These four things are the various aspects of the work of Christ.</S>
