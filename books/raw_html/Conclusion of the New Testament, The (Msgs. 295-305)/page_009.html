 <h2 class="head3">4. The Factor of Our Justification</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. Delivered on the Cross because of Our Offenses<br />
to Satisfy God&rsquo;s Righteous Requirements</h2>
<p>In Romans 4:25 we see that Christ is the factor of our justification: &ldquo;Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification.&rdquo; This verse first tells us that Christ was delivered up to die on the cross because of our offenses. This means that because we have offenses against God, Christ was delivered on the cross for us in order to satisfy God&rsquo;s righteous requirements. Since the death of Christ has fulfilled and fully satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirements, we are justified by God through His death (3:24).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Raised because of Our Justification</h2>
<h2 class="head5">(1) As a Proof of God&rsquo;s Satisfaction<br />
for God to Accept Us</h2>
<p>Romans 4:25 goes on to say that God raised Him from the dead for our justification. If God had not been satisfied with Christ&rsquo;s offering for us, how could God have raised Him from the dead? God&rsquo;s raising Christ is a strong proof that God was satisfied with Christ&rsquo;s dying for us and that we are justified by God because of Christ&rsquo;s death. Now God can accept us through Christ.</p>
<p>Suppose that Christ died for us and for our sins and was buried in the tomb but was not resurrected by God. If this were the situation, we could not believe that His death was accepted by God and that it satisfied God&rsquo;s requirements and fulfilled His desires. However, Christ is not in the tomb. God raised Him up from the dead, and He came back in resurrection. This is a strong proof that God has accepted His death for us, that His death satisfied God&rsquo;s requirements and fulfilled whatever God wanted Him to do for us. Therefore, the resurrection of Christ is the proof of our justification by God. In Christ, the resurrected One, we are justified.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) As the Resurrected Life for Us to Live a Life<br />
Justified by God and Acceptable to God</h2>
<p>Christ was raised not only as a proof that God accepted us through Christ but also as the resurrection life for us to live a life justified by God and acceptable to God. The resurrected Christ is in the third heavens at the right hand of God as conclusive evidence that all of God&rsquo;s requirements have been satisfied and that we have been thoroughly and adequately justified. However, this resurrected Christ is not only in the heavens but also within us to impart life that we may have a life of justification. By believing in Him, we have received Christ as our objective righteousness and are objectively justified before God. We have also received Christ as resurrection life that we can live by this life to have Christ lived out of us as our subjective righteousness; hence, we can be subjectively justified by God. The resurrected Christ enters into us that we may have the subjective justification. This resurrected Christ is living in us to be our life that we may live out a life of righteousness (Col. 1:27b; 3:4a). This is the subjective justification which we obtain through Christ&rsquo;s life. This subjective justification is our living by the resurrected Christ.</p>
<p>Therefore, justification is not merely a positional matter; it is a dispositional matter. The death of Christ gave us a positional justification, and the resurrected Christ in the heavens is a proof of this. Now the resurrected Christ also lives inside us, living out a life of dispositional justification. Eventually, we are justified both in position and in disposition. We have not only an objective justification but a subjective justification as well. We may now live such a subjective, dispositional justification. Thus, as the factor of our justification, Christ was delivered on the cross because of our offenses in order to satisfy God&rsquo;s righteous requirements. He then was raised because of our justification as a proof of God&rsquo;s satisfaction for God to accept us; He was raised also as the resurrected life for us to live a life that can be justified by God and is always acceptable to God. Today Christ in resurrection is our justification.</p>
