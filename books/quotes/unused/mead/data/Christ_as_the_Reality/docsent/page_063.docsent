   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWENTY-ONE ITEMS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first five verses of 2 Timothy 3 show us the situation that existed at that time: "But know this, that in the last days difficult times shall come; for men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boasters, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, savage, nonlovers of good, traitors, reckless, blinded with pride, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but having denied its power; from these also turn away."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these verses there are exactly twenty-one items.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first is lovers of self.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I believe that we all know that humanity is a matter of love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Human beings are not machines; they are loving beings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If there is no love, humanity will vanish.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suppose all the members of a family have no love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What kind of family will that be?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the first aspect of humanity is love.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But love must be used in the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If it is used wrongly, it is exceedingly dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the proper use of love requires the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the first cause of corruption of society is the misuse of love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul tells us that men will become lovers of self.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second item is lovers of money.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I do not believe that money has ever been more lovable than at the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The third is boasters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How the young people are boasting today!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The fourth is arrogance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are not only proud, but arrogant.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fifth is revilers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We see so much of this today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The sixth is disobedient to parents.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is very prevalent today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It seems that human ethics have been changed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some even say that it is good to be disobedient to parents.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This comes straight from the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Any disobedience comes from Satan, the rebellious one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is the source of all rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The seventh item is unthankfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The mood today is to be ungrateful to parents, ungrateful to grandparents, ungrateful to brothers and sisters, and even ungrateful to country.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the real picture of today's generation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And today's younger generation is simply reaping the things sown by the older generation.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The tenth item is implacable.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that these people do not like to make peace with others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They do not like to forgive others, and they do not like to be reconciled to others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more trouble they can make, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more riots, the more turmoil, the happier they are.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a prophecy which was fulfilled at the end of the first century and will also be fulfilled at the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the prophecies of the Bible, there is always a double fulfillment: one at the present time, and the other in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I do believe that what we are seeing today is part of the fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>People simply do not like to make peace.</S>

   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The last two items are seen in the phrase, "having a form of godliness, but having denied its power."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The twentieth is the form of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This may refer to those who go to church on Sunday.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You may say that they have a form of godliness, but they deny the power, which is the twenty-first item.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What is the power of godliness?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Too many Christians have a form of godliness, but they care nothing for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They have the religious form, but they do not have Christ.</S>
