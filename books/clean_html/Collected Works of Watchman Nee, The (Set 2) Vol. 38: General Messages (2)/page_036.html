<h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>The Bible has many examples to illustrate this point. Leviticus 10:1-2 says, "Now the sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, each took his censer and put fire in it, and placed incense upon it, and offered strange fire before Jehovah, which He had not commanded them. And fire came out from before Jehovah and consumed them, and they died before Jehovah." The law concerning the offering required that every time one burned the incense, the fire had to come from the altar. The failure of Nadab and Abihu lay in their failure to use the fire from the altar. They used a different fire for the incense, and the result was death before Jehovah.</p><p>The altar is a type of the cross, whereas the incense is a type of our service before God. The zeal of our service must come from the altar of the cross. Those who do not offer according to this rule will die. What is the cross? It is the place where the self is put to death and the place where we allow the Lord to live. It is the experience of Galatians 2:20, which says, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me." The cross deals with the self's wisdom, opinion, energy, zeal, hope, and desire. After we have been dealt with in this way, we are qualified to serve before the Lord.</p><p>The zeal of many is but strange fire! Men often do not go through the dealing of the cross; they do not reject their own will and wisdom, and they act according to their flesh. Yet they think that by so doing, they can please God and revive the Lord's work. This is zeal to be sure, but it is not zeal that comes from God. It is fire to be sure; however, it is not fire from the altar but strange fire. Anything that is not from the altar of the cross of self-denial is strange fire. Strange fire is fire of the self; it is fire that issues from the soulish life, the fleshly life, and the natural life. Strange fire means that the self-life interferes with the works of God. Although the works are God's, the self-life wants to dictate the way the works are carried out. Offering up strange fire is employing the self's methods and wisdom and insisting on the self's proposals in the works of God. Strange fire will not win us God's acceptance in the incense of our service but will cause us to die before the Lord.</p><p>Nadab and Abihu were two sons of Aaron. Aaron was the high priest chosen by God. What the two men did was not rebellion against God; they burned incense to serve God and please Him. Yet they did what God had not commanded them to do. They did not act according to God's command and were judged by Him. Aaron's sons might have thought that since God had not explicitly forbidden them to use other kinds of fire for the incense, they could use strange fire. They did not realize that in God's service, anything that He has not explicitly commanded us to do should not be done at all. They did not see how strict our God is. In God's work, anything that He has not commanded is forbidden by Him, and if man does any of these things, he errs and has sinned. God sent fire to Nadab and Abihu and burned them to death because they committed the sin of presumptuousness. Although they were the sons of Aaron and were priests rendering service to God, God did not tolerate their actions.</p><p>They did not commit any treachery, fraud, fornication, or robbery like the sons of Eli. They did not rebel against any of God's explicit commandments and did not do anything that God forbids men to do. They were there specifically to serve God and please Him. They purposefully prepared two censers and burned incense with their own fire. They thought that they would please God. Little did they realize that even though their motive was good, they were serving the Lord according to their own will. They did what God had not commanded them to do; they did something outside God's will. This offended God. In all of our service to God, we cannot presume that God will approve our work just because we have a good motive. Our motive may be good, but if we are presumptuous, God will still punish our sin of presumptuousness. Today we may not see God's severe judgment immediately upon our work, but we must realize that all the work that comes from strange fire will be judged at the judgment seat on that day. May the Lord open our eyes to see what sin is. Not only are fornication, robbery, deceit, extortion, unrighteousness, and filthiness sins, but even "working for God," "preaching," and "helping others" can be sins if we are not doing them according to God's direction. God will judge the sin of presumptuousness also. All those who work by themselves without God's command are offering a service of strange fire and offending God.</p><p>First Samuel 13:8-14 records the story of Saul offering the burnt offering by himself. It serves as a big warning to us. Saul had three great reasons for offering the sacrifice by himself. First, he saw that the people were leaving him. Second, Samuel had not come at the appointed time. Third, his enemy, the Philistines, had gathered in Michmash and were going to come down to Gilgal to attack them. Therefore, he "forced" himself and offered a burnt offering (v. 12). Saul did not do anything evil; he was offering a sacrifice to Jehovah. He thought in his heart that God might not be pleased if he did not pray and that God would be pleased if he prayed more. He thought that he would save the people from the enemy's hand by rendering a little more service to Jehovah. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Samuel said to Saul, "Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee" (vv. 13-14).</p>
