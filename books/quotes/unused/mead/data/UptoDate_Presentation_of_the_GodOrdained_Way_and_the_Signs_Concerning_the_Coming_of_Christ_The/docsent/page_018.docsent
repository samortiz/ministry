   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Not Predicting</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To prophesy for God is not to predict.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To predict is to foretell an event before it occurs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is not the meaning conveyed in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Chinese Union Version renders this word "to be a prophet preaching."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the term prophet may lead people to understand the Greek word here as referring to predicting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, what the prophets of God spoke in the Old Testament did not altogether consist of predictions; rather, their speaking included a great measure of exhortations and warnings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1 Corinthians 14, in speaking of prophesying for God, Paul did not have any intention for us to speak in tongues or to predict; his intention was that we all speak for God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God desires to speak to His people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, He would not speak directly to them; He wants us to speak for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, this matter is very precious, and for this reason it is also quite difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But Speaking to Men Building Up,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Encouragement, and Consolation</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First Corinthians 14:3 says, "But he who prophesies speaks to men building up and encouragement and consolation."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Building up is for the church; the church needs the words of building up.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Exhortation is for the work; the Lord's work needs the words of exhortation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Consolation is for the believers; every believer needs the words of consolation, because every day we all have problems and worries, and we all need to be consoled.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, when we prophesy for God in the church meetings, we first need to take care of the building of the church of God, that the church may be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Second, we need to take care of the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because they have many problems, everyone who works for the Lord needs incitement and encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Third, we also need to take care of all God's children that they may have joy and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we should remember that to prophesy is to speak building up for the church, to speak encouragement for the work, and to speak consolation for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Being the Excelling Gift</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First Corinthians 14:12 says, "Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Speaking in tongues is for the building up of ourselves; thus, it is a gift of lesser value.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only prophesying is for the building up of the church; thus, it is the excelling gift.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How transcendent and noble it is if we can speak for God by speaking some illuminating words that everyone may be comforted and may be full of joy and hope, and that the church may be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Being for the Building Up of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Prophesying is the excelling gift because it builds up the church 1 Cor 14:4-5, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Prophesying not only builds up individual saints, but also builds up the Body of Christ, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Larger Church Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because there are more people in the larger meetings, the words that we prophesy are more powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Concerning Prophesying for God, the Believers: Needing to Pursue and Desire Earnestly</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First Corinthians 14:1 says, "Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to desire earnestly the most profitable gift, which is the gift of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since to prophesy for God is to speak for God and to speak forth God, it is to minister Christ to people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the most important thing in the church meetings and the most profitable gift in the building up of the saints and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the concluding word of this chapter, Paul still charged us to pursue and desire earnestly to prophesy for God's building v. 39 .</S>
