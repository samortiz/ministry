<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CRUCIAL NEED AMONG US TODAY<br>FOR THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>We need to be stirred up by the Lord so that we can cooperate with Him to go higher. We have attained to a certain extent, but we have not attained to the extent which we should, so we must humble ourselves to learn something and be improved every day.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Learning to Speak</H2><P>In these days we are taking the God-ordained way to have the church life. The big item in the church life is the meetings. Especially, we need to learn how to take care of the Lord's need in our speaking of His word in the meetings. Those in traditional Christianity do not consider that all the saints are qualified to speak the word of God. Therefore, they have set up a clerical class of people to be the unique speakers. Every Sunday morning in their main service, they have a practice of one person speaking and the rest listening. A Christian could be there for his whole life listening to this speaking for many years and eventually not be able to speak a word for the Lord. This is a poor situation. This kind of practice annuls the spiritual function of the saints and quenches their heart to speak for the Lord.</P><P>Furthermore, this kind of practice is absolutely unscriptural. In the New Testament, especially in 1 Corinthians 14, we are told that when we all come together as the church, everyone should prepare to have something to share with the others (v. 26). There is a picture of this in the ancient times with the Israelites. When they came together to worship the Lord, they all brought some surplus of the good land to present to God. The holy word in the Old Testament charged them not to appear before God empty-handed, without anything to present to God (Deut. 16:16). But today most Christians come to their main service with nothing, expecting that someone will be there to speak to them. This is altogether not based upon the Scripture.</P><P>About fifty-five years ago, Brother Watchman Nee saw the light from 1 Corinthians 14 that before we come to the meeting, we should have something prepared to present to the Lord and to the attendants. In other words, everybody should have some word to speak to others, to minister the Lord to others, that Christ may be glorified and His Body may be built up. Brother Nee also realized that if we stopped the one-man-speaking practice, we would need something to replace it or we would not have anything. At that time we were not able to enter into the practice of the church meetings in mutuality revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. Eventually, beginning in 1987 we began in Taipei to enter into the practice of having church meetings in mutuality with all the attendants speaking for the building up of the church. Since that time we have seen a slow improvement among us. This improvement has become an encouragement to us, especially to me.</P><P>Some may feel that the new way is all right but not that good. But as long as this new way would not reduce us but give us some increase at a good percentage, we should be satisfied. At the end of 1988 there were approximately one thousand five hundred sixty saints in Southern California. Today there are approximately three thousand one hundred eighty saints here. This is double the number of what we were five years ago. This shows that during the period of time in which we have been endeavoring to take the God-ordained way, we have still had the increase.</P><P>Since we are practicing the God-ordained way, the new way, we must learn to speak because speaking in the meeting is a vital thing for the Lord's recovery. We all need to be perfected to speak for the Lord. When we speak in a larger meeting, we must speak loudly, audibly. Furthermore, in order to speak we all need to learn something. I have over one hundred various kinds of dictionaries that I use to help me in studying the Bible. I have one dictionary on the history of the church which is very helpful. I am saying this to impress us that we need a learning spirit if we want to be those who speak for the Lord.</P><P>Since we love the Lord and love His recovery, we must take the way to have the proper and adequate meetings. The first item we must pursue for this is prophesying (1 Cor. 14:1). Prophesying is not only speaking but also speaking rightly, speaking accurately, speaking audibly, and speaking with something rich. This is why we have to learn. If we do not have any learning, we cannot have the riches to impart to others. Our speaking should also be adjusted in its rhythm. If we speak too slowly we can exhaust others' patience. If we speak too fast, others will not be able to understand us. I hope we would exercise ourselves to learn to speak for the Lord.</P><P>When I was thirty-two years old, I stood in front of a mirror to practice my speaking and my gestures. I also practiced speaking to members of my family. We love the Lord and many of us are young, so we have a long way to go in our Christian life. If we learn to speak accurately, adequately, properly, and richly to meet the Lord's need, we will be greatly used by the Lord and bring in much blessing to the churches.</P>
