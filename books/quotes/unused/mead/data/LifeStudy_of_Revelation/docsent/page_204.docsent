   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Abominations of the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The apostate church is also the mother of the abominations of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These abominations are idols Deut 7:25-26 , with which the apostate Roman Church is filled.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These idols have been mixed in with the so-called service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When people go to a Catholic cathedral to worship, whom do they worship?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some purchase candles and stand before the idol of their choice.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Catholicism there is an idol market, and people can pray to any idol they choose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although many pray to Mary, that actually is not Mary it is Venus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The cathedrals in the Catholic Church are not different from idol temples.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not even in the idol temples in China did I see as many idols as there are in the Catholic cathedrals.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Certainly, the apostate church is the mother of abominations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>C. In the Wilderness</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the apostle John saw the great prostitute, an angel carried him away in spirit into a wilderness 17:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A wilderness is a desert, a parched land.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that the apostate church is in a desert, where there are no springs of water prepared by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Certainly the apostate church cannot receive the water supply from God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to show the apostle John that the apostate church is in such a desolate place, the angel carried him there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>D. Sitting on Many Waters</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 1 says that the great prostitute sits on many waters, and verse 15 indicates that the waters where the prostitute sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These words are fulfilled in the fact that the apostate Roman Church rides on peoples and nations throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Catholic Church actually numbers one third of the population of the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>E. Committing Fornication</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>with the Kings of the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The kings of the earth have committed fornication with this great prostitute.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that she has sinful religious relationships with the rulers of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What the apostate church commits is not adultery, the sin of an unfaithful spouse, but fornication, the sin of a prostitute.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is more sinful than adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The fornication of the apostate church consists of her sinful relationships with the rulers of the earth for her profit, just as a prostitute commits sin for gain.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The fornication committed by the apostate church is spiritual fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Catholic Church is intimately involved with worldly politics, and the kings of the earth commit fornication directly with her.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the eyes of God, this is spiritual fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>F. Having Made the Earth-dwellers Drunk</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>with the Wine of Her Fornication</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This great prostitute has made those who dwell on the earth drunk with the wine of her fornication v. 2 . The wine here refers to the heretical doctrines in the sinful religious relationships of the apostate church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They confound as wine does those who become involved in her religion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the wine of her fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In an indirect manner those who dwell on the earth are made drunk with this wine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The heretical doctrines of the apostate church are like drugs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They befuddle people, make them dumb, and cause them to lose their senses.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I have talked with many Catholics, and I have found them to be completely drugged.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more you talk to them, the less they understand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates that they have been made drunk with the wine of the great prostitute.</S>
