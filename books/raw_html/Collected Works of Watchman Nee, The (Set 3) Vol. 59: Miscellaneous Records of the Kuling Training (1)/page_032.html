<h2 class="head2">The Power of Resurrection Being<br />the Greatest Power</h2><p>The greatest limitation on earth is death; nothing can extend beyond the confines of death. Death is the ultimate limitation of all living creatures. However, when the Lord resurrected, He destroyed this sepulchral limitation. Death is the greatest limitation, but resurrection has conquered death. Therefore, resurrection is the greatest power of all. We began talking about resurrection as early as 1926. But even now we are only touching the hem of the resurrected Lord's garment; we are still far off. If we can touch a little more, we will transcend death and everything else. This is the greatest power of all. Once we touch the power of resurrection, it will be easy to spread the gospel of the kingdom to all of China. Resurrection power is the greatest of all powers.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><h2 class="head2">Transmitting the Resurrected Lord</h2><p>What then is the Holy Spirit? In Acts 2:33 Peter preached the gospel to the Jews. He told them that the Lord was exalted to the right hand of God, had received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, and had poured out this Spirit on men. Therefore, the power of the Holy Spirit is the power of resurrection. This means that the Lord installed the power of resurrection and even resurrection itself into the Holy Spirit when He sent this Spirit to us. As soon as a man touches the Holy Spirit, he touches resurrection. Once a man is in the Spirit, he touches the Lord of resurrection. The Holy Spirit testifies to the resurrection of the Lord. While the Lord was on the earth, some leaned on His bosom. Others kissed Him, pressed upon Him, or received from His hands. He washed the feet and touched the hands of many. It was possible to touch the Lord then. However, this kind of touch cannot compare with our touch today. Today we are not bound by time and space. The resurrected Lord is now in the Holy Spirit. What we see today far exceeds what men saw then. The church has been able to go on continuously for two thousand years because men have inwardly seen the Lord in a clear way. Outwardly we do not see as clearly as the men in the four Gospels, but inwardly our knowledge of the Lord far exceeds that of those in the four Gospels. Once we are in the Spirit, we touch the resurrected Lord. The single, most important work of the Holy Spirit today is to transmit the resurrected Lord to men. The Holy Spirit is not transmitting the Christ of the Gospels to men, but the Christ in resurrection. When men saw the Lord on earth, they could only tell how tall He was, how wise He was, or how old He looked. Some could say that they saw Him when He was twelve or that they knew His brothers. However, we who are in the Holy Spirit today are not bound by time and space. We are touching the Christ who is not limited by time and space.</p><h2 class="head2">The Power of Resurrection Being<br />in the Holy Spirit</h2><p>The Lord has transcended all barriers. Today the Holy Spirit is here to testify of this transcendent Christ. If a man claims to know the Holy Spirit yet does not know the transcendency of the resurrected Christ, he does not know the Christ in the Holy Spirit. The power of resurrection is in the Holy Spirit. Ephesians 1:21 says that when the resurrected Christ was uplifted, He transcended all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come. God made the resurrected Christ to sit at His right hand and exalted Him to a place that is far beyond human understanding. He has transcended all the names that man can name, not only in this age but also in the age that is coming. Resurrection means the breaking down of all barriers. Only the self-existing and ever-existing One can transcend all, yet God decrees that even those who are not self-existing and ever-existing can transcend all as well. The work of the Holy Spirit today is to reveal this resurrection power to us. We have to see that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of resurrection. The Spirit that transcends everything is the Holy Spirit.</p>
