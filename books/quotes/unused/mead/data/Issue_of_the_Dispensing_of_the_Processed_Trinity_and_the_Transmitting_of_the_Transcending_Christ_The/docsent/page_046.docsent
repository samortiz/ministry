   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DAMAGE OF OPINIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Opinions are another source of division.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In one Lord's table meeting, I saw a situation which illustrates this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this table meeting, the cup and the bread were covered with a cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After a short time, one brother stood up to take off the cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His reason was that the elements should be seen in order to display the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But later another brother came back to put the cloth back on the elements.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His reason for doing this was to protect the bread and the wine from a fly in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both of these brothers were bothered with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They were opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Could that table have been blessed by the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the one brother was afraid to receive some sickness through the fly, the wise thing would have been not to say anything or do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the cup came to him, he simply could have not taken it and passed it on to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He should have had no opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I would like to give another illustration to show how opinions can frustrate things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Three brothers were going to take a car from Anaheim to Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before they started, they began to argue about which was the best way to take.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They argued with one another for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By that time they would have already arrived in Los Angeles, regardless of what way they had taken.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This shows how opinions can delay us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For over sixty years I have been serving the church and ministering the word to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It has been hard to see a brother who was not opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Anyone who is opinionated does not see the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you check with the brothers who have been working together with me for the past five years here in Anaheim, they can tell you that I never argue with them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If they ask me about their feeling to go somewhere, I will tell them to pray and that if they feel led of the Lord and can be spared, to go.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These brothers can tell you that I am not opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many times the sisters are very opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They may not express their opinions to others, but they will to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to reject our opinions, because they damage the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE BODY BEING THE INTRINSIC</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to see the way Paul presents the Body of Christ in Ephesians 1.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul said that God raised up Christ, seated Him in the heavens, subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Right away in the following phrase he said, "Which is His Body" v. 23a . The church is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that the Body is the church's intrinsic significance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church without the Body means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Greek the church is the ekklesia, the called-out ones coming together.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the significance of this gathering is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the recovery today there are over twelve hundred churches around the globe, yet we all are one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we consider ourselves as individual churches or as individual believers, we are through.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should consider ourselves as one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the parts of our physical body would keep their own jurisdiction and be autonomous, our body would be finished.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But thank the Lord that all the members of our physical body are submissive to one another so that our body can act and operate smoothly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose that we wanted to go somewhere and that all the parts of our body agreed except our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the feet could talk, they might say to the other members, "Don't you know that we are tired.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You have no love.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You don't sympathize with us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You want to go, but we will not go, because we do not have the strength to go."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What kind of physical body would this be?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In practicality, there would be no body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is to be "disbodied."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today among the Christians concerning the Body of Christ, it is like this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They are "disbodied."</S>
