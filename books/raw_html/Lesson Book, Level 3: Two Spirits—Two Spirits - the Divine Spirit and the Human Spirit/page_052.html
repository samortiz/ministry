Hebrews 4:12 says that the living word of God is sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit. This verse shows not only that the spirit and soul are different, but also that there is a need for the spirit to be divided from the soul. We must deny our soul in order to give ground to our spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. DENYING THE SOUL</H2><P>[In the teaching of the New Testament, especially in the Gospels, it always tells us that we have to deny the soul, to lose the soul, but it never tells us that we have to deny the spirit. In the Epistles, we are always told that we have to walk according to spirit, live in the spirit, and do things by the spirit. In the Gospels is the denying of the soul; then is the Epistles you have walking according to the spirit (Romans 8:4). The New Testament doesn't tell us to walk and live and do things in the soul.</P><P>Matthew 10:38-39 says, "And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. He who finds his soul (the word here in Greek is psuche, meaning soul) shall lose it, and he who loses his soul for My sake shall find it." Then Matthew 16:24-26 says, "Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. For whoever desires to save his soul shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul for My sake shall find it. For what shall a man be profited if he should gain the whole world, but forfeit his soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" The soul must be denied.]</P><P>[In all the four Gospels the Lord told us again and again that we have to lose the soul, to deny the soul [Mark 8:35-36; Luke 9:24-25; John 12:25], but you cannot find a word telling us that we have to lose the spirit or deny the spirit. On the contrary, the Epistles charge us to walk according to spirit, to do things in the spirit, and to pray in the spirit (Rom. 8:4; Rom. 1:9; Eph. 6:18). In the teachings of the Gospels we are told to deny the soul, to lose the soul, but in the teachings of all the Epistles we have to take care of the spirit, walk in the spirit, and we have to do things, to pray in the spirit. So there is a big, big difference between the soul and the spirit.]</P>
