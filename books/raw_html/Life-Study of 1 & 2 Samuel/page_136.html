<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. CONGRATULATED BY TOI KING OF HAMATH</H2><P>David was congratulated by Toi king of Hamath for his fighting against the king of Zobah (vv. 9-10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. CONSECRATING HIS SPOILS<br>FROM ALL THE NATIONS TO JEHOVAH</H2><P>David consecrated to Jehovah his spoils from all the nations, articles of gold, silver, and bronze (vv. 11-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. OVER EDOM</H2><P>Verses 13 and 14 speak of David's conquest over Edom. He put garrisons throughout all of Edom, and all the Edomites became servants to him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. DAVID'S REIGN<br>IN JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS</H2><P>In verses 15 through 18 we have a word concerning David's reign in justice and righteousness. Verse 15 says, "So David reigned over all Israel, and David executed justice and righteousness for all his people." At that time Joab was over the army; Jehoshaphat was recorder; Zadok and Ahimelech were priests; and Seraiah was scribe. Benaiah was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites (the body guard and the runners), and David's sons were his advisers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. SHOWING KINDNESS<br>TO MEPHIBOSHETH THE SON OF JONATHAN</H2><P>Chapter nine is a record of David's showing kindness to Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. For the Sake of Jonathan</H2><P>In verse 1 David asked, "Is there still anyone left of the house of Saul, that I may show kindness to him for Jonathan's sake?" David felt obliged to show kindness, for the sake of Jonathan, to any remaining descendant of the house of Saul.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Finding Out Mephibosheth<br>through a Servant of the House of Saul</H2><P>A servant of the house of Saul, whose name was Ziba, was called to David, and David asked him, "Is there yet anyone at all of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him?" (v. 3a). The servant told him that there was still a son of Jonathan, one who was crippled in his feet. When Mephibosheth came to David, David told him not to be afraid, for he would surely show kindness to him for the sake of Jonathan his father. David went on to tell him that he would restore to him all the land of his father Saul and that he would eat food at his table continually (v. 7). Mephibosheth paid homage to David and said, "What is your servant that you should look upon a dead dog like me?" (v. 8).</P>
