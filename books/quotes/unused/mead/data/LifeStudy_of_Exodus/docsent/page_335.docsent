   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PLACED ON FOUR PILLARS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At this point we need to consider further the significance of the veil placed on four pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have pointed out that these pillars signify extraordinary believers, those who have been not only redeemed, but also dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The veil signifies the flesh of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We know that Christ is typified by the Passover lamb, the manna, the ark, and the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What kind of Christ is typified by the veil?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The lamb is the redeeming Christ, the manna is the nourishing Christ, and the veil is Christ in the flesh crucified for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With Christ in the flesh we have incarnation and crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Yes, Christ Himself was cleft, riven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But now the pillars, the extraordinary believers who have been redeemed and dealt with, must bear a testimony in the tabernacle, the habitation of God, of the incarnated and crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only by being dealt with can we become such pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To be dealt with here means to experience the crucifixion, the rending, of our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who are pillars, the extraordinary believers, in the church, God s dwelling place, must bear the testimony that their flesh has been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Peter, John, Paul, and the overcoming believers throughout the generations and centuries have borne such a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They have been pillars testifying that their fallen being with its fallen nature, that is, their person and their flesh, has been rent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The concept here is deep and the thought is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The tabernacle is the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But within God s dwelling place there is a separation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In a human dwelling place a separation may be a positive thing, but in God s dwelling place the separation is a negative matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, the veil is negative, for it conceals God s presence from His people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before the veil was rent, only the high priest was qualified to enter the Holy of Holies once a year.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This proves that the veil was something negative.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today this veil is our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some may argue that the veil signifies Christ s flesh, not our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But when Christ, the eternal Word of God, became flesh, He became identified with us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that the flesh which Christ became actually denotes our fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, when He was crucified on the cross, our fallen nature, that is, our natural being, the flesh, was crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When He was cleft, our flesh was cleft also, for our flesh was cleft with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yes, in God s dwelling place Christ has been crucified, and the veil has been rent.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now the pillars must continue to bear this testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With Christ, the flesh has been crucified, and the veil has been rent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But with us the veil may not yet have been cleft.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because with Christ the veil has been cleft, the separation between God and man has been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now those who have been redeemed by Christ can commune with God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, many believers still have not experienced the crucifixion of their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, their flesh remains as a separation between them and God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The pillars within God s dwelling place must now bear the testimony that the veil of their flesh has been cleft with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In other words, those who are pillars in the church should no longer live by their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead, they must bear the testimony that their flesh has been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the meaning of Galatians 5:24.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we consider the veil from the standpoint of experience, we see that there is an identification of Christ as the veil with those believers who are pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that the pillars are closely identified with Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The veil was put on the pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This implies the identification of the veil with the pillars and the oneness of the veil and the pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may say that the veil was the clothing, the covering, of the pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Clothing signifies identification.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we put clothes upon our body, these clothes become one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In like manner, the veil clothing the pillars became one with the pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, the veil and the pillars were identified.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A WAY OPENED</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The deep significance of identification is that whether or not the way can be opened for people to contact God depends on the experience of this identification.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the veil is rent, then the way will be open for fallen people to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Otherwise, the way will be closed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means that when the flesh is dealt with, there is an entrance for fallen man to contact God and have fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before the veil was broken, there was no entry into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The priests could come into the Holy Place and approach the table, the lampstand, and the incense altar, but they could go no further.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the veil was rent, three entries were opened up.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We say this on the basis of the probable location of the four pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is likely that two were on each end, next to the standing boards, and that two were in between.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This would make three entrances into the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If two pillars were not next to the standing boards, there would be no way to support the corners of the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Spiritually speaking, these three entrances typify the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the New Jerusalem there are three gates on each of the four sides.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>These gates typify the Triune God as the entrance into the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We see these gates in the three parables in Luke 15: the Son as the Shepherd, the Spirit as the woman lighting a lamp, and the Father receiving the returned prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Also, in Ephesians 2:18 we read that in one Spirit we have access through Christ unto the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, the Triune God Himself is signified by the three entrances.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once again we see that through the types in the tabernacle we can know Christ in a very detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is difficult to find words to convey what is portrayed by all these types.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But even though we may not be able to utter what we see in these figures, deep within we can have a proper realization.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This will strengthen us, nourish us, and help us to grow.</S>
