   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OUTPOURING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE INFILLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us consider again the difference between the outpouring and the infilling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The outpouring of the Spirit is for every believer, whereas the infilling of the Spirit is for a special group of people those who are emptied.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In studying the Bible we have to realize that every term can be paired with a corresponding term.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, resurrection goes with death, and filling goes with emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must consider all the corresponding terms before we can understand a word accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who have been filled with the Spirit are those who are emptied because filling and emptiness correspond to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before the day of Pentecost, the one hundred and twenty disciples were gathered together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They were all clothed with the Spirit and filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They could be together for ten days and pray together in one accord because they had all been dealt with by the resurrected Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The three thousand people at Pentecost also received the outpouring of the Spirit, but the Bible does not say that they were filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The one hundred and twenty received both the infilling and the outpouring, whereas the three thousand received only the outpouring.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Later, the five thousand also received the outpouring of the Spirit without receiving the infilling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How do we know that the three thousand and the five thousand only received the outpouring of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the whole church had been filled by the Spirit, there would not have been any dispute in the daily dispensing of the food.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But when the widows were overlooked in their portions, there were murmurings and disputes Acts 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This proves that the disciples were not filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then the apostles appointed seven deacons to take charge of the table.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These seven were filled with the Spirit v. 3 . If the whole church had been filled with the Spirit, there would not have been the need for a selection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, because not everyone was filled with the Spirit, seven had to be selected.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This proves that many people had the outpouring of the Spirit, but not the infilling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The outpouring of the Spirit comes upon us as a result of our faith in the ascended Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It has little to do with our measure of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The infilling of the Holy Spirit comes as a result of our obedience to the resurrected Lord within, and this demands that our life be sanctified within.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you want to have the infilling of the Spirit, you must come to the meetings empty, hungry, and dissatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you do this, you will be filled and satisfied when you go home.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must be empty and hungry all the time before you can be filled with the Spirit all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You should not be satisfied with what you have received from this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You must allow the cross to deal with you daily.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This will bring in the daily filling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever you are not victorious, you do not have the filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you have the infilling of the Holy Spirit today, it is because you have experienced the dealing of the cross and are living an overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once I was invited to a brother's house for a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the end of the meal I said, "This is enough."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the brother kept adding more rice and food to my bowl.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This went on twenty or more times.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I thought, "When is he going to stop?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the way we experience grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God's bountiful supply is still waiting for us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The grace we enjoy is an abounding grace, which adds grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may have experienced victory and may have received the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may even have experienced the infilling of the Spirit many times, but we should not be satisfied with these experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Holy Spirit can fill us up again, and the degree of filling will be greater when we are filled the second, the third, and the fourth time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The deeper the cross works in us, the more we will receive the infilling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The deeper the cross cuts through us, the deeper we will be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The filling of the Spirit sometimes brings heartbreaks and sufferings, and sometimes it brings hardships.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, all these are the digging work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are for the purpose of increasing our measure and making us bigger and richer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Under these circumstances, we should not be afraid to shed tears or grieve.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we go through these breakings, the Lord will use us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if we murmur in our heart and argue with God, the overcoming life will cease immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When it ceases, even the outpouring of the Spirit will be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before the Lord, whenever we allow the cross to dig and cut through us, more of what we love and aspire for is removed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This removal is the work of the cross, and it is for the purpose of increasing our measure.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The more our measure is increased, the more grace we will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some people think that they already have experienced the cutting of the cross and already have been filled by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Actually their measure is just the measure of water in a seashell.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is not true suffering and not true filling.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our measure is being expanded whenever we encounter something that runs contrary to our will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are allowing the cross to cut through us and allowing the Spirit to fill us up whenever we submit to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>OUR TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must be sanctified in the eyes of sinners and even in the eyes of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we have not passed through the cross and are not filled by the Holy Spirit, and if we can only show men such things as head covering and baptism by immersion, I will be the first to declare that I have nothing to do with such a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must let others know about God's full counsel and God's center.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to let others see that we have consecrated ourselves to God for the purpose of accomplishing His will.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are here to pursue the one high will, not miscellaneous things.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After we return home from this conference, we should not auction away our victory cheaply.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After we have received the outpouring of the Spirit, we have to testify more concerning the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have to testify how He has delivered us from our sins and is living for us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we do this, others will be hungry and thirsty to seek after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In order for our work to be effective, we must generate a genuine hunger in others.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If the Lord leads us to speak, we must properly and clearly explain how the Lord has become our overcoming life, and we must help others to empty themselves and experience the infilling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must pay attention to one more thing: We should not advertise the outpouring of the Spirit as a thing of curiosity, and we should not make it a point of propaganda.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should only testify when the Lord leads us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What happened during the past few days was an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the future, we should not do the same thing in other places because it will stumble others.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If there are some people who need to experience the outpouring of the Spirit, we can take them home and gather three or five people to pray together and seek for the outpouring.</S>
