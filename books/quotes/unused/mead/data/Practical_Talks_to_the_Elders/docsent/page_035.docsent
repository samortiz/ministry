   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Mingling</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Probably from 1950 the light began to come about mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the inner life teachings of past centuries, the main word used to describe our relationship with God is the word union.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, through the experience of the divine revelation in the Bible concerning the Triune God being our life, I came to realize that our relationship with God is not just a union; it is a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then I began to see that the thought was there in typology.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Leviticus 2:4 we are told that the meal offering was made of fine flour mingled with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I first began to minister on the matter of mingling, I didn t realize the word was mentioned in typology; I thought it was a new term used in my message.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was later that I saw that mingling is found in typology.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When I was opposed for saying that we are mingled with God, I tried to find out why some opposed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the early centuries there were some teachers who saw from the Bible, and I believe from their experience also, that there is such a thing as mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because their teaching stirred up so much debate, however, the term was dropped and the word union was used all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe some of those who oppose us do so based upon this history.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more I ministered on the matter of mingling, the more I got strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord being food and drink to us implies strongly the thought of mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whatever you eat and drink mingles with your physical being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The eating of the tree of life and the drinking of the water of life from the throne of God illustrate God s mingling with His redeemed people to the uttermost for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So, I fully believe that the thought of mingling is scriptural; there is the need for such ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE ISSUE OF THE PAST MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The issue of these more than twenty years of ministering the Word with the focus on the Spirit is the matter of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Mingling is based upon dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If God does not dispense Himself into us, there is no mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This dispensing is by the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this dispensing, the Spirit as the very consummation of the Triune God is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Father is embodied in the Son; the Son is realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All three, therefore, are consummated in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For what purpose is the Spirit the consummation of the Triune God?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is that He may dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This dispensing is in accordance with His dispensation Gk. oikonomia, arrangement or plan ; it is not an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He does it according to His arrangement, His system, His household administration.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God, according to such a dispensation, dispenses Himself all the time to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God s Means of Dispensing Himself</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To do this, God uses two means, two instruments.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first is outward: the Bible, that is, the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The second is inward: the Spirit, which is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These are the two great gifts God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There are two sister portions by Paul in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Ephesians 5:18 says that we should be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Colossians 3:16 says we should be filled with the Word Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These are sister portions, telling us we should be filled with the Spirit and with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To bring the saints under God s dispensing we must stress two things: the inward gift, that is, the Spirit, and the outward gift, that is, the Word, the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Especially we who are leading ones in the churches must have adequate experience of the inward Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, the inward Spirit is simply the practical God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God could not be present and practical if He were not such a processed, all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If God has not become such a Spirit to us, then He is just objective, an external object; He is not practical, and we cannot experience Him.</S>
