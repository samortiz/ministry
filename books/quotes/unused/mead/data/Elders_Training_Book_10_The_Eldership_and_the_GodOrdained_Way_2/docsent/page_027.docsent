   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Oneness That Needs the Full Growth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the New Man and the Measure of the Stature</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of the Fullness the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This oneness in practicality needs the full growth of the new man and needs also the measure of the stature of the fullness the Body of Christ Eph 4:13c .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that we need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A child who is only four feet tall is not full-grown; he needs to grow further until he arrives at the measure of six feet, the measure of the stature of a full-grown man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a similar way, we need to grow in the divine life until we arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness, the Body, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No Longer Babes Tossed by Waves</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>and Carried About by Every Wind of Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>in the Sleight of Men, in Craftiness</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>with a View to a System of Error</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we are full-grown, that is, mature, we will no longer be babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error Eph 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The problems among us today are due to the immaturity of many of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A number of saints have been damaged by the negative speaking of the divisive ones because they lack the full growth, which means that they are short of the adequate knowledge of Christ and the proper understanding of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because of this they listened to and believed the negative talk.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians 4:14 speaks of the winds of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every wind of teaching comes in the sleight of men, that is, in a cheating way, and in craftiness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this verse sleight and craftiness are used in apposition, meaning that they refer to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sleight implies cheating, and craftiness implies deceiving.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To deceive people is to cheat them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The winds of teaching in sleight and in craftiness are related to the system of error.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word system indicates that the system of error must be of Satan; it must be a satanic system of error designed to systematize people into a division.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The winds of teaching may have the appearance of truth, but in such teaching the truth may be applied for the purpose of causing division.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Anything that divides the believers is a wind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1 Corinthians 1:12, some of the Corinthian believers said, "I am of Paul," some said, "I am of Apollos," and some said, "I am of Cephas."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Surely we all would condemn this kind of speaking as divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, some of the Corinthians said, "I am of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This does not seem to be divisive; rather, it seems very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nevertheless, even such a "spiritual" saying was divisive; it was a wind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all must be of Christ, but to say that we are of Christ so as to designate ourselves as different from other believers is divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To designate ourselves by saying either "I am of Paul," or "I am of Cephas," or "I am of Christ" is divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To say "I am of Christ," in itself, may be right, but as long as it is divisive, it is a wind of teaching that carries the believers away from the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not a matter of whether a certain kind of speaking is right or wrong; it is a matter of whether or not it is divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Satan is subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is difficult to seduce people by using something that is obviously wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, anything that is good and right can easily be used to attract people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether a certain thing is divisive or not does not depend on whether that thing is right or wrong; it depends on whether that thing divides or does not divide.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In recent days some have declared that they have come back to the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This kind of speaking seems very good, because to enjoy Christ is a wonderful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, if we use this wonderful thing to designate ourselves, to separate ourselves from others, this is divisive.</S>
