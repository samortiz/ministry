   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PERFECTING THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 4:12 speaks of the perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To perfect the saints is not mainly to teach them; it is to minister Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What the saints need is not the knowledge of doctrine, but the ministering of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever someone ministers Christ to us, we spontaneously have the sense that we are fed and nourished, that we have received Christ as our food supply.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Through this supply we are strengthened and enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, it is altogether different when someone comes to us with enticing questions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the serpent contacted Eve in the garden, he asked, Has God said?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In like manner, negative ones often raise tempting questions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to realize immediately that such questions do not come from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who contact us in this way do not minister Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They do not supply us with food, they do not water us, and they do not strengthen, enlighten, or equip us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The effect of their questions is darkness and death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As soon as we are aware of this kind of speaking, we must close ourselves to it and refuse to take it in.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What the saints need is to have Christ ministered into them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is necessary for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In all our contact with the saints there should be the ministry of Christ as the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The leading gifts are to perfect the saints through such a ministry of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more the saints are supplied with the living Christ, the more they are perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>GROWING IN PARTICULAR MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the saints are perfected through the ministry of Christ, they will grow up into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have Christ within us, but in many matters we are still in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, we need the growth that will bring us out of ourselves and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Teaching cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This can be done only through the ministry of Christ as food and nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The growth into Christ in 4:15 is equal to the putting on of the new man in verse 24.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The only way to put on the new man is to grow up into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more we grow into Christ, the more we put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To put on the new man is to be in the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We cannot be in the church life if we do not grow into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to grow up into Christ in all the details of our daily living, for example, in shopping and in talking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Often our talk is natural and devoid of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The only way to be free from such a natural way of speaking is to grow out of it by growing up into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we grow in Christ in the matter of talking, our talk will eventually be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By growing up into Christ in this particular matter, we spontaneously put on more of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In some localities the saints love the Lord very much; however, they are quite natural.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nearly everything about them their behavior, their virtues, their way of speaking is natural.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With them there is no sign of having grown up into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is disturbing to the indwelling Spirit, who longs for the church to be realized as the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to put on the church life as the expression of the one new man, we need to grow out of everything natural by growing up into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we have the perfection with the growth spoken of in 4:13 and 15, surely we shall put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE PROPER COMMUNITY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we grow into Christ, we shall also put off the old man, especially regarding the former manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The manner of life of the old man is the old social life, the old community life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By creation, every human being needs a community life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before we were saved, we had a certain kind of social life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now that we are saved our social life needs a change.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that we need a change of community.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church life is the best social life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can testify that in the church life our former social life has been exchanged for the best community life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Praise the Lord for the social life in the church!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A STABLE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, if we proclaim that the church is our community life but we do not grow into Christ, we shall not be stable in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some say that they are for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, when they are disappointed with something in the church, they leave.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This indicates that they have not truly put on the church life by growing up into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The only way to put on the church life is to grow up into Christ in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Suppose a sister does not grow up into Christ in her shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As long as she lacks growth in this matter, her church life will not be altogether secure.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The security of our church life depends upon our growing up into Christ in particular matters.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we do not grow up into Christ, we may be in the church life one day and gone the next.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For a steady church life, we need to grow up into Christ in particular ways.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Once again we see that to put on the new man is to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What we need is not growth in a general way, but in particular ways.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For example, a brother may need to grow up into Christ in the way he cuts his hair or in the way he deals with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we do not show any growth in such aspects of our daily life, others may rightfully question the security of our life in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only by growing in particular things will our church life become steady, stable, and secure.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The more we grow in Christ, the more of the church life we put on.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The church life is not a matter of good character or good works.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is altogether a matter of growth into Christ in particular things.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>By growing day by day in Christ, we gradually put off the old social life and put on the church the new man as the new community life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As we grow, we take Christ both as our life and as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Growth depends upon Christ making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we do not give Christ the opportunity to make His home in us, we can neither take Him as our person nor have the genuine growth in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We grow in Christ only by taking Him as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The more we take Christ as our person, the more we grow up into Christ in particular things.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The result is that we put on more of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is possible to be in the church life merely in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, if we do not grow in Christ by taking Him as our person, we are not in the church life in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The reality and practicality of the church life consists in growing up into Christ, which in turn is based upon taking Christ as our person in particular matters.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As we take Christ as our person and grow up into Him, the church life is constituted into our being, and we become part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is the proper church life.</S>
