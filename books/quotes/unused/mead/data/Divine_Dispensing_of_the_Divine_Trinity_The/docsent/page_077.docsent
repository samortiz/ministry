   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAW OF THE SAVING AND REIGNING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 8:2 Paul says, For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The life in 8:2 is the saving life in 5:10 and the reigning life in 5:17.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, 8:2 is the direct continuation of 5:10 and 17.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The saving and reigning life has a law, and this is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may also say that this law is the law of the saving and reigning life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter eight we have the continuation and the development of the saving and reigning life revealed in chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Romans 8 we have not only the saving and reigning life itself; we have the Spirit and also the law of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE TRIUNE GOD AND HIS PROCESS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As Paul was writing chapter eight of Romans, he had a number of wonderful matters in view.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this chapter he puts these matters together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, in Romans 8 we have the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 15 speaks of the Father: For you have not received a spirit of slavery to fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 3 speaks of the Son: God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This chapter speaks of the Spirit again and again vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2, 5, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 23, 26, and 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, in Romans 8 we see the Trinity of the Godhead; that is, we see the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this chapter we also see the process through which the Triune God has passed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 3 we have the incarnation, for this verse says that God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This involves incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second, in Romans 8 the death of Christ is strongly implied.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 11 says that God raised Christ Jesus from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How could the Lord have been resurrected if He had not died?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, here we have incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this chapter the resurrection of Christ is revealed in a rich way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This chapter emphasizes the resurrection because it is a chapter on the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reality of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not try to separate the Spirit from resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only in the Spirit can we have a full realization of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Romans 8, therefore, is concerned with both the Spirit and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because this chapter refers to incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, we may say that it reveals the process through which the Triune God has passed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A DESCRIPTION OF OUR EXPERIENCE The Regenerated Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Romans 8 Paul also has much to say regarding our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this chapter he not only speaks of the Spirit of God, but also speaks of our regenerated human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, 8:10 says, And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The spirit in this verse, of course, is our spirit, not the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because we have Christ in us, our spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this reason, we need continually to turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever you feel that you are weak or tired, you need to turn to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Are you tempted to lose your temper?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Turn to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have a part of our being that is life, and this part is our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No matter how young or new a believer may be in the Lord, the regenerated spirit of that one is life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Praise the Lord that in the New Testament there is a verse that tells us that our spirit is life!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Mind Set on the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Romans 8:6 says, For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have seen from verse 10 that our regenerated spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now according to this verse we see that the mind set on the spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all know that our mind is troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, doubts arise from the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All day long we are bothered by our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But according to verse 6, even our troublesome mind can be life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this verse Paul clearly says that the mind set on the spirit is life and also peace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, our spirit is life, and it is possible for our mind to be life as well.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 8:6 we see the condition that must be fulfilled if our mind is to be life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This condition, this requirement, is that the mind be set on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If our mind is set on the flesh, the mind will be death.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But if we turn our mind to the spirit and set it on the spirit, our mind will be life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many of us can testify of this from our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For example, suppose you are tempted to be angry with a certain person.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you set your mind on the flesh, surely you will be angry.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But if you set your mind on the spirit, your mind will be life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>First our spirit becomes life through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then by being set on the spirit our mind can also become life.</S>
