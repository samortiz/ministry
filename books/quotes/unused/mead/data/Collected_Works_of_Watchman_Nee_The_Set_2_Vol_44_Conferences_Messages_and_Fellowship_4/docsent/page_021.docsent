   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH CARRYING OUT GOD'S WILL ON EARTH Subduing the Rulers and Authorities</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church has a great responsibility on the earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the negative side, the church has to subdue the power of darkness and continue the warfare that Christ waged against Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the positive side, the church brings God's will to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Wherever we are, we should stand firm.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we read the daily news, we can find where the enemy is working, and we should render proper, opposing prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second Corinthians 10:4 says, "For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful before God for the overthrowing of strongholds."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ephesians 6:12 says, "For our wrestling is not against blood and flesh but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our prayer must be powerful before God in order to oppose the power of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before we can reign in the future, we have to learn to rule over everything today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We rule over the thrones on earth by the throne in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Believers fail because they have not exercised their authority; they have not prayed to reign over the political events.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As soon as we see the devil's power or work, we should exercise our authority to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If there were no Christians on earth today, the world would be like hell.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to learn to exercise the overcoming authority of Christ to rule over the power of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Preaching the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everyone in this world is a captive of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But God wants the Christians to recapture the captives through the gospel and win them back to God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When God wins one more person, Satan has one less person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First Timothy 2:4 says, "Who desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This shows that the gospel is part of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God delivers men with the purpose of saving them to the extent that God's authority can be fully manifested through them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God wants us to preach the gospel and through it to carry out His will.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who do not open their mouths and do not testify for God have failed to uphold God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Casting out Demons</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every believer should be able to cast out demons; this act also carries out God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we cast out the demons by the Spirit of God, the kingdom of God has come upon us Matt 12:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Overturning Anything Not Found in Heaven</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to overturn anything on earth that is not found in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In heaven there is no lawlessness, sickness, weakness, or hunger because God's will is done in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If these things come to us through God's permission, they will go away after awhile Matt 10:29; Job 38:8-11; Jer 5:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if they are from Satan, they will not go away, even after months and years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to differentiate between the things that God has allowed to come upon us and the things that Satan has set to ensnare us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to reject anything that comes to us without God's permission.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The earth should have only that which is found in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whatever heaven does not have should not be found on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the church's responsibility on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Absolutely Obeying God's Will</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church must obey God's will absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His will must be done in man before it can be done on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nothing can replace God's will, not even sacrifice, zeal, or work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not a matter of good or evil but a matter of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a work cannot be linked to God's will and cannot inflict loss to the gates of Hades, it is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God brings us through many trials because He wants His will to be done, not because He is cruel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God tests us again and again to see what and who we are living for.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not Having Private Associations</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the casting out of the demon in Acts 19:13-16, we see that the enemy fears only those who do not associate with him in private.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He recognizes those who refuse to associate with him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the kingdom of the demons, a well-recognized name carries much weight.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The devil knows and fears men such as Paul, whose names are well-recognized and who are absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some Christians secretly want to associate themselves with the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The devil only laughs at such ones because they are not absolute for God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They can never shake the gates of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only those who are absolute and who do not associate themselves with the devil privately will bring God's will to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Praying</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Genuine prayer is a joint labor with God to bring His kingdom to the earth and to carry out His will on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, prayer is nothing less than a spiritual battle 2 Cor 10:2, 4; Matt 6:10; Eph 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Prayer overturns the power of darkness and opens the way for God's will to be executed on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Not Belonging to the World</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are above the world; we do not belong to this world John 17:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Through the cross God delivered us out of this world unto Himself and His will Gal 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should not belong to this world, and we should not return to the reign of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once we are not of this world, Satan will not have any ground in us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we are not of this world, we will be free from Satan's authority, and we will be delivered from His reign and kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In this way, God's will can be carried out on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>May God execute His will and accomplish His purpose through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The church's responsibility on the earth today is to perpetuate Christ's victory on the earth and to bring in God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the church is faithful to its position and responsibility, God's eternal purpose will be accomplished.</S>
