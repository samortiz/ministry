<p class="bold">WEEK 7 — DAY 3</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 10:1, 7-10, 14-15</h2><p class="bold">1 &nbsp;And He called His twelve disciples to Him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they would cast them out and heal every disease and every sickness.</p><p class="bold">7 &nbsp;And as you go, proclaim, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.</p><p class="bold">8 &nbsp;Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.</p><p>9 &nbsp;Do <sup>1</sup>not acquire for yourselves gold nor silver nor copper for your belts;</p><p>10 &nbsp;No bag for the journey nor two tunics nor sandals nor a staff; for the worker is worthy of his food.</p><p>14 &nbsp;And whoever does not receive you nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.</p> <p>15 &nbsp;Truly I say to you, It will be <sup>1</sup>more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>In 10:1-4 we have the appointment of the twelve apostles. Prior to chapter ten the Lord carried out His kingly ministry alone. But beginning in this chapter the twelve apostles were added for the enlarging, the spread, of the ministry.</p><p>The authority here [v. 1] to cast out unclean spirits and heal diseases is a foretaste of the power of the coming age (Heb. 6:5), that is, of the millennium, in which all demons will be cast out and all diseases will be healed (Isa. 35:5-6).</p><p>An apostle is a sent one. Now the twelve disciples (v. 1) were to be sent; thus they became the twelve apostles. In sending out the twelve apostles, the Lord arranged them in pairs.…We need to be impressed with this principle. We all must be paired. None of us, especially the young people, should go anywhere by ourselves. We need another one to match us.…Whenever you are burdened by the Lord to go to a certain place, do not go by yourself. Rather, go in pairs. If you do not have another one to match you, you will miss the blessing. In order to receive the blessing, you must be paired. This is not my opinion; it is the Lord’s economy. Hence, we all must learn the lesson to be paired, to be matched with others.</p><p>In 10:5-15 we have the way to spread the gospel of the kingdom to the house of Israel. In verses 5 and 6 we see that the Lord Jesus charged the twelve apostles not to go into the way of the Gentiles or into a city of the Samaritans, but only to “the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” The Samaritans were a mixture of Gentiles and Jewish blood (2 Kings 17:24; Ezra 4:10; John 4:9).</p><p>When the Lord sends us,…the authority, the presence of the Lord, and the peace follow us. This is the reason the Lord told the apostles to look for one worthy of their peace [Matt. 10:11, 13].…To receive the Lord’s sent ones, the apostles, means to receive the presence of the Lord and the peace. To reject them means to reject the presence of the Lord and the peace. It is not an insignificant matter to be sent by the Lord, for as sent ones, we become the Lord’s representatives.…Wherever we go, we bring [His authority, His presence, and His peace] with us. (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 361-364)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>9<sup>1</sup> The twelve apostles (sent to the house of Israel, not to the Gentiles), as workers worthy of their food, did not need to bring their necessities with them. (However, the Lord’s workers sent to the Gentiles should take nothing from the Gentiles—3 John 7.) This principle was changed after the Lord had been fully rejected by the house of Israel (Luke 22:35-38).</p><p>15<sup>1</sup> Indicating that the punishment resulting from God’s judgment is in varying degrees. Rejecting the Lord’s apostles and their words (v. 14) will bring more punishment than will the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 361-364; Hymns: #913</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
