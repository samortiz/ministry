   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A Model of the Christian Life</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>and the Church Life</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must see a vision concerning the Triune God embodied in Man, a Man who lived the life of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The incarnation was the dispensing of the Triune God into humanity, and the Son s living was the result of such a dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Man Jesus was a model confirming to us that the dispensing of the Triune God into humanity works!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In human history there was at least one Person who was the result of God s dispensing and who lived a life of the divine nature mingled with the life of the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I was younger I wondered why our God needed to become a Man to live on this earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For thirty years He lived in a carpenter s home.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Seemingly He did not do anything; He just lived there.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To me there was no need of that.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need a Savior, and a Redeemer, but why did our Lord need to live on this earth for thirty years, seemingly doing nothing?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even the Lord Jesus work for three and a half years did not involve much; He traveled mainly in Palestine, a narrow strip of land about three hundred miles from north to south and about one hundred miles from east to west.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually He only gathered one hundred twenty Acts 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Among these one hundred twenty there was not one with a doctor s degree.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Most were unlearned, some were fishermen, and then there were a group of women, one of whom was possessed by seven demons.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Seemingly, Jesus did not do much in the way of work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Actually, He did something quite significant.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He lived a life which is a model, a pattern, of the Christian life and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This shows that God does not treasure that much what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God treasures His dispensing and how much of the divine dispensing has been imparted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Jesus was altogether the aggregate of the divine dispensing, the embodiment of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He lived a life as a Man saturated with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His living was the expression of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He lived in Nazareth for thirty years doing no work because His burden and His intention was not to work, but to live a life that was the result of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In every page of the four Gospels we can see a picture of the divine dispensing lived out by this Man Jesus.</S>
