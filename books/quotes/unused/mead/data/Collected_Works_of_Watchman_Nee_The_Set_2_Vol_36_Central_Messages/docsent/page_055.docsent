   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"WHO BECAME...FROM GOD"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have spoken of our being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we will speak on Christ being in us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How can Christ be in us?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is in us because of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because the Lord Jesus has resurrected and because He is now in the Holy Spirit He is not merely a man, but a man in the Spirit , He can be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord said that His flesh is meat indeed and His blood is drink indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He can be eaten by us John 6:53-56 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If He were still a man like He was when He was on earth, He could not be eaten by us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We eat the fruit of the tree of life; we do not eat the tree of life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot eat the tree; there is no way we can take the tree into us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was like the tree of life; there was no way for us to take Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the same way, there is no way for us to take a person into us today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the Lord Jesus were not a resurrected Lord, if He were only a Lord who once lived on the earth, He could only be Himself forever, while I could only be myself forever.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There would be no way for us to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It would not matter how holy and lovely Jesus of Nazareth was; there would be no way for us to receive Him, because He would only be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But thank the Lord that He is not only a man today; He has died and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the Holy Spirit, He has become the Lord whom we can receive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Holy Spirit is the Lord's coming in another form 14:16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Another name for the Holy Spirit is "the Spirit of Jesus" Acts 16:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is also called "the Spirit of Christ" Rom 8:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Lord Jesus put on the Holy Spirit, He became a "receivable" Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If He had not become such a Lord, we would not be able to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ has resurrected and put on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we receive the Holy Spirit, we receive Christ; in the same way, when we receive the Son, we receive the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When men in the past saw the Father, they saw the Son; in the same way, when men know the Spirit today, they know the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus has resurrected, and He is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we can receive Him into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All those who have received the Lord Jesus, whether they are clear or not, have received this experience from God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has put us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the first thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The second thing is that He has made Christ our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Neither of these two things have been done by us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot get into Christ by ourselves, and we cannot put Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Both things could only be accomplished by God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ became wisdom to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First I would point out the proper punctuation for the second part of 1 Corinthians 1:30.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the original language, there should be a colon after the words "wisdom to us from God."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that wisdom includes the following three things: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First Corinthians 1 3 speaks of God's wisdom and man's wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Wisdom is the subject, and righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are the explanation of how Christ becomes our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What does this verse mean?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to understand this verse, we must first consider what life is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suppose a temptation comes and stirs you up.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You know that you have to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But where does this patience come from?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Your life supplies you with patience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You need to have life before you can exercise your patience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When you do not have life, you are dead, and there is no way for you to practice patience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You must supply and sustain your patience with life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Suppose you realize that laziness is wrong, and you want to be diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you are diligent, your life is making you diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Suppose a man has encountered hardships, and you think that you should love him and help him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Where does this love come from?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is your life that compels you to love.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, the inward reaction that is produced every time we encounter something is the result of the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These reactions originate from your life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The source of power for these reactions is life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Without life there can be no reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We only react when there is life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Every moment of our life we are dealing with things, and every moment we have reactions.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We deal with the demands of the outward world moment by moment with our life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Moment by moment we are exercising our life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God has not given us Christ so that He could just die for us on the cross; He has given Christ to us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Originally, we react to all the demands that are outside of us by exercising our own life; we act according to our own life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If our own life is strong enough, we make it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If our own life is not strong enough, we do not make it, or worse, we collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We react with our own life and deal with outward matters with our own life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But God has given Christ to us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Before we received the Lord Jesus, we lived by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After we receive the Lord Jesus, God wants Him to live inside of us and live for us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When the Lord Jesus becomes our life within, we do not have to live by our original life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is not a matter of the Lord Jesus giving us commands, suggestions, or teachings and then us carrying them out.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Rather, He becomes our life within and carries things out for us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>From now on, we should live by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Formerly, we responded to outward demands with our own life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Now we should allow Christ's life to respond to them.</S>
