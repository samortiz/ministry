   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Justified by Faith</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Abraham, as a called one, was justified by faith Gen 15:6; Rom 4:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The fallen ones depend on their work, but the called ones believe in God's work, not in their own work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No fallen person can be justified by works in the sight of God Rom 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the called ones, having been called by God out of the fallen race, put no trust in their own effort; they trust in God's work of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Abraham and all other believers are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"They which be of faith are blessed with the believing Abraham" Gal 3:9, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>. The blessing of God's promise, "the promise of the Spirit" Gal 3:14 , is for the believing ones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By faith we received the Spirit, which is the reality and realization of Christ Gal 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, both Abraham and we are associated with Christ and joined to Him by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is by faith in God's work of grace that God's called people are justified by Him and participate in Christ, their eternal portion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Living by Faith</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hebrews 11:8 says that Abraham was called, and that he answered this call by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then, verse 9 says that he also lived in the good land by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the called one of God, not only was Abraham justified by faith, but he also lived by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As one called by God, he should no longer live and walk by himself, but live and walk by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For Abraham to live and walk by faith meant that he had to reject himself, to forget himself, to set himself aside, and to live by Someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whatever he had by nature had to be set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we compare Genesis 11:31 and 12:1 with Acts 7:2-3, we see that when God called Abraham in Ur of the Chaldees, he was very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Abraham did not take the initiative to leave Babel; his father, Terah, did.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This forced God to take away Abraham's father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Genesis 12:1 God called him again, telling him to leave not only his country and his kindred, but also his father's house, which meant not to bring anyone with him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But once again Abraham, like us, was weak and he took Lot, his nephew Gen 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is an Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>An Abraham is a person who has been called out, who no longer lives and walks by himself, and who forsakes and forgets everything he has by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is exactly the message of the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Galatians 3 says that we are the sons of Abraham and that we should live by faith, not by our works.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Galatians 2:20 says that to live by faith means "not I, but Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I, the natural I who came out of the fallen race, have been crucified and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, it is no longer I, but Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are true Jews, the real descendants of Abraham, we must leave everything and live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must forget about all that we can do and repudiate all that we are and have by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christians appreciate Abraham very much.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, we should not esteem Abraham too highly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was not that outstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was called, but he did not dare to leave Babel; his father took him out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This forced God to remove his father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then Abraham relied on his nephew, Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After this, he put his trust in his servant, Eliezer Gen 15:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It seemed that God was saying, "Abraham, I don't like to see your father with you, I don't like to see your nephew with you, and I don't like to see Eliezer with you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I want you to have no one to rely upon.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You must rely on Me. Don't depend upon anything else or anything you have by nature." This is believing in God, walking in Him, and living by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is no longer I, but Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are real Jews, then we are real Abrahams.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to be an Abraham, we must believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To believe in the Lord is to become associated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Abraham was called out of the fallen race, and he became associated with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All the sons of Abraham must likewise be associated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other words, if we are the seed of Abraham, we belong to Christ and we are associated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we would be associated with Christ, we must repudiate ourselves and take Christ as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is believing in Christ, and this believing is righteousness in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not try to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Simply believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The fallen race always likes to do something, to work and to exert some effort.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But God says, "Come out of that.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You are the called race.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Don't try, don't do, and don't work any more!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Forget your past.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Forget what you are, what you can do, and what you have.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Forget everything, and put your full trust in Me. I am your good land.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Live in Me, and live by Me."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These are the real Abrahams, the real Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As the sons of God, they trust in God and forget about themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>These are the ones who make up the generation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We all must be Abrahams, those who forget their past, give up what they are and have, and put their trust in Christ, their good land.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Today our walk and our living must be by faith in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If so, then, as heirs of God's promise, as those who inherit the promise of the Spirit, we shall participate in Christ as God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At a certain time the Lord asked Abraham to offer Isaac, the one God had given according to His promise, for a burnt offering Gen 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Lord had given Isaac to Abraham; now Abraham had to give Isaac back to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord had already charged him to cast out Ishmael Gen 21:10, 12 ; now He charged him to kill his son Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Are you able to do this?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What a difficult lesson this is!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Nevertheless, this is the way to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Last month or last week you may have experienced Christ in a certain way, but today the Lord says, "Consecrate that experience.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>That was a real experience of Christ, but don't keep it."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Again, the lesson is to never trust in what we have, not even in what God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If God has given you something, it must be given back to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is the daily walk by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>To walk in the presence of the Lord by faith means that we do not hold on to anything, not even to the things given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The best gifts, given by the Lord Himself, must be given back to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Do not keep anything as something to rely on; rely only and always on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Abraham did this.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Eventually he lived and walked in the presence of God purely by faith.</S>
