<p>The present trouble among us had its beginning in the past, but the fermentation or leavening process was not significantly manifested until 1985. This fermenting process has continued over the past few years and has become fully exposed this year (1989). In August of this year, the brothers who are taking the lead in the present trouble began to publish a paper called <em>The Word and the Testimony</em> in open opposition to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and ministry.</p>
<p>From 1984 to 1986 I called three urgent elders&rsquo; trainings. The first was in February 1984, the second in September 1985, and the last in February 1986 (see <em>Elders&rsquo; Training, Books 1-8,</em> published by Living Stream Ministry). My opening word in two of these three elders&rsquo; trainings was concerning the danger of division.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Intention to Do an Extra Work<br />
in the Unique Work of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery</h2>
<p>The present problem among us came out of something which was hidden in the past. One of these hidden things was the intention to do an extra work in the unique work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. In the recovery there is a definite work which is for the building up of the local churches unto the building up of the universal Body of Christ. This is the work. But among us, there was a case of someone who wanted to do an extra work within the work. This person would not leave the recovery or give up the church life. Instead, he insisted on having a particular work of his own, by his own effort, within the recovery. This was a divisive factor.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Tendency to Keep Separate Territories</h2>
<p>Another hidden divisive factor is the tendency to keep separate territories. The Lord&rsquo;s work and move for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal economy is uniquely one. If we consider any region in which we are participating in the Lord&rsquo;s unique work as our particular territory, this will be a cause or a factor of division. Even the tendency to keep a separate territory should be uprooted. We should work for the Lord within His measure (2 Cor. 10:13-16), but we should not consider what the Lord has measured to us as our particular territory. Our local work in our region should be for the Lord&rsquo;s universal Body. In the New Testament we cannot see such a thing as jurisdiction in the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Way of Not Having One&rsquo;s Work<br />
Mingled with Others&rsquo; Work</h2>
<p>In the past there was the hidden factor of working in a way of not having one&rsquo;s work mingled with others&rsquo; work. The New Testament unveils to us that Peter&rsquo;s work for the Lord, mainly in the Jewish land, and Paul&rsquo;s, mainly in the Gentile world, were all for the one Body of Christ, without any distinction or separation. Rather, they were one in the carrying out of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The effect of Peter&rsquo;s work was realized in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:12), and Paul did go to Jerusalem to fellowship with the apostles and elders there (Acts 15:2, 4; 21:17-20a). This kind of fellowship, like the blood circulation of our physical body, helps the Body of Christ in the circulation of the divine life. It mingles the different pieces of our work for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery into one move. If our work is void of this kind of fellowship, this may develop into another factor of division.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Hidden Expectation of Being<br />
a Prominent Figure in the Lord&rsquo;s Work</h2>
<p>There was also the hidden expectation of being a prominent figure in the Lord&rsquo;s work. We cannot deny that this &ldquo;gopher&rdquo; of ambition was among us. If you are ambitious and have the capacity, your capacity may neutralize your ambition, and there may be no problem. The problem among us today is that a number of brothers have ambition but do not have the capacity. Ambition plus incapacity is a real problem.</p>
<p>If all the ambitious brothers had the capacity, their capacity could swallow up the ugliness of their ambition. But if they have ambition without the capacity for their ambition, their ambition with their incapacity causes them to become dropouts. If you desire to be a prominent figure and you have that capacity, you may become such a person. If all the churches are helped by you and all the churches listen to you, you may become a prominent figure. But if you do not have the capacity and you want to become prominent, this is when a problem comes in.</p>
<p>We can see the difference in capacity with Barnabas and Paul in Acts. Barnabas was used by the Lord to bring Saul, who became Paul, into the ministry (Acts 9:26-27; 11:22-26). Furthermore, in Acts 13 Barnabas&rsquo;s name was mentioned first when the list of prophets and teachers in Antioch was recorded and when the Spirit set Barnabas and Saul apart for the work. Shortly after they went out, the matter of capacity arose. At the beginning of the journey, Barnabas was always mentioned first (vv. 2, 7); then Paul&rsquo;s name began to be mentioned first (vv. 9, 13, 16, 46, 50). Paul&rsquo;s name was mentioned first because his capacity to meet the need at that time was greater than Barnabas&rsquo;s, and he eventually became the leading speaker (14:12). Paul began to take the lead on their journey because he had a greater capacity. Barnabas did not have the capacity that Paul had. Later, Paul wrote fourteen Epistles. Who could speak as much, as deeply, or as high as Paul spoke? Of all the writers of the New Testament, Paul was the only one to use the term <em>the Body of Christ.</em> The other writers did not use this term or the term <em>economy,</em> because they did not have as great a capacity as Paul.</p>
<p>When Paul and Barnabas returned from their trip to Antioch, a big problem arose concerning circumcision, and the church in Antioch sent them to Jerusalem to fellowship so that the problem could be solved (Acts 15:1-3). After the problem of circumcision was solved and they returned from Jerusalem to Antioch, they wanted to make another journey (v. 36). At this juncture Barnabas wanted to bring his cousin, John Mark (v. 37; Col. 4:10), on the journey. But Paul would not agree to bring Mark along, because Mark had left Barnabas and Paul in a negative way on their first ministry journey (Acts 13:13 and note 1). Barnabas&rsquo;s desire that Mark go with them was simply according to his own feeling. As a result, Barnabas and Paul separated from each other (15:39). From that point on, even though Barnabas might have gone out to visit the churches, his ministry was finished as far as the holy record in Acts is concerned.</p>
<p>According to my understanding, the problem between Paul and Barnabas consisted mainly of two points. First, Barnabas might have had some hidden unhappiness within him, because he took the lead at the beginning and later Paul began to take the lead since Barnabas had a smaller capacity. This was not an easy matter to overcome. If Barnabas had been happy about this development, that would have been a great mercy to Barnabas. Second, according to the record in Acts 15, Barnabas did not keep a proper principle in taking John Mark with him. Apparently, he did this only because of his own personal feeling concerning his cousin. This violated the spiritual principle. Barnabas should have submitted to Paul&rsquo;s way of not taking John Mark in order to allow Mark to learn the lesson. Instead of submitting to Paul, Barnabas took his own way, and this resulted in a separation between him and Paul. Paul had a greater capacity than Barnabas, and because of this, he eventually was the one to take the lead in the ministry.</p>
<p>For more than twenty-five years in this country, I never told people that I was an apostle. But in these past few years, some brothers began to talk considerably about apostles and have said that there are not one, but many apostles among us. This is a shame! In a meeting of the church in Anaheim on August 28, 1988, one of the sixteen points concerning the standing of the church in Anaheim, a point presented by a certain brother, was that there are many apostles among us today, not just one. He said that he would give a list of these apostles to any of the saints who were interested. One brother asked for and received such a list from that brother. The list included seven names, with a question mark beside one of the names, and it did not include the name of the one who gave the list.</p>
<p>Shortly after I received news concerning this list, I went to Taipei, and I gave a message there concerning the three different kinds of apostles (see <em>A Timely Trumpeting and the Present Need,</em> pp. 25-29, published by Living Stream Ministry). The seven brothers on that list were all under my ministry. According to the truth concerning the kinds of apostles, this would make them apostles like Timothy, Titus, and Silas, who were produced by the Lord&rsquo;s directly appointed apostles. After this message was published, another word came out saying that there are <em>no</em> apostles today. This is similar to what John Nelson Darby taught. Later, still another word came out saying that there are only twelve apostles&mdash;the eleven, who were selected by the Lord Jesus, and Paul. It was said that the selection of Matthias by lot in Acts 1 was wrong. But according to the Bible, when Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost (2:14), he stood up with the eleven, which included Matthias.</p>
<p>This kind of speaking is based on whatever would be a benefit to the speaker and does not have the standard of truth. This is a basic problem.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Present Turmoil in the Lord's Recovery and the Direction of the Lord's Move Today &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
