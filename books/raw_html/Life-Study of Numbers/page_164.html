<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Distributing of the Plunder,<br>Both of Man and of Cattle</H2><P>In 31:25-47 we have the distributing of the plunder, both of man and of cattle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Half Given to Those Who Went to War<br>and Half to All the Assembly</H2><P>"Take the sum of the plunder that was taken, both of man and of beast, you and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers' houses of the assembly; and divide the plunder into two parts, between those who engage in battle and went out to the war and all the assembly" (vv. 26-27). Here we see something marvelous: the fighters received half of the plunder, and the other half was given to those who stayed behind and who probably prayed for the ones who went out to war.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. One out of Five Hundred<br>of the Persons and of the Cattle<br>from the Portion for the Men Who Went to War Being Given to Jehovah as a Tribute</H2><P>"Levy for Jehovah a tribute from the men of battle who went out to the war, one out of five hundred, of the persons and of the oxen and of the asses and of the flocks" (v. 28). This tribute was to be a kind of memorial before God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Tribute for Jehovah Going to Eleazar<br>the Priest as a Heave Offering of Jehovah</H2><P>"Take it from their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest as a heave offering of Jehovah" (v. 29). Because Eleazar the priest was one with Jehovah, whatever was given to Jehovah as a tribute by the fighters went to Eleazar the priest. What was given to Eleazar became a heave offering. This signifies that the tribute was put into ascension for a memorial before Jehovah and that this eventually became the high priest's portion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. One out of Fifty from the Half<br>for the Assembly Being Given to the Levites<br>Who Keep the Charge of the Tabernacle of Jehovah</H2><P>"From the half of the sons of Israel you shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the oxen, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all the cattle, and give them to the Levites who keep the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah" (v. 30). Thus, the high priest received his portion, and the Levites received their portion. This was according to Moses' wisdom, which he received from God.</P><P>The distribution of the plunder included all kinds of persons among the Israelites. This distribution covered those who went to war and those who stayed back. It also covered the high priest and the Levites. Regarding the distribution of the plunder, there is no record of any opinion or proposal. The people received their portion without expressing any opinion and without making any proposal.</P>
