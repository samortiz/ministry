   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this message we want to continue our fellowship concerning the Lord s pattern as a man of prayer in the record of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>E. Training His Disciples to Learn from Him</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>in the Miracle of Feeding Five Thousand People 1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Taking the Five Loaves and Two Fish,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Looking Up to Heaven, and Blessing Them</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the performing of the miracle of feeding five thousand people with five loaves and two fish, He trained His disciples to learn from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Matthew 11:29 the Lord told the disciples that they needed to learn from Him, indicating that He was their pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Matthew 14:19 says that He took the five loaves and two fish and when He was going to bless them, He looked up to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words, He blessed the food by looking up to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Looking up to heaven indicates that He was looking up to His Father in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that He realized the source of the blessing was not Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was the sent One.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The sent One should not be the source of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The sending One, the Father, should be the source of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here is a great lesson for us to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Most readers of the Bible would pay attention to the miracle of creating something from nothing performed by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 14.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we need to see the pattern which the Lord set up for us here.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to remember that He looked up to the Father in heaven and blessed the five loaves and two fish in front of His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After His blessing in this way, He told the disciples what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No doubt, what He did was a pattern for the disciples to learn from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to this pattern, we have to realize that we are not the Sender, but the ones sent by the Sender.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Regardless of how much we can do, we should realize that we still need the blessing from the source, from our Sender, that we can pass on to the benefited ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a big lesson which I want to stress.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A co-worker who is invited to speak somewhere may think that since he has been speaking for the Lord for many years, he knows how to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All of us need to drop this kind of attitude and realize that we are not the source.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No blessing is of us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Regardless of how much we can do or how much we know what to do, we must realize that we need the Sender s blessing upon our doing by trusting in Him, not in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even when we take our meals, we should learn of the Lord to look up to the Father as the source.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we bless our food, we should bless it by looking up to the source of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>a. Being One with the Father</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His looking up to the Father in heaven indicated that as the Son on earth sent by the Father in heaven, He was one with the Father, trusting in the Father John 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a very important principle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whenever I speak for the Lord, I must have the sensation that I am one with the Lord, trusting in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What I know and what I can do mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Being one with the Lord and trusting in Him mean everything in our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should never go to minister the word by remaining in ourselves and by trusting in what we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we trust in what we can do, we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The blessing comes only by our being one with the Lord and trusting in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not Doing Anything from Himself</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord did not do anything from Himself John 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This was also a pattern to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was the One through whom the entire universe was created, but He would not do anything from Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the denying of our self, which He taught so much.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He said that anyone who follows Him must take up his cross and deny himself Matt 16:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He lived a life of denying Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The learned professors in the universities do many things in order to attract people s attention, displaying what they know and can do.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But we are not today s professors; we are today s God-men, the duplication of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should deny ourselves and not have the intention of doing anything from ourselves but have the intention of doing everything from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is to practice the teaching of denying the self by doing things with the Lord.</S>
