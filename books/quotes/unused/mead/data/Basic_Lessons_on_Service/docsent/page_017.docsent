   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Hymn #52 Hymns is a very good hymn on the worship of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Stanzas 2 and 3 say:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How deep the holy joy that fills that scene,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Where love is known!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thy love, our God and Father, now is seen,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Him alone;</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As, in the holy calm of Thine own rest,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He leads the praise of those Thy love has blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He leads the praise!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How precious to Thine ear</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The song He sings!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How precious, too, to Thee how near, how dear</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Are those He brings</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To share His place: 'twas thus that Thou didst plan;</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thou lovedst Him before the world began.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This hymn is simple and short, yet high in its thought and full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It would be good to ask the saints to read these stanzas so that they can be impressed with the significance of worshipping the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Warning</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Related to our partaking of the Lord's table, there is also a warning in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>a. Proving Ourselves and Discerning the Body</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to prove ourselves and discern the Body at the Lord's table 1 Cor 11:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to discern whether the bread on the table signifies the unique Body of Christ or a sect, a division, a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is why we can take the Lord's table only in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We cannot partake of the so-called communion in other places because that bread on the table does not signify the Body but a division.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever we go to a place to attend the Lord's table, we must prove to ourselves that the bread on the table really signifies the Lord's Body, without any division.</S>
