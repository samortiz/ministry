<p>In conclusion, let us look at the picture in Revelation 22. In the New Jerusalem there is a river of water of life flowing from the throne. The throne is a matter of authority, and the flowing water of life is a matter of fellowship. The flow of water signifies fellowship, and this flow is related to authority. This is the source of the building up of the New Jerusalem. In the church today the water of life from the throne should be flowing freely among us. Nevertheless, in our present condition it is not flowing freely. Although the water of life may flow to you, it is not easy for it to flow out of you to others. Thus, it ceases to flow. The water of life must flow into us and out of us. When the flow of life comes to us from the throne, it seems to run into barriers that prevent it from flowing out of us. In order for the church to be built up, we need to be transformed. However, this transformation can be produced only from the flowing of the water of life. Genesis 2:10-12 shows that the flowing river produces gold, bdellium (pearl), and onyx (precious stones). The New Jerusalem is built with these three kinds of precious materials. Without the flow of life, without the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, there is no way for gold, pearl, and precious stones to be produced.</p>
<p>In this city of pure gold, the New Jerusalem, there is a throne, and a river of water of life proceeds out from the throne, flowing downward in a spiral fashion to encircle the entire city. The entire city is in this flow and is full of life. Is this the condition that we see in the church today? I am afraid that instead of life we have death, and instead of a flowing condition there is a stagnant condition. Hence, those of us who are serving, whether as elders, co-workers, or responsible ones, must release our spirits whenever we come together so that our spirits may be blended.</p>
<p>In learning to pray in a blended way in the spirit, the main point is to put aside the self; it is not to deal with our sins. According to our experience, if we deal with the self, our sins will be dealt with spontaneously. This can be likened to a person wearing an old, filthy, and stinking garment. He does not need to wash or patch it up, much less sterilize it. All he needs to do is to take it off and throw it away. This solves the problem.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4 says that we should put off the old man and put on the new man (vv. 22, 24). If we compare the reference to the new man in chapter 4 with the new man in 2:15, we can see that the new man is the church. When we put off our self and live in the church, we are putting off the old man and putting on the new man. We do not need to deal with our shortcomings and weaknesses. Our self is like an old, filthy rag that needs to be taken off and discarded; then we will not be in our self. Furthermore, we will live in the church and put on the church as the new man.</p>
<p>I have learned a secret: We do not need to focus on dealing with our sins, which often only brings us into death. We only need to put off the self by coming to the meeting, by releasing our spirit, by living in the Body, and by blending in the spirit. This is to put off our old man and to put on the new man, the church. In this way, we will be sanctified, victorious, and strong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYER</h2>
<p>O Lord, have mercy on us. In the building up of Your church, we want the line of fellowship as well as the line of authority. O Lord, we earnestly hope that everyone among us would be a royal priest who has the flow of life from the throne. We hope that in everyone of us there would be an expression of both the priesthood and the kingship. Lord, we look to You to fill us so that there is a balance among us between the priesthood and the kingship. We pray that You will bring us into continual fellowship with You so that the saints will enter into Your fellowship. Dear Lord, recover this matter! May all the saints long for this matter and pursue this matter in the spirit! Lord, we desire to have this balance. We desire that fellowship will balance authority and that authority will be coordinated with fellowship. O Lord, how we pray that we would have such a normal condition among us, with Your throne being established with its full authority and with the Holy Spirit flowing from the throne in full fellowship. Lord, grace us, that we may have a situation of life with authority so that all of us can fellowship in one spirit and be blended and built up together. Lord, if we are short in this, we will have no way to build up the church on this earth. O Lord, we submit to You, asking You to give us grace, asking You to manifest the priesthood and the kingship among us, and asking You to manifest the reality of living water that flows from the throne. Oh, it is so glorious that fellowship can be coordinated with authority! Lord, may Your building be fulfilled here. May Your plan be accomplished here. We earnestly desire that You would cause every saint to respond to this matter and that we would all rise up to pray, to fellowship, to release the spirit, and to blend with one another in the spirit! O Lord, fulfill this desire! In the name of the Lord Jesus, Amen.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
