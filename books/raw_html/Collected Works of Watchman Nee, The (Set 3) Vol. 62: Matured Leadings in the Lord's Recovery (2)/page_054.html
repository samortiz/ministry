<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRITUAL LIFE</h2><p>In reading the Bible and listening to messages, we have to learn to exercise our spirit. In our daily life, we have to ask ourselves continually, "Do I have the spirit when I am doing this?" The temptation of young people is to use their mind and to neglect their spirit. The first fall of man came about when he used his mind and neglected his spirit. A young man once asked me, "I have been studying theology for eight years. Every day I study the Bible for over ten hours. Why do I still not have any light?" I answered him, "Your mistake lies in your presupposition; you suppose that you will receive light by spending more time and effort. This is not possible. If this were the case, unbelievers could read the Bible and receive light as well." Only spiritual men can understand spiritual things. Only they can grasp the spiritual things. The same can be said about the practice of the ministry of the word. Only a spiritual man, one who exercises his spirit, can have light and revelation. In every aspect of our spiritual living, we have to exercise our spirit more than our mind.</p><p>A man can speak humble words, but this does not mean that he is a humble person, even though a humble person will always speak humble words. Similarly, a man can deliver spiritual messages, but this does not mean that he is a spiritual person, even though a spiritual person always delivers a spiritual message. A speaker should bear the Holy Spirit "upon his shoulder" and carry Him to others. The Holy Spirit is willing to let Himself be carried with some people, but He is not willing to let Himself be carried with others. If we want to carry the Holy Spirit, we must be spiritual persons who exercise the spirit. Some people may not be that clear with their messages. Their grammar may be all wrong. However, the Holy Spirit is able to use them to subdue others because they have the spirit. It is wrong for anyone to try to substitute the spirit with the word. This is actually impossible.</p><p>Some people have spirits that are of high, reliable, and of sterling quality. Others' spirits are low in quality. Mr. T. Austin-Sparks's words do not match his spirit. His spirit is of very high quality. When you hear Mr. Sparks pray, you can sense that his spirit is high, clean, and pure. We need a clean and strong spirit. Some people have a clean spirit, but it is weak. In my whole life I have only met two people who prayed with a strong and clean spirit&mdash;Brother Sparks and Miss Barber. The young ones must begin learning now. They must ask themselves again and again, "Does my speaking have the spirit? Is my spirit strong? Is it clean?" All the brothers and sisters must practice this until they become very experienced.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2><p>In order to have sensitive spiritual feelings and to walk according to the spirit, there are three conditions which we have to meet. First, we must be genuinely regenerated. Second, we must have an absolute consecration. Third, we must practice. If we have these three things, our spiritual consciousness will greatly increase after three months. In the coming days, when the brothers and sisters work together in coordination, they must not only take care of the business but also take care of their spirit in the course of their work. Learn to do nothing apart from the spirit. Whatever we do in the meeting, we must first ask, "Am I doing this apart from the spirit?" Whether we are singing, praying, or testifying, we have to do it with the spirit. Otherwise, we may be exhausting the brothers' and sisters' spirit. It is not a matter of opening or not opening the mouth but a matter of following the spirit. It is wrong if we open our mouth but do not use our spirit. It is also wrong, of course, if we do not open our mouth. We are not exhorting you to open your mouth, and we are not exhorting you to shut up. We are exhorting you instead to follow the Holy Spirit and to exercise your spirit. Do not grieve the Holy Spirit. If all the brothers and sisters can learn and practice this lesson, our spiritual feeling will become very keen, and God will do great things in the church.</p>
