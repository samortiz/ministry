   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO RECEIVE CHRIST'S</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REDEMPTION AND SALVATION By Faith</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can one experience Christ's redemption and salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The way is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul said in Ephesians 2:8 and 9 that "you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works that no one should boast."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Redemption and salvation are not something that we earn as merits.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They do not originate from ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are not through the works that we do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is nothing that a man can do to earn forgiveness or salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both forgiveness of sins and salvation in life are by faith, and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Faith Being to Substantiate</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ's Work of Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Faith is first the seeing of what God has done to Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hebrews 11:1 says that faith is the substantiation of things hoped for.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Just as our eyes substantiate color and sights to us, so faith substantiates to us God's redemptive work accomplished two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we see that God has judged Christ on our behalf, we are redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Faith Being to Receive</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ's Life in Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Faith is also a receiving of what Christ imparts to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John 1:12 tells us that those who believe in Christ are those who receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, to believe is just to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Faith is not to believe in something that does not exist; rather, it is simply to receive something that is already there and given to you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If someone gives you a watch, all you need to do is to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once you receive it, the watch becomes yours.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When God gives the saving life of Christ to us, all we need to do is to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once we receive this gift, it becomes ours forever.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is nothing we can do to add to what God has already done.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need only to receive it in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And there is nothing that can take away this gift once we have it; it is ours forever.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You may be very diligent to do good works.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You may be very sincere in doing penance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if you do not see Christ's accomplished work on the cross and do not receive His life in resurrection, you are still not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible says at least one hundred fifty times that man is justified, saved, and receives eternal life through faith alone Acts 16:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In these one hundred fifty times, no other condition is attached.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is faith and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Neither redemption nor salvation is through the works of man; both are works of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since they are works of God and since they are based on the righteousness of God and the life of Christ, they will never change.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can change, our mood can change, and our feelings can change, but God's righteous judgment will not change, nor will Christ's saving life change; they will stand forever.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even the heavens and the earth can change, but the righteous work of God and the saving life of Christ will never change.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ's redemption and salvation are forever "insured."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once a person is saved, he is forever saved John 10:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once you have received the gift of God, you will never lose it Rom 11:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once you become a child of God, you can never be lost again.</S>
