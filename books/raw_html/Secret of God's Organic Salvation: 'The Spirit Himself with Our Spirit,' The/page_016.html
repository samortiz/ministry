<h2 class="head1">II. THE SECRET OF TRANSFORMATION</h2><p>Transformation is the fifth section of God&rsquo;s organic salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Divine Life Added<br />to the Believers&rsquo; Redeemed Life</h2><p>Regeneration has added the divine life to the believers&rsquo; redeemed life, making the two a &ldquo;grafted&rdquo; life; thus, the believers participate in God&rsquo;s divinity.</p><p>Some Christian teachers hold strongly to the concept of what is called an &ldquo;exchanged life.&rdquo; This concept is found in the biography of J. Hudson Taylor written by his son and daughter-in-law. According to this concept, the Christian life is an exchanged life, a life in which we exchange our life for the divine life, the life of Christ. This teaching concerning an exchanged life is a great error. In the New Testament there is no such thing as an exchanged life. Yes, the first part of Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live.&rdquo; This, of course, is true: the old &ldquo;I&rdquo; has been crucified with Christ, and this &ldquo;I&rdquo; lives no longer. However, in this verse Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;The life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God.&rdquo; On the one hand, the old &ldquo;I&rdquo; has been crucified; on the other hand, there is a new &ldquo;I,&rdquo; and this new &ldquo;I&rdquo; lives by the faith of Christ. This is a matter not of an exchanged life but of a grafted life, two lives that have been grafted together to be one life. God has added His divine life to our redeemed human natural life and grafted our life with His life.</p><p>By means of this grafted life the believers participate in God&rsquo;s divinity. The believers are being mingled with God, and God is mingling Himself with them. As a result, the believers have divinity in their being and participate in God&rsquo;s divinity.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Believers Sanctified<br />in Their Nature with the Nature of God</h2><p>Sanctification has sanctified the believers, especially in their nature, with the holy nature of God to change their nature; thus, they also participate in God&rsquo;s divinity. The more we are sanctified, the more we participate in God&rsquo;s divinity.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Believers Renewed Mainly in Their Mind</h2><p>Renewing has renewed the believers mainly in their mind to change their mind with the mind of Christ; thus, they also participate in God&rsquo;s divinity.</p><p>Three things cause us to participate in God&rsquo;s divinity: regeneration, sanctification, and renewing. Regeneration changes our life, sanctification changes our nature, and renewing changes our mind. All three things enable the believers in Christ to participate in God&rsquo;s divinity. If we realize this, we will see that as believers we are not only human but also divine. Today we, the believers in Christ, are both divine and human. We are human and divine persons. Because we are divine as well as human, we are also mystical.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Believers&rsquo; Entire Being Transformed</h2><p>Transformation transforms the believers&rsquo; entire being, by the transforming Spirit in their spirit filled with Christ, into the glorious image of Christ, that they may fully participate in God&rsquo;s divinity. To be filled with Christ, who is divine, is to be filled with divinity. At present we are participating in God&rsquo;s divinity only partially, but when our entire being is transformed and filled with divinity, we will fully participate in God&rsquo;s divinity.</p>
