   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Preparation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Even though David had this desire, God did not allow David to build a house for Him because David had shed blood abundantly and waged great wars 1 Chron 22:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In typology, this refers to Christ in His suffering before He entered into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was not able to build the temple until He entered into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As long as Christ stayed in His suffering, the church could not be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In God s ordination, David could not build the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead, he did the preparation work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Materials</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First Chronicles 22:14 speaks of David s preparation of the materials.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>David told Solomon, Now then in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah...gold...silver and bronze and iron without weight, for it is in abundance; and timber and stone I have prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In his affliction David prepared all the materials for the building of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to typology, in His affliction Christ prepared all the materials for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Site</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>David not only prepared the materials but also the site for the building of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The site was the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite 21:18-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Solomon s time came, he simply carried out the building work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that in His suffering Christ prepared everything both the materials and the site needed for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, when Christ entered into glory, He could begin to build.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>David told Solomon that the materials that he had prepared were sufficient but that Solomon could add to them 22:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In reality, most of the materials were prepared in David s time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In principle, this shows that Christ in His suffering prepared all that was needed for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Solomon</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In typology, Solomon and David signify two aspects of one person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>David typifies Christ in His sufferings, and Solomon typifies Christ in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Being Glorified</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After Solomon was made king, the first thing he did was build the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that as soon as Christ entered into glory, He produced the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ s glorification is recorded at the end of the Gospels Matt 28; Mark 16:6-20; Luke 24:46-51; John 20:19-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then in the beginning of Acts, the church was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As recorded in Acts 2, the church was produced on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This can be compared to the day on which Solomon completed the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Solomon s being made king and his enthronement were his exaltation and glorification by the Israelites; these were absolutely related to the building of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Likewise, Christ s exaltation and glorification are absolutely related to the producing and building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Building the Temple</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As soon as Solomon was made king, he built the temple 1 Kings 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This typifies that as soon as Christ was glorified, He produced the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Ark Entering the Temple</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After Solomon completed the temple, the priests brought the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah into it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the day when the temple was dedicated to God, it was filled with the glory of God 8:6, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God obtained a dwelling place on the earth and caused His glory to fill it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once the temple was built up and God obtained a dwelling on earth, He could fully express His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The temple s dedication is a type of the day of Pentecost; once the church was produced on the earth, the glory of God was expressed on the earth and filled the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Building Materials The Preparation and Obtaining of the Materials</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The materials for the building of the temple were prepared in part by David and in part by Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we carefully read 1 Kings 5 through 6 and 1 Chronicles 22, 28, and 29, we will see that David prepared most of the materials for the building of the temple and that Solomon prepared a small part.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>David plus Solomon typify the complete Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>David typifies Christ in His death; thus, everything prepared by David typifies what Christ obtained in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Likewise, Solomon typifies Christ in His resurrection; everything Solomon prepared typifies what Christ obtained in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, the obtaining of the materials for the building of the church depends on Christ s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Most of these materials were obtained by Christ s death, and a small part was obtained by His resurrection.</S>
