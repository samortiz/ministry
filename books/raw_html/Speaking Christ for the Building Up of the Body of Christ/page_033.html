 <h2 class="head1">ENDEAVORING TO SPEAK EVERYTHING WITH A VERSE<br />
OR A PORTION OF THE SCRIPTURE AS ITS BASE</h2>
<p>We need to endeavor to speak everything in the meetings with a verse or a portion of the Scripture as its base. Our speaking must be based upon the Scripture. Thus, it is always good to pick up an appropriate verse to match our speaking. The Lord&rsquo;s speaking, the anointing, the power, and an appropriate verse from the Bible are all one. When all these elements are present, the word that we speak is the living Triune God. Our speaking must always be mingled and blended with the Triune God through the Spirit in His Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENDEAVORING TO TAKE CARE OF THE FLOW<br />
AND ATMOSPHERE OF THE MEETING</h2>
<p>Whenever we meet, we have the assurance of the Lord&rsquo;s promise that He is with us (Matt. 18:20). The Bible reveals that, as the Spirit, He is the breath and the wind. In John 3 the Greek word <em>pneuma</em> is translated into spirit (v. 6) and wind (v. 8). Whether <em>pneuma</em> means wind or spirit depends upon the context. Verse 8 says that it blows, and the sound of it can be heard. This indicates that it is the wind. A regenerated person is like the wind, which can be realized, but which is beyond understanding. The very Lord who is with us in our meetings is like the breath and the wind. On the day of Pentecost, the Spirit was like a rushing violent wind that filled the room where the believers were (Acts 2:2, 4). The Triune God was in that blowing wind because He Himself is the wind, the air, and the breath. In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word <em>ruach</em> can be translated into wind, breath, or spirit. In Ezekiel 37 <em>ruach</em> is translated in these three ways (vv. 5, 9, 14).</p>
<p>We believe that whenever we meet in the name of the Lord, He is with us as the air and the wind. The wind blows and flows. In the meeting there is a spiritual flow, and we must learn how to follow this flow. The Spirit may be flowing in a certain direction in a meeting, but we may behave against the flow and miss it. The flow always goes together with the atmosphere. The atmosphere of the meeting is the issue of the flow. Someone&rsquo;s speaking in a meeting may stop the flow of the meeting, and the entire meeting may be brought out of the flow and its accompanying atmosphere. Thus, we must learn to follow the flow and atmosphere of the meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING SPEAKING MERELY DOCTRINES,<br />
 THOUGH SCRIPTURAL</h2>
<p>In our meetings we should avoid speaking merely doctrines, though scriptural. We do not want mere doctrines without some reality for the Christian experience and without the supply of life. When we speak, we should minister the Spirit and the divine life into others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING REFERRING TO SECULAR STORIES,<br />
 ILLUSTRATIONS, AND PARABLES</h2>
<p>When we speak, we should also avoid referring to secular stories, illustrations, and parables. Because we were raised up, educated, and instructed in many ways in human society, we have a tendency to speak secular things. But in the church meetings we are speaking for the Lord. It is hard for us to keep our speaking away from secular stories, illustrations, and parables. Whenever we use secular things in our speaking, we eliminate the power and the impact of our speaking. This is a subtraction from our speaking. When we speak, we have to do it without any reference to secular things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING QUOTATIONS<br />
FROM BOOKS WITHOUT SPIRITUAL WEIGHT</h2>
<p>We should avoid quoting things from books without spiritual weight. Many times people like to quote from others&rsquo; books in their speaking because they think that these quotations can strengthen or confirm their points. They also may quote others to strengthen or confirm that they are learned and knowledgeable. We do not need to make such a show of our knowledge of others&rsquo; books. To refer to others&rsquo; books is a risk. We may bring in things that are not according to the truth or that are not constructive. Our speaking with wrong quotations from others&rsquo; books may distract others and destroy our intention to build up the church. To bring in quotations from other books may even create dissension, so we have to be careful when we quote others&rsquo; writings.</p>
