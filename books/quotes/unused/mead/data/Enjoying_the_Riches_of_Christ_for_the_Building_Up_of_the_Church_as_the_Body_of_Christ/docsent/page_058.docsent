   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Perfected into One</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 17:23 says, "I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In what way can we be perfected?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In our old nature we are not one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We can be perfected into one only by Jesus being in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is in you, He is in me, and He is in every one of His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By His being in us, we are being perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you say that my hair is too short, I may say that your hair is too long; then we will fight.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should forget about the length of our hair.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let us talk about Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If I say to a brother, "Your hair is too long," his response should be, "Brother, don't you know that Jesus is within you?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Don't talk to me about hair.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Talk to me about Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be sure, if we talk about anything other than Jesus, eventually we will be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If someone asks you about tongue-speaking, do not answer him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You may say, "Brother, don't you know that Jesus is within you?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let's change the subject and talk about Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we talk about tongue-speaking for ten minutes, we will be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may be for it, and I may be against it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who is right and who is wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only the Lord knows.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We simply need to be perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To speak doctrinally about loving one another is very easy, but when we are put together practically, what happens to our love for one another?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Immediately we may be exposed because we are still too natural.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are natural with one another, it is impossible for us to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we must be perfected, not by being regulated, but by enjoying the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I was a young Christian, I once stayed in a small bedroom with an older brother.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sometimes as I brought water in a basin into the room, I would spill a little water on his bed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then I would go to him, confess, and ask for his forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After a few days of this, he said, "Brother, it is better to not do anything wrong and need to confess."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This caused me to be anxious, but the more careful I was, the more water I spilled and the more I needed to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This illustrates that to stay together with others is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One day, however, we all will be perfected, not by being regulated but by realizing that Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Real oneness is in the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>CARING FOR CHRIST AND NOT OUTWARD THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am concerned for some who still hold certain concepts and ideas about the Christian meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some may consider that Christian meetings should be orderly and dignified.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They may say, "Look at these people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are shouting and laughing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no dignity with them."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I do not like to criticize those who say this, but I would say that dignity is not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today we all have to consider Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must not care for anything but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may say that we do not like a certain kind of meeting because it is too noisy, but what if the Lord Jesus likes it?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Jesus may say, "I am happy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They may not be so good, but they are living while others are dead."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why are Christians divided and still being divided?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is because they hold many good things other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To be orderly and to have dignity is good.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I do not like to see careless shouting and laughing, and I do not like to see wild and uncivilized long hair and beards.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I would rather see everyone with a proper haircut, properly shaven, and dressed with a proper tie.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, we have to look into the deeper situation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For someone to have a tie makes no difference if he does not have much Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord Jesus did not usually have meetings in orderly places.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He had meetings on the seashore, on the hillside, or on the mountaintops.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In those meetings, there was no chair arranging or cleaning beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Almost every meeting was a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The exception was when the Lord fed the five thousand; He had them sit down in groups of fifty Luke 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To meet in this way was the Lord's wisdom in order to distribute food to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It was a matter of wisdom, not a matter of dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord Jesus did not care for mere outward dignity and order.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Two centuries ago John Wesley was raised up by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In England at that time no one was allowed to preach the word of God outside of a building dedicated by the Church of England to be a "sanctuary."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Their thought was that the word of God is so holy that it should be preached only in a sanctuary, a holy place, and not in a common place.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, God raised up John Wesley.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Wesley did not care for the concept of the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He preached the word of God on the street corners.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This kind of preaching eventually became one of the biggest revivals of recent times.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord Jesus does not care for mere outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He cares only for Himself, that is, for how much Christ we have.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We all need to be perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we care only for Christ, we will not care for an outward way to have our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whether the meeting is noisy or quiet, orderly or disorderly, full of dignity or without any dignity, makes no difference to us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we care only for Christ, we will have no opinion because we are being perfected into one by and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There is no other way for us to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We cannot be one by sitting down to have a discussion.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Be assured, the more we discuss, the more divided we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We should never talk about mere doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must simply fellowship about Jesus and be perfected with the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Some may want to talk about whether baptism should be by immersion or sprinkling, by hot water or cold water, in fresh water or salt water, in lake water, river water, or in a swimming pool.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, it is best not to talk about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Some may want to talk about the Lord's table, asking, "What kind of bread should we have?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Should it be leavened or unleavened?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Should it be cut into pieces or should it be whole?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Should there be many small cups or one big cup?"</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Again, it is best not to talk about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we talk about this, we may fight with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Let us forget about the opinions and be perfected into one by Christ.</S>
