   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE SUPPLY OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 3:3-6; 2:15; Col 3:10-11; 1 Cor 12:20-21; Rom 12:3-6 THE NEED FOR THE SUPPLY OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every Christian should know that he is only a member.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If he does not have the other members, he will not survive.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Body all the members must be joined together before they can become the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the members in the Body are related to one another, and they cannot be separated from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Between the members there must be a mutual supply and a mutual relatedness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only then can the members survive.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a Christian lives an independent life, sooner or later he will weaken and dry up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If I am an ear, I cannot see and neither should I expect to see by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The whole body is dependent upon the eyes for sight, and no amount of prayer will give sight to the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I am an ear, what should I do if I want to see something?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I should go to the eyes a brother or sister who sees and ask for help.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to go on with the Lord, we must recognize His supply for us in the Body and avail ourselves of it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The whole Body is built up through the interdependence among the members.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When I was in Southeast Asia, I had a talk with some brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Someone asked, "Why am I not living as before?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have not committed any particular sins that I know of, and I have not disobeyed the Lord in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have not taken back my consecration or changed my mind about the money I have offered to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Outwardly, there does not seem to be any change in my spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But why I am not the same as before?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I seem to have lost the joy and the vitality that I once had."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I answered, "The reason is that you have lived in your self for too long.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You have to get into the Body life."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order for a member to live a normal life, he must receive the supply from the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a man is not living in the Body of Christ, he will not receive the Body's supply.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No member can say that he does not need the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No member may detach himself from other members to live alone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 12:3 says, "Not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not think too highly of ourselves, and we should not think that others are inferior.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not despise and reject other members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Peter thought that the other members would fall and fail but that he would not.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But when the test came, he failed just the same as everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who think highly of themselves and despise other members will end up in trouble sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Body of Christ everyone is a member and nothing more than a member.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, no member can live without the other members, much less despise them.</S>
