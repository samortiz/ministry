   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS OUR PORTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These ten blessings will lead us to the highest blessing of all the enjoyment of God Himself as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 119:57 the psalmist declares, Thou art my portion, O Jehovah Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we have God as our portion, we have not only light, life, water, and all the benefits these bring us, but we have the very God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some may think that the Old Testament saints did not enjoy God as their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the writer of Psalm 119 says definitely that the Lord was his portion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because the psalmist kept God s word, God could be his portion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is a very great matter to have God as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God can be our portion because He is real and not a superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If God had not been a reality to him, the psalmist could not have testified that the Lord was his portion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everything superstitious is vain, unreal, and not at all substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How could something vain and unreal be our portion?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the psalmist declared that God was his portion, he was enjoying and touching something very real.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order for God to be our portion, He must also be very practical, present, enjoyable, and available.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How could something become our portion if it were not near and available?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And how could something be our portion if it were not enjoyable and practical?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For many Jews, Moslems, and even Christians, God is far away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To them, God is not practical, present, enjoyable, and available.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In their experience, they do not have Him as their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I can testify from personal experience that my God truly has become my portion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have never seen Him with my eyes or touched Him with my hands, but in my inner being I enjoy Him all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some may claim that this is merely a psychological phenomenon.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, psychological phenomena usually do not last very long; yet the enjoyment of God as our portion is long-lasting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is ever the same; He does not change.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This One who is real, practical, present, enjoyable, and available is my portion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am sure that you also have had some experience of God as your portion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even though your experience may be limited, you cannot deny that to you God is real, practical, present, enjoyable, and available.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He truly is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all face problems in life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From years of experience I have found that there is just one antidote to our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This antidote is all-inclusive and very effective it is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He alone is the answer to our problems and the cure for all our troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not allow God to come into our situation, life will be nothing more than an empty dream.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without God, all our dreams first become problems, then troubles, and ultimately turn into death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But if we take the Lord and apply Him to our situation, things will be different.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We shall be able to testify that our portion is not this matter or that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our portion is not a good marriage, a high position, a large bank account, or a piece of real estate.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our portion is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because He is living, real, and practical, we can taste Him and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We enjoy God as our portion through the Word and by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may compare the Word and the Spirit to an antenna and a ground wire which are the means for divine electricity to be conveyed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we come to the Word with the Spirit, we receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yes, we enjoy light, life, and watering.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, it is actually God Himself who is light, life, and living water to us in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is even our restoration, deliverance, strength, comfort, nourishment, upholding, and safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By contacting the Word in a proper way, we receive the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do not receive light, life, or water as things apart from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No, the light, life, and living water we enjoy are actually God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God is also our salvation, food, drink, comfort, and protection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every aspect of the first ten blessings we receive through the living Word is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The declaration in Psalm 119 that the Lord is our portion is extremely crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can receive light because God is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can have life and living water also because He is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All the different blessings come to us through the Word because the Lord is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As long as we have Him, we have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I repeat, the blessings we receive through the living Word are not things apart from God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They are different attributes or virtues of the living God as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In all kinds of situations, we may have deliverance and salvation because God is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All the blessings we receive from the living Word of God bring us to the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The testimony of the psalmist was that the Lord was his portion because he kept His word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>By keeping God s word, he participated in God Himself and enjoyed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we keep the Lord s words, we also enjoy Him as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Only of the Bible can it be said that the author of the book is the portion of those who read it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many Chinese have studied the writings of Confucius, but Confucius has not become their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Likewise, students do not experience the authors of their textbooks as their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But there is one book the Word of God whose Author eventually becomes our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The more we come to the Bible in the right way, the more the Author of this book, God Himself, becomes our portion.</S>
