   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord Jesus Himself is the pattern for the believers' receiving the Spirit both essentially and economically.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First, the Spirit came as the divine essence for the conceiving and birth of the Lord Jesus Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This was the coming of the Spirit essentially for Christ's existence and being as the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Holy Spirit also came to Jesus Christ as the divine power for the anointing of Christ Matt 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This was economical and was for Christ's ministry and work, whereas the coming of the Spirit as the divine essence was essential and was for the Lord's being and living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When He came forth at the age of thirty to minister and work for God, He needed the Spirit as His power economically, even though He had already been born of the Spirit and had the Spirit within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The believers also received the Spirit both essentially and economically.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the day of the Lord's resurrection, the essential Spirit for the disciples' spiritual existence and being was breathed into them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is proved strongly by the record of Acts 1.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to this record, even before the day of Pentecost, Peter was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the four Gospels Peter often behaved in a foolish, nonsensical manner.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But in chapter one of Acts Peter is a very different person, able rightly to expound the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another indication that the disciples had received the Spirit essentially before the day of Pentecost was the fact, also recorded in Acts 1, that they were able to pray in one accord for ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before the Lord's crucifixion, the disciples were striving with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But in Acts 1 there is praying instead of striving.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What made it possible to pray in one accord for ten days?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was made possible by the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although the disciples had received the Spirit essentially and had this Spirit within them, they still needed the economical Spirit to descend upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Concerning this, the Lord Jesus said to them, "You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth" Acts 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then ten days after His ascension, the Lord Jesus poured out Himself as the consummated Spirit upon His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we can see that the church was formed by two steps.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first step was the Lord's breathing the Spirit into the believers for their spiritual existence and being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The second step was the Lord's pouring out Himself as the consummated Spirit upon the believers, baptizing them into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By these two steps the believers were filled inwardly with the Spirit and were clothed outwardly with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Inwardly they had the Spirit of essence, the essential Spirit, and outwardly they had the Spirit of economy, the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a result, they were altogether wrapped up with the Spirit, and by being wrapped up with the Spirit they were formed into the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was the formation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the day of Pentecost Christ baptized the Jewish believers in the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not too long afterward, in the house of Cornelius He baptized the Gentile believers in the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem, the economical Spirit descended upon the Jewish believers, and in the house of Cornelius in Caesarea, the same economical Spirit descended upon the Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By these two instances of the believers being baptized in the economical Spirit, Christ, as the Head in the heavens, baptized His entire Body both the Jewish side and the Gentile side in one Spirit into one Body, as fully revealed in 1 Corinthians 12:13.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the church was formed through Christ's baptizing all the believers, both Jews and Gentiles, in one Spirit into one Body.</S>
