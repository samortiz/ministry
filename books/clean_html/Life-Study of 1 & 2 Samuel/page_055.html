<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. CHOSEN BY GOD</H2><P>David was chosen by God (1 Sam. 16:1-10). "Jehovah said to Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, though I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have selected for Myself a king from among his sons" (v. 1). Jesse had seven of his sons pass by Samuel, but Jehovah had not chosen them. David's family seemed not to care for him, but God was determined to use him, for He had chosen him. David was God's unique choice among the children of Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. TRAINED BY GOD IN HUMILITY</H2><P>David was trained by God in humility through his circumstances. God purposely caused him to be born as the youngest one, the last one, to make him humble. Furthermore, David was assigned to go to the field to take care of the sheep. None of his seven brothers would do that; they all wanted a better job.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. ANOINTED</H2><P>First Samuel 16:12-23 relates how David was anointed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By Samuel with Oil</H2><P>Because David was God's choice, Samuel, God's acting representative, came purposely to anoint him with oil (v. 13a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Confirmed by the Spirit of Jehovah<br>Rushing upon Him from That Day</H2><P>Samuel's anointing David with oil was confirmed by the Spirit of Jehovah rushing upon him from that day (v. 13b). This rushing of the Spirit was related not to life for salvation but to power for outward activities.</P>
