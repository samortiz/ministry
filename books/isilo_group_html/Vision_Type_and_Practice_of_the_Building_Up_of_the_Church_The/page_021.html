<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
AND ELIMINATING DISTINCTIONS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 3:9-11; Eph. 2:11-16, 18-22; 3:19</h1>
<p>Colossians 3:9-11 says, &ldquo;You have put off the old man with his practices and have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; The Greek words for <em>old man</em> and <em>new man</em> are singular, because in the eyes of God there is only one old man and only one new man. There are not many old men and many new men. All who are in Adam are one old man, and all who are in Christ have put off the old man and put on the new man.</p>
<p>Verse 11 mentions four kinds of distinctions. The first distinction is according to race, indicated by <em>Greek and Jew.</em> The second distinction is according to religious background, indicated by <em>circumcision and uncircumcision.</em> The third distinction is according to culture, indicated by <em>barbarian</em> and <em>Scythian.</em> A barbarian is an uncultured person, and Scythians were considered the most barbarous. The fourth distinction is according to social class, indicated by <em>slave</em> and <em>free man.</em> These four distinctions encompass all the distinctions in human society. However, these distinctions are in the old creation; they do not exist in the new man. In the new man there is only Christ; only Christ is all and in all.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:11-16 says, &ldquo;Remember that once you, the Gentiles in the flesh, those who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh made by hands, that you were at that time apart from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who were once far off have become near in the blood of Christ. For He Himself is our peace, He who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace, and might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity by it.&rdquo; The phrase <em>you who were once far off</em> in verse 13 is translated &ldquo;you who were once far off from God&rdquo; in the Chinese Union Version. For this reason, many people understand this phrase to mean that we were apart from God and that Christ reconciled us to God, thus causing us to be one with God. However, in addition to this meaning, this passage deals with the problem in the building up of the church, which is the problem of distinctions that are based on the old creation. Hence, <em>far off</em> in verse 13 refers to the uncircumcised Gentiles being far off from the circumcised Jews.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>middle wall of partition</em> in verse 14 speaks of the separation between the circumcised and the uncircumcised. These distinctions, separations, and problems were abolished by Christ on the cross. Christ has become the peace between the Jews and the Gentiles; He created the two into one new man, so making peace. Not only so, He reconciled both in one Body to God through the cross (vv. 15-16).</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:18-22 says, &ldquo;Through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father. So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone; in whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; According to this crucial passage, our being saved and having access to the Father are not a personal matter but a matter of the building up of the church. Being reconciled to God refers to the Jews and Gentiles being made one Body and thus reconciled to God. Having access to the Father refers to the entire Body having access in one Spirit unto the Father. This is the way that we can be built up. The apostles and prophets are the foundation of the building, and Christ Jesus is the cornerstone, which connects the two walls of the building together. One wall is the wall of the Jews, and the other is the wall of the Gentiles, both of which are connected in Christ. Thus, in Christ all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord. Furthermore, in Christ we also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will cover the practice of the building up of the church from a different angle. We will see our need to be filled with Christ. We have said repeatedly that in order to be built up, one must be broken. Only those who are broken can be joined and built up together with others. However, it is not sufficient to focus on the negative aspect of being broken. Breaking only focuses on eliminating the self and the old creation. In order for the church to be built up, we must also allow Christ to fill us inwardly; this is the positive side. In relation to the building up of the church, from our point of view, we need to be broken, but from Christ&rsquo;s point of view, we need to be filled with Him (3:19).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Type, and Practice of the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
