<h2 class="head1">HAVING MUCH AND ADEQUATE PRAYER</h2>
<p>The co-workers and elders must also strengthen their prayer. We need to consider this matter as a burden and pray for it. In order to be a hungry one, one must first be a fasting one. The co-workers, elders, and full-timers need to fast and pray often. It is not too much to fast and pray weekly. We must pray by fasting, saying, &ldquo;Lord, You must turn the church around absolutely from the old way of Christianity. You must turn us to the home meetings. Burn in every home! Stir up every home!&rdquo; To merely act a little after I speak is not the way. We need to pick up the burden in a genuine way and pray with this burden pressing heavily upon our shoulders.</p>
<p>Fasting is the result of heaviness of burden and pressure in the spirit. When one becomes so pressed that he is unable to eat, he is fasting. Once we pray according to the burden within, the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit will come upon us. When the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit comes upon us, something will happen. This is different from a mere change of method. Although we speak of changing the system, we are merely borrowing this expression for convenience. In reality, if we have only an outward way without a burden that burns within us, and if we do not fast or pray, this &ldquo;change of the system&rdquo; will be an empty shell. It will never bring forth any results.</p>
<p>I have no way to describe the heaviness of my burden. I hope we all will see this and pick up this burden. The need in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is great, and there is no way for us to meet the need. I have mentioned before that throughout my life of serving the Lord over the past fifty or sixty years in both the East and the West, I have never seen a place like Taiwan today where needs abound. The way the high-rise apartment buildings are constructed today is simply a preparation for the gospel. Within one building there are sixty to seventy homes, and they all share a common entrance. It is easy for everyone to know everyone else. Are we not touched by the situation? Our need today is people. At present, there are approximately ten thousand saints in the church in Taipei. Among them only four thousand are active members. If we do not work on the homes, and if we do not stir up every home, how can we answer to the Lord, and how can we answer to all the saints?</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE HOME MEETINGS<br />
AND TRAINING THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>I have heard that many denominations are now turning their attention to these urban communities and have gained many people from them. However, they are still carrying on their practice in the old way. I hope that when we go to these communities, we will be different. We should practice &ldquo;universal conscription&rdquo;; everyone should be a soldier, and every home should rise up. If we stir up the homes with the homes, and if we perfect the homes with the homes, soon twenty homes will be stirred up in a community. Perhaps in two years many home meetings will be established in that community. This requires our labor. To depend solely on the one or two hundred co-workers and elders that we have here can be compared to attempting to quench one&rsquo;s thirst with only a drop of water. What we need to do is stir up the homes. Of course, we cannot wait until all the homes are stirred up before we begin our work. On the one hand, we need to make personal visits to the communities, and on the other hand, we need to train the saints through the practice of the home meetings. If we cannot break through in the matter of the home meetings, we will not be able to have an army. Every home that is stirred up becomes a part of the army.</p>
<p>During the Second World War, after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the United States could not enlist the adequate number of fighting men by the standard way. The government opened up the opportunity for anyone interested to join the army. As a result, the number of volunteers more than met the demand. The American government also diverted its resources and turned many factories into arsenals. In this way all the needs were met. Today in Taiwan we need to evangelize the entire island. The Lord has provided us with an open door. If we have three to five thousand people responding to this need, we will gospelize Taiwan in at least two years.</p>
<p>I have heard reports of the visitation work in the communities. These reports are very encouraging. We are well received and many people are open to us. Although we do not have the adequate manpower, we should still endeavor to do this work. In particular, the full-time trainees should go out at least twice a week. I have made the decision that when we go out again, we will match two young full-timers with one older saint. I believe that there will be more open doors because of this, and people will take our gospel even more seriously. The training center in Taipei needs to plan, and the co-workers and elders must take the lead to encourage the working saints and the elderly saints to dedicate some time to go with the full-time trainees to visit the communities and to bring the meetings to people&rsquo;s homes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BRINGING THE MEETINGS TO THE HOMES</h2>
<p>To bring the meetings to the homes is the very heart of the God-ordained way. It will be a great failure in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery if we cannot bring the meetings to the homes. For the past twenty years in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we have been bringing people to the meeting halls. The more we work in this way, the fewer people we have, and the worse the condition of the homes becomes. More and more our meetings have become a kind of Sunday morning service. In Christianity many people &ldquo;go to church&rdquo; to listen to the singing of hymns and to attend the &ldquo;service,&rdquo; but their homes are deplorable; their tables may still be scattered with mah-jongg game pieces. In the morning the family attends the service, but in the afternoon the mah-jongg game goes on in the homes. In order to overturn this degraded situation, we must bring the meetings to the homes. I hope that every home will be mobilized, that everyone will become a soldier, and that together we will become an army of the Lord.</p>
<p>At present in Taipei there are about sixty new urban communities. Let us suppose that we can set up a center for meeting in every community, and every center takes care of fifty people. Immediately we will have three thousand people. If each center takes care of one hundred people, we will have six thousand people. This is not a small matter. This is the reason that we must endeavor to work on the communities.</p>
