Today, among the many local churches in the Lord's recovery, there are few problems, and the situation is pleasant and encouraging
We have seen the central lane of Paul's completing ministry, but we do not have the living to correspond with our vision
What needs to be recovered today is mainly the things revealed in Paul's ministry, which is strengthened by John's mending ministry
Only Paul's Epistles reveal the great mystery-Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ
The Lord used Brother Watchman Nee to lay a foundation in His recovery, and He has been going on based on that foundation
As leading ones, we are often distracted by outward things, such as our work or the problems in the local churches
Our daily walk does not adequately correspond to our vision concerning the central lane of Paul's completing ministry
To see this is a great help, but we need to consider whether we are daily practicing to walk according to the spirit
We should not be satisfied to see some growth in life; we must seek to have a proper living, which will produce normal growth
When the leading ones meet in the various localities, they should pray and fellowship concerning their living of Christ in their daily lives
As leading ones, we know from our experience that when we are living Christ, we are best able to care for the church
Recently, based on Romans 8:4, we have seen the matter of walking according to the spirit, which is the practical way to live Christ
The more they taught about Christ, the more they were divided and fought one another because of different interpretations and doctrines
Christians have emphasized various kinds of works and teachings throughout the past nineteen centuries, but few have lived Christ
The Lord has revealed much to us today, but we need to be those who earnestly desire to walk according to the spirit
Walking according to the spirit is different from praying in difficult situations or before spiritual activities
We may rarely speak negatively, but even our positive speech that is not according to the spirit is still according to the flesh
We need to do everything according to the spirit, thinking, speaking, and acting moment by moment according to the spirit
If all the saints live Christ by walking according to the spirit, there will be a great increase in the church
When the meetings are dismissed, the saints tend to talk only with those whom they already know, and new ones are often neglected
When we choose whom we will talk to based on our natural preferences, we are not walking according to the spirit
Our primary concern should not be how to do things such as preaching the gospel and shepherding the new believers
Our gospel preaching and shepherding should not be activities but should be the issue of a daily life of walking according to the spirit
We need a clear view from the heavens to see that what the Lord wants is a group of people who walk according to the spirit
As leading ones, we primarily need to walk according to the spirit in our daily life and help other saints to enter into this kind of living
Genesis 1:27-28 says, 'God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them
Today we stand on their shoulders to see and practice the matters of living Christ and walking according to the spirit
Whether or not there is a high atmosphere of corporate enjoyment in our locality, we need to personally walk according to the spirit
Many saints need to practice walking according to the spirit in order to become less dependent on corporate help
The apostle John did not receive corporate help when he was in exile on the island of Patmos, but he was still in spirit
Deep within we realize that it is mostly we who are living and not Christ, perhaps even when we are speaking about the Lord
Because the matter of living Christ pertains to life, which is mysterious and abstract, it is easy for us to miss and neglect this matter
The outward results of our work may pass away; therefore, what really counts in the eyes of God is our living of Christ
That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit
For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the Spirit
Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be
Many writers see that chapter 7 concerns the flesh, and chapter 8 concerns the spirit, which is in contrast with the flesh
Paul completed the divine revelation, and John mended, confirmed, and strengthened it more than nineteen centuries ago
Since then Christians have found many crucial points in the Bible, but the true focus has been almost entirely missed
The thought that God wants to live in us so that we may live Him is like fine flour, and all the other thoughts are like leaven
Activities such as preaching the gospel and establishing churches should be the issues of our living the Triune God
We mainly need to see that the focus of Romans 8 and of the Bible is nothing other than God's desire to live in us so that we may live Him
In other words, the Bible teaches us that God wants to be one with us in life and living-He lives in us, and we live Him
These different understandings of the same chapter are based on the thoughts already occupying the minds of husbands and wives
A husband is able to love his wife because God, who is love, lives in him and becomes his love as he lives God
Similarly, a wife's submission should not be merely an ethical virtue but the issue of God living in her and her living God
We can apply this focus to every virtue mentioned in the Bible, such as humility, kindness, long-suffering, and forbearance
These should not be ethical virtues like those taught by Confucius but the expression and issue of God living in us and our living Him
According to the original Greek, in terms such as the love of God, the words love and God are in apposition, indicating that God is love
Verses 9 and 11 present a threefold Spirit-the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead
If all the genuine Christians in a region begin to live this way, the entire region will be turned to God without any need for organizations
The church life is not a matter of whether we are right or wrong but a matter of whether we are living ourselves or living God
When we see this, we should not quit our service in the church, for we may still be living ourselves when we quit
We may be familiar with these simple words, yet we need to realize that they convey a profound revelation that has been greatly neglected
The Lord Jesus was with His disciples for three and a half years and gave them many messages, including His word in Matthew 5-7
John 14:7-11 reveals that the Father is one with the Son, for the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son
The vine in John 15 is the universal new man, of which Christ is the Head and all the believers are the members
To teach that we branch out the Triune God according to John 15 is not to teach that we are God as an object of worship
John 1:12 says, 'As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name'
If we walk according to the flesh, we branch out Adam, but if we walk according to the spirit, we branch out God
Both reveal the focus of the universe and the center of the Bible-the Triune God lives in us so that we may live Him
All we need to do is to live the Triune God; everything else will be a spontaneous issue of our living the Triune God
Other teachings emphasize the resurrection life, subjective sanctification, or holiness, and the victorious life
Many books have been written concerning these matters and have influenced countless seeking Christians during the past few centuries
The Triune God in Christ has passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
Christ has attained to the throne and has obtained the kingdom, the highest name, the lordship, and the headship
The Triune God in Christ has been processed through all these steps and accomplishments and has become the life-giving Spirit
Verses 9 and 11 refer to the Spirit as the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead
At the time of our salvation, our spirit was made alive as the Spirit came into our spirit and regenerated it with the divine life
We need only to walk according to the mingled spirit, which is the practical way to live God and to allow God to live in us
If we allow the Triune God to indwell us in this way, we will spontaneously and continually experience the killing of the death of Christ
The focus of the Bible and of the Christian life is not to experience the subjective death of Christ; the unique focus is to live God
Even our initial believing in the Lord for our eternal salvation requires our effort to understand the gospel and choose to believe
Similarly, as long as we are walking according to the spirit, we will live a normal Christian life without much feeling
We have a clear negative feeling when we are not walking according to the spirit so that we know to stop and turn to the spirit
If we walk according to this wonderful mingled spirit, every other experience of the normal Christian life will spontaneously come forth
We need to take the lead to pursue a daily life of walking according to the mingled spirit so that we can minister such a life to others
The central lane of the divine revelation in the Bible is the Triune God living in the believers so that they may live Him
The focus of God's economy is not communal living but the Triune God living in the believers so that they may live Him
On the first day of the week each one of you should lay aside in store to himself whatever he may have been prospered'
To faithfully set aside a portion of God's material blessing for His needs requires grace, which is the Triune God enjoyed by us
What He desires is to live in the believers so that they may live Him practically to the extent that they desire to give financially to Him
We need to realize that no practice will last long if it is not based on the Triune God living in us and our living Him
God's intention cannot be fulfilled merely by our good works, such as baptizing new believers or raising up churches
Even many who have left the denominations to meet as local churches are still under the influence of organized Christianity
Timothy is not prominent in history because he did not succeed Paul as one who wrote Epistles and cared for all the Gentile churches
The fallen thought of having a successor in the Lords work is due to distraction from the central lane of the divine revelation in the Bible
The leading ones need to take the lead to live Him and to minister Him into the saints so that all the saints may live Him
The Lord said, 'Whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave'
Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4:5, 'We do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus' sake'
If anything, the elders should consider themselves to be lower than the other saints because they are the servants of the saints
Many believers are not meeting on the proper ground of locality, but they are all still members of the local churches
We should not become a sect by considering that we are special and that those who are not meeting with us are inferior
We should follow the example of Paul, who did not preach himself but Christ Jesus as Lord, and himself as the slave of the saints
Because we are all fallen and have the fallen nature, we desire to have a title and a position to control and rule over others
It is a great shame to control others, and it proves that the controlling one is not walking according to the spirit
For the sake of the Lord's recovery, the elders in the local churches must see that human authority, headship, and control are wrong
We must reject all the false replacements of the one thing that is real and that counts-the Triune God living in us so that we may live Him
To teach different things does not mean to teach heresy but to teach things different from the apostles' ministry
All the positive things will issue from such a living, and all the negative things will be swallowed up by such a living
The only thing that can keep us and preserve us is to see and practice the vision that God wants to live in us so that we may live Him
Corinthians 4:5 shows that Paul and the other apostles considered themselves to be merely slaves to serve the saints
When John wrote Revelation, he did not call himself an apostle, although he was the last of the original apostles still alive
Verse 9 says, 'I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus'
No matter how much the Lord uses the elders and co-workers, they must consider themselves only as slaves and brothers
We should not have any thought of making money through the church instead we should be eager to help the saints and take care of their needs
As the flock of God, the churches are God's possession, but God has allotted them to the elders for their care
As elders, we should not lord it over the portions that God has assigned to us; instead, we should be examples to the flock
Similarly, the elders should not use their eldership or their spiritual capacity as a basis to give orders to others
The church is the Body of Christ expressed as groups of believers who love the Lord and walk according to the spirit
The church cannot be living or revived if it is the possession of an elder or if an elder considers himself to be the boss
The elders should not consider themselves to be higher than others and they need to see that the church belongs to God and to all the saints
If an elder needs to move from his locality, he should not need to meet with the other serving ones to hand things over to them
In principle all the affairs of the church should be open to all the saints and all the saints should bear the responsibility for the church
The universal church is all the believers throughout time and space, and the local church is all the believers in a locality
Any group of believers who come together to worship God according to Scripture without any division is a local church
Similarly, we must see that all the believers are our brothers and sisters in the Lord and are members of the church
He taught us that all the believers, including Roman Catholics who are truly saved, are our brothers and sisters
According to Paul's view of God's economy, all the members of the Body of Christ should be persons who walk according to the spirit
All the believers are members of the Body of Christ, but the practicality of the Body depends on the believers' walk
If the believers walk according to the flesh although they are still members of the Body of Christ there will be no Body in their experience
There are millions of believers today, but there is very little of the Body life among them, because few walk according to the spirit
By the Lords mercy the situation in the Lords recovery is somewhat better yet we have to admit that even among us the Body life is lacking
We may have living meetings and stand on the proper ground of oneness, but the Body life among us is inadequate
The Body life does not depend on the exercise of the spirit in the meetings but on the walk, the daily living, of the saints
His children were in the church in Chefoo and strongly encouraged him to come and see what was happening when the revival began
What the Lord wants today is not to start a revival but to recover the Body life, the realization and living of the Body of Christ
In the revival in Chefoo all the saintsabout eight hundred brothers and sistersconsecrated themselves their families and their possessions
They physically brought their belongings to the meeting hall, including the title deeds to their houses, to offer to the church
Afterward for the sake of the gospel seventy migrated by boat to Inner Mongolia and thirty migrated by boat to Andong in southern Manchuria
In 1968 four couples in a certain church wanted to begin practicing pray-reading in the meetings, but the rest of the church opposed it
Practices such as pray-reading, calling on the name of the Lord, singing, and praising are helpful, and revival helps as well
They help the saints, but in order to live the Body life, the saints must begin to walk according to the spirit
The release of the spirit in the meetings does not have the same spiritual value and weight as walking according to the spirit
If the goal of our work is merely to stir up the saints to release their spirits in the meetings, our work will be in vain
Because we are all members of the Body of Christ and have Christ as our Head, it is a shame if we need elders to regulate us
We know that these things are not God's intention, for the positions of apostles, elders, and deacons are gone in the book of Revelation
Even the writer of Revelation, the apostle John, did not identify himself as an apostle but only as a brother who was in spirit
In Revelation we do not see apostles, elders, and deacons but the seven Spirits, enlightening the churches as the lampstands
As elders, we need to take the lead to forsake any such human work and instead help the saints to walk according to the spirit
Whether someone is in the recovery does not depend on outward appearances but on the inward reality of spirit and life
The enlightening and searching of the seven Spirits is the true test and measure of whether anything is of the Lord's recovery
The root of the church's degradation and the source of religious, organized Christianity is man's attempt to rule over and control things
If we do not see this, such corruption and darkness may creep in and greatly damage the church in our locality
As elders, most of our concern and labor should be to pray for the saints, visit them, shepherd them, and help them to grow
When the saints come to serve, certain things will be spontaneously manifested, such as who should take the lead in the groups
There are four main chapters in the New Testament concerning the Body life-Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12, Ephesians 4, and Colossians 2
These chapters were all written by Paul, the only New Testament writer to use the expression the Body of Christ to describe the church
In order to understand the matter of presenting our body as a living sacrifice to God in Romans 12, we must go back to chapters 6 through 8
The fall brought in sin and death, which damaged man and annulled his body for the fulfilling of God's purpose
The body of sin is strong in sinning against God, but the body of this death is weak in acting to serve and please God
If we allow the Spirit of the Triune God to indwell us, to occupy us, life will eventually spread to our mortal body
In this way our body of sin and of death is recovered to become living and active for the fulfilling of God's purpose
Thessalonians 5:23 says, 'The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete'
Ultimately, our body is also freed so that our entire tripartite being is freed from the dominion of sin and death
We need to walk according to the spirit so that our body will be freed from sin and death, given life, and qualified to be presented to God
To have our mind renewed is not to change our mind but to have a new element and essence added into our mind so that it becomes a new mind
When the mind is renewed with the divine element and essence, we know God's will, that which is well pleasing to Him
If we pass through the experiences revealed in Romans 1-8, we will function as members in the Body according to Romans 12
If we migrate to establish a church in a new locality, we should not go individualistically but as a member functioning in the Body
How we need to thank the Lord that He has opened His word to us, making every portion of the Bible transparent and bright
After we enter into the experience of functioning in the Body according to Romans 12, we can go on to the experience of 1 Corinthians 12
In the past those who were stirred up to drink of the Spirit but did not care for the Body life eventually lost their enjoyment
Drinking of the Spirit issues in at least three things that are recorded and developed in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14
No other chapters in the New Testament go to such lengths to show us the way to function as do 1 Corinthians 12 and 14
Paul teaches that the proper speaking in the meetings, whether prophesying or speaking in tongues, is in the Body and for the Body
Parents desire that all their children will be healthy and intelligent so that they can have a successful education and career
Troublesome ones terminate our self-confidence because they create situations in which we do not know what to do
If we are walking according to the spirit and drinking of the Spirit, we will embrace, love, and serve the weaker and troublesome ones
Drinking of the Spirit issues in not overstepping others' ministry, which is not to contradict others' functioning when we function
Question: Weaker members sometimes say something in a meeting that is not according to the truth or conveys something negative or damaging
Answer: To take care of this kind of situation, we first need the basic understanding and attitude that the Body is welcoming and inclusive
If the speaking one does not heed such a word, the elders must allow him to speak a few more sentences before asking him to stop again
If their spiritual education is adequate, another member will immediately stand up to speak something positive
When someone's negative speaking touches a certain subject, the whole congregation should ignore the subject in that meeting
Perhaps six months later, the proper time will come for a leading one to speak something that will heal the wound or recover the loss
While keeping this basic attitude, we need to exercise our spirit to receive wisdom from the Lord concerning how to handle each case
Until we reach the stage of the Body life, we still live in the natural life and use our natural strength, way, and wisdom quite often
When we live in the natural life and do things with the natural strength, by the natural way, and with the natural wisdom, we cannot be pure
Even if we think that we have a pure motive and do not want to damage others, we are still not pure if we take the natural way
If we consider our experience, we have to admit that most of our walk is not according to the spirit but according to the flesh
We may think that such a living is not easy to attain, but when we reach the stage of the Body life, it will be spontaneous and easy
Acts 8:26-27 says, 'An angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Rise up and go south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza
We may say that we have a burden when we actually have an intention to have some success or accomplish something
When we reach the stage of the Body life, we will not care for our own intentions but only for the Spirit's leading
If the Spirit leads us to go somewhere, we will go regardless of whether we think that anything will come of our going
If we visit a locality because we have a burden to go, but we do not have the Lord's leading, we may have outward success
We should not think that when we reach such a high stage of the Body life, there will be no weak or troublesome ones in the churches
In a proper family there are mature ones to maintain a proper family life, but there are also weak and troublesome ones
In 1 Thessalonians 3:12 Paul writes, 'The Lord cause you to increase and abound in love to one another and to all'
If a brother walks according to the spirit, there will be a corresponding expression, or manifestation, in his living that others can see
A brother who may genuinely love the Lord but walks according to the flesh will be opinionated and quarrelsome
The way to be saved from such failure is to walk according to the spirit, drink of the Spirit, and embrace all believers
Most Christians today are accustomed to frequently leaving the group they meet with when they no longer like the meetings
In 1 and 2 Corinthians he was severe and strict in dealing with some of the Corinthians, but he forgave everyone
As we walk according to the spirit, we should show strength and take action but without politics or the intention to gain a personal kingdom
According to the record of the New Testament, Paul rendered much help to them, but he avoided being the center
As we handle matters in a good way with a good result, our reputation will be built up, and many people and affairs will come to us
In order to avoid becoming a center, we should often allow people and business affairs to go to other brothers
If the church meets in the home of a single brother, there is a great danger of sin because of the temptation of the flesh
The wives of brothers who are useful to the Lord in the work or the church often try to exert some control in certain matters
As a result, the wife of a brother who serves in the ministry or the church may become the source of corruption
We do not need to fight against our wives, but we must realize that the wives should not be involved with our service
If the physical children of apostles were their successors, there would be no need for God's selection and predestination
Corinthians 16:19 says, 'Aquila and Prisca greet you much in the Lord, with the church, which is in their house'
If our wife proposes much to us concerning the affairs of the church, we should allow her to speak in order to care for her
If we do not exercise discernment and maintain our standing, we will suffer, and the work and the church will suffer
According to God's economy, the Bible does not allow females to be the head, but wives sometimes try to be the head through their husbands
We must love our wives and respect them to the uttermost, but in the church and the work we must be careful not to be maneuvered by them
It is not easy for such a wife to go on properly, because the danger and the temptation for her to maneuver things are always present
Few wives have the intention to maneuver, but regardless of their intention, they may damage the church through their maneuvering
Serving brothers' becoming a center and their wives' maneuvering are two very damaging things in the Lord's recovery
Question: You have encouraged us to walk according to the spirit and not to rely on the exercise of the spirit in the meetings
In principle, we must help the saints to know the real exercise of the spirit, which is not merely shouting or excitement
The elders need to pray much and do their best to help the saints learn the real exercise and release of spirit
They may contact the saints in different ways-one at a time or in small groups, by visiting them or inviting them somewhere
They are the first sheep to do something, and the rest of the flock will follow them to do what they are doing
If only a few new ones come to a love feast for the gospel, it is difficult to give a gospel message with impact
There are many things for the elders to do-it all depends upon their seeking the Lord's leading and carrying it out properly
If we practice in this way, a revival will come in which every member will be functioning and active in the church life
There is a need for some to serve the Lord full time in every place, even in a small village in the countryside
If we have the ability to create a spiritual market, the work may demand that we give up our job in order to serve full time
According to Mark 11:23, faith can remove a mountain, but when there is a mountain that needs to be removed, we do not have the faith
If we do not know how to shepherd, we can simply invite some to our home and fellowship with them in mutuality, asking them to help us
If we have the spiritual ability, we can create a very profitable market in a seemingly small or weak situation
We should not play politics, but we should avoid offending people, because everyone is promising for the Lord's recovery
Since there is submission on the female side, it seems that there should be the exercise of authority on the male side
If we exercise our authority but do not love people, we will cut off one member after another until there is no one left
Question: If a new one in the church life has psychological problems, how much time should we spend caring for that one?
We can follow the Lord's leading to speak in the meetings concerning the need to preach the gospel, and we should take the lead to do it
Answer: We need to humble ourselves and confess to the Lord that we are narrow, religious, proud, and self-confident
If we are not narrow, religious, proud, or self-confident, we will always be joyful and released and will not have a problem with anyone
If we cannot forgive someone, it indicates that we are narrow and religious, because we are vindicating ourselves
If we do not walk according to the spirit even our trying not to be narrow religious proud or selfconfident will be something of our self
If we walk according to the spirit, we will spontaneously be led by the Spirit and will know how to care for him and minister life to him
Distraction from the focus of the Bible actually comes not from the other points in the Bible but from the enemy, Satan
Our intention in publishing the ministry is to release the riches from the Word that have been hidden for centuries
Before 1960 it was difficult for the leading ones to feed the churches because not much of Brother Nee's speaking was published
Today the problem is not a lack of 'groceries' but the ability to discern which portions are best suited for a particular local church
No matter how rich the published messages are, the present situation in a local church involves a particular need
All the saints will live a life of testimony and speak Christ, preaching the gospel and spreading the truth everywhere
Because we are still living in the old creation, we are contaminated by our natural life, strength, way, and wisdom
Because this tendency or habit is constituted into our being, we may unconsciously and subconsciously bring it into the church life
In Matthew 23:8 the Lord told His disciples, 'Do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers'
In Mark 10:37 James and John said to the Lord, 'Grant to us to sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your glory'
Although organized Christianity neglected this crucial word of the Lord, in the 1800s the Brethren paid attention to the Lord's word
Based upon the Lord's teaching in Matthew 23:8, they did away with the clergy and only called one another brothers
In Luke 22:25-27 the Lord said, 'The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called benefactors
You shall not be so; but let the greatest among you become like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves
The churches should not have an atmosphere in which the elders are considered to be greater than the other saints
It is a shame if the concept of hierarchical rank or an atmosphere of ambition is brought into the church life
The outward things, such as where the elders sit and how much they function in the meetings, do not matter as much as their inward attitude
Because Paul did not make himself great, some foolish ones belittled him and said that they preferred Cephas or Apollos
In 1947 a serving sister in Shanghai told me, 'The roof of the meeting hall has a big hole in it and needs to be repaired'
Before going to bed at night, if we do not put our shoes in the proper place, it indicates that we are lazy and loose
A brother who does not keep his shoes shined cannot take good care of a church or speak the word of God with impact
As a result, two children with the same disposition, or nature, but raised in different cultures will have different characters
They may have the same nature by birth but their characters will be different because of their different practices and habits
An elder who talks to another saint may do so according to the spirit but will speak mostly according to the standard of his character
According to my experience, for the Lord to regenerate a person is easy, but for the Lord to change a person's character is difficult
The leading ones in the churches should not assume that because they are elders, their character is up to the standard
Our usefulness to the Lord depends not only on whether we walk according to the spirit but also on our character
Any regenerated person can walk according to the spirit, but only a person with a proper character can walk according to the spirit well
When we consider the thirty character traits mentioned above, we will see that our character is lacking and may delay our spiritual growth
We may say that we do not lie steal or commit gross sins but we probably cannot say that we have the thirty character traits mentioned above
The earlier we begin to practice to improve our character, the more likely it is that we will receive the mercy and grace to be successful
Two brothers may interpret the Lord's leading in a particular situation differently because their character is different
