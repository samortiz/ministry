   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>APPENDIX TWO HOW TO WALK BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The following is an article by Jessie Penn-Lewis, "Spiritual Things to the Spiritual."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It originally appeared in The Overcomer, Vol. 3, published by The "Overcomer" Office, Leicester, England, September 1911.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The editor of The Overcomer was Jessie Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The title, "How to Walk by the Spirit," was provided by Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The aggressive warfare against the powers of darkness is essentially a spirit conflict, and the "natural man" knows nothing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is to be understood only by spiritual men and women, hence the importance of knowing what is the meaning of the term "spiritual," and how to walk in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have put a capital S on the word spirit in the New Testament, where often it reads with a small s, or we have done that in the mind, by reading in the large S referring to the Holy Spirit in places where there should be a small s. The large S so read in by the majority of us, has hidden the fact that we have a human spirit, which is the organ for the Holy Spirit, and the place where the Holy Spirit dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>See "The Place of the Indwelling Spirit," in May Overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the shrine of that spirit comes all His divine light, and leading.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not having understood clearly about the human spirit, we have not known how to co-operate with the Holy Spirit, and when He has come into our spirits, we have thought everything He had to say to us, must be given to the mind, with the result that we have mainly walked "after the soul," and not "after the spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It will help you if I show you clearly from the Word of God what the spirit life is, and how to walk in it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First of all let us turn to 1 Cor ii.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>11, where Paul says, "Who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the SPIRIT of the man, which is in him?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here we have the statement that the "spirit of the man" alone has knowledge of the man; and "even so the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>None can know about God, only as the Spirit which is of God comes from God to reveal Him and His mind, to the believer, through the medium of his human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The human spirit is the organ for the reception of the Spirit of God, and through which He reveals truth to the mind, and gives the knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, continues Paul, "We received not the spirit of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is a "spirit of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>People forget that.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They ticket the world as "things," but there is a "spirit" of the world, and some "spirit" must work in us either the Spirit which is of God, or "spirits" instigated by Satan, i.e., the "spirit of the world," the "spirit of error," etc. How can you know the way to shut your spirit against all these spirits outside in the world, unless you understand how to co-operate WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD in the things of God?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You must shut your spirit to the influence of the world-spirit, as well as shut your mind to world thoughts and ways.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may have the "spirit of the world" in you without outwardly appearing to be worldly, hence the importance of understanding the teaching given by Paul in 1 Cor ii. and iii.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"We have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the THINGS that are freely given to us of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Which THINGS we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Spirit teacheth."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here is Paul speaking of "THINGS" i.e., substantial facts in the spiritual realm, not of theories, opinions, visions, illusions, but "things," and the Holy Spirit actually giving words to describe these things, to "spiritual" men, able to apprehend them "interpreting SPIRITUAL things to SPIRITUAL men...for the natural man lit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"man of soul" receiveth not the things of the spirit, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now you see the place of the spirit in man, in regard to the things of God, and the necessity of our becoming spiritual men men of spirit not men of "soul," i.e., "the natural man," the man who seeks to apprehend spiritual things with his natural mind, which the Apostle emphatically declares he cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From various expressions used by Paul it also appears that the spirit of man is a distinct entity, or organism, if I may use that word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Gall has a chapter on "The physiology of the spirit" in "Primeval Man Unveiled."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>See 1 Cor v. 3-4, "Ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus." He does not refer there to the Holy Spirit, but to his own spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In ch. xiv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>14, he adds a distinct action of the human spirit: "my spirit prayeth."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Rom xii.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>11, there is described both a characteristic of, and action of the spirit "Fervent in spirit, serving the Lord" and in 1 Peter iii.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>4, you read of a "meek and quiet spirit" again descriptive characteristics.</S>
