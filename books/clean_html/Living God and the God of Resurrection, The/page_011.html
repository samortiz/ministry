<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S JUDGING AND GIVING GRACE</h2>
<p>Even though God&rsquo;s judgment is to clear out the negative things within us, His purpose is to give us grace so that we may have a new beginning. God does not stop with judgment. His judging puts an end to everything that is old in order for Him to gain new ground and begin a fresh work. He wants to create more and to give more grace. God judges in order to give grace, and He gives grace after He judges.</p>
<p>Concerning the Holy Spirit, John 16:8 says, &ldquo;When He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment.&rdquo; This is the judging God executing His judgment through the Holy Spirit. God judges His people in order to convict them and to open the way for them to receive His grace. If we ignore His shining and reject His judging, we will close the way to God&rsquo;s grace, and as a result, we will lose His blessing. If we are willing to accept His judging and be convicted by it, we will open the way for Him to give us grace so that His blessings can reach us. God judges us in order to bring us into His grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COOPERATING WITH GOD&rsquo;S JUDGING</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention in judging man, especially His people, is to open a way for His work of grace; hence, we should have a proper attitude toward His judging. We should be humble and bow down to God&rsquo;s judgment; we should judge ourselves according to His judgment. Then He will open a way for His rich blessings to come upon us. The more thoroughly we receive His judgment, the more we will receive His grace. However, if we are insensitive to God&rsquo;s judgment or even defy it and remain in darkness, His judgment will become our loss. The effect of God&rsquo;s judging us, whether it is a gain or a loss, depends on how we receive it.</p>
<p>In order to do any work of grace in man, God needs man&rsquo;s cooperation. God&rsquo;s judging is not an exception. God&rsquo;s goal is not to judge us; He wants us to receive His judging light so that we can be blessed. The more thoroughly we receive His judgment, the more grace we will receive, and the more we will grow in the divine life. Those who do not act upon God&rsquo;s judging light cannot receive grace.</p>
<p>In order to be regenerated, man must receive God&rsquo;s judgment. The Spirit convicts man concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment. When a person judges himself according to the conviction of the Holy Spirit, he is immediately saved by grace. Otherwise, God has no way to save that person. This shows that in order for us to receive grace from God, we must cooperate with His judging.</p>
<p>Isaiah 57:15 says that God will dwell with the contrite and lowly of spirit. A person with a contrite and lowly spirit is a person who receives God&rsquo;s judging. Verse 14 says, &ldquo;Cast up, cast up; prepare the way; / Take up the obstacle out of the way of My people.&rdquo; From the context, <em>the obstacle</em> in this verse refers to those who are proud and unwilling to judge themselves according to God&rsquo;s light. They are proud, self-righteous, and unwilling to examine themselves; hence, they are filled with obstacles and fall into desolation. God says that we should take the obstacle out of the way.</p>
<p>Our present need is still to remove the obstacles if we want God to give us grace. A believer who is proud and conceited will condemn and criticize others, looking only at the splinter in their eye but not considering the beam in his own (Matt. 7:3). He is stumbled by pride and self-conceit, and the way for him to receive grace is blocked. Furthermore, he can become an obstacle, frustrating others from receiving God&rsquo;s grace. If we are considerate of the Lord&rsquo;s heart, we will learn to be humble and judge ourselves according to His light. Instead of being proud, we will see our poor condition and our weakness, and we will realize our need for the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and rebukes. When we are willing to place such a demand on ourselves, rather than on the saints, our contriteness and humbleness will open the way to receive God&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;If we discerned ourselves, we would not be judged&rdquo; (1 Cor. 11:31). David said, &ldquo;The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; / A broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise&rdquo; (Psa. 51:17). In order for the Lord to revive our locality, many of us must humbly accept the Lord&rsquo;s rebuke in His judging light. This is the way for us to receive grace, and it is also the way for the church to bring in God&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSUMMATE JUDGMENT OF GOD</h2>
<p>Let me repeat: our God is a judging God, and we need to revere Him. God&rsquo;s judging is a serious matter. If we do not revere and express Him, we will face His ultimate judgment.</p>
<p>God ends every age with judgment. He has judged every age in human history. Eventually, there will be a consummate judgment, which will include the church. The churches are always being judged by God and will eventually face a consummate judgment. This also applies to individuals: we are judged by God during our lives, and eventually we will face a consummate judgment.</p>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens is just like a man about to go abroad, who called his own slaves and delivered to them his possessions. To one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability. And he went abroad...Now after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them&rdquo; (Matt. 25:14-15, 19). On the one hand, we are God&rsquo;s children and members of His household (Eph. 2:19). On the other hand, we are His slaves, and one day He will come to settle accounts with us. The settling of accounts is His judging. Everything we have&mdash;whether it be a healthy body, a sober mind, material riches, or spiritual gifts&mdash;was given to us by God. Since He gave us these things, we have a responsibility, and with it comes judgment. One day He will ask how we used the gifts that He gave us: did we hide them in the earth, or did we use them to do business? He gave us light. Did we give it to those who were short of light? He gave us power. Did we sustain the weak with it? He gave us material riches. Did we use them to care for those in need? God will inquire concerning the things He gave us. As much as He has given us is as much as He will demand from us. Grace comes with a responsibility, which brings in judgment. God&rsquo;s judgment begins from the house of God (1 Pet. 4:17). The Bible shows that at the end of time God will judge all things. Now, God is judging us at the end of every stage of our Christian life.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;I am conscious of nothing against myself; but I am not justified in this, but He who examines me is the Lord. So then do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:4-5). In Romans Paul says that we will all stand before the judgment seat of God and give an account concerning ourselves to God (14:10, 12). Each one of us will come under God&rsquo;s great judgment. Today we may criticize and judge our brothers, but in that day God will make us explain our words of criticism and judgment. The Lord said that we will render an account of every idle word on the day of judgment, for by our words we will be justified or condemned (Matt. 12:36-37). The day of judgment is awesome. Regardless of who we are, in that day &ldquo;we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:10).</p>
<p>We revere God because He is the living God, and we express godliness because He is the God of resurrection. But He is also the judging God. On the day of judgment His eyes will be like a flame of fire, His feet will be like shining bronze that has been fired in a furnace, and out of His mouth will proceed a sharp two-edged sword (Rev. 1:14-16; 19:12). He will indeed be frightening. If on the day of judgment we still have things that are not of God or are incompatible with God, such as sin, the flesh, natural affections, the world, and the self, they will be searched out by the flaming fire in His eyes, cut off by the sharp sword from His mouth, and trampled on by His feet of shining bronze.</p>
<p>We thank the Lord that today He is judging us in the course of our life in order to give us new opportunities and new beginnings before His consummate judging. This is His mercy; otherwise, we would be condemned along with the world. In this process every judgment is a reminder and a deliverance. With each new beginning, God gives us fresh grace. If we do not receive His judging, we will face His judgment on the ultimate day of His judgment. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would know Him as the judging God who is not mocked.</p>
