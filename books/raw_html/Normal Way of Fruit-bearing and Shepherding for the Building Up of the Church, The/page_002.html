 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">SERVING THE LORD BY CARING FOR PEOPLE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 John 5:16a; Exo. 21:5-6; Isa. 50:4-5; Rom. 12:11</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO BE TRAINED FOR OUR SERVICE</h2>
<p>Many Christians throughout the centuries have held to one of two extremes concerning our service to the Lord. Certain &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; persons insist that to serve the Lord is absolutely a matter of life. They say that since we have life, we will grow in our service, so there is no need of any training. Those at the other extreme insist that we must receive schooling in order to serve. In 1958 I was invited to a Christian meeting in London that was considered to be very spiritual. The leading ones turned all the meetings over to me for an entire month, including not only the conference meetings but also the regular meetings. Before I left, they asked me to have another time with them for questions and answers. The main question that night was from one of the young people, who had heard that we had many trainings in Taiwan. In that place of meeting in London, however, they did not have any kind of training. Their feeling was that to serve the Lord is a matter of life, and as long as they had the growth in life, they did not need training. I told them, &ldquo;When I was young, my mother sent me to school specifically to learn English. However, even today my speech is too poor. A small child can speak English better than I can, even though I began to learn English long before he was born. I was trained to write and to read silently. I was trained to know grammar, and I may know grammar better than you do, but I was not adequately trained to speak. We cannot train a dog to speak English, because a dog does not have the English-speaking life. Only human beings can speak the human language. Still, we cannot say that as long as we have the human life, we can grow in this life to be able to speak English. We all have the human life, but you speak English well, and I speak it poorly. This is because you received a training that I did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I continued by using the example of learning to fly an airplane. I said, &ldquo;We cannot train a monkey to pilot an airplane, because the monkey life is not good for this purpose. Only the human life can do this, but this does not mean that as long as we have the human life we can all pilot an airplane. If we believe this, we will damage many lives.&rdquo; I concluded, &ldquo;Dear ones, by this we can see that we need the proper life plus the proper training. We should not insist on either extreme. Yes, we need life; without life we cannot carry out the spiritual things. However, this does not mean that as long as we have life we need nothing more. In addition to the proper life, we still need the proper training and practice.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Apostle Paul&rsquo;s Realization<br />
of the Need for Training</h2>
<p>Near the end of his life Paul wrote 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, the three &ldquo;pastoral&rdquo; Epistles, because he realized from his experience that there was the need for training. Paul learned many things from his experience. For example, in the first stage of his ministry, Paul said that it is better to be like him and remain single and that to be married is a cause of troubles (1 Cor. 7:7-8, 32-34). At that time Paul had received a revelation, but he did not yet have much experience in the church life. Later he told Timothy that widows under sixty years of age should be encouraged to marry again (1 Tim. 5:9, 14). By that time he had seen some who made a vow to the Lord to love Him as single ones but eventually fell into fornication. These experiences taught Paul something further. In the early books of Paul&rsquo;s writing, such as Romans and 1 and 2 Thessalonians, we do not see the consideration of training, but his later books&mdash;especially 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus&mdash;are filled with the concept of training and discipline. He said, &ldquo;The things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also&rdquo; (2 Tim. 2:2). Paul had taught and trained Timothy, and now he charged him to train others with what he had been trained by Paul.</p>
<p>Likewise, in his earlier writings Paul said nothing about the qualifications of elders, deacons, and deaconesses, but in the later Epistles he pointed out all these qualifications. A man does not merely grow into qualifications; qualifications come from training. Therefore, training is very scriptural. In the past twelve years I have spoken much against many traditional and unscriptural teachings of Christianity. Because of this, some may say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, did you not tell us that we need life, not teaching?&rdquo; What I said is that we do not need mere doctrinal teaching. After we receive life, we do not need teachings in letter, but we do need training. Paul learned something from his experiences. Likewise, according to our study of Paul&rsquo;s writings and according to our experience in the past years, there is the need for training.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Watchman Nee&rsquo;s Burden for a Formal Training</h2>
<p>When I was with Brother Watchman Nee, he would often say, &ldquo;Witness, we need the training.&rdquo; Brother Nee was saved in 1920, and he began the work for the Lord in 1922. After a number of years, he realized that there was the need of training. In 1936 he bought a portion of land and built a center for the purpose of training. However, in August of the next year Japan invaded Shanghai, and the building was destroyed. Three years after that, in 1940, he rented a place in Shanghai to begin the first formal, year-round training. Every week there was one meeting for training, and many persons remained there all week to wait for that one training meeting. Besides this, we also attended all the church meetings. For the whole year we heard three messages a week, one in the training meeting and two in the church meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day and on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>After the war, the work of the Lord spread widely throughout China, and Brother Nee returned to his ministry. He told me, &ldquo;Witness, I will not carry out my ministry in the way that I did in the past. What I will do now is simply take care of the training. After 1948 he no longer took care of the church meetings. He stayed on the mountain with many lodgings in order to train people. These trainings were selective; not everyone was allowed to attend. The first period of training in 1948 was about six months long, and the second period in 1949 was also six months. He charged me to care for the work and fight the battle elsewhere. I was to send the believers as the good material to him to be trained, and after their training he would send them back to the churches. By this, I realized that in the first stage of the Lord&rsquo;s work there is not much need for training, but after the churches have been raised up and there is the responsibility of caring for the serving ones, we need the training.</p>
<p>After this time I was sent to the island of Taiwan. There we began the work in 1949, and in 1952 we began the training. This training was also selective. I did not train all the saints but trained only the serving ones, including the co-workers, elders, deacons, deaconesses, and all the promising ones. Every year we held a conference for one week to ten days with a large congregation of two or three thousand, which grew to four or five thousand. Each week we would meet on Tuesday through Friday in the mornings and evenings, and in the afternoons we would have practice. On Saturday the trainees would return to their local churches to serve throughout the weekend, on Monday they would come back to the training, and on Tuesday morning we would begin again. This went on for four to six months a year. The work in Taiwan depended mostly upon this training.</p>
