It is used with the intention of stressing the focal point of God's divine enterprise, which is to distribute, or dispense, Himself into man
The Father as the source is embodied in the Son, and the Son as the course is realized in the Spirit as the transmission
Returning to, abiding in, and exercising our spirit to realize the Spirit of God are fundamentally necessary today
It is by so doing that we can partake of all the fullness of God by enjoying the unsearchable riches of Christ
May the Lord grant us grace that we may be brought into such a realization and practice it in our daily life and in all that we do
For a proper application and better result, all the chapters in this book need to be read with a praying spirit
It will be more profitable to pray-read all the quotations of the Scriptures in every chapter and always accompany the reading with prayer
May the Lord's presence with His sweet anointing within be realized by all the readers in their reading of these chapters in the spirit
The apostle Paul was chosen by God to bear the responsibility for God's economy, and he trained his spiritual son Timothy in this economy
According to history, two prevailing elements distracted the early Christians from the right track: Judaism and Gnosticism
The Gnostics tried to bring their philosophy into the church, distracting the early Christians from the mark of God's economy
God's economy is God's dispensation, which means nothing other than God dispensing Himself into the human race
It means 'an administrative arrangement, a governmental management,' and refers to the dispensing, distributing stewardship of God's plan
In this divine dispensation God, who is almighty and all-inclusive, intends to dispense nothing other than Himself into us
God requires such a divine arrangement a divine management a divine dispensation a divine economy in order to bring Himself into humanity
Now that we know that Gods purpose is to dispense Himself into humanity we must discover what God is in order to know what He is dispensing
When a businessman plans to manufacture a product he must first of all be clear about the substance of the product or its basic constituent
We have seen God's purpose and what is dispensed by God; now we must realize how God is dispensed through His economy
We know that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are not three different Gods but one God, who is expressed in three persons
It is because only through the Trinity can the essential means be provided whereby His Spirit is dispensed into us
The incomprehensible God is now expressed in Christ who is the Word of God the invisible God is revealed in Christ who is the image of God
Just as blue was added to the handkerchief so the human nature was added to the divine nature and the onceseparated natures have become one
The first step of God's dispensing Himself into man, therefore, is through the embodiment and incarnation of Himself in the Son as a man
There are seven basic elements that make up this wonderful person, six of which were added through His history
The Gospel of John, which emphasizes that He is the Son of God, also tells us that He was tired, hungry, and thirsty and that He wept
His human sufferings also were part of His daily life, which included many earthly troubles, problems, trials, and persecutions
In Christ there is the divine nature, the human nature, the daily human life with its sufferings, and also the effectiveness of His death
By His ascension to the heavens He transcended all enemies, principalities, powers, dominions, and authorities
Christ, the man with the divine nature, is enthroned in the third heaven as the exalted Head of the whole universe
According to the first steps of His economy, the Father placed Himself in the Son, and the Son has the seven elements mingled with Himself
All that is in the Father is in the Son, and both the Father and the Son, containing all the elements in Christ, are brought into the Spirit
The Holy Spirit, after the Lord's ascension, is no longer the same as the Spirit of God in the Old Testament times
If we are distracted from this, however good and scriptural other things may be, we will surely miss the mark of God's economy
Thy sweet anointing with Thy might In weakness doth sustain; By Thy supply of energy My strength Thou dost maintain
In chapter 1 we saw that God's economy is to dispense Himself into us by means of the three persons of the Godhead
At one end is the source or the storage of electricity, and at the other end is the transmission of electricity into our homes
Strictly speaking, there is only one dispensation that we need-the economy of God with the dispensing of God Himself
The sixty-six books of the Scriptures are a full record of this one dispensation-the dispensing of God Himself into us
When we are in the Holy Spirit, there is no need to reckon ourselves dead, because we are enjoying Him as this wonderful dose
When we fellowship with Jesus in this Spirit and when we live in this wonderful Spirit, we automatically have inward comfort
When we fellowship with the Lord and walk in the Holy Spirit, we will spontaneously have inward light for guidance
By contacting Him, we will see what a wonderful Spirit He is, dwelling within us to be the bountiful and all-sufficient supply
Too many doctrines in Christianity are distracting the Lord's people from the Lord Himself, causing them to miss the mark of God's economy
Christians even read the Scriptures in a wrong way, since they make little or no contact with the Holy Spirit in their reading
From morning to evening we must deal with the One who dwells in us, for He is the bountiful supply of the Lord Jesus
Only as we are in the Spirit, just as the Father and the Son are in the Spirit, can we experience this mutual abiding
When we are in the Spirit, we are abiding in the Son and the Father, and at the same time They are abiding in us
The Lord is also the Spirit of life within us as water that refreshes, strengthens, and fills us with the inner life
If a policeman stood on the street in plain clothes without his uniform, no one would respect him as a policeman
The Lord told them to wait until He had ascended to the heavens to be enthroned as the Head and the authority of the universe
It was by His ascension and enthronement that He gained the position to pour Himself down in the Holy Spirit as the authority
On the day of resurrection, which is the day of life, the Holy Spirit came out of the Lord and entered the disciples as the breath of life
He may put on his uniform and exercise his position of authority, but he will have no inward strength and refreshment
Some Christians who are filled within are without the uniform, and other Christians who wear a proper uniform are empty within
We need the Holy Spirit of the resurrection day as life within us and the Holy Spirit of the Pentecostal day as power upon us
If we have both aspects of the Spirit, we will experience the blessed mingling of the Holy Spirit within and without
Many Christians are troubled about post-tribulation rapture, pre-tribulation rapture, partial rapture, or some other kind of rapture
Let us aim at the mark of His economy, deal with the living Christ in the Holy Spirit, and be filled and clothed with Him
Some argue about eternal security, but the real security is simply Christ Himself , not the teaching of eternal security
We will be teaching things that only raise questions rather than concentrating our full attention on the mark of God's economy
Although we can certainly receive help from doctrine, the main center of God's economy is not doctrine but the living One in the Holy Spirit
If we contact this living One in the wonderful Holy Spirit throughout the whole day, three things will happen within
If we are in the Holy Spirit, we will be transcendent, because in this wonderful Spirit are the elements of ascension and transcendence
To be transformed does not mean merely to be changed outwardly; it means to be changed both in nature within and in form without
As we behold and reflect like a mirror the glory of the Lord, we are transformed into the Lord's image from one degree of glory to another
During the whole day, if we live in the Spirit, He will transform us by renewing our mind, our emotion, and our will
The economy of God and the aim of His economy are that God intends to dispense Himself into us and mingle us with Himself in His glory
The first occurrence of the word spirit refers to the Holy Spirit of God, and the second, to the human spirit of man
Another verse showing these two spirits is John 4:24: 'God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit'
Romans 8:16 further confirms the existence of the two spirits: 'The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God'
Romans 8:9 refers without a doubt to the Holy Spirit, but verse 10 speaks of the human spirit: 'Though the body is dead
The comparison must be between the human body and the human spirit, not between the human body and the Holy Spirit
The reason for this difficulty is that in the believer the Holy Spirit and the human spirit are mingled together as one spirit
Because of such a mingling in some Bible verses it is difficult to say whether the word spirit refers to the Holy Spirit or the human spirit
In the New Testament it is wonderful to see that the two spirits, the Holy Spirit and our spirit, are one mingled spirit
According to the Old Testament, God's temple is portrayed as having three parts: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies
Hebrews 10:19 says, 'Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus'
According to the above diagram our human spirit is the Holy of Holies which is Gods residence the very chamber in which God and Christ dwell
If the high priest had been unable to locate the Holy of Holies, his efforts to contact God would only have ended in failure
Speaking of the Sabbath rest, Hebrews 4:9 and 11 say, 'So then there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God
The Israelites who had been delivered out of Egypt, instead of going on into Canaan, wandered for many years in the wilderness
The reason the book to the Hebrews was written is that many Hebrew Christians had been saved, but they were wandering in their soul
They would not press on from the wilderness into the good land-that is, into Christ, who dwelt in their spirit
We must not continue to wander in our soul but must press on to enter into our spirit, where Christ is our rest
In ancient times all the people of Israel had access to the outer court, but only the priests could enter the Holy Place
Of all the Israelites who were saved and brought out of Egypt into the wilderness, very few went on into the good land of Canaan
All of this typifies that the natural man, the soulish life, and the old nature must be broken as the veil and buried as the old man
Another religious distraction is that after we are saved, we feel that we are weak and that we need strength and power
When we know the proper way to discern the spirit from the soul, we will hit the mark of contacting the Triune God
We tune our human spirit rightly when we have a broken and contrite spirit , when we are repentant before God and open to Him
If we have such a spirit the Triune God who is the wonderful Spirit and who is the spiritual electricity will immediately contact our spirit
In more than twenty translations of the New Testament there is a difference in the way the word spirit is treated
In some translations the word is capitalized in certain instances, and in the same instances in other translations it is not
In many passages it is difficult for any translator to decide whether spirit refers to the Holy Spirit or the human spirit
One may assert that this mingled spirit is the human spirit, but another may say that this Spirit is the Holy Spirit
Romans 8:10 says, 'But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness'
Now Christ is in us, and though our sinful body is still dead because of sin, our spirit is alive and full of life because of righteousness
Verse 11 declares that because of the Spirit's indwelling, our weak, mortal body will also be enlivened, revived, and strengthened
The Word of God is living and sharp, even sharper than a two-edged sword, piercing to the dividing of soul and spirit
The innermost part of the temple, the Holy of Holies, indicates the innermost part of our being, the human spirit
He has entered into death and passed through death, and He has resurrected, ascended into heaven, and been enthroned
Everything has been attained by the wonderful Triune God, and all these realities are in the Holy Spirit, who has come into us
The point is that this Holy Spirit has been dispensed into our human spirit, which is now the residence of God
If we do not know how to discern our spirit, we will not be able to locate the Holy of Holies, the place where the Lord dwells today
The enemy tries to frustrate us from discerning our spirit and soon after we are saved he does this by helping us make a decision to do good
If you could not find a certain portion in the Scriptures, these Christians could tell you immediately the book, chapter, and verse
To possess the knowledge of the Scriptures is one thing, but to know the living One revealed by the Scriptures is quite another
It is regrettable that many Christians have the Scriptures only in their hand and in their memory with very little of Christ in their spirit
Many know how to speak in tongues and how to experience healing, but they do not know how to discern the spirit and contact Christ
Romans is a general sketch of the Christian life and walk, and in such a sketch not much reference is made to gifts
We do not oppose any gift, but we must give a proper proportion to every gift; otherwise, we will be unbalanced
Signs and wisdom are gifts , but the apostle preached 'Christ crucified' and 'Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God'
Corinthians 12 mentions spiritual gifts, including speaking in tongues, but at the end of the chapter Paul mentions 'a most excellent way'
Rather than encouraging the practice of the gifts, he adjusts the Corinthians with some corrective instruction
The mark of God's economy is neither teachings nor gifts but Christ, who is the living Spirit indwelling our spirit
There is no need to give special attention to any kind of teaching or gift if the indwelling Christ is already realized in our spirit
Let us give our full attention to discerning our spirit, contacting the living Christ, and fellowshipping with Him
Day by day we need to learn to know this wonderful Triune God the unsearchable Christ the allinclusive Holy Spirit who is now in our spirit
Throughout the day we must seek to return into our spirit, discern our spirit, and contact Christ as everything
Romans 9:21 and 23 and 2 Corinthians 4:7 clearly show that God created us to be His containers so that we might contain Him
To illustrate, bottles are necessary to contain beverages, and light bulbs are necessary to contain electricity
After being made, the light bulbs must contain electricity; otherwise, they will be meaningless and good for nothing
Although this word may seem simple, it is the exact word needed to point out the main thought of the whole Scripture
The basic teaching of the whole Scripture is simply this: God is the very content, and we are the containers made to receive this content
The child mentioned here refers to the child born in the manger at Bethlehem, who is not only named Mighty God but also Eternal Father
Matthew 2819 says Go therefore and disciple all the nations baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
You buy the whole melon second you cut it into slices and third before this melon enters your stomach you chew it until it becomes juice
Now we can see the point: The Father is not only the Father but is also the Son, and the Son is not only the Son but is also the Spirit
Originally, the melon was on the table, but after being eaten by us and our family, the melon is in the whole family
There is the need of the three persons of the Godhead, for without these three persons God could never be wrought into us
In the illustration of the melon, without being cut into slices and received as juice, the watermelon could never be wrought into us
A human being is not a simple container, like a bottle containing a beverage; on the contrary, man has many different parts
Perhaps you have been a Christian for many years, and up to this very time you do not know the difference between the mind and the heart
We read in these verses that the thoughts of the mind can be blinded by the enemy, and the heart can be enlightened by the light of God
The god of this age blinds the minds of the unbelievers, but God shines His light in the hearts of the believers
In order for us to take a picture into a camera, three main things are needed: a lens without, film within, and light
Many times when an unbeliever comes to hear a good message of the gospel, we think, 'Tonight this man will surely be saved'
Regardless of how good the message is and how much he has heard, his understanding has been blinded, or covered
Thirty years ago Brother Watchman Nee was preaching the gospel, telling people that God's intention is not for us to do good
We ourselves are the camera, and we must learn how to use our camera in order to receive God in Christ as the picture
As the object, He must be wrought into us by the shining of the divine light through the lens of our mind onto the film of our heart
Spiritual experiences are simply the pictures of Christ taken into us, the camera, and impressed upon our spiritual film
If you look at their 'film,' you will find no 'picture'; the entire film will be blank, because they have no experiences of Christ
If the apostle Paul came and we opened his 'camera' and took out the 'film,' we would find that every 'photo' is a picture full of Christ
In the next chapter we will consider in detail all the parts of man, and later we will consider how they function and how to adjust them
In the previous chapter we saw that we were created purposely to be God's containers, having God Himself as our content
Besides the inward parts there is another part in this psalm called the hidden part In the hidden part You would make known wisdom to me
Thessalonians 5:23 is a verse indicating that we are tripartite, or of three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body
If we would know Christ and enter into Him as the good land and as the rest, we must discern the spirit from the soul
The living word of God is a divider of the soul and the spirit and a discerner of the thoughts and intentions of the heart
Philippians 1:27 says that we must stand firm in one spirit-not the Holy Spirit, but the human spirit-and strive together with one soul
Thessalonians 5:23 indicates that we are composed of spirit, soul, and body, and Psalm 51 reveals the inward parts with the hidden part
Thessalonians 5:23 indicates that we are a tripartite being-spirit, soul, and body-but it does not mention the heart
These verses show that love is in the soul, proving, therefore, that within the soul there is such an organ, or function, as the emotion
Concerning hatred, 2 Samuel 5:8, Psalm 107:18, and Ezekiel 36:5 speak of hating, loathing, and despising in relation to the soul
Since these are expressions of the emotion, these verses also prove that the emotion must be a part of the soul
In the Scriptures it is difficult to find any additional parts of the soul, for these three parts cover all the functions of the soul
On one hand, the Holy Spirit witnesses with our spirit; on the other hand, our conscience bears witness in the Holy Spirit
Deuteronomy 2:30 says that God hardened the spirit of Sihon the king of Heshbon, which means that Sihon's conscience was hardened
These verses offer the strongest ground for the fact that the function of the conscience is in the human spirit
Our soul can know things by reason and by circumstantial experiences, but the human spirit can discern things without these
To know, to groan, and to be indignant in our spirit come from a direct sense of discernment that is not dependent upon reason
Now we have the scriptural ground for these six parts: the three parts of the soul and the three parts of the spirit
The reason for this is that the heart is a composition of all the parts of the soul and the most important part of the spirit the conscience
Since the conscience is the main part of the heart, the heart must be dealt with first to ensure a proper relationship with God
When we were fallen, our heart was turned away from the Lord, but when we repented, our heart turned to the Lord
The veil between you and the Lord will be taken away by your turning your heart to Him, and you will see the light
We will sense that we are wrong with our wife, with our husband, with our children, with our parents, with our schoolmates
These steps do not take place once and for all when we believe in the Lord Jesus and receive Him as our Savior
Just as we cannot see without eyes, hear without ears, or think without a mind, we cannot love without a heart
They know the function of the eyes, the ears, and the mind, but they simply do not know the function of the heart
He does not have the knowledge, but his initial experience of salvation is a reaction or reflection of love in his heart toward the Lord
Of all, the Bible tells us that we were originally dead, but when we received the Lord Jesus, we were quickened and made alive
History records that thousands and even millions of people have been rapidly changed because their dead spirit was enlivened
Not only has our dead spirit been recovered and made alive, but a new substance has been added into our spirit
You need to thank and praise the Lord that such a wonderful allinclusive exhaustless immeasurable Christ has actually been added into you
It is to contact the Lord, to receive Him, to worship God , and to fellowship with the divine persons of the Triune God
She thought that if our heart loved the Lord, it was good enough, and there was no need to talk about the spirit
Two passages, Matthew 16:24-26 and Luke 9:23-25, tell us clearly that we need to deny our soul, which is our self
In the previous chapter we saw that the soul, our very self, is composed of three parts: the mind, the will, and the emotion
Our soul is our self, our very being, which has been extensively damaged and occupied by fleshly, worldly, and natural things
Corinthians 3:18 says that we must be transformed, but it does not indicate in what part we are to be transformed
Transformation, therefore, is to be accomplished in our soul, because the mind is the leading part of the soul
We have pointed out that the purpose of the heart is to love the Lord, and the purpose of the spirit is to receive and contact the Lord
In most versions the word reflecting is not translated in 2 Corinthians 3:18, but the meaning is in the original language
By being purified and transformed, the soul becomes the very organ, like a mirror, to reflect and express Christ
We love the Lord with our heart, we receive and contact Him with our spirit, and we reflect and express Him with our transformed soul
A building with many rooms always has an entrance and an exit; a person comes in by the entrance and goes out by the exit
The heart is not a separate and exclusive part of our being, but is composed of all the parts of the soul and one part of the spirit
Whatever enters into us must enter through the heart, and whatever comes out from us must proceed through the heart
For this reason the preaching of the gospel must be guided by the Holy Spirit that it might touch the human heart
The seeking one in the beginning of Song of Songs asks the Lord to attract her by His love so that she may love Him
They are seeking the Lord, but at the same time they are seeking other things, such as their position and their career
There are at least three verses that speak of singleness of heart: Acts 2:46, Ephesians 6:5, and Colossians 3:22
If we deal with our heart in such a way, our whole being will be open to the Lord, because the gateway will be open
If we are pure and single in our heart, the function of our conscience will immediately be very keen and alert
To further illustrate, suppose the Holy Spirit is working in your spirit, demanding that you answer the call of the Lord
You are quite logical, quite reasonable, quite right, but there is still the call of the Lord deep in your spirit
Our conscience can be made right only by our confession and our applying the sprinkling, the cleansing, of the Lord's blood
When this is the case, we have a God in name only; but when our conscience is purified by the blood, we sense that God is living
When our conscience is dull and full of offenses, it needs to be dealt with by our confession and the purifying of the blood
Following the dealing with the conscience, the faculty of fellowship in our spirit is dealt with, as seen in 1 John 1:1-7
When our conscience is not purified and transparent, the fellowship is gone and can be regained only when our conscience is recovered
If we are wrong in our conscience our fellowship with the Lord is broken and when the fellowship is broken the intuition does not function
A transparent conscience will bring us into the presence of the Lord, resulting in a living fellowship with Him
Through this living fellowship, it is easy for our spirit to sense the will of God directly-this is the function of the intuition
Through such dealing we can obtain a transparent and purified conscience, which will give us a perfect fellowship with the Lord
In the order of our dealings with the Lord, we must begin with the heart, because it is the entrance and the exit of our whole being
By having a purified conscience, a conscience without offense, we will have a transparent fellowship with the Lord
According to our Christian experience, this is the right order: the heart, the conscience, the fellowship, and the intuition
Many times we know something of God in our spirit, but because of a problem in our mind, we may not understand it
Sometimes it may take two or three weeks or even months before we are able to understand what we sense in our spirit
The history of the world can be divided into successive ages, such as the first century, the second century, and so forth
There is no doubt that we are regenerated, because the Lord is within us as our eternal life, and the Holy Spirit is dwelling in our spirit
Regeneration has been accomplished in our spirit, but after regeneration, we still need the transformation of our soul
Concerning the matter of clothing, many who are saved are just like the people of the world in their thinking about fashion
If they would be transformed by the renewing of their mind, their thoughts about their manner of dress would change
Not until they love the Lord more and give the Lord more ground to work within them will they be transformed in their way of spending money
We have Christ as life within our spirit, but now we need Christ to spread into the inward parts of our soul and saturate them with Himself
The mind has found another law, which is more powerful and stronger than the law of sin mentioned in chapter 7
The mind never again attempts to do things independently but sets itself on the spirit, which is indwelt by the Holy Spirit
It is one thing to renew the mind, and another to set the mind on the spirit and stand and cooperate with the spirit
Because the mind stands with the spirit, the spirit will rule over the mind, saturate the mind, and become the spirit of the mind
The putting off of the old man is the work of the cross, and the putting on of the new man is the work of resurrection
Between the work of the cross and the work of resurrection is verse 23, which says, 'Be renewed in the spirit of your mind'
If He knows that we have no willingness to obey, there is no need for us to receive understanding concerning His will
We must also know the positive side, that is, the side of always being ready to exercise our emotion according to the Lord's pleasure
She knew that the Lord allowed her to do certain things according to the desire of her emotion, but she realized that the Lord was not happy
The more we go our own way, the more we will lose our joy; we will not have the sweet, tender, and deep fellowship with the Lord
If our emotion is kept under the rule of the Lord with His pleasure and joy, it will be saturated with the spirit
If our soul is transformed, spiritual strength and power will even now saturate our weak, mortal body when we need it
In Numbers 20 the smitten rock, which typifies Christ as the One who was smitten and riven on the cross, flowed with living water
The rock typifies Christ crucified on the cross, smitten by God so that the living water, which is the Spirit of life, may flow out into us
We must not talk too much about doctrines, about circumstances, about future steps, nor about guidance concerning the Lord's will
Our heart has much dirt that needs to be dug out, and even in our spirit there is some dirt that must be dealt with
Perhaps at this very moment some accusations that we have not confessed to the Lord are still on our conscience
It is simply because there is a demand of the Lord that you will not answer, and it has become an immediate accusation in your conscience
If we would experience a free, inward flow of the Spirit, our conscience must first be dealt with and purified
After dealing with the accusations in our conscience, we must also dig away the many things condemned by the Lord in our heart
On one hand, many are seeking the Lord and His way, but on the other hand, they are still seeking many things other than the Lord Himself
It is easy to dig away the accusations from our conscience, but it is not easy to dig away the things that we love from our heart
There is no doubt that we love the Lord and are seeking Him, but our loving and seeking the Lord are with a complicated heart
Since the day we received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, He has come into us as the springing well of living water
One layer is the conscience, another layer is the heart, and now a third layer is our mind, which holds much dirt
Sometimes we think we are quite submissive to the Lord, but when He puts us into certain circumstances, we are exposed
Before the Lord you may have no problem, but concerning the saints in the church, you may not be able to submit to them
Many experiences and circumstances under the Lord's sovereignty simply expose us to the light so that we may know how stubborn our will is
How easy it is to obtain more and more spiritual knowledge while we remain unchanged in our life, our nature, and our disposition
My deep concern is not merely to give a message but to afford you a little instruction so that you will go to the Lord
Although you may not know how to solve them, they will be solved by the flowing of the living water, the fellowship of life
Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me
For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it
Three things are emphasized in verse 24: first, 'deny himself'; second, 'take up his cross'; and third, 'follow Me'
These two verses can be rendered, 'Whoever wants to save his soul shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul for My sake shall find it
He said to them all, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me
For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake, this one shall save it
In verse 23 Luke adds a word that is not found in Matthew 16:24-the word daily, indicating that we must take up our cross daily
Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness
That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit
The way God dispenses Himself into us is by the Father being embodied in the Son and the Son being realized in the Spirit
Not only the person of the Son is in the Holy Spirit; the accomplished work of the Son also is in the Holy Spirit
In the types of the tabernacle and the temple there were three parts: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies
In this Old Testament figure the shekinah glory of God and the Ark are clearly shown to be in the Holy of Holies
The three parts of the tabernacle and the temple correspond to the three parts of man-the body, the soul, and the spirit
If Christ is to be enjoyed as our divine portion, we must know how to enter into this holiest place, our human spirit
The title is correct, for Hebrews reveals how we may enter the Holy of Holies, the human spirit, where Christ dwells
Romans 8:34 says that Christ is in heaven at the right hand of God, but the same chapter says that Christ is in us
Many Christians can recite John 316 but they are ignorant of 2 Timothy 422The Lord be with your spiritwhich is just as important as John 316
For many years we had Christ as the treasure within us, but we were ignorant of the fact that He was in our spirit
The Lord is in our spirit, and His grace is in our spirit, but the way for us to contact Him is by crushing our soul day by day
It is to help us realize God's eternal purpose of dispensing Himself into us as our unique portion, as our life and as our everything
When you cannot endure a difficult situation and the suppression is beyond your strength, turn to your spirit and look unto Jesus
At the very beginning of the Scriptures, God is seen creating man as the center of the creation for the purpose of expressing Himself
At the beginning of the Word of God we are shown two trees-the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
In order to understand God's plan in the Scriptures, we must be thoroughly clear concerning these two trees and what they represent
According to the revelation of the whole Scripture, the tree of life signifies God Himself in Christ as our life
The Old Testament and the New Testament present the Lord Jesus a number of times as either a tree or a branch of a tree
We can sit in the shade of Christ as the apple tree-under His covering and in His shadow-and enjoy all His riches-the fruit of the tree
From the very beginning of time these two trees represent two sources-one, the source of life, and the other, the source of death
It was God's intention for this neutral, innocent man to take God into him, that God and man, man and God, might be mingled together as one
Another possibility, however, was that man would be induced to take the second tree, which is the source of death
When he took the fruit of the tree of knowledge into himself as the earth, he received Satan, who then grew in him
The fruit of Satan was sown in Adam as a seed is sown in the soil; thus, Satan grew in Adam and became a part of him
Although this is logical and reasonable, we need scriptural ground to confirm that something of Satan is in our body
The corrupted, transmuted body is called 'the body of sin' and 'the body of this death' because this body became the very residence of Satan
Sin was within corrupted man, but there was no sin within the Lord Jesus; there was only the likeness of the flesh of sin
When Satan came to possess man, he thought he was successful, but he did not realize that he had fallen into a trap
Israel went into the Red Sea with Pharaoh and his army, but they were resurrected from the death water without Pharaoh and his army
Christ brought man with Satan into death and the grave and brought man without Satan out of death and the grave
We need to say Hallelujah, because the Lord Jesus is in our spirit , but we must also be on the alert, for we are still in this flesh
Though Satan by the fall entered into man, he was dealt with by the Lord, and now through His resurrection the Lord is within us
The New Jerusalem is the Triune God mingled with the resurrected man, and the lake of fire is Satan's ultimate destruction
All that is not related to the Triune God and the resurrected man will be put into the lake of fire with Satan
In conclusion, the meaning of this picture to us today is that the normal Christian life does not consist of doing good
The normal Christian life is simply to take Christ and live by Christ and put the flesh with Satan to death all the time
Our spirit is God's home, His dwelling place, His habitation, the very place from which He spreads Himself through our whole being
When our soul is transformed into the image of the Lord, our thoughts, our desires, and our decisions will always express the Lord
In the same principle, the corrupted body, the flesh possessed by Satan, has become the base from which he can do his devilish work
Of course, God can never be defeated, but by our taking sides with Satan, it seems that God is temporarily defeated
We need to listen to the Lord's words in Matthew 16:24: 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself'
To live and walk by the soulish life means to live and walk by our self, which involves us in marriage with Satan
The evil one in our flesh will rise up to snatch and defeat us and bring us under his captivity, making us a most wretched person
If, however, we deny the soul, the self, and live and walk by the spirit, Christ as life will regulate and saturate our whole being
After being dealt with by the cross, we will be in the spirit, which means that we will be in the resurrection life
One test of how much our soul has been broken is how much the cross has dealt with our natural love and affection
He said to them all, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me
For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake, this one shall save it
He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life
When the cross is applied to our self, we will immediately be clear whether our fellowship is in the spirit or in the soul
The only way to determine whether we are in the soul or in the spirit is by checking whether we are now on the cross
When we deny the self by taking up the cross, the Lord Christ will have the full ground in us, and it will be easy for us go along with Him
Day by day we must learn the lesson to deny the self, to take up the cross and not give any ground to the soul
Many Christians know something concerning the cross, but they are not clear concerning the principle of the cross
The first item in the old creation is the angels with the angelic life, and the second is man with the human life
The rebellion of the angelic life produced the third and fourth items of the old creation-Satan and his kingdom
The soul of man was created by God , but it has become the self, which is threatened and corrupted by the flesh
God originally created the body as a good and pure thing, but it was corrupted by Satan's sinful nature and became the flesh
Sin corrupted the body, causing it to become the flesh, and the flesh influenced and controlled the soul, making it the self
The entire creation was damaged and corrupted by the rebellion of the angelic life and by the transgression of the human life
Included with Satan is the kingdom of Satan; therefore, since Satan is in man, the kingdom of Satan also is in man
If we want to meet Satan, there is no need for us to go to some special place-by going to man, we will meet Satan
If we desire to contact the kingdom of Satan there is no need for us to go to the moonby going to man we will contact the kingdom of Satan
Within man as the representative of the old creation are Satan the kingdom of Satan the world sin sins death the flesh the old man etc
When He became a man in the flesh, He became a man in the flesh of sin, since by that time sin was within the human flesh
Romans 8:3 tells us that Christ had only the likeness of the flesh of sin, not the sinful nature of the flesh of sin
In John 3:14 the Lord Jesus Himself told us that He was typified by the bronze serpent that Moses hung on a pole , which typifies the cross
The Lord not only put man upon Himself, but He also put Satan, the kingdom of Satan, the world, sin, sins, the flesh, etc
The Lord, incarnated as a man, had only the likeness of the flesh of sin, not the sinful nature that sinful people have
Like the bronze serpent on the pole, the Lord had only the likeness of the serpent, not the nature and the poison of the serpent
Not only Christ was crucified there, but also man, the world, Satan and his kingdom, sin, sins, the old man, etc
All that we have, all that we are, all that we do, and all that is related to us have been brought to the cross
We have now seen the principle of the cross, and in the next chapter we will see the principle of resurrection
We do trust that our mind will be open to see that all the things related to us, whether they are good or bad, must be utterly put to death
In the previous chapter we considered the twelve items of the old creation, the first of which was the angelic life
The angelic life as the first of the twelve negative items of the old creation does not include the good angels
After they rebelled the fallen angels became the rulers the authorities the worldrulers and the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies
The majority of the angels, who did not rebel, were not included in the old creation, which was brought to an end by Christ's crucifixion
After man was created, Satan came to induce man to sin, and from the sin in man many fruits were produced, called sins
Following the fall, Satan then utilized all the necessities for man's existence, such as eating, clothing, marriage, housing, etc
These necessities had been created and ordained by God for man's existence, but Satan utilized them to systematize the entire human race
Through the fall Satan injected something of his own nature into the human body to corrupt it, causing it to be transmuted into the flesh
Satan was the head of the angels, and Adam was the head of the rest of creation, but both representatives rebelled
Consequently, the whole creation was influenced and affected and needed to be reconciled by Christ's redemption
All the above-mentioned items compose the old creation, and as we have seen, fallen man became the very center of that creation
Satan with his kingdom and worldly system was in man, along with sin, sins, death, the self, the flesh, and the old man
Everything of the old creation, including all the negative things in the universe, was centralized in this fallen man
Christ put man upon Himself-not a small, simple man but an all-inclusive man, a man who included the entire old creation
Both the vertical and horizontal measurements of the building pinpoint the altar at the center of the temple premises
He ended this all-inclusive man through a Spirit who is eternal, a Spirit who has no beginning and who can never be ended
Romans 1:4 says that Christ was 'designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead'
Death could end everything else, but death could not end the eternal Spirit ; He is different and separate from all things
The principle of resurrection is the separation produced by the eternal Spirit, the One who could never be terminated by death
Seeing that the principle of resurrection is in the eternal Spirit of separation, we must ask where this Spirit is today
We need to forget about time and space; wherever Christ is and whenever Christ is, there is always resurrection
On the day of His resurrection, when Christ came to His disciples, He breathed into them and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
If we have this Spirit, we have the reality of resurrection; if we do not have this Spirit, we have nothing to do with resurrection
Resurrection is simply Christ Himself, and the principle and reality of Christ's resurrection is the eternal Spirit, who can never be ended
Anything else that is put to death will be ended; only the eternal Spirit cannot be held or terminated by death
The bountiful, all-inclusive, all-sufficient supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the power of Christ's resurrection
His cross has ended everything negative, and now His eternal Spirit is indwelling us as the power of resurrection
The more we live and walk in the eternal Spirit of separation, the more we will realize the killing power of the cross
If we simply live and walk in the Spirit, who is the all-inclusive dose within us, we will experience the killing power of the cross
As long as we are in the all-inclusive Spirit, the experience of the cross is ours, and the reality of the resurrection is within us
Both Hebrews 8 and 1 John 2 declare that today, under the new testament, there is no need of any outward, human teaching
Hebrews 8:10 says that God's laws are inscribed within us; thus, there is no need for anyone to teach us to know the Lord
It is quite possible for us to be Christians for years and yet not know that we have these two wonderful things within us
Through the Lord's death all twelve items of the old creation have been brought to the cross and completely crossed out
The new creation consists of Christ in the eternal Spirit and the recovered and uplifted human nature in resurrection
The divine nature is certainly God Himself, and the law of life and the anointing also are something of God Himself and His moving within us
There is no need to seek guidance from the Lord concerning honoring one's parents; the law concerning this matter is fixed
Regardless of whether a person is a man or a woman and whether he is old or young, rich or poor, he is compelled to keep the rules
The law is unchanging, but the word of the prophets may change many times depending on the situation of those involved
To determine the way he should honor his parents on a certain occasion, guidance was needed; therefore, he had to contact the prophet
When we are shopping for an article of clothing, one item may be worth two hundred dollars, and another, twenty dollars
In more than a thousand chapters of the Scriptures there is not one word prohibiting stylish hairdos like those of the movie stars
When they enter a department store, they have no limitation and no regulation except that of their checking account
When they enter a department store and pick up an item, something within regulates them and says, 'Put it down,' and they obey
The more we have the anointing of the Holy Spirit within us, the more we will gain the substance of God Himself
God Himself is the paint, the Holy Spirit is the Painter, and the anointing is the painting, the applying of the paint
The more we are painted by the Holy Spirit with God as the paint, the more the substance of God Himself will be added within us
From this eternal life there is the divine fellowship, and this divine fellowship brings in the light, which is God Himself
We must realize that either death or life and peace, as mentioned here, is something we can sense deep within us
Day by day the current of blood carries away the waste products and conveys the supply of nourishment to every member of our body
Negatively, it washes the members of our body and carries away the refuse, and positively, it supplies health to our body
Only the medical profession can tell us how much nourishment and discharge is daily carried out by the current of blood
We sense not only the inner flowing but also the inner shining, which comes only through the fellowship of life
The more we have the flowing of life, the more we are in the presence of God, and the more shining we will experience
When we set our mind on the flesh, as the apostle pointed out in Romans 8:6, we are simply setting the self on the flesh
If we remember only John 3:16 and forget Romans 8:6, we are a Christian with a poor salvation; we can never be a victorious Christian
John 3:16 is adequate for us to receive eternal life, but Romans 8:6 points out how to be a victorious Christian
Personified sin, representing Satan, is in the flesh, the Triune God is in the spirit after we are saved, and the self is in the mind
When we cooperate with the flesh, we have death; when we cooperate with the spirit, we are partakers of God, who is life
Such a person will not have any sense of emptiness, darkness, uneasiness, and so forth, because he does not have life
If he has life within, though the life may be sickly and weak, he still has a certain sense of emptiness and darkness
We have the deep, inward sense that we are satisfied, enlightened, strengthened, comforted, uplifted, liberated, and transcendent
The main riches of resurrection are God Himself, Christ as life, the divine nature, the law of life, and the anointing of the Holy Spirit
We need to bear in mind that the tabernacle and the temple had three parts: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies
In the type of the tabernacle Gods presence or the shekinah glory of God and the Ark which is a type of Christ were in the Holy of Holies
In other words we need to discern the spirit from the soul in order to realize in our experience the living Christ who dwells in our spirit
A sister once came to me, saying, 'If we are not in the spirit as the Holy of Holies, we are still in the body or the soul
When we received the Lord Jesus, we exercised our spirit, although we had no conscious knowledge of the term spirit
That night while he was with his family, who knew nothing about Christianity, he suddenly closed the door to his room
His wife and son asked him what he was going to do, to which he replied that he had some special business and that he had to close the door
The next morning after breakfast he had to go to court to take care of a case, and on his way, all of a sudden, something happened
After this, however, although he was saved, he continued to act and live in a worldly way and look at things as worldly people look at them
From that very day he discovered how to fellowship with Christ and how to take Christ as his daily manna through the reading of the Bible
His sins were dealt with at the altar, typifying the cross, but the world and the worldly things were still upon him
Three years later, by passing through the first veil, he dropped the world and the worldly things and entered into the Holy Place
Day by day he began to experience Christ as his life, his food, his light, and his sweet savor of resurrection
The letters reveal that from his experience of the breaking of the outer man, this brother is receiving the real discernment of the spirit
The bread is not the hidden manna, the light is not the hidden law, and the incense is not the hidden rod of resurrection
Many times when we come to the meeting with the sweet odor of burned incense, some may comment, 'What a nice brother'!
To partake of the manna from heaven and the living water flowing out of the rock does not prove that we are in the goal of God
Neither the passover lamb in Egypt nor the daily manna in the wilderness can compare with the good land of Canaan
The good land of Canaan includes not merely one aspect or one part of Christ; it typifies the all-inclusive Christ
Now in the Holy Place, day by day we read the Scriptures, contact Christ, and experience the shining of the light
They were saved when their sins were dealt with by the passover lamb, but the Egyptian forces, Pharaoh and his army, still enslaved them
With some people, a pair of eyeglasses is a 'soldier of the Egyptian army,' because for them it is a worldly item
With others, the matter of dress is not only a single soldier but a whole division of soldiers in the Egyptian army
They could always testify to others how they enjoyed manna, but at the same time they were wandering in the wilderness
One day they passed through the Jordan River, and in the water of the Jordan twelve stones representing the old Israel were buried
Or are we in the Holy Place enjoying Christ day by day as our manna, our heavenly light, and our sweet savor of resurrection?
We can enjoy Christ as the hidden manna, as the hidden law, and as the hidden authority of resurrection in order to rule over all things
The tabernacle and the temple, as we have seen, were composed of three parts: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies
Inside the outer court the tabernacle and the temple were divided into two parts: the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies
Before we see the items in the Holy of Holies, we must first look at the items in the outer court and the Holy Place
All Bible students agree that the altar is a type of the cross of Christ and the laver is a type of the work of the Holy Spirit
After we experienced the altar of the cross, immediately the Holy Spirit began to work, as signified by the laver
If we have had the experiences at the altar and the laver, it means that we have been saved and are no longer outside the outer court
Even though we may have outwardly entered Christianity, without the experience of these two things, we are still outside the kingdom of God
We have entered the main gate of the tabernacle, but there is still another veil, or gate, which we must enter
From the outer court, from the place to which we came by believing in the Lord, we need to enter into the Holy Place
The first item in the Holy Place was the table of the bread of the Presence, a table on which the bread was displayed
The table of the bread of the Presence did not contain only one piece of bread; it held a large amount of bread
After experiencing Christ as our Passover and the cleansing work of the Holy Spirit have we gone on to experience Christ as our daily manna
Although we may not have enough of these experiences, the main issue at this time is that we have such experiences
Although Christ can be enjoyed as our food, as our light, and as our sweet savor toward God, Christ Himself is in the Holy of Holies
Christ as food, as light, and as the sweet savor are the three items in the Holy Place, but now Christ Himself must be touched
The manna in the Ark was not the open manna but the hidden manna ; it was not the manna displayed but the manna hidden in a secret place
Aaron ministered in the outer court, offering sacrifices on the altar; Melchizedek ministers on the throne of grace in the heavenlies
We need to press deeper to enter into 'the secret place of the Most High' in order to touch the heavenly Christ Himself
The law is the testimony of God, and the lampstand in both the Old Testament and the New Testament also is the testimony of God
Those who have Christ as their living law hidden within them do not show forth much outwardly, but inwardly they know Christ in a deeper way
We have seen three things in the Holy Place: Christ as food, Christ as the light of life, and Christ as the sweet savor
They too were in the wilderness, like the Israelites of old, but the wilderness for the Corinthians was the soul
In Hebrews 4:12 he said the same thing to the Hebrew believers-that they needed to divide, or discern, the spirit from the soul
The reason for this is that the Corinthians were soulish in their gifts, and the Hebrews were soulish in their doctrines
For more than thirty-eight years the Israelites wandered in the wilderness, and day by day through all that time they partook of manna
The manna, which fell from the heavens daily, did not justify the wandering of the people of Israel in the wilderness
Before the apostle Paul dealt with the gifts in 1 Corinthians, he pointed out that Christ Himself is our portion
Israel surely could thank God for their daily manna, but the manna was only a temporary provision until they arrived in the good land
The writer of 1 Corinthians advised the Corinthian believers to adjust and limit themselves in relation to the gifts
Satan came into our body as the law of sin, but praise the Lord, when we were saved, the Triune God came to dwell in our spirit as our life
Satan takes our body, which is the flesh, as the base for his fighting, and God takes our spirit as the base for His warfare
According to the context of Galatians 5, the Spirit here must be the Holy Spirit, who dwells in and mingles with our regenerated spirit
My mind desires to keep the law of God and by itself desires to serve God ; however, my mind, representing my self, is too weak
My mind, representing my self, cannot keep the law of God; if my mind tries to do the will of God by itself, it is always defeated
If it depends on the flesh, the result will be death, but if it depends on the spirit, there will be life and peace
We must all be impressed with this clear picture: Satan is in us, Christ is in us, and the self stands in the middle
When we are independent and making up our mind to do good by our own strength, we are being tempted, and we will surely be defeated
The lesson we need to learn is never to be independent and try to do things in our own strength, but always to depend on the Lord
The mind in chapter 7 represents the independent self struggling by its own effort, which always ends in defeat
Once we rely on Christ and He takes possession of our whole being, our body is released from the usurping hand of the enemy
When we lived independently, Satan could take possession of our body and force us to do things against our will
In Romans 12 we are told that if we desire to realize the church life, we must first present our released body to the Lord
In order to realize the church life, the life of Christ's Body, we must definitely present our body to the Lord
After we present our body to the Lord, the second thing for the realization of the church life must promptly take place
A brother who truly loved the Lord and the church life definitely offered his body as a sacrifice to the Lord and to the church
When we take our full share in the practical life of the church, we must have our mind purged, renewed, and reeducated
Before they came, the church was very much at peace and in oneness, but since they came in, their minds have created trouble for the church
The Christian life may seem to be individual and private, but actually it is not; it is a corporate life, a body life
You alone are not the Body; you are a member, and you need others as members in order to realize the church life
We need to realize the church life by definitely presenting our body to the Lord by having our mind renewed and by having our spirit on fire
We have seen that it was composed of the outer court and the two parts of the tent of the tabernacle-the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies
In the outer court there was the altar which typifies the cross of Christ and the laver which typifies the cleansing work of the Holy Spirit
The experience of Christ in all these aspects forms the real content of the building of God and provides the very materials for the building
The New Testament church is not a church according to a certain pattern, but a church constituted of life and of the experience of Christ
The real man was not manufactured according to a certain pattern, but was born and matured by the growth of life
Not one living person on this earth through the past six thousand years has been formed; every one was born and grew in life
The three main components of the wall were the bronze sockets, the bronze pillars, and the hanging of fine twined linen
Both the altar and the laver were made of bronze; therefore, all the sockets of the separating wall were made of bronze
The experiences of the cross and the cleansing of the Holy Spirit are the very base for the separation of the Lord's building
According to Numbers 16:38-39, the bronze used to overlay the altar came from the censers of the two hundred fifty rebellious people
The foundation, as seen in the sockets of the separating wall of God's building, comes from the experience of the bronze altar
When our whole being and all our actions have been put on the cross, we can testify how dirty, how worldly, and how sinful we are
At the cross we put everything of ourselves to death, and at the laver we put everything under the cleansing power of the Holy Spirit
When the tabernacle was erected with the surrounding separating line, one could see from afar the white linen that demarcated it
When we are in the outer court, nothing of the divine nature has yet been wrought into us that can be expressed
At this stage there is nothing of God wrought into this brother that can be expressed-there is no gold manifested
The wood of the boards signifies humanity, the human nature, and the gold overlaying the boards signifies divinity, the divine nature
Every aspect of our behavior and conduct in the outer court is right, for it is judged at the cross and purified at the laver
No matter how much we have been purified, we can only be white linen; we cannot be the boards for the building of the tabernacle
It is by this mingling of divinity with humanity that we become the materials for the building of the house of God
It comes from the experiences of the golden table, the golden lampstand, the golden incense altar, and the golden Ark
The gold that overlays the boards comes from the very experience of the contents of the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies
There were forty-eight boards in the tabernacle, which were combined in pairs, each pair of boards measuring three cubits in width
In the morning such a brother may be facing one direction, and in the afternoon he may face the opposite direction
We received the Holy Spirit as the rings at the very beginning of our Christian life, when we were regenerated
The rings held the bars which also typify the Holy Spirit but with the human nature signified by the acacia wood within the overlaying gold
It is this wonderful Holy Spirit with both the divine nature and the human nature who combines and unites us together
By this picture we can clearly see that the unity, the oneness, the building up, of the boards was not in the wood but wholly in the gold
The building of the church cannot be manufactured with human hands, by imitating a pattern or by forming an organization
The building of the church is not a man-made pattern, not a manufactured imitation, but the spontaneous growth of Christ as our life
Every part and every aspect of the tabernacle typifies either the work or the person of Christ-it is much more than a pattern
The tabernacle shows that by means of His redemptive work Christ Himself must be wrought into us as everything
The altar in the outer court typifies the allinclusive death of Christ on the cross which has ushered us into a right relationship with God
Confessing that we are sinners and that we have been put to an end by Christ's death, we receive Christ as our life
We think that we are only feeding on Him and enjoying Him, but actually the more we feed on Him, the more we are being swallowed up by Him
It must be born of Christ in the Spirit; it must be the living Body of Christ grown up with the life of Christ
In the outer court we experience the accomplished work of Christ, which is the means for us to enter into the Holy Place
The Holy Place and the Holy of Holies are not a matter of experiencing the work of Christ but of experiencing Christ Himself
Again we repeat: the building of the church is a matter of growth, which is Christ being progressively wrought into us as our everything
Through the process of regeneration and maturing by the Spirit, all the materials will be fitly framed together and united as a whole
In the type of the tabernacle, as we have seen, the roof consisted of four layers, and every layer signifies an aspect of Christ
The tabernacle thus becomes an expression of Christ through this covering, which covered the tabernacle completely
Only Christ must be uplifted; only Christ must be exalted; only Christ must be expressed as the roof to cover us
If we read the measurements of the tabernacle , we will discover that the covering included not only the roof but also the two sides
Outside they saw nothing but Christ, and inside they saw nothing but Christ wrought into and mingled with humanity
From without people can see nothing but Christ, and from within they see nothing but Christ wrought into many persons
Blue signifies that which is heavenly, purple denotes royalty, and scarlet signifies the blood of Christ shed for redemption
The basic material, however, was fine linen, which symbolizes the humanity of Christ with all His fine characteristics and behavior
The curtains of the tabernacle were fine yet very strong, and because they were made of twined linen, they were doubled in strength
He was a real man with a fine human nature and conduct, but He was also the embodiment of the glory of God wrought into His creature
Matthew 25:31-46 speaks of the division and difference between the sheep and the goats, and the goats are shown to be sinful people
After the rams' skins dyed red, there was the fourth layer, which constituted the outer covering of the tabernacle
My emphasis, however, is not on these matters but on the very Christ who is full of beauty within and is simple and humble without
Once the attack of the enemy comes, those in the beautiful buildings of the so-called Christian churches will be the first to fall
Only those who do not bear any outward show but have the heavenly beauty and divine comeliness within them will endure to the end
When we speak of a person's house, we refer to the place where he dwells, where he lives, where he works out his life
God is living, and now He dwells in the church, moves in the church, lives in the church, and works out His whole life in the church
Everything that can be seen everything that can be touched everything that can be possessed and enjoyed is not real but is at best a shadow
All the types, all the figures, and all the shadows in the Old Testament were only pictures of the reality to come, which is Christ Himself
Christ is the truth; Christ is the reality of the entire universe; Christ is the reality of the Old Testament and also of the New Testament
The church, in which the living God dwells, lives, and moves, is the pillar and base on which the reality stands
Come and see the reality of life, the reality of love, the reality of patience, and the reality of many other things'
Everything that we need-patience, humility, kindness, love for others, and even love for God-must be found in Christ Himself
If we have Christ living out through us, we have the reality and fulfillment of all the requirements of the Ten Commandments
We must consider these two aspects-inwardly, God's dwelling in the church, and outwardly, the church bearing the testimony and the reality
The manifestation of God in the flesh has very much to do with the church being the house of God and the pillar and base of the truth
When we are the living Body of Christ in a certain place, we are truly the house of God and the pillar and base of the truth
The principle of the New Testament is the principle of incarnation, which is simply God Himself manifested in the flesh
The church must be the manifestation of God in Christ through the Spirit, not the demonstration of doctrines or gifts
According to their daily walk, most Christians today do not know the way of the inner life and of Christ as their life
When people gain a certain kind of realization or learn certain methods, they try to start something new where they live
As a result, he got rid of all these things; he crossed out the clergyman's title and began to wear ordinary clothes
After this, he went to work for the Lord at another place and in another way, without the title and without the robe
The outward change was not the result of an inward change in life; hence, it became simply another new religious movement
We learned that Christ was born of a virgin and lived, walked, and worked on the earth, and we even believed that He was resurrected
Sometimes all the members of the church paraded on the streets, holding up crosses and singing 'Onward Christian Soldiers'
Today some insist on ministering a set of teachings such as predestination, man's free will, absolute grace, and eternal security
It is possible to minister all these teachings, but the life and the spirit within people may never be touched
Just as the teachings should be the means to convey Christ to others, so also the gifts should be the means only to convey Christ
All these things simply prove one thing: that God's intention is not to give us teachings and gifts but to give us Christ, the living One
We all must realize that God's intention is that we know the living One, the Triune God, and experience Christ in the Holy Spirit
When the inner life and the indwelling Christ are ministered, how great is their need for an inner revelation!
We must also see that the building of the church is not a matter of position or responsibility but a matter of life in our inner being
It is not a matter of putting someone into a position, but a matter of the growth of the inner life unto maturity
God uses teachings to help some people, and He uses the gifts to help others, but these are not the main thing
The living God will dwell, live, and work in us, and we will bear the testimony of Jesus, who is the reality of the entire universe
We have pointed out that the word economy in Greek means 'administration, stewardship, government, arrangement, dispensation'
The word dispensation is used here without any thought of periods of time, but with the denotation of the dispensing of God into us
God created and redeemed man for this purpose, that man might be the container into which He could dispense Himself
In the entire universe-time, space, and eternity-the center of God's economy is to dispense Himself into humanity
Eventually the ultimate consummation of all Gods work of creation redemption and transformation is the universal mingling of God with man
The New Jerusalem comes into existence as the ultimate result of all God's work as recorded in the sixty-six books of the Scriptures
The Son is both the embodiment and the expression of the Father ; no one but the Son has ever seen God the Father
In the Son God has accomplished all that He planned through four major steps: incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
God was brought into the human nature and lived in that nature for thirty-three and a half years on this earth
It was not merely a man by the name of Jesus who suffered; rather, it was also God within this man who suffered
Resurrection recovered and uplifted the standard of the humanity created by God and brought the human nature into God
Through incarnation the divine nature was brought into man; through resurrection the human nature was brought into God
Now it is possible for man to have more than a created human nature for the human nature has been regenerated uplifted and brought into God
Since all the negative things have been dealt with and terminated by the cross, there is nothing negative in this model
The New Testament deals more with the fact that God in the Spirit has come into us than with the fact of His coming upon us
Only the innermost part, the Holy of Holies, was the place where God's shekinah glory dwelt and where the Ark as a type of Christ remained
We can trace this from the Scriptures very clearly, especially in 2 Timothy 4:22, which says, 'The Lord be with your spirit'
If we lack the experience of practically living by Christ, we will be only a certain kind of 'religious church'
In the spiritual realm, we may know all the good, scriptural, and even spiritual teachings and yet be starving from the lack of food
The churches today need 'mothers' to nurse the young ones and give them not teachings but something of Christ to eat and drink
To build up Christ's Body, we must feed on Christ, eat Christ, and drink Christ so that we will be nourished with Christ
We need to forget about ourselves and contact Him, enjoy Him, be regulated by Him, and be anointed by Him all the time
As you allow Christ to be your daily food, you will be able to testify to the whole universe, 'I am tasting Christ day by day
When we drive our car, we know where to put the gasoline and how to start the car; that is the mark of operating a car
The all-inclusive Christ as the good land is in our spirit, and His dwelling in the Holy of Holies also is in our spirit
If we do not know how to discern our spirit from our soul, we will miss the mark and will be unable to enjoy Christ
If people are fed with Christ, He will become the material in them, and the Body of Christ will gradually grow and be built up
