<p>This is just like what the Bible shows us. The divine power of God has granted unto us all things related to life and godliness. The sufficient life supply will meet all our needs. Therefore, we do not have to worry; we need only to draw on God’s supply by faith.<p>Second Peter 1 opens by saying that we have been allotted like precious faith from God. Through this faith, all the things related to life and godliness will become reality to us, and we will be led into this reality. The divine nature will also become the element of our Christian living and experience. Then holiness and perfection are not hard matters to us; even overcoming and being spiritual are very easy. This is like my sitting inside a 747 jumbo jet flying from Taipei to Los Angeles. I will get there after flying for fourteen hours. Actually, it was not I who was flying; I was merely enjoying. Similarly, what delivered Noah and his eight family members from the destruction by the flood was not Noah himself, but the ark. The ark delivered them from the judgment of the flood; yet they themselves were inside enjoying God’s preparation.<p>Today our Christian life is also like this. Everything in Christ is an enjoyment. If we are not in Christ, our being a working one is a heavy burden. Marriage and rearing up children are all burdens. What a suffering it is! Therefore, we should not forget that the beginning of 2 Peter 1 tells us that the divine power of God has already granted to us all things related to life and godliness. God within us is our life, and He is also supplying us day by day.<p>The sad thing is that although we have Christ as the “747,” we often do not get onto the plane. We have Christ as the ark, yet we often do not go in. We still try to use our own efforts and schemes, yet the result is that we bring to ourselves burdens and difficulties. Then how do we get onto the spiritual “747”? How do we enter into the ark? As long as we are contacting Christ, it does not matter where we are or what time it is, because He belongs to us. First Corinthians 10:4 says that the Israelites in the Old Testament had a living rock following them, which was Christ. Today Christ as the real rock is following us. We may contact Him at any time. We may call on Him from our heart at any time, “O Lord Jesus!” Even though one call seems so simple, yet it is really something; we can get the deliverance. Just by our calling, we enjoy the Lord as life within, and we will manifest godliness without. When we call on Him unceasingly in this way, although we do not see Him outwardly, yet in our spirit we can contact Him and enjoy our organic union with Him. By this He becomes our content and supply.<p>We have to realize that all of our problems occur because our union with the Lord is broken. If the electricity stops in the day to day life, the lights, sound, and air conditioning will all be gone. We will not be able to do anything. But as long as the electricity is connected, all of these will be available. This is a very good illustration. Sometimes we may be wrong and may not be clear concerning the Lord’s leading. This is the result of our fellowship with the Lord being broken and of our having lost the joy and the peace within. I have had many human experiences and also a lot of difficulties. For example, I have many children and many grandchildren. All these are burdens. So I have only one way, which is to contact the Lord and call on Him. As soon as I call, immediately I get the enjoyment and feel happy and peaceful.
