   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the kingdom of the heavens is an exercise in this age and a reward in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This truth is very much lacking among today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hardly anyone is willing to pay the price to take up this truth and to teach it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For this reason, we should be burdened to take care of this matter, first being exercised by the kingdom of the heavens in this age so that we may receive it as a reward in the future and then carrying out the burden to preach the gospel of the kingdom to the whole inhabited earth according to Matthew 24:14.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Son of the Father is the expression of the Father as the source of life John 1:18, 4; 1 John 1:2 .</S>

   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because the Father delights in His Son, the kingdom of the Son of the Father s love is a pleasant thing, a matter of delight.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the reason it comprises only three sections the section of the church life, the section of the heavenly part of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium, and the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem as the consummation of the church and the kingdom.</S>
