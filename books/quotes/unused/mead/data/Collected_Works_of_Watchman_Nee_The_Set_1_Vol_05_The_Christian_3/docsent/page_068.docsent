   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"Miserable."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Laodicea thinks that its condition is admirable and enviable.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet the Lord told it that it is pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are pitiful because first they do not have Christ, and second they think that what they have is plentiful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The words "poor and blind and naked" form another phrase.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, Laodicea boasts of itself in three things, and the Lord considers it as having three shortages.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are "poor."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This of course does not mean worldly poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Materially speaking, they are indeed rich.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Others consider it this way, and they consider it this way also.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet they have nothing of being "rich toward God" Luke 12:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although they are rich, they have not put what they have to the Lord's use.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They have not made with the mammon of unrighteousness friends who will receive them into the eternal tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They spend more on themselves and on their children than on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, they are poor before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a church is full of worldly blessings and considers itself to be rich spiritually and materially, it must in reality be poor spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every time we see a person boasting of his riches in God, it proves to us that such a one is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Riches can only be found in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the church says, "I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing," it is boasting of its own riches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It considers itself rather than Christ the haven of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If this is not spiritual poverty, what is it?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever our eyes are turned away from Christ to the church, we become poor spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No matter how much we draw near to Him outwardly, as soon as we set our eyes on it instead of on the Lord, we are insulting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the same as setting our eyes on ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Philadelphia has not yet received everything that Christ has given to it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They only have a little power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although that church thought that it was poor, the Lord was pleased with it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"I have loved you" Rev 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But when a church has "become rich" and has glorified itself, the Lord is not pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the contrary, He will spew it out of His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Wherever we see a place having a little power and keeping the Lord's word and not denying His name, we can rejoice because the Lord will soon return for them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To confess one's poverty and weakness is not to doubt Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is only when we realize our own emptiness that we will depend on Him for strength.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we see a place considering itself rich and full, we can say that Laodicea is there already and that the Lord is about to spew it out of His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Laodicea is also "blind."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Of course, this refers to spiritual blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord cannot be rebuking them for physical blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If one is indeed physically blind, such a world-loving believer as those in Laodicea will never say that he has "need of nothing"!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The worldly riches and prosperity have blurred their spiritual vision.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the one hand, these do not know the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the other hand, they do not understand themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As such they are blind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those who concentrate on themselves will in the end see nothing of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who concentrate on Christ will see Christ and will also see themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once the eyes become blind, a person is not able to see any of God's work in this end time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To the heart of such a believer, the signs of the times are a novel idea.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is always the self-righteous Pharisees who "know how to discern" the face of the sky, but "cannot discern the signs of the times" Matt 16:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Immediately after the Lord Jesus taught the disciples about not storing up treasures on the earth, He told them that if the eye is single, the whole body will be full of light Matt 6:19, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The reason for this is that treasures blind one's spiritual sight.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These are also "naked."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those who boast in their clothing often boast in their money-pockets as well.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To care much for one's apparel is to seek for acclamation from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the world loses its grip on the heart, the dress will lose its color to the wearer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Laodicea is famous for its woolen goods.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although its apparel is fine in quality and its dyes bright, before God it is naked.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They spend everything on themselves and do not give their clothes to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Their selfish way of spending expresses their own spiritual nakedness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They have no good deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Such shame will one day be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When they stand before Christ they will be surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who are ignorant of themselves will no longer be ignorant of themselves in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is true that the Lord Jesus is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His righteousness will cover up all our shame and will enable us to stand perfect before God, even as He is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>"He has clothed Me with the garments of salvation, / He has wrapped Me with the robe of righteousness" Isa 61:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We the prodigals have received the Lord Jesus as our "best robe" Luke 15:22 and are able to settle peacefully in the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This speaks of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All those who have received the Lord Jesus as their Savior are no longer naked.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, we have to pay attention to another aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Before God, we are freely justified through His grace and by our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>No matter how our work is, our position will not be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is as far as God's side is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As far as Christ is concerned, it is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Christ is our robe of righteousness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>By Him, we can forever be saved from nakedness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This matter is settled and can never be overturned.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But whether or not we are naked before Christ depends on our work after we have believed.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Of course, this work does not refer to what the believers do in the flesh but what they do in the new man by the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Saints are saved from their nakedness before Christ through their own righteous acts Rev 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God's relationship with us begins with the eternal kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The time of trial and of the millennial kingdom is the time for the Lord Jesus to execute His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If saints do not have their own righteousness in the new creation, they will be put to shame at the day of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Laodicea is covered before God, but it is naked before Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>For this reason, concerning the Lord's rapture and His reigning, He will deal with us in righteousness.</S>
