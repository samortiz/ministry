   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MORE A PERSON IS AN AUTHORITY, THE MORE HE UPHOLDS AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>David waited in Hebron for seven and a half years because Ishbosheth, Saul's son, continued to be king in Mahanaim after Saul's death 2 Sam 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Later Ishbosheth was assassinated by Baanah and Rechab.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They took his head to David in Hebron, thinking that they were bringing good tidings to David.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But David killed them 4:5-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He judged the rebellious ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This shows that the more a person is an authority, the more he upholds authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot build up our own authority at the expense of others' authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The less a man seeks for authority, the more God gives him authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The minute a person rebels against authority he should be judged, whether or not he is rebelling against your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When David did this, he gained the favor of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Consequently, 2 Samuel 5 says that the eleven tribes sent men to seek after David.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A man who knows God's authority is submissive to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such a one is qualified to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You should not deal with anyone just because he has offended your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You have to wait for God's children to anoint you as the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before the children of God anoint you, it is wrong to harbor any complaints or murmurings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>HAVING NO AUTHORITY BEFORE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Second Samuel 6 says that when David brought God's ark back to the city of David, he danced before the ark with all his might.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>David was already king of the whole nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Michal the daughter of Saul saw this, she despised David vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Michal thought that since David was the king, he should have sanctified himself in the eyes of the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of course, it is right that a king should not be wild.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But David was not wrong in what he saw.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He saw that he had no authority before God, that he was lowly and worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Michal's mistake was her father's mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Saul kept the best of the cattle and the sheep; he disobeyed God's commandment and was rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yet he tried to save his face by asking Samuel to recommend him before the people of Israel see 1 Sam 15:1-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The way Michal took was different from the way David took.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God was pleased with David, and He judged Michal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Michal had no descendant until the day of her death 2 Sam 6:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that God cut off any continuation of such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He would not allow such a person to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When David went before the Lord, he felt that he was as lowly as anyone else; he did not consider himself higher than others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A deputy authority should take a place before God that is as equally low and humble as all the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He should not exalt himself or try to uphold his authority among men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On his throne David was the king, but before the ark he was the same as all the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They were all God's people and were all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Michal wanted to hold on to her way; she wanted David to be a king even before God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She could not stand David's action, and said to him, "How the king of Israel has made himself honorable today!" v. 20 . But God accepted David's way and judged Michal's way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Moses went before the Lord, he was the same as the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When David went before the Lord, he was also the same as the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may be an authority in the church, but when we go before the Lord, we are the same as everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the basis and secret of an authority being the same as all the brothers when he goes before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>HAVING NO CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING AN AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am particularly fond of one sentence in 2 Samuel 7:18: "Then King David went and sat before Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By then the temple was not yet built.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The ark was in the tabernacle and David sat on the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God made a covenant with David, and David offered a wonderful prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here we touch a pliable spirit, a sensitive spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before David was king, he was a warrior, and no one was able to stand before him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now that he had become king and his nation had become strong, he was meek enough to sit on the floor beside the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Here was a person who maintained his humility.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He could pray in a very simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a picture of a deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Michal, who was born in the palace, was concerned with pomp and majesty, like her father.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>She did not realize the difference between being sent by the Lord and entering into the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When a man is sent by the Lord, he may have a certain degree of authority in speaking and acting on God's behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But once he enters the presence of the Lord, he has to fall down before His feet; he has to know who he is.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>David was indeed a king appointed by the Lord; he was endowed with the God-given authority.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we count Saul out, David was the first king appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ is not only the descendant of Abraham but also the descendant of David.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The last name recorded in the whole Bible is the name of David Rev 22:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, the amazing thing is that though David was king, he did not have the consciousness that he was king.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He knew that he was nothing in the eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If a man is always conscious of his authority, he is not qualified to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>An authority must learn to know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The more a person is an authority, the less consciousness he should have about his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God's deputy authority should have such a blessed ignorance being an authority without having the consciousness of it.</S>
