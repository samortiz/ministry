   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 The Purpose of Calling On the Lord a To Be Saved</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why do we need to call on the name of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Men need to call on the name of the Lord in order to be saved Rom 10:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suppose a particular person hears the gospel and begins to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You can help him to be saved by having him pray to the Lord in a very quiet way, and I have seen many persons saved in this manner.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, if you would not only help him to pray, but also to call upon the name of the Lord, his experience of salvation would be much stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first way, the way of praying quietly, does help people to be saved, but not so richly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The second way, the way of calling loudly, helps people to be saved in a richer and more thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, we need to encourage people to open themselves and to call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>b To Be Rescued from Distress, Trouble,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sorrow, and Pain</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Another reason for calling on the Lord is to be rescued from distress Psa 18:6; 118:5 , from trouble Psa 50:15; 86:7; 81:7 , and from sorrow and pain Psa 116:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>People who have argued about calling on the Lord found themselves calling on Him when they were subject to a certain trouble or illness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When our lives are free from trouble, we will argue about calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, when trouble comes, there will be no need for anyone to tell you to call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You will call spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Calling on the Lord rescues us and delivers us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to call on the Lord when in distress and trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, Psalm 116:3-4 tells us that calling on the name of the Lord rescues us from many negative things such as pain, sorrow, death, and hell.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you want to be delivered from such things, you need to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>c To Participate in the Lord's Mercy</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Psalm 86:5 says that the Lord is good, ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy to all them that call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The way for us to participate in the Lord's plenteous mercy is to call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we call upon Him, the more we enjoy His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>d To Partake of the Lord's Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Psalm 116 also tells us that we may partake of the Lord's salvation by calling on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord" v. 13 . In this one psalm calling on the Lord is mentioned four times vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>2, 4, 13, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The calling here is for the purpose of partaking of the Lord's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we have seen earlier, the way to draw water out of the wells of salvation is to call upon the name of the Lord Isa 12:2-4 .</S>
