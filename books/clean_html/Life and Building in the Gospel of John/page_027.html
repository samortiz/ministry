<h1 class="title">BEHOLDING HIS GLORY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:14, 18, 49-51; 2:11; 11:40; 17:1, 4-5; Heb. 1:3; Exo. 40:34-35</h1>
<p>In the previous chapters we looked at three matters in John 1:14: the Word becoming flesh, tabernacling, and being full of grace and reality. In this chapter we will consider the matter of beholding His glory. Although these are seemingly different subjects, they are fully related to one another. The Word becoming flesh is God&rsquo;s tabernacling among us. God&rsquo;s tabernacling among us is full of grace and reality, and in this grace and reality His glory is manifested. These four matters are all related to one another. In this chapter we will consider the matter of beholding His glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GLORY BEING GOD EXPRESSED</h2>
<p>Although many brothers and sisters are familiar with the term <em>glory,</em> they may not necessarily know the meaning of glory. I must admit that this matter is difficult to explain, because our experience of glory is very limited. Even when the Old Testament speaks of the glory of Jehovah filling the tabernacle (Exo. 40:34-35), it does not provide a clear explanation or description of glory. The verses speak of a cloud covering the Tent of Meeting and the glory of Jehovah filling the tabernacle. There is a connection between the cloud and God&rsquo;s glory, but the cloud is not the glory. Hence, it is not easy to explain the matter of glory.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters think that glory is God manifesting Himself radiantly before men. Many Bible versions that have cross references link <em>beheld His glory</em> in John 1:14 to the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus on the mountain. According to the writers of these cross references, when Peter, James, and John saw the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus on Mount Hermon, they were beholding the Lord&rsquo;s glory (Matt. 17:1-2). We cannot say that the phrase in John 1:14 is not related to this incident, but glory refers to more than the Lord&rsquo;s transfiguration. The entire Gospel of John is needed in order to explain this phrase. The glory spoken of by John refers to God being expressed. Although God cannot be seen or touched, it is possible for people to speak of God being expressed.</p>
<p>The introduction to the Gospel of John is contained in verses 1 through 18 of chapter 1, and in this introduction John says, &ldquo;We beheld His glory&rdquo; (v. 14). John beheld the God who was spoken forth, the Word who became flesh. In His becoming flesh, He tabernacled among men so that He could express God. As soon as the children of Israel left Egypt and raised up the tabernacle, the glory of God filled the tabernacle. God dwelt in the tabernacle, and His glory was expressed through the tabernacle. When the tabernacle was filled with God&rsquo;s glory, it was filled with God&rsquo;s expression. When John wrote his Gospel, he used the picture of the tabernacle to tell people that the Word, who was spoken forth and who became flesh, was also a tabernacle. As such a tabernacle, God was expressed and could be received by men as grace and reality. He could be received because He was expressed in glory. This glory cannot be seen outwardly, but it can be seen by our inner eyes of faith.</p>
<p>According to the Gospel of John, glory is a person; that is, glory is God in the flesh being expressed. Although Jesus looked like an ordinary man, people could not help but realize that God was among them. He was like the tabernacle in the Old Testament, which was outwardly covered with rough and ugly porpoise skins (Exo. 26:14) but was inwardly filled with the brightness of Jehovah, the glory of God. When Jesus the Nazarene was on the earth, His outward appearance was comparable to the covering of porpoise skins on the tabernacle. He did not have any attracting form nor majesty, and His visage was marred more than that of any man (Isa. 53:2; 52:14). However, those who contacted Him could not help but realize that in Him there was an expression of God as glory (John 1:41, 49). When the Lord Jesus was transfigured on the mountain, the disciples saw His glory with both their inner spiritual eyes and their physical eyes. However, when John spoke of beholding His glory, his emphasis was on the glory that the disciples saw as the Lord tabernacled among them in a lowly man for more than three years.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPRESSING THE GLORY OF GOD</h2>
<p>The beginning word in John 1 is an introduction, a prelude. Every case that follows this introduction confirms that people beheld His glory. At the end of chapter 1, when Nathanael came to the Lord Jesus, the Lord spoke of the condition of Nathanael&rsquo;s heart, saying, &ldquo;Behold, truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile!&rdquo; (v. 47). He also said, &ldquo;Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you&rdquo; (v. 48). Nathanael was greatly surprised by the Lord&rsquo;s word, and he responded, saying, &ldquo;You are the Son of God&rdquo; (v. 49). In this lowly person, Nathanael saw something that could not be found in ordinary people, so he could not help but say that Jesus was the Son of God. Nathanael beheld the glory of the Lord.</p>
<p>In chapter 2 the Lord Jesus changed water into wine at a wedding feast in Cana of Galilee (vv. 1-11). In this situation people witnessed the glory of God being expressed and coming forth in a lowly man. Consequently, verse 11 speaks of the miracle as the &ldquo;beginning of signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee,&rdquo; which &ldquo;manifested His glory.&rdquo; The God who was hidden in Jesus was expressed, and this expression was glory.</p>
<p>In chapter 4 we also see a manifestation of glory. As a lowly man, the Lord Jesus was weary from His journey; He was hungry and thirsty. After His disciples left to buy food, a woman came to the well where the Lord was resting. In this situation His outward appearance surely could be likened to the porpoise skins on the tabernacle. When the woman came, He said, &ldquo;Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever&rdquo; (vv. 13-14). Through this word, the Lord manifested His glory. Even though the woman was puzzled, the Lord had stirred up a longing within her for this living water. Therefore, she said, &ldquo;Sir, give me this water&rdquo; (v. 15). The Lord said, &ldquo;Go, call your husband and come here&rdquo; (v. 16). The woman, thinking that the Lord had unintentionally touched the dark side of her living, tried to cover up her situation by telling the truth, so she said, &ldquo;I do not have a husband.&rdquo; The Lord immediately responded, saying, &ldquo;You have well said, I do not have a husband, for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband&rdquo; (vv. 17-18). With this word the Lord revealed that He knew her background. When she heard the Lord&rsquo;s words, she must have felt that there was something extraordinary about this tired and thirsty man with a marred visage. It is no wonder that she went into the city and testified to the people, saying, &ldquo;Come, see a man who told me all that I have done. Is this not the Christ?&rdquo; (v. 29). She saw a manifestation of glory.</p>
<p>In chapter 5 the Lord arrived in Jerusalem and came to the porticoes at Bethesda. There were many sick people lying there, but no one paid attention to the Lord Jesus, who had no attracting form. The Lord saw a person who was sick for thirty-eight years, and He asked, &ldquo;Do you want to get well?&rdquo; (v. 6). The man answered, &ldquo;Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me&rdquo; (v. 7). The Lord then said, &ldquo;Rise, take up your mat and walk&rdquo; (v. 8). Immediately, the man became well, and he took up his mat and walked (v. 9). I believe that in this situation the glory of God was expressed through the Lord Jesus, a seemingly ordinary man.</p>
<p>In chapter 6 the Lord used five loaves and two fish to feed many people. The Lord was full of wisdom and authority when He preached to the crowd; hence, they did not want to depart. The other Gospels also record this case, saying that the disciples came to the Lord and said, &ldquo;Send them away so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy for themselves something to eat&rdquo; (Mark 6:36). The Lord answered, &ldquo;You give them something to eat&rdquo; (v. 37). The disciples tried, but they could find only five loaves and two fish (cf. Luke 9:13). Then the Lord Jesus ordered the disciples to have the crowd recline by companies on the green grass. The Lord took the five loaves and the two fish and, looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all. Eventually, those who had eaten the loaves were five thousand men (Mark 6:39-44). In the beginning the disciples might have said, &ldquo;How can we divide five loaves and two fish among so many people?&rdquo; but eventually everyone ate and was satisfied, and they gathered the leftover pieces and filled twelve handbaskets (John 6:13). That was truly a manifestation of the Lord&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<p>In John 8 the scribes and Pharisees brought to the Lord a woman who had been caught in adultery (v. 3). According to the law of Moses, she should be stoned to death. The scribes and Pharisees used this case to test the Lord Jesus. They asked Him, &ldquo;What then do You say?&rdquo; (v. 5). This was a very difficult question. If the Lord said she should be stoned to death, how could He say that He loved sinners and had come for the sake of sinners? If the Lord said that she should not die, then He would be accused of violating the law of Moses. At this moment, the One who had a marred visage stooped down to write on the ground. When they persisted in questioning Him, the Lord Jesus stood up and said, &ldquo;He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her&rdquo; (v. 7). The Lord&rsquo;s words not only had much authority, but they were also full of love! He did not say whether or not they should stone her. He only said that whoever was without sin could throw the first stone. After saying this, He again stooped down and wrote on the ground (v. 8). When the people heard what He said, they left one by one, beginning with the older ones. Eventually, Jesus was left alone and only the woman stood in the midst (v. 9). Then the Lord Jesus stood up and said to her, &ldquo;Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?&rdquo; (v. 10). She said, &ldquo;No one, Lord,&rdquo; and Jesus said, &ldquo;Neither do I condemn you&rdquo; (v. 11). What glory was expressed with this word! His sweet love is indescribable. This situation illustrates John&rsquo;s word in 1:18: &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In chapter 9, when the Lord Jesus saw a man blind from birth, His disciples asked, &ldquo;Who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?&rdquo; (v. 2). The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but he was born so, that the works of God might be manifested in him&rdquo; (v. 3). The expression <em>that the works of God might be manifested</em> refers to the manifestation of God&rsquo;s glory. The Lord intended to manifest a situation of glory on this blind man.</p>
<p>In chapter 11 a man named Lazarus was sick and then died. His sisters asked the Lord Jesus to come and visit him in order to heal him, but the Lord did not come immediately. He waited until Lazarus was dead and buried (v. 17). According to our natural understanding, this was a hopeless situation. When the Lord Jesus arrived, they took Him to the dead man&rsquo;s tomb (v. 38). Then the Lord commanded them to take away the stone that was covering the entrance to the tomb (v. 39). When He cried out with a loud voice, &ldquo;Lazarus, come out!&rdquo; (v. 43), Lazarus came out. This situation was truly glorious!</p>
<p>Every case presented in the Gospel of John shows that people realized God was being expressed through Jesus the Nazarene. With Him there was glory, a glory that could not be found in anyone other than Him, just as a father can be truly expressed only by his son. This is the reason 1:14 speaks of His glory, the &ldquo;glory as of the only Begotten from the Father.&rdquo; The expression <em>from the Father</em> indicates that the glory He expressed can be likened to a son expressing all that his father has given him. Only a son can obtain and express all that is of his father.</p>
<p>Hence, verse 18 continues, saying, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; The Son&rsquo;s declaring is glory. God is declared in the way of glory. In the universe only the Lord can declare God, and only He has glory. After seeing all these cases, we should have a better understanding of what it means to behold His glory.</p>
