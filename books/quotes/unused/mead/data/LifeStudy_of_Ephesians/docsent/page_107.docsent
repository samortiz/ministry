   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SECOND GROUP, RELATED TO THE LORD A. One Lord</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 5 says, One Lord, one faith, one baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse does not speak of one Son, but of one Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Gospel of John it is the Son in whom we believe 3:16 , but in Acts, it is the Lord in whom we believe Acts 16:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the writings of John, the Son is for life 1 John 5:12 , whereas in Acts, the Lord, after His ascension, is for authority Acts 2:36 , a matter which concerns His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here, as the Head of the Body Eph 1:22 , He is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our believing in Christ is related to both life and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not many Christians, however, realize that they must believe in the Lord for authority as well as for life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As lost sinners, we were not only spiritually dead, but we were also without the Lord, without a head.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But after believing in the Lord, we have both life and a head.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Ephesians the oneness of the Body is related not only to life but also to headship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christians are divided because they do not care for the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 4 Paul covers life, which is closely related to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But in verse 5 he deals with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today few Christians care for life, and even fewer have any care for authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By the Lord s mercy and grace, we in the Lord s recovery care both for life and for headship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have not only the one Body with the one Spirit and the one hope, but also the one Lord with the one faith and the one baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>B. One Faith</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the New Testament faith denotes both the act of believing and the content of what we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Faith as our act of believing is personal and subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But faith as the content of what we believe is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The one faith in verse 5 is not our personal act of believing; it is the object of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As Christians we may differ concerning various doctrines, but we all have the one faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all believe in the Person of the Lord Jesus and His redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We believe that Christ is the Son of God incarnated to be a man, that He died on the cross for our redemption, that He was resurrected on the third day, and that He has ascended into the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This unique faith is held by all genuine Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is through this faith that we are joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As soon as a person comes to believe in the Person and work of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, he is made one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before this he was outside of Christ, but now he is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This Christ is our Lord, our Head, and we are under His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are members of His Body, and He is our Head.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we would keep the oneness, we must take care of both life and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The life-giving Spirit is working within us so that we may be transformed in soul, transfigured in body, and fully manifested as sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But we have not only the life-giving Spirit within us, but also the Lord as the Head of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, we must be submissive to the authority and headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>C. One Baptism</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In faith we believe into the Lord John 3:36, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>, and in baptism we are baptized into Him Gal 3:27; Rom 6:3 and terminated in Adam Rom 6:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through faith and baptism we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ and have thus been joined to the Lord 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The reality of baptism consists in realizing and confessing that our natural being has been crucified and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, baptism is the realization of death, burial, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through faith we are joined to Christ, and in Christ we are crucified, buried, and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Immediately after we believe in Christ, we should be baptized as a testimony of our realization of this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Baptism always follows faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Through baptism, we have a complete and thorough transfer out of Adam and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now we are in Christ who is our life and our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No longer are we in Adam with Adam as our head.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are in Christ with Christ as our Head.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because the Lord, faith, and baptism are related in such a way, Paul spoke of them together in verse 5.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>THE ONE GOD AND FATHER OF ALL</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 6 says, One God and Father of all, Who is over all and through all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God is the Originator of all things, and the Father is the source of life for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In verse 4 we have life; in verse 5, headship; and in verse 6, origin or source.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because everything has a source, it is possible to trace things back to their origin.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, most Christians today, being superficial, do not care for the origin or source of things.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We in the church life, on the contrary, must have sober discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This means that we must consider the matters of life, headship, and source, or origin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we trace something back to its source, we shall not be cheated or deceived or led astray.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Apostle Paul was a very discerning person, having received a keen discernment from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Beginning with the one Body, Paul traced the source all the way back to the one God and Father.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means that he went all the way back to the very source, to the origin.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In verse 6 Paul speaks of the one God and Father Who is over all and through all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The thought of the Trinity is implied here.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Over all mainly refers to the Father; through all, to the Son; and in all, to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Triune God eventually enters into us by reaching us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our oneness is constituted of the Trinity of the Godhead: with the Spirit as the life-giving Spirit, with the Son as the Lord and Head, and with the Father as the source and origin.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we see this, nothing will be able to distract us or lead us astray.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We shall have the proper discernment regarding the oneness and how to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The keeping of the oneness is a matter in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This means that the Triune God Himself is the base of our oneness, its fundamental basis and very foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Originator of our oneness is the Father, the Accomplisher of our oneness is the Lord, and the Executor of our oneness is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In our experience, however, the Spirit is first because He is directly related to the oneness, to the carrying out of the oneness in the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Following this, we have the Lord as the Accomplisher and the Father as the source.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, our oneness is the Triune God realized and experienced by us in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although many of us have been Christians for years, we have never heard that oneness is actually the Triune God becoming our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Our oneness is the Triune God the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father wrought into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Along with the Triune God, we have the faith, the baptism, and the hope.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>One day we received faith and were brought into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What a glorious visitation was this coming of faith!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>After we believed into Christ, we were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We became members of the Body with the hope of glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This oneness is the Triune God wrought into the Body, which comes into existence through faith and baptism and which has the hope of one day being glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>May we all have the heart to care for this oneness.</S>
