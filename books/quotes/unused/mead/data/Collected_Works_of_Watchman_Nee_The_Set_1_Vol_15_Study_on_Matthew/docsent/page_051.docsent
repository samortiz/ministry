   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The parable of the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since the Lord did not explain the treasure, we can find the explanation from other portions of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The treasures or, storehouses mentioned in 1 Chronicles 27:25 represent the glory of the kingdom of David.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The treasure mentioned in Ecclesiastes represents the riches of the kingdom of Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The glory of a kingdom lies in its treasures.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even during the period of theocracy from Moses to the judges before Saul , the treasures also represented glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a kingdom is strong, the treasures are protected.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But when a kingdom is weak, the treasures are captured.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The field signifies the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why is the treasure hidden in the field?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The glory of the kingdom of God has never been revealed on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, after the captivity of the Jews, God became the God of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man has not seen God's ruling of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even before the captivity, the glory of God's kingdom was hidden to men, with a few exceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From before the age of Moses, the kingdom of the heavens was always hidden until John the Baptist, who began to preach that the kingdom of the heavens was near.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How long was the kingdom of the heavens hidden?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From the creation of the world to the time of John Matt 13:35; 25:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Who hid the glory of the kingdom of the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God did Prov 25:2; Rom 11:33 "depth" means "hiddenness" .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Continuing the thought in the preceding section, the field is the world; otherwise, the Lord would have given another explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By this we know that the kingdom of the heavens will be related to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The kingdom of the heavens will appear on the earth Zech 14:5, 9; Psa 8 a psalm of the kingdom, where verses 7-9 mention the whole earth .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Its realm will be on the earth, but the part of the Lord's governing will be in the heavens, and the world will be destroyed after the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"Which a man found" refers to what the Lord did on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the world was in a time of confusion, there was a man crying in the wilderness, "The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord also preached this message.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Moreover, the teachings of the kingdom of the heavens Matt 5 7 and the power of the kingdom of the heavens such as healing and miracles all have been manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 44 does not imply the thought of seeking; it is merely a discovering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord discovered first; no other person discovered before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The "man" refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The angels and the prophets could not reveal it cf.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Heb 2:5-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Afterward, the Lord hid it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first half of this verse the Lord spoke in the past tense; from this point on, He used the present tense.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From this we know that "hidden" and "found" were accomplished facts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But "hid" here and "sells" and "buys" in the last half of this verse are things to be carried out at the time of the Lord's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why was it hidden again?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is because of the Jews' rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From the middle of chapter eleven they began to reject, and in chapter twelve they carried out the rejection see Matt 11:20, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, the treasure is hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to 13:41-44, this thing is now hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Afterward the Lord did not perform many miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When He did, He did it for individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Himself was also hidden cf.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>John 8:59; 12:36; Luke 4:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why was He hidden?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It was because something went wrong that is, the Jews rejected Him and because there was danger Jer 41:8 ; the children of Israel had evil intentions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord hides Himself from the entire nation of the Jews, not from the individuals or disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord forsook the entire nation of the Jews, yet He did not forsake individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord rejoices for the glory of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may refer to Luke 10:17-18 and 21, the only place that records the Lord's rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The disciples went to preach the gospel and the power of the kingdom of the heavens; they rejoiced because the power of Hades was being cast into the bottomless pit cf.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Matt 25:21, 23; Heb 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"In his joy goes" indicates that the Lord went to the cross in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This going is different from the going in verse 46.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There it is to go out, to depart; here it is to go back, as in Matthew 5:24; 8:13; 9:6; 19:21; Mark 2:11; 6:38; 7:29; 10:21; John 3:8; 4:16; 6:21; 7:3.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This proves that the place where the treasure is found is not in the house but in the field, that is, in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, He had to return to sell all that He had.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This means that He had to pay the price and give up Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the Lord came to the earth, He had forsaken a great part of His possessions though not all , and on the cross He gave up even His life see Acts 20:28; 2 Pet 2:1; Rev 5:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The purpose of buying is for obtaining the treasure hidden in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, the realm is the world 2 Pet 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, the unsaved also are bought.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord as the sin offering is for the believers; He is even the propitiation for the sins of the whole world 1 John 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God has great expectations for the earth; therefore, He bought it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The kingdom in the future will be related to the earth the kingdom will be on the earth Rev 11:15; Matt 6:10 and the Lord's heart is also on the earth Matt 6:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hence, the Lord will come back to the earth to establish the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the Bible, when buying and selling are mentioned, sometimes neither the seller nor the cost is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The spiritual meaning cannot be too material.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Verses 45-46:Bible expositors have explained the parable of the pearl in the following ways.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The first kind of interpretation, which began from the time of Luther and continues to this day, maintains that the pearl refers to Christ and the man represents the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But how can the believers buy Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Christ is the only Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>How could He become a pearl of great value among the fine pearls?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The second kind of interpretation is that the pearl refers to the choicest parts of the church, which are scattered among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Men would forsake everything to seek for them in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, men do not need to sell all that they have in order to seek the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Both the rich and the poor can seek the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The third interpretation, which was given a hundred years ago, is that the pearl refers to the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The fourth interpretation is that the pearl refers to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is partially correct, for the pearl does not refer to the substance of the church but to the parts of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Otherwise, the pearl and the church cannot be linked together.</S>
