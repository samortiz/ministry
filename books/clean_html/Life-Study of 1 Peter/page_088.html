<h2 class="head1">SUFFERING AS A CHRISTIAN</h2><p>Verse 15 says, &ldquo;For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or as a meddler into others&rsquo; affairs.&rdquo; Literally, &ldquo;a meddler into others&rsquo; affairs&rdquo; is an overseer of others&rsquo; affairs. This denotes one who causes trouble by interfering in others&rsquo; business. If we are careless in the church life, we may interfere, meddle, with the affairs of others. To gossip about the saints is to interfere with others&rsquo; affairs. If we suffer because we do such things, that kind of suffering does not mean anything. It is part of the vain manner of life.</p><p>In verse 16 Peter continues, &ldquo;But if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name.&rdquo; In verses 14 and 16 we have two names. The first name is Christ, and the second name is Christian. If we suffer because of these two names, that is glorious. This kind of suffering is a glory to God. It glorifies God because, when we suffer in the name of Christ and as Christians, the Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of glory, rests upon us. When we suffer for Christ, glory rests upon us, and that glory is actually the Spirit of glory Himself.</p><p>The Greek word for Christian is <i>Christianos,</i> a word of Latin formation. The ending <i>-ianos,</i> denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire. Those who worshipped the emperor, the Caesar&mdash;<i>Kaisar,</i> were called <i>Kaisarianos,</i> which means the adherents of <i>Kaisar,</i> the people belonging to <i>Kaisar.</i> When people believed in Christ and became His followers, this caused some in the Empire to consider Christ as a rival of their <i>Kaisar.</i> Then at Antioch (Acts 11:26), they began to call the followers of Christ <i>Christianos</i> (Christians), adherents of Christ, as a nickname, a term of reproach. Hence, in this verse it says &ldquo;as a Christian, let him not be ashamed&rdquo;; that is, if any believer suffers from the persecutors who contemptuously call him a Christian, he should not feel ashamed but glorify God in this name.</p><p>Today the term Christian should bear a positive significance, that is, a man of Christ, one who is one with Christ, not only belonging to Him, but having His life and nature in an organic union with Him, and who is living by Him, even living Him, in his daily life. If we suffer for being such a person, we should not feel ashamed, but be bold to magnify Christ in our confession by our holy and excellent manner of life to glorify, express, God in this name. To glorify God is to express Him in glory.</p><h2 class="head1">JUDGMENT BEGINNING<br />FROM THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2><p>In verse 17 Peter says, &ldquo;Because it is time for the judgment to begin from the house of God; and if first from us, what will be the end of those who disobey the gospel of God?&rdquo; This book shows the government of God especially in His dealings with His chosen people. The sufferings they undergo in fiery persecution are used by Him as a means to judge them that they may be disciplined, purified, and separated from the unbelievers and not have the same destiny as the unbelievers. Hence, such disciplinary judgment begins from His own household.</p> <p>As we have pointed out, Peter&rsquo;s use of the word &ldquo;judgment&rdquo; in verse 17 indicates that persecutions and sufferings are a kind of judgment. This judgment, however, is not for condemnation to eternal perdition. It is a judgment for discipline, a dispensational discipline to purify our life. This judgment is a fiery ordeal, a burning furnace, to purify us and remove any dross. We can be compared to gold, but we still have a certain amount of dross from which we need to be purified. No teaching or fellowship can accomplish this purification. The disciplinary judgment of the burning furnace is necessary to carry it out.</p>
