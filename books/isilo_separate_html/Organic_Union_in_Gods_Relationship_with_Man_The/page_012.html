This pleasure became His will, which eventually became His purpose. This purpose then became His economy through His counsel (vv. 9-11; 3:9). Through a council held among the three of the Trinity (Gen. 1:26), God made a counsel to create man and even to become a man. Hence, God created man according to His good pleasure. After creating everything, He looked on what He had made, including man, and said that it was very good (Gen. 1:31). God created man with a body and with a spirit and placed him before the tree of life. This was the first step. But man still did not have God. Thus, God had to take a further step, the step of becoming a man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S PROMISE TO COME TO BE THE SEED OF MAN</H2><P>Do not think that it was easy for God to enter into man. He first created man, and then He waited. God is a God who is patience; therefore, He can be patient. After creating man, He waited four thousand years before He came to be a man. The first promise that He would come was given to Adam (Gen. 3:15), and the second promise, two thousand years later, was given to Abraham (22:18). Still, He did not come; rather, He waited another two thousand years. Then one day, two thousand years ago, He came, not in the way of coming down from the third heaven and appearing suddenly as a man on the earth, but by entering into the womb of a human virgin. He was born there and remained in that womb for nine months (Matt. 1:20). Then He was delivered out of the womb of that virgin, and He became a child in the manger at Bethlehem (Luke 2:16). This child was called the Mighty God and the Eternal Father (Isa. 9:6). He was also called Emmanuel&#151;God with us (Matt. 1:23). He is God with man, and He is a man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Be the Seed of Woman</H2><P>After the first step of God's creation of man, man became fallen (Gen. 3:1-6). Then God came in, not to condemn man or to curse man, but to give man a promise that the seed of the woman would come to bruise the head of the damaging serpent (v. 15; Isa. 7:14; Gal. 4:4; Matt. 1:20, 16). That promise indicated that God Himself would come to be the seed of woman.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Be the Seed of Abraham</H2><P>After the promise given to Adam, God waited two thousand years until the time of Abraham. He then made a further promise to Abraham, saying, "And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed" (Gen. 22:18; Gal. 3:16; Matt. 1:1). According to Galatians 3:14, the promise given to Abraham was that God Himself would come to be the seed of Abraham, and this seed would be a blessing to all the nations by becoming the all-inclusive Spirit for mankind to receive.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD'S<br>GOOD PLEASURE AND PROMISE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Word as the Defined and<br>Explained God Becoming Flesh</H2><P>After His promise to Abraham, God waited another two thousand years before coming to be a man named Jesus Christ, who was also called Emmanuel&#151;God with us. Through His incarnation He as the Word, the defined and explained God, became flesh (John 1:1, 14a; Rom. 8:3m).</P><P>Since that time two thousand years have passed. A total of six thousand years have passed since the creation of Adam: two thousand years from Adam to Abraham, two thousand years from Abraham until the day God became incarnated to be a man, and two thousand years from that day until today.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
