   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With God as Reality and Grace</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>for His Dispensing into His Believers</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ came through incarnation with God as reality and grace for His dispensing into His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John 1:14 says, "And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us..., full of grace and reality," and verse 17 says, "For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The law could not come, because it had no life; hence, it was given.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But because He is a living person, Jesus was not given; He came down to man, and He came with something.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ came through incarnation with God as reality and as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Reality is God gained by us, and grace is God enjoyed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We gain God and we enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God as grace is God enjoyed by us, and God as reality is God gained by us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By gaining God and enjoying Him, we eventually enjoy all His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of His Fullness His Believers</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Having All Received, and Grace upon Grace</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of His fullness His believers have all received, and grace upon grace John 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today, the grace upon grace that we are enjoying is a matter of dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are enjoying and He is dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is dispensing for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our enjoyment today is altogether a matter of the dispensing of the Triune God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This dispensing of the Triune God into us can take place only by the Holy Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the reason that we must remain in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we get out of our spirit, we must return quickly and remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In our spirit we enjoy the dispensing, and from the dispensing we receive the fullness, all the riches of what the Triune God is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>IN THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In incarnation the divine dispensing was mainly for Christ, the Head, but in resurrection the divine dispensing is mainly for us, the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Head and the Body are two marvelous entities in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The dispensing in incarnation for the Head has been completed, but the dispensing in resurrection for the Body is still going on today.</S>
