Here we have the life and the light. We are also told that the life is the light. This life which is the light is the Word who is God Himself (1:1). In God Himself, the living Word, is the life, and this life is the light. Therefore, light is related to life.</P><P>John 6:63 says, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life." Here life is related to the Spirit, and the Spirit who is life is also the Word. The life with the Word is related to the Spirit.</P><P>First John 1:1-4 says, "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life (and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us); that which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. And these things we write that our joy may be made full." Here we see two more things that are related to life&#151;fellowship and joy. Therefore, light is related to life, the Spirit is related to life, fellowship is related to life, and joy is related to life.</P><P>Verses 5 through 7 say, "And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth; but if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin." In these verses we see again that light is related to life.</P><P>We also need to read Romans 8:2: "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." Here we are told that the Spirit is the Spirit of life, and with this Spirit of life there is a law. Of course, the law of the Spirit of life is related to life. Then verse 6 says, "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace." Peace is also related to life.</P><P>In the above passages of Scripture there are at least six things that are related to life: light, the Spirit, fellowship, joy, the law of the Spirit, and peace. The burden in my heart in these days is to help the Lord's children know the proper way to experience Christ as life. In other words, my real burden is to help people know the way of the inner life. Christ is living within us today to be life to us, but how can we experience Christ as life all the time?</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
