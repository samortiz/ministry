<h2 class="head2">The Question of Sects</h2><p>The principle in ascertaining a sect: (1) It has its own distinctive name, (2) it has its own distinctive organization, and (3) it has its own distinctive fellowship. (July 31)</p><p>When Dr. Stearns discussed the matter of leaving the denominations with Mr. Sparks, he was asked, "If you are truly under the headship of Christ, would you come under the Presbyterians?" This made Dr. Stearns clear about the matter of leaving the denominations.</p><p>We should speak to students about the church. We should let them know that we fellowship with all the saints and that we take care of the Body life. (August 2)</p><h2 class="head2">Among the Workers (August 2)</h2><p>If a worker cannot work together with another worker, there must be something wrong with his spiritual life. We should learn to work together with others. This is like a couple living together; both have to learn to rub off each other's rough spots.</p><h2 class="head2">The Prayer Meeting (August 1)</h2><p>Any problem in the church that cannot be solved by the brothers should be settled by prayers of authority. It should never be settled by the consent of the majority. Prayers of authority should constitute at least half of all our prayers.</p><h2 class="head2">The Bread-breaking Meeting (July 28)</h2><p>It is better to break the bread in the evening. The reasons are as follows: (1) We labor in the day for the Lord and enter into the enjoyment in the evening, and (2) indifferent ones also are screened out by holding the meeting in the evening.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning Visiting a Place<br />and Breaking the Bread There (July 25)</h2><p>If you are a guest in a place and only stay there temporarily, it is permissible to break bread and remember the Lord with the ones who are there. But once the matter of receiving arises, it touches the matter of church ministry. We have to be careful and not act rashly.</p><h2 class="head2">The Preaching Meeting (July 28)</h2><p>There are three things to watch for in preparing a message: (1) the message, (2) the material, and (3) the method.</p><h2 class="head2">Funeral Meetings (August 1)</h2><p>It is better for believers to personally conduct the funerals of their fellow believers. For example, in the Bible we have the Lord's death, Stephen's death, and the death of the condemned couple Ananias and Sapphira. All of their funerals were handled by the believers.</p>
