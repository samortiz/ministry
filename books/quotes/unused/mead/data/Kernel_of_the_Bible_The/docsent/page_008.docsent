   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S DESIRE TO RECOVER THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many Christians hold the mistaken concept that God wants to dwell in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But the Bible reveals that God s desire is to dwell on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is not satisfied with His heavenly dwelling place; He desires to come down to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You may love heaven, but God loves the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You may want to go to heaven, but God wants to come down to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Which do you prefer heaven or earth?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although most Christians love heaven much more than earth, God loves earth more than heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He has no problems in heaven, but He does have many problems with the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is eager to recover the earth that He may establish His dwelling place here.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God created man for the specific purpose of recovering the earth that He may have a dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The time of Abel, the time of Abraham, and even the time of Jacob were not the right time for God to set up His dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He had to wait until the house of Israel had come into being, had been delivered out of Egypt, and had been brought to Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That was the time God told the house of Israel to build Him a dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The tabernacle built by the Israelites was not only a type of the church; it was also a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, it was not just the individual Christ; it was the corporate Christ, the enlarged Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The tabernacle was Christ enlarged to be God s dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE GLORY OF GOD FILLING THE TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the tabernacle had been built and erected, it was filled with the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Exodus 40:34 says, Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that the God of heaven had come into His dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This matter has great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE ONE TABERNACLE IN GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God s intention is to have a dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This dwelling place is the enlargement of Christ, an enlargement that includes all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s dwelling place is not with one person individually; it is with all the believers corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In typology, all the children of Israel were one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The number of the Israelites must have been more than two million.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although they were so numerous, they were absolutely one; they were still one house.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These more than two million people erected one tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is difficult to believe that among this large number of people there was just one tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Most people, thinking that it would be awkward for so many to come together to one tabernacle, would suggest that there be several dozen tabernacles, and that a portion of the people be assigned to each of them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If there were twenty-four tabernacles, then the people would be divided into twenty-four sections, one section for each tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This would be the plan suggested by human wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christians today would probably propose that there should be more than a hundred tabernacles to accommodate this number of people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God s economy, however, is different from man s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In His economy there is one tabernacle for more than two million people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>SMALL IN APPEARANCE, GLORIOUS IN CONTENT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, this unique tabernacle was not very large.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, it was just thirty cubits long and ten cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In other words, it was forty-five feet by fifteen feet.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we had been there, we probably would have proposed that the tabernacle be a great deal larger, perhaps five hundred feet by fifty feet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nevertheless, in appearance the church should be one small tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All the people must come to this tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you do not, you will not be able to meet God or to hear God s speaking, because God s presence and His oracle are both in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Outside the tabernacle, God does not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the book of Exodus we can see both Christ and the church, the kernel of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We see Christ as the Angel, as Moses, as the Lamb, as the manna, and as the rock with the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we enjoy such a Christ, we eventually become the house of God, the dwelling place of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God s earthly dwelling place is not large; rather it is quite small.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The outstanding point related to the tabernacle is not its greatness it is the fact that God s presence and glory are there.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the tabernacle there was God s glory, God s speaking, God s light, and God s life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must see the difference between the way God does things and the way man does things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Man desires to have a large outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although the number of the people may be quite small, man likes to build a large hall for them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God s way is different.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although the number of the people may be huge more than two million He has a small building.</S>
