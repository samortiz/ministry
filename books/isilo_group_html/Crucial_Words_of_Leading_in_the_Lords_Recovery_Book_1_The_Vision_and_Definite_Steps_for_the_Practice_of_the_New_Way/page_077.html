<h1 class="title">HOW TO MEET</h1>
<p>I have now been in Taiwan for almost three months, and I have tried my best to go to different meeting halls each Lord&rsquo;s Day to see how we are teaching <em>Truth Lessons.</em> On one occasion when I met with the elders, I spoke a few words to them, but I did not pour out all of my inward feelings because I never want to tell people what to do without first doing it myself. Empty knowledge is of no value; genuine knowledge is gained through experience. However, I am also clear that my commission in Taiwan is mainly for the translation of the Recovery Version into Chinese. I spend ninety percent of my time, and even one hundred and twenty percent of my energy, on this matter. For this reason, I do not have the time to talk in a detailed way about the change in the system.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING CARE OF A MEETING&mdash;<br />
BEING BESIDE OURSELVES</h2>
<p>When we began to change the system, I said that we are doing something new. We must, therefore, learn to do things one step at a time. I never expected that the new way would be successful within one or two years. This is not possible. We need to work this out gradually in one accord. Concerning the teaching of <em>Truth Lessons,</em> after much observation I can only shake my head in resignation. Our way of teaching is not correct. We do not even know how to take care of a meeting. Please excuse me for saying this, and please do not be discouraged. I am speaking honestly because I want us to grow. Let me demonstrate how we should take care of a meeting. I want us to learn something.</p>
<p>In taking care of a meeting, the co-workers and elders must first be beside themselves. We must be &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; before God. The Lord Jesus was the first One to be beside Himself. Mark 3:20-21 says that He met so often that He did not even care for His food. His relatives came and pulled Him away, thinking that He had gone crazy. If the relatives of the Lord Jesus had not testified of this, we would never imagine that the Lord could be beside Himself for a meeting. We would have thought that the Lord met in an ordinary way and that the tone of His teaching was gentle and mild. However, if He had done this His relatives would not have said He was beside Himself.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was not the only one who was beside Himself; the apostle Paul was the same. In Acts 26:24, when Paul was defending himself before King Agrippa, Festus shouted, &ldquo;You are insane, Paul. Much learning is driving you insane.&rdquo; This means that Paul was so intense in his defense that others thought that he was insane. The spirit within him burst forth, and his entire being was &ldquo;exploding.&rdquo; In order to have an explosion, there must first be pressure. A deflated person can never be beside himself; he can never be &ldquo;crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expression <em>beside Himself,</em> as in Mark 3:21, means that one is away from himself; he is delivered from himself. Humanly speaking, when a man is delivered from himself, he no longer acts according to himself. He has lost the form and expression that characterize him. For example, ordinarily we may sing in a very polite way, but suddenly we jump and shout as we sing. It seems as if we have lost our senses and are insane. This is what it means to be beside oneself. I believe the Lord Jesus was this way when He met on that day. This is the reason His relatives said that He was beside Himself. If the co-workers and elders are beside themselves in the same way, and they are so &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; that they sing, prophesy, and read the Word ecstatically in the meeting, irrespective of how many people are present, our meetings will surely be successful and full of the supply.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to the teaching of <em>Truth Lessons.</em> We need to be crazy, and our spirit needs to explode. We cannot be like a deflated tire. Who will receive the gospel if we preach lamely and tamely like a deflated tire? Similarly, if we are not beside ourselves when teaching <em>Truth Lessons,</em> if there is neither life nor vitality, the brothers and sisters will be killed. After I visited some <em>Truth Lesson</em> meetings in various places, I became quite concerned. We cannot build up the church by taking care of the meetings in that way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM<br />
THE DEADENING INFLUENCE OF CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>Whether it is the big meetings, the home meetings, or the meetings for teaching the truth, we first need to learn to lead the meeting in a proper way. Before we can speak to people, we must know how to begin the meeting properly and how to make people &ldquo;come alive.&rdquo; If the brothers and sisters sit before us like blocks of wood, and we ourselves behave like pieces of wood, there is no way we can lead the meeting. In 2 Corinthians 5:13 Paul said, &ldquo;Whether we were beside ourselves, it was to God; or whether we are sober-minded, it is for you.&rdquo; This means that in our daily life we should be sober, but in the meetings, in order to glorify God, we must be beside ourselves and ecstatic for God. If we are lukewarm in the meeting, we are not being sober but are in fact bound and dead.</p>
<p>History shows that Christianity has been under the influence of deadness, darkness, dryness, and desolation for a long time. Such degradation has continued until it has reached the lowest level. The Reformation did not reverse this situation of deadness. It was only one hundred sixty years ago when the British Brethren were raised up to release the light of the truth that men were delivered from darkness. However, although these truths were received in the spirit, they eventually led to an exercise of the mind. In the name of defending the truth, numerous divisions were produced. Within fifty years the entire situation dried up and the Lord was forced to raise up the Pentecostal movement as a reaction to the dead teachings of the Brethren. Those in the Pentecostal movement would shout, jump, and cry. They were no longer dead, but they had no regard for the truth. This went on until sixty years ago, when the Lord raised up His recovery through Brother Watchman Nee in China.</p>
<p>According to Brother Nee&rsquo;s realization, the Lord raised us up in China because deadness, oldness, tradition, and Pentecostalism had pervaded the West. The Lord did not have a way to go on and was thus forced to turn to the East. Since the day that the Lord raised us up in China, the light among us has been clear; we know that it is the Lord who has raised us up. He wants us to overturn the formalism of Christianity, the deadness of the Brethren, and the wildness of the Pentecostal movement. We take the truth of the Brethren, but we reject its deadness. We take the release of the spirit among Pentecostals, but we reject their wildness. Regrettably, the co-workers have not been sufficiently infused and impressed with these characteristics in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Today&rsquo;s Christianity is a killing religion. Subconsciously, we have fallen prey to its influence.</p>
<p>I am not selling my &ldquo;seniority,&rdquo; but I have been conducting and holding meetings for more than fifty years. I have visited many places, and I am very familiar with the ways in which Christians meet. I have also read many books. I am clear about the deceiving, damaging, and ensnaring situation that exists today. We are still trapped in this snare. It is true that we are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, but we are not completely free from the snare of Christianity. We may have been saved in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, but we still bear within our being the things that have ensnared Christianity.</p>
<p>This is the reason I put aside all considerations and openly rebuked the co-workers a year and a half ago. I did not &ldquo;save their faces&rdquo; or leave them with any place to turn. I did this because, more than anything, I hate being trapped in the snare of Christianity. I dearly love every co-worker, but I hate the things that issue from the influence of Christianity. Such things have been killing us from the day we were saved. Even today, we are still passing these things on to others. This is what grieves and cuts my heart the most.</p>
<p>The co-workers have been under my training for the past thirty years, but even today not too many are beside themselves. This is sad. It is a loss to the Lord. I hope that from today we can all learn to be beside ourselves in our homes before we come to the meeting. We should be &ldquo;crazy,&rdquo; dancing before the Lord. This is not for men to see, but for the demons, the angels, and even that we would see. If we are &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; in our spirit, the brothers and sisters will be attracted and captured. In fulfilling my ministry in the United States, I did not speak beautiful English, and I certainly did not have any eloquence. Yet how did I attract so many brothers and sisters? I was able to be beside myself. We may have thousands of messages to deliver, and we may be full of God&rsquo;s economy, but if we are silent and reserved and do not exercise and release our spirit, we will kill everyone. Only those who are beside themselves and who are released in their spirit can lead the meetings properly.</p>
<p>In my natural constitution I am a reserved person. By nature I do not like to contact people. My mother told me that when I was five or six years old, I did not like playing with other children. I was always by myself. Later I received the Lord&rsquo;s grace and was forced by the Lord to learn to overturn my natural constitution for the sake of serving Him. Today I am an old person, yet it is still easy for me to be beside myself. I am ashamed to see co-workers who have been under my training for more than twenty years who are unable to be beside themselves. This is a shame to me, and it is a shame to them. Brother Nee once said that if a Christian has never been beside himself once before God, he is not qualified to be called a proper Christian. For this reason, all the co-workers must be beside themselves. We must learn to be &ldquo;crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I pray to the Lord, many times I hit the desk or the bed. Sometimes I jump, skip, dance, and wave my arms. We must realize that the truth, the Spirit of truth, life, and the Spirit of life make us &ldquo;crazy.&rdquo; In 1953 I conducted a formal training. I spoke to the trainees emphatically that they all needed to be &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; before God. When they set out to work for God, they needed to be beside themselves. Of course, this does not mean that we need to be crazy in front of others. We need to be sober before men but crazy in our spirit. Today when the full-timers visit people in the communities, they cannot act crazy when they come to people&rsquo;s doors. This will scare people away. We should be polite and sober but not bound. When we sit down, we must pay attention to our posture. When we speak, our voice has to be gentle and kind. However, our spirit must be burning. If we can do this, the listeners will touch something in our inner being. They will think, &ldquo;This man is attractive even while he is talking about Jesus. This is entirely different from what I have heard before.&rdquo; This shows that one recipe may make a dry and unpalatable dish in the hand of one cook but a delectable, juicy, and savory dish in the hand of another.</p>
<p>Hence, if we are crazy before God, our words will be full of power. At a crucial juncture, others will be convicted. Once they are convicted, we can have the freedom to be crazy before them. Then they will fully respect what we have to say. I believe this was what Paul did before King Agrippa. At a certain point in his defense, Festus shouted, &ldquo;You are insane, Paul. Much learning is driving you insane.&rdquo; In visiting the communities, we should have similar experiences. I believe if we follow these instructions, many people will be convinced, and in the end they will be saved and baptized.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_076.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_078.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 1: The Vision and Definite Steps for the Practice of the New Way &nbsp; pg 77</div><br></body></html>
