   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LOVING JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Have you ever noticed how long Galatians 2:20 is?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For many years I thought that verse was too long.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me" to me, just that much was sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many times I quoted just the first part of Galatians 2:20, thinking the last half was unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But Paul added, "who loved me, and gave himself for me."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul simply could not contain himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since he had such a One living in him, the love of Christ constrained him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is a constraining power.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The love of Christ constrains us to live no more unto ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He loved me and gave Himself for me; now I love Him and live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Apostle Paul had been an enemy and persecutor of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But at a certain time the Lord knocked him to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then he was turned from being an enemy and a persecutor of Jesus to being one who loved Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Real power is in love.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Love can do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the mothers know that there are many things that no one but mothers can do for their children, because mothers have the loving power.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we really love the Lord Jesus, we will have the power and strength to do anything for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I read a poem once which was written by a martyr at the time of her martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I cannot quote it, but I can recall the main point.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She said that every martyr of Jesus is one who loves Jesus; every one who loves Jesus will give his life for Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Can you die for others?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you love them, you can.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Love can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nothing but love could make us die for others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we love Jesus, we will be willing to die for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was why the Lord Jesus asked Peter, "Lovest thou me?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He asked him three times, and Peter answered, "Lord, thou knowest that I love thee."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then eventually the Lord told him how he would die.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God" John 21:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As one who loved Jesus, Peter would also be a martyr for Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do you think that to follow and sacrifice your life for Jesus is a suffering?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the contrary, it is really an enjoyment because we love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The power is in the love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>ENJOY BY LOVING</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Life is a Person, and there is no other way to apply and enjoy this Person but by love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some of the saints in past centuries used to pray, "Lord, show me Your love that I may love You."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to pray the same prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once we see the love of Jesus, we will be so constrained, so captured, and so attracted.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We will spontaneously love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then by loving Him, we will enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is life, and since this life is a Person, there is no other way for us to experience Him but by love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only by loving Jesus can we enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If I want to enjoy a brother, I must love that brother.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more I love him, the more I enjoy him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord Jesus is not a doctrine; He is not a set of gifts or a power; He is a Person who needs our love, our appreciation, and our affection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How we need the sweet affection and love toward the Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many Christians today hold the teachings, but are so cold toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They have all the doctrines, the dispensations, the prophecies, and the types.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some even have doctor's degrees in divine teachings, yet they are so cold toward the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can deal with teachings in this way, but we cannot deal with this Person in a cold way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can exercise our mind to deal with all the doctrines, and yet our heart remains cold.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we are going to deal with this Person, we must have a hot and loving heart, a heart so full of affection that we would contact Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One book among the sixty-six books of the Bible, the Song of Songs, illustrates how the Lord Jesus is altogether lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This book shows how the Lord is so attractive, and how we are those who love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We just love Him!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Could you love some doctrine in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I do not believe that you could even love the gifts in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do you love the gifts?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Could you say, "O dear gifts, you are altogether lovely!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Oh, the healing!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Oh, the speaking in tongues!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All the gifts are so sweet!"?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Just try to speak in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It simply does not fit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But we can say a thousand times, "Lord Jesus, You are altogether lovely!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>O Lord Jesus, You are altogether lovely!"</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Suppose you have the best furniture in your home.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The chairs, the sofas, the desks, and the bedroom furniture are all very beautiful and expensive.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But could you love them like you love a person?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Could you go to one of the chairs and tell it, "Little chair, I just love you.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You are altogether lovely"?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Could you do that?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I simply could not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I do care for all the furniture in my apartment, but I have never told it how much I love it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I simply cannot express myself in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But the more you say this to a person, the more there is the sweet love and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is because there is the affectionate attachment in a person.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Lord Jesus is not a chair; He is not a sofa; neither is He a teaching, a doctrine, a gift, or a power.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He is a loving Person.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>"My Beloved is altogether lovely!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He is my life!"</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This life is nothing else but a lovely Person.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We may talk about Christ being our life, but if we do not have the real love toward Him, He is only life to us in doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We just have the doctrine of Christ as life; we do not have the enjoyment of Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we would enjoy Jesus as life, we must love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>As long as we love Him, even if we do not know the term "life," we will enjoy life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We will not know a doctrine, but we will enjoy Jesus, a living Person, as our very life.</S>
