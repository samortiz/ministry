<p>The greatest hindrance to the genuine building up in coordination is our opinions. Every person has opinions. If a person did not have any opinions, it would be very easy for him to coordinate with others. Whether young or old, we all have opinions. Sisters have opinions, brothers have opinions, and even newly saved ones have opinions. I have never met a person who does not have an opinion. The only place where we can be delivered from our opinions is our spirit. Our spirit transcends opinions. When we bring the saints into the spirit and we are all pursuing in spirit, praying in spirit, exercising the spirit, and releasing the spirit, we will not have any opinions. The more a person exercises his spirit, the fewer opinions he will have, whereas the more a person remains in his opinions, the less he will exercise his spirit. This is a spiritual law: a person who prays little has many opinions. If a person has many opinions, he is surely lacking in prayer. The more we are in spirit, the fewer opinions we have; once we are in spirit, we are delivered from opinions.</p>
<p>The genuine building of the saints is in spirit. God&rsquo;s dwelling place is a spiritual house, a dwelling place in spirit (Eph. 2:22; 1 Pet. 2:5). Oneness is not the result of everyone having the same opinion but of everyone being in spirit. This can be seen in Paul&rsquo;s speaking concerning the oneness of the Spirit in Ephesians 4:3. Our oneness can never be based on trying to have the same opinion but on being in spirit.</p>
<p>If we only study doctrines, the result will be division. This is another law that we cannot escape. Doctrinal discussions only increase the distance between us and generate more opinions. One opinion generates another opinion, which, in turn, generates yet another opinion. The only place where we can be rescued from our opinions is our spirit. Those who pray in spirit and even pray forth their spirit do not care for doctrines or opinions. On one hand, they are very clear concerning doctrines and opinions, but on the other hand, they do not care for any doctrine or opinion, because they know that being in spirit is the key.</p>
<p>God desires that we be in spirit. When we are in spirit, there will be no problems, even if we differ in our opinions or views, because we will be one in spirit. Hence, when the Bible speaks of the oneness of the saints, the oneness in the church, it is referring to the spirit. Ephesians 2:22 says, &ldquo;In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; Our being built together is in spirit, and what we are building up is the dwelling place of God in spirit. How can we have the building if we do not bring the saints into the spirit? In order for the saints to have genuine growth and to really know themselves, including the corruption of their natural man, we must help them to turn to the spirit. In order to really experience Christ and touch His riches, they must turn to the spirit. In order to have genuine oneness and genuine building up to become God&rsquo;s dwelling place, they must turn to the spirit. Presently, however, the serving ones are very neglectful of this point. We pay attention to matters related to meetings, messages, and activities, but we neglect leading the saints to their spirit. I have a heavy burden concerning this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING STEADFASTLY</h2>
<p>I hope that all the co-workers, elders, and responsible ones in the districts will receive this burden from the Spirit. We must weep and pray concerning our lack, crying out to the Lord. We meet, but we exercise our spirit very little; we preach the gospel, but we exercise our spirit very little; we listen to messages, but we exercise our spirit very little; and we labor in activities, but we exercise our spirit very little. We have everything, but we do not pray. If all the saints would have this sense, the Spirit would surely overturn the condition of the church.</p>
<p>Concerning the prayer time in the small groups after the message meeting, we need to improve our skills in leading the saints. Nevertheless, I have an even heavier feeling that the co-workers, elders, and responsible ones in the districts are short in exercising their spirit and inadequate in their prayer. This is not a matter of just changing our methods. We need to change our concept; we need to have a change in ourselves. We have fellowshipped concerning releasing the spirit, blending in spirit, learning to be priests, and ministering in spirit; however, the co-workers, elders, and responsible ones still have not touched the burden behind these points. They are satisfied with our meetings, messages, and activities, but they are not dissatisfied with our shortage of prayer in the spirit. If they truly felt this lack, they would immediately change their focus from activities and messages to turning to the spirit.</p>
<p>This is a serious matter&mdash;we need to turn to our spirit. We need to pray to be a Christian anew. Our prayer is inadequate; our spirit is not strong, and we do not release our spirit. If we do not take heed to the matter of bringing the saints into the spirit, we will lead them astray. If we are not willing to turn to the spirit to pray, we cannot bring others to their spirit to pray. If we do not open our mouth and exercise our spirit in the meeting, we cannot expect the saints to open their mouth and exercise their spirit when they come to the meeting. If the co-workers, elders, and responsible ones in the districts do not change their concept, we will only address the symptoms of our root problem, even if we change our methods.</p>
<p>In the past, the elders, co-workers, and responsible ones have labored much. However, there are thousands of saints in the church in Taipei who function only a little and whose spirits are not strong, in spite of the fact that they come to meeting after meeting, hear message after message, and labor in activity after activity. This situation grieves me very much. We cannot allow this situation to continue. We must turn to the Lord and begin to learn that the only thing that matters is prayer in spirit. Acts 1:14 speaks of the apostles and the saints continuing &ldquo;steadfastly with one accord in prayer.&rdquo; Later, the three thousand, who were baptized following Peter&rsquo;s message with the eleven, continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers (2:42). The work of the apostles came from their prayer, and the result of their work was to lead people into prayer.</p>
<p>If we look at our work, however, thousands have been saved, but only a few hundred pray in the meetings. This is because our work did not come from prayer, and we have not led people into prayer. It is pitiful that many saints, who obey the word, fellowship with one another, and break bread, are lacking in prayer and in the exercise of the spirit. Is the prayer in our districts dead or fervent, feeble or prevailing? Is the spirit strong or weak, living or half dead? We need to have a clear understanding and realization that merely having meetings, giving messages, and doing activities is inadequate if we are short in prayer and in the exercise of our spirit. We must wake up; we need to begin with prayer and work to bring people into prayer. We must continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word (6:4).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 64</div><br></body></html>
