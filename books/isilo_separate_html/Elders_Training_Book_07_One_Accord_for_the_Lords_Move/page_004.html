<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery in mainland China started in 1922. I was with Brother Nee until I left for Taiwan in 1949. Throughout those twenty-seven years Brother Nee was always under a suffering due to the fact that there were saints, co-workers, and elders receiving his ministry, yet it was hard to see that they were one. There were different opinions among the ones who received his ministry&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, this is the way, but....&rdquo; The people who received the recovery, who received Brother Nee&rsquo;s teaching, would carry out what he taught in their own way. Everyone had his own way to carry out the same kind of teaching. It is ridiculous to think that this kind of practice could be successful. If a car has five occupants and everyone of them is the driver, how could the car go? Many times, the ones who are not driving the car are full of opinions; they are &ldquo;back seat drivers.&rdquo; When you take a ride and you are not the driver it is best not to voice your opinion. Let the one who is driving be free to drive according to his judgment.</p>
<p>From 1922 to 1942 in mainland China there was &ldquo;the one car&rdquo; of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, yet there were different drivers. When I came into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in 1932, I saw how Brother Nee suffered because of this, but up to 1942 and 1943 by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy a great revival was taking place in Chefoo through the one accord among the serving ones there. After the war, I had the opportunity to come together with Brother Nee in Shanghai, and I related to him all that happened during the years I was in Chefoo. He confirmed all that we practiced, and encouraged me to carry on the same thing. We must realize that to carry out the same thing we need the one accord. From the fall of 1946 to the spring of 1949, for two and a half years, the whole situation in Shanghai was under my driving. Then the impact was seen again to some extent. To some extent there was one car with one driver. The Lord was going on in those two and a half years and there was a revival which brought Brother Nee back to the ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR EXPERIENCE IN TAIWAN</h2>
<p>I was then sent to Taiwan in 1949 and when I started the work there, I dropped every point which I had seen and learned that was not practical. In the first six years we had a hundredfold increase, from about four hundred to more than forty thousand. The impact was there. Even today all the churches in Taiwan still live on that foundation. They are still standing on the riches brought into the church life throughout those six years. Soon after this six-year period, the brothers were influenced to invite Brother T. Austin-Sparks from England to render us more spirituality, and his coming brought in a big factor of dissension. We invited him the first time in 1955 and again in 1957. From 1955 until recently in Taiwan the impact had never come back.</p>
<p>When I was going back to Taiwan in October of 1984, I realized how the one accord, the morale, was lost in Taiwan and how the morale was also lost to some extent in the United States. I made the decision to go back to Taiwan since that was the place where the Lord&rsquo;s recovery started abroad. I had to go there to have a new start. This new start is absolutely different. The brothers from the United States who joined the gospel preaching there can testify that it is one hundred percent different from our present way to preach the gospel, and it works. Recently sixteen gospel teams were sent out from the church in Taipei to nearby villages. Within only twenty-one days one thousand nine hundred and seventy-five people were baptized. They did not use any gimmicks. They used prayer, the Spirit, and the Word, and they had the one accord. They had one mind and one will with one purpose in one heart and in one soul. No doubt, they had the morale.</p>
<p>One policeman came to maintain order when he saw a crowd gathering. Within a short time he was baptized and sat there to listen to the first lesson of the new life series. One particular person was saved on the street with no place to baptize him. The saints knocked on the door of a nearby house, thinking that this might be a house of somebody who would listen to the gospel. They asked the person who answered if they could borrow their bathroom. This person gave them permission and while the people in the house were eating lunch, the saints went to their bathroom to baptize this newly saved one. The family asked the saints what they were doing and the saints preached the gospel to them. Then the whole family was baptized. A number of these sixteen villages are now ready to have a church. The halls in Taipei are going to spread the church life to these nearby places.</p>
<p>When I went back to Taipei in 1984, fifty-two brothers were established to be elders and twenty-eight more were added later. There are also now over one hundred and thirty new full-timers in Taipei and most of them are college graduates. The church in Taipei is prepared to receive another two hundred fifty full-timers by June of 1986.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
