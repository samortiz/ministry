   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE HOUSE OF THE LIVING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 15 continues, "But if I delay, that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The words "know how one ought to conduct himself" indicate that in this book Paul gives instructions concerning how to take care of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to Paul's word in verse 15, the church is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek word rendered house may also be translated household.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The same word is used in 3:4, 5, and 12.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The household, the family, of God is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The house and the household are one thing the assembly of the believers Eph 2:19; Heb 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reality of this house as the dwelling place of the living God is in our spirit Eph 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must live and act in our spirit so that God can be manifested in this house as the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As God's dwelling place, the church is both God's house and His household, His family.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Old Testament, the temple and God's people, His family, were two separate things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But in the fulfillment in the New Testament, the dwelling place and the family are one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The family is God's dwelling place, and God's dwelling place is His family.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we have indicated, the Greek word for house may be translated either as house or household.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to God's New Testament economy, God's family is His house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These are not two separate things; they are actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are God's family and also His temple, His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In speaking of the church as the house of God, Paul specifically refers to God as the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The living God who lives in the church must be subjective to the church rather than merely objective.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>An idol in a heathen temple is lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The God who not only lives but also acts, moves, and works in His living temple, the church, is living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because He is living, the church is also living in Him, by Him, and with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A living God and a living church live, move, and work together.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The living church is the house and the household of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, it becomes the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE PILLAR AND BASE OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Speaking metaphorically, Paul goes on to say that the church is "the pillar and base of the truth."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The pillar supports the building, and the base holds the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church is such a supporting pillar and holding base of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The truth here refers to the real things which are revealed in the New Testament concerning Christ and the church according to God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church is the supporting pillar and holding base of all these realities.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A local church should be such a building that holds, bears, and testifies the truth, the reality, of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church as the house of the living God is both the pillar which bears the truth and the base which upholds the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we have pointed out, the truth is the reality and the contents of God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This economy is composed of two mysteries: Christ as the mystery of God Col 2:2 and the church as the mystery of Christ Eph 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ and the church, the Head and the Body, are the contents of the reality of God's New Testament economy.</S>
