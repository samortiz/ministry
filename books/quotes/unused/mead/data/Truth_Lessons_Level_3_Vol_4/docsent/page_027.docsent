   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this lesson we will cover more aspects regarding the believers corporate experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity through their living in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I. Loving the Brothers and</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Loving One Another in the Church</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We live in the church, loving all the brothers and loving one another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 12:9-21 speaks of living a life according to the highest virtues of the divine life and love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the beginning of verse 9 Paul says, Let love be without hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then in the beginning of verse 10 he continues, Love one another warmly in brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This matches what Peter says in 1 Peter 1:22: Love one another from a pure heart fervently.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In John 13:34-35 the Lord Jesus said, A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By this shall all men know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This commandment is the message that John speaks of in 1 John 3:11: This is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not love others in a natural, religious, and moral way by trying to imitate God s love.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In our human nature we have a tendency to love people; however, this kind of love is moral, natural, and even cultural.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In contrast, real love is the result of enjoying the processed Triune God in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we are in the fellowship of the divine life, that is, in the enjoyment of the Triune God, this enjoyment has a result, or an issue, which is the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By means of this love, we spontaneously love others, especially those organically related to our Father who has begotten us 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have been begotten of the Father, and many other persons have also been begotten of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The result of our enjoying Him is that we love all His children.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, loving the brothers is an issue of enjoying the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We do not need to imitate the Lord s love; rather, we need to be constituted with the Triune God, who is love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This One dwells within us and desires to dispense Himself into our being, to saturate us with Himself so that we may enjoy Him inwardly as love.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This love needs to saturate us until it becomes the love with which we love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The revelation concerning love in the New Testament is different from our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Love is the God of love dwelling in us and us dwelling in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First John 3:24 says, In this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Spirit keeps us in an organic union with the Triune God, who is love, and causes God to be our life and even our person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not only so, the Spirit is saturating us with the element of God, who is love.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ultimately, we will be constituted with the essence of God s love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is to say that the divine love will become us, and as a result, we spontaneously love others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, we do not love them according to our own love; rather, we love them with God as our love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is a great difference between this kind of love and the love that people have through trying to imitate the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the New Testament, all mutual love among the believers is triangular; it includes love from three sides.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are children born of God, and as such, we surely love our Father, the One who has begotten us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since we love the Father who has begotten us, we also love those begotten of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Consequently, we experience a triangular love, involving God, us, and all those begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This triangular love is realized in our organic union with the Triune God, who is love.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The reason we as believers are able to love God and one another is that we have experienced a divine birth John 1:12; 1 John 5:1; 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:4, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have been born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because of our divine birth, we are able to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This triangular love is related to the divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We not only love the Father who has begotten us; we also love those begotten of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the love with which the believers love one another in the church life.</S>
