[1]  CONTENTS Christ The Portion of the Saints The Reality of Being in Spirit Six Major Items of Enjoyment in the Spirit The Renewing of the Inner Man
[2]  CHAPTER ONE CHRIST THE PORTION OF THE SAINTS Scripture Reading: Col 1:12, 15, 19; 2:2, 3, 6; 1:27-28; 3:3-4, 11; 1 Cor 1:30; 6:17; 15:45 THE PRACTICAL ENJOYMENT OF THE LORD BEING VITAL TO THE CHRISTIAN LIFE
[3]  In this book we want to consider one thing: how to enjoy the Lord.
[4]  There is nothing as vital or as basic to our Christian life and to the church life as the real, practical enjoyment of Christ.
[5]  This enjoyment is not Christ in doctrine or in knowledge, but Christ in life, in the Spirit, and in reality.
[6]  WALKING IN HIM THE KEY TO EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS THE PORTION OF THE SAINTS
[7]  Colossians 2:6-7 says, "As therefore you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him."
[8]  CHAPTER TWO THE REALITY OF BEING IN SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 5:10; 8:1-2, 9-10; 10:6-8; 1 Cor 6:17 RECONCILED THROUGH THE DEATH OF CHRIST AND SAVED IN HIS LIFE
[9]  Romans 5:10 says, "For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life."
[10]  In addition, Romans 8:9-10 reveals three divine titles: the Spirit of God v. 9 , the Spirit of Christ v. 9 , and Christ Himself v. 10 . This simply means that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself.
[11]  THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST BEING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT
[12]  We must realize that Christ is not so simple.
[13]  TO WALK IN CHRIST BEING TO WALK ACCORDING TO SPIRIT
[14]  According to Romans 8, to be in Christ is to walk according to spirit v. 4 . To walk according to spirit means to have no condemnation in Christ Jesus v. 1 . Although many brothers say that they are in Christ, they also testify that they have a lot of condemnation within.
[15]  To say that there is no condemnation in Christ Jesus v. 1 is equal to walking according to spirit v. 4 . When we are walking in spirit in reality, it is at that moment that we experience no condemnation.
[16]  CHAPTER THREE SIX MAJOR ITEMS OF ENJOYMENT IN THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4; 6:35; 4:14; 7:37; 20:22; 15:4-5; 8:12; 10:10; 3:6; 4:24; 6:57, 63; 14:16-17, 19-20 CHRIST BEING OUR LIFE, FOOD, WATER, BREATH, LIGHT, AND ABODE
[17]  In the Gospel of John, there are six major items of the enjoyment of Christ in the spirit.
[18]  THE LINE OF THE SPIRIT IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN
[19]  The line of the spirit begins in John 3:6 where the Lord says, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."
[20]  This means that if we are to deal with God, contact God, enjoy God, and partake of God, we must contact Him in our spirit, exercising our spirit.
[21]  TURNING TO THE SPIRIT TO BREATHE CHRIST AS THE FRESH AIR
[22]  TURNING TO THE SPIRIT TO BE NOURISHED BY THE LORD AS FOOD
[23]  The fourth item of the enjoyment of Christ is the matter of food.
[24]  CHAPTER FOUR THE RENEWING OF THE INNER MAN Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:6, 17-18; 4:7-8, 14-16; 12:9 THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST AS OUR PORTION IN SECOND CORINTHIANS
[25]  Christ has been made such a portion to us as the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 that we may contact Him through and by our spirit.
[26]  The apostle Paul in the book of 2 Corinthians builds upon the foundation laid in the book of 1 Corinthians by pointing out the contrast between the soul and the spirit.
[27]  There is only one thing that will help you to realize that Christ is within you as your life and that you must learn to live by Him, not by yourself.
