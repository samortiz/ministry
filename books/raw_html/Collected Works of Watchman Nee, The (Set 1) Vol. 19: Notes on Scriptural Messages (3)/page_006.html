<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE FOUR MINISTERS<br>IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 46</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Acts 9:20-28; Matt. 4:18-22; Eph. 1:22-23; 2:22; 1 Pet. 2:3-5; 1 John 2:12-13; John 21:18, 21; Acts 28:23; 2 Tim. 1:15; 2 Pet. 2:1; 1 John 4:1; 2 John 7</H1><P>This morning I want to talk about four different ministers in the New Testament. The word minister, according to the Greek, refers not only to the deacons but also to the serving ones. All who work for God and the gospel are ministers. So when we say four ministers, we mean four different workers. In the passages that we have just read, there are four different subjects, which are the four main subjects of the New Testament. The ones who preached these four subjects are the four ministers.</P><P>There is a special thing in the New Testament: there were three disciples from among the twelve, who were with the Lord all the time. What are the names of these three disciples? I think all of you know their names; they are James, Peter, and John. They were with the Lord on the mount of transfiguration; they went with the Lord to the house of Jairus; and at the end, they were with the Lord in the garden of Gethsemane. Why did the Lord choose only these three from among the twelve disciples? Why did the Lord put them in a more noticeable position? The main reason was that God wanted to establish His works in the New Testament along three different lines. But was it enough to have only three lines? No, it was still not enough! In Acts the Lord brought in another minister besides these three. Who was this man? Was it Matthias? No, even though Matthias was chosen as an apostle by casting lots, he was not the minister. Who was chosen? Our beloved brother Paul was chosen. He was one specially chosen by the Lord. Although many people worked for the Lord in the New Testament, only these four occupy a unique position. There were none besides these four. According to the Bible, the order of these four is as follows: (1) James, (2) Peter, (3) Paul, and (4) John. This is the proper order of the Bible and is recognized by all believers. Today we cannot exhaust the deeper significance of these four lines, but we can consider a little about them. We cannot see everything thoroughly and clearly; but as long as we see a little, some help will be rendered in our walk on earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JAMES</H2><P>James is the most unnoticed one among the four. He never wrote an epistle. The book of James in the Bible was not written by him, but by the Lord's brother. Peter and John were both zealous men. We can see many accounts of their work, but James did not do anything special. He was a very hidden person. How could he be listed among these four? Why did the Lord choose him as one of the four to represent one special line? James did not manifest the gifts of preaching, healing, and works of wonders, etc. Although these gifts are good, James' outstanding trait was not in any of these things. What do we see in him? He did one thing that was great and extraordinary; he was the first martyr among the apostles! The most extraordinary and crucial line among these four is the line of suffering. No matter how different were the works of Peter, Paul, and John, there was one line common to them all, the line of suffering and rejection. Suffering is something that is basic to every Christian.</P><P>Today many people like to read Paul's excellent Epistles; they like to hear about Peter's zealous works and John's wonderful visions. Yet they toss James aside and subconsciously forget about him. They do not realize that every work should be based on James. Peter won three thousand people to the Lord in one day, and Paul established churches everywhere. Yet without James's suffering, the Lord could not be satisfied. When the Lord came to this world, He took the standing of one who was rejected. If we do not suffer with Him, we cannot satisfy His heart no matter what wonderful things we do.</P><P>Why did the Lord make James so hidden? He only wanted to highlight one special point of James. Suppose we have many chairs, several lamps, and numerous desks here. We are accustomed to seeing them and do not feel anything special about them. But if the items are moved away one day and the place is cleaned so that only one small desk remains, every brother would immediately notice the small desk. If a crowd is here, you would not notice anything, but once all the people are gone and only one person is left, he will draw considerable attention. This is what the Lord did. He hid every gift of James and only highlighted his suffering. In the Bible Peter said to arm ourselves with a mind to suffer (1 Pet. 4:1). Only suffering overcomes everything and accomplishes God's eternal purpose. Brothers, let me say an honest word. Those who do not want to suffer with the Lord can never expect to be exalted with Him. Only those who suffer are worthy of being exalted. If you want to be highly exalted, you have to follow James's footsteps.</P><P>There is more truth concerning James which can render us much help. However, because of time, I cannot go further. Now let us take a look at Peter.</P>
