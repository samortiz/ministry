   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Then we need to read Revelation 17:4-5: "And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication; and upon her forehead a name was written, Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of the Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This woman held a golden cup, but within it were abominations and the filthiness of her fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What a leaven this is!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And this leaven is hidden in a golden cup.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Outwardly, it appears to have something of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We know that gold always signifies God's divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Outwardly there is the appearance of God, but inwardly there is much leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Great Babylon is herself a prostitute and the mother of many smaller prostitutes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No doubt the woman in Matthew 13 is the woman in Revelation 2 and 17.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Matthew 13 says clearly that the woman took the leaven and hid it in the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Fine flour signifies the Lord Jesus as our food.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Fine flour was used in making the meal offerings which typify Christ's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The meal offering was food for both God and the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The meal is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is the fine flour for God's satisfaction and for our satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the Roman Catholic Church as that evil woman took leaven and put it into the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, the Roman Catholic Church took many evil things and added them into the truth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, the birth of Christ is the truth, but the Roman Catholic Church picked up the matter of Christmas and added it to the birth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must differentiate between the birth of Christ and Christmas.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The birth of Christ is the fine flour, and Christmas is the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Matthew 1 there is the birth of Christ as the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christmas was added as a kind of leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Roman Catholic Church has repeatedly picked up something evil, pagan, dirty, satanic, and demonic to put into the truth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It holds a golden cup that in outward appearance seems right, but many abominations and fornications are hiding within.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The great Babylon is gilded with gold, precious stone, and pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Its appearance is somewhat like the holy city, New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, the holy city is not gilded with these things; it is actually built with these precious materials.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that the gold, precious stone, and pearls are not the substance and inward reality of the great Babylon, but merely an outward covering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The New Jerusalem, the holy city, is built with these materials as its substance and inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Both within and without there is the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But with the great Babylon there is only the appearance of gold covering the inward impurity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Matthew there is the seed of the leaven, in the Epistles there is the growth, and eventually in Revelation there is the harvest of the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The harvest of the reality of the kingdom is a city which is pure gold throughout.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The harvest of the appearance of the kingdom is also a city, but it is only gilded with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that the great Babylon is a counterfeit, false city.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must be absolute for the reality of the kingdom and have nothing to do with the appearance of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Which city are you in?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am afraid that you may still hold on to some leaven of the great Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Please spend time to be impressed with all the different kinds of leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Praise the Lord that we have seen something concerning the kingdom!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After reading all these chapters, can you say that you have never seen anything concerning the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Can you say that the chapters in Matthew are still a mystery to you?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have seen the reality of the kingdom, the appearance of the kingdom, and the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Praise the Lord for the reality and for the manifestation of the kingdom!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But be alert and be careful concerning the appearance of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are not for the leaven, but for the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are not for Babylon; we are for Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the pure Word of the Lord, and it is so clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The reality of the kingdom issues in the New Jerusalem, and the appearance of the kingdom issues in the great Babylon, the consummation of falsehood.</S>
