<h1 class="title">AS THE LORD&rsquo;S, LIVING TO HIM</h1>

<p class="hbody">No mortal tongue can e&rsquo;er describe<br />
 The freedom of the soul,<br />
When passed beyond all earthly bribe<br />
 To God&rsquo;s complete control.<br />
All things are his, yes, life, and death,<br />
 Things present or to come;<br />
In Christ he draws in peace each breath,<br />
 In Christ he finds his home.</p>
<p class="hbody">When such as we the King can choose,<br />
 To share with Him His throne,<br />
&rsquo;Tis passing strange that we refuse<br />
 To be our Lord&rsquo;s alone.<br />
O never speak of sacrifice!<br />
 A privilege untold<br />
Is to be His at any price,<br />
 In Calv&rsquo;ry&rsquo;s hosts enrolled.</p>
<p class="hbody">Arise! the holy bargain strike&mdash;<br />
 The fragment for the whole&mdash;<br />
All men and all events alike<br />
 Must serve the ransomed soul.<br />
All things are yours when you are His,<br />
 And He and you are one;<br />
A boundless life in Him there is,<br />
 Whence doubt and fear are gone.</p>
<p>Hymn 473 in our hymnal is wonderful. When I went back to Taiwan in October of 1984, this hymn was so sweet. We could not stop the singing of this hymn, and it stirred up many hearts. I like every line except for the last one, so we can replace &ldquo;Whence doubt and fear are gone&rdquo; with &ldquo;And kingdom yet to come.&rdquo; Verse 3 refers to the holy bargain, the fragment for the whole. When we sacrifice a fragment to the Lord, we gain the whole earth! When we serve Him, everyone and everything serve us&mdash;&ldquo;All men and all events alike must serve the ransomed soul&rdquo; (verse 3). We all need to speak and sing this hymn again and again.</p>
<p>The verses in the Scripture reading can be considered as a cluster of the divine Word, a cluster of grapes, so precious and so sweet. First Corinthians 3:20b-23 indicates that Christ is ours. Since Christ is ours, all things are ours. Even death is ours. Death serves a purpose for us, so death works for us. Verse 23 concludes with the fact that we are Christ&rsquo;s. He is ours and we are His. He belongs to us and we belong to Him (S. S. 2:16). This is marvelous! First Corinthians 7 tells us that we all have been bought by Him to be His slaves. We are His slaves bought by Him with a price, so He is our Master, our Owner. He is our Lord, and we are His slaves.</p>
<p>Romans 14 tells us that &ldquo;we live to the Lord&rdquo; (v. 8). To live for Him is somewhat easy to understand. To live with Him, in Him, by Him, and even to live Him are still not too hard to understand. But to live <em>to</em> Him probably is a matter that we have never considered and do not understand. What is it to live to Him? This is the main point of this chapter.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 08: The Life-Pulse of the Lord's Present Move &nbsp; pg 31</div><br></body></html>
