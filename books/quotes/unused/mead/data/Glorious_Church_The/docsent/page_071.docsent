   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verses 19 and 20 say, "The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What do precious stones imply?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is a basic difference between precious stones and gold.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Gold is a chemical element, while a precious stone is not a chemical element, but a compound.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Gold is an element because God created it as gold; it was made directly by God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But a precious stone has been formed from various kinds of elements, which have been composed together through chemical combination through countless years of heat and pressure in the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, the precious stones do not signify something given directly by God, but something which the Holy Spirit has produced in man by much effort and many years of burning.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The work of the Holy Spirit on earth is to continually put us into trials so that we may have all kinds of experiences and become precious stones before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The precious stones, therefore, are the product of our being disciplined by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us illustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Isaac's birth represents gold, but Jacob's experience represents precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Isaac was born a son through the promise of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He never suffered, nor was he ever seriously at fault.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jacob's case, however, was quite different.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He suffered very much and passed through many trials.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's hand was upon him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Day after day and year after year, God wrought something into Jacob which caused him to become a precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That life which God has imparted to us is the gold, while the life which God is constituting in us is the precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Day after day, in all kinds of circumstances, He is making us in the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God does not stop by just giving us a portion of Christ's life; He wants to have the life of Christ wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On one hand, we must realize that except for the Lord's life in us we are not any different than we were prior to our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But on the other hand, after following the Lord for five or ten years and being disciplined and dealt with by Him, a portion of the life of Christ has been constituted in us by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is something within us which has been formed by the Lord, and this is the precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You should not be surprised when God continually puts you into the fire to burn.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It seems that the things which other people encounter are all good, but the things which you are up against are not prosperous or easy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You are even misunderstood and attacked by others; more things have happened to you than to anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But you must realize that it is not without a cause.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is continually burning you; the Holy Spirit is working to constitute more of the life of Christ in you so that you may be transformed into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Revelation we find not just one kind of precious stone, but all kinds of precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some are jasper, some sapphire, some chalcedony, some emerald, some sardonyx, some sardius, and other kinds.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All of these precious stones are the product of burning.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They were not formed by God in a moment of time but obtained after being wrought upon through long years of God's working.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Precious stone was not given to us at creation, nor is it something we obtained when we became a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Precious stone is formed in us through God's burning day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is a substance which is constantly put into the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the fire burns in a certain way, a certain kind of mineral is melted into that substance, and it becomes a certain kind of precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the fire burns in another way, it causes another kind of mineral to be dissolved into that substance, causing it to become another kind of precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Different ways of melting certain minerals together form various kinds of precious stones.</S>
