<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of fellowship given by Brother Witness Lee in co-workers&rsquo; meetings in Taipei in 1958. Chapters 1 through 6 were given in March. Chapters 7 through 13 were given in October and November and are Brother Lee&rsquo;s fellowship after his visit to Europe and America.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S NEED IN THE PRESENT AGE</h1>
<p>In the first six messages our fellowship will mainly be to gain spiritual understanding. The purpose of this fellowship is not to discuss certain matters or to set up a training but rather to provide an opportunity for us to come together and fellowship concerning the work and the service. I am also burdened to fellowship concerning the building up of the church, our spiritual pursuit, and the supply through the ministry of the word.</p>
<p>According to my disposition, I am inclined to labor for a long time in only one place. In relation to our disposition, regardless of how much we experience salvation, God does not intend to annul our disposition. This is the reason that Paul&rsquo;s Epistles have Paul&rsquo;s flavor and that John&rsquo;s Epistles have John&rsquo;s flavor. The writing of the apostles was out of the Holy Spirit, but it has their flavor. Even though we usually associate disposition with naturalness, the Lord does not intend to annul the disposition of the people who are in His hand. The Lord desires that man be mingled with Him and yet maintain the distinctiveness of man.</p>
<p>After I graduated from school, I worked in one company. Many of my schoolmates and friends encouraged me to look for a better job, but I did not want to change where I worked. I worked in the same company for six to seven years before I began to serve full time. I worked in only one place until I served the Lord full time. Likewise, wherever I served, I labored diligently; I did not move from place to place.</p>
<p>I was in northern China for a long time, but I labored only in one place&mdash;the church in Chefoo. The more I labored, the more work I saw that needed to be done. Then one day the Lord raised up circumstances that sent me to southern China. I then labored for a long time in the Shanghai and Nanking areas. Again, if not for the circumstances, it is possible that I would still be in Shanghai. The more I labored, the more I felt the need to labor, because there was much to be done. But God raised up circumstances that did not allow me to continue to labor there.</p>
<p>Under the Lord&rsquo;s arrangement, I had to travel back and forth between two or three different places. Even though I traveled from one place to another, the Lord rarely led me personally. Most of the time the Lord raised up circumstances that forced me to move, or the senior co-workers charged me to move. Hence, I always felt dissatisfied because I expected to stay in one place for a long time and concentrate my energy and strength to labor and build up a local church as a strong model.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE POVERTY AND WEAKNESS OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING THE RESULT OF A SHORTAGE<br />
IN THE SUPPLY AND THE LEADING<br />
OF THE MINISTRY</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s arrangement in various circumstances over the years compelled me to travel often. I once fellowshipped with the responsible brothers that I hoped to remain in Taipei, and not travel for a long period, in order to build up a model, because the condition of our district meetings is not what it should be. This is mainly because of a shortage in the supply and the leading in the ministry of the word. It seems as if the church is a shell, and there is a shortage in content. Even though there are more than twenty district meetings, the content of these meetings needs to be enriched and strengthened. In a certain sense, they are more impoverished than before. Therefore, there is the need for a supply from the ministry.</p>
<p>In the past the elders in the church in Taipei were willing to receive my help. However, after they received the help, the result they worked out was different than what I envisioned. To illustrate, the brothers and sisters in Southeast Asia have a good recipe for breakfast pastries. But when we follow this recipe, the breakfast pastries that we make are raw and unattractive. This shows that it is one thing to have instructions, and it is another thing to have the skill to follow the instructions. For example, after hearing messages concerning the enjoyment of God, the brothers tried to lead the saints. Yet somehow their practice turned out to be different from what it was supposed to be. This is similar to the Chinese saying, &ldquo;He painted a tiger, but it turned out as a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The church in Taipei is a large church with about two thousand saints in the meetings. The greatest shortage is that the elders&rsquo; administration of the church is poor and weak. The saints lack color and energy, but this is not because the brothers have made mistakes. It seems as if the saints have not eaten for days, or they do not receive adequate nutrition from their food. Undoubtedly, the saints are weak because they lack a supply from the ministry.</p>
<p>The elders, the responsible ones in the district meetings, and the full-time serving ones have tried their best, but there is still a lack. This is the reason that I want to stay in Taipei for an extended period. I would rather sacrifice the work in other places in order to remain here and work together with the elders. I do not want to merely give them instructions. I want to work together with them and guide them.</p>
<p>A church as large as the church in Taipei has many needs, but the brothers and sisters who serve in Taipei do not have the skills to meet these needs. It seems as if we are building a house without the proper skills. We have labored in Taipei for many years, but the result of our work is poor and weak. Even though we may not be blamed for the shortage of our work, we cannot deny that it is poor and weak.</p>
<p>I have considered this problem before the Lord from many angles. On the one hand, because I could not be here continually, there has been a lack but not a loss. On the other hand, my frequent travels overseas have deepened and broadened my spiritual insight. If I had not traveled all these years, my spiritual insight would not be as sharp as it is now. A person who stays in one place for a long time can see only a partial picture. If I had stayed in one place, my understanding would not be as deep as it is now. On the one hand, my absence was a lack, but on the other hand, my traveling has enabled me to have a broader view and a deeper and higher realization. I feel that this gain is worthwhile. Therefore, I want to fellowship my observations with you. You may not feel the same as I do, because we are looking at things from different angles. Nevertheless, I want to fellowship my impressions.</p>
<p>I am about to visit nearly every major city on every continent except Australia. A number of these cities do not have a church that we know of; nevertheless, I would like to visit these cities. Most of the cities have local churches.</p><h2 class="head1">THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN LONDON</h2>
<p>The visit by T. Austin-Sparks at the end of 1955 was a notable event among us. Before his visit we did not have official fellowship or contact with any Christian group in the West. Brother Nee visited the West, but almost no Christians from the West visited us. Brother Sparks&rsquo;s visit and his fellowship gave us many impressions that caused us to pay attention to the direction and the work of the Lord in the present age.</p>
<p>In July and August of last year, Brother Sparks called an international conference in London and insisted that I attend. My absence disappointed him. The conference began in London, then it went to Denmark, and finally to Scotland. Only twenty-five to twenty-nine people attended the meeting in Scotland, which was a meeting of workers from various places. It was not a gathering of all the saints. America, Europe, India, and other places in the world that know something of the way that the Lord is taking were represented in the international conference. But there was no one from the Chinese-speaking areas of Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. This disappointed Brother Sparks because he wanted some believers from these areas to attend the conference.</p>
<p>A brother with whom I labored previously sent me a substantial amount of information concerning the conference. Brother Sparks also sent me a detailed letter about their meetings and about his feeling concerning the meetings. In addition, I also received a letter from a Western sister who is a co-worker. Hence, I know what took place in the conference from these three sources.</p>
<p>Brother Sparks led the attendants to see and to study the way that the Lord is taking in this age. He said that the churches and even the work in every place should be the same and that we should have the same vision and know the way that the Lord is taking in this age and the work that He is doing. He also said that if we see the way that the Lord is taking and the work that He is doing, the churches and the work will be the same. In his letter to me, Brother Sparks did not write about the result of the meetings, but he clearly said that very few among the brothers have a large capacity. The brother who labored with me in the past wrote that Brother Sparks spoke of Taiwan numerous times during the conference. Brother Sparks hoped that the workers from some places, particularly from India, would pay more attention to the work in Taiwan.</p>
<p>The Western sister described the meeting that took place in Scotland. Her letter indicated that the attendants felt that the work at Honor Oak needs to be balanced. Her words were rather strong. She said that Honor Oak &ldquo;only gives and does not receive&rdquo;; that is, they only give to others; they do not receive from others. If they do not receive, they are not balanced. We should not have the thought that the goal of my travel is to balance others. This is not my intention. I am merely fellowshipping concerning the spiritual condition of different places.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN GROUPS IN THE WEST</h2>
<p>The majority of Christian groups in the West, except for Catholicism, are fundamental. Two Christian groups are quite influential. One group is represented by the Keswick Convention, which is renowned among Christians in the West. This convention may be the largest gathering of Christians from all over the world. Besides the Brethren and us, who take the way that the Lord is taking, zealous Christians and Christian workers from all over the world, including Africa and Australia, are desirous to attend the convention. Any preacher who becomes a speaker at the Keswick Convention is considered to be very good, because this opportunity is not given to many. This shows how influential the Keswick Convention is among Christians in the West.</p>
<p>The other influential group is the evangelicals. The Christians in this group are concerned with the spread of the gospel. They are content to labor together for the spread of the gospel, but they do not stress the truth. The evangelicals can be subdivided into three groups, the largest group being the missions. The most influential mission has been China Inland Mission, which focuses on preaching the gospel in foreign countries. After the political situation changed in China, however, China Inland Mission ceased its work in China and is no longer as influential. It is a top mission that was highly esteemed in the hearts of Christians during the past fifty to sixty years. Another mission is the Oriental Missionary Society founded by Charles E. Cowman, whose wife wrote <em>Streams in the Desert.</em> Other mission groups are the Christian and Missionary Alliance, which was founded by Dr. A. B. Simpson, and the Baptist denomination. These are very good missions that send missionaries to preach the gospel overseas. They are admired and respected by Christians in the West.</p>
<p>Another evangelical group focuses on domestic gospel campaigns. The believers in this group do not belong to any mission; instead, they act individually. There are at least ten evangelical revivalists in America, and the most famous is Billy Graham. These brothers are mainly concerned with preaching the gospel domestically. Once in a while they may travel abroad, but their primary work is within their country. They feel that they should not evangelize foreign countries when their own country is a land of Gentiles. They feel that since the number of believers in their country is decreasing and the number of unbelievers is increasing, they should preach the gospel to their countrymen instead of in a foreign country. Hence, they promote gospel campaigns in their country.</p>
<p>Just like the mission groups that go abroad, these brothers do not care about anything else. They make a concerted effort to preach the gospel. Wherever they go, they require all the Christians, regardless of their denomination or sect, to cooperate, work, and pray together. Before they go to an area, they send a team to prepare the atmosphere by advertising their gospel event on billboards and in newspapers. When the atmosphere is ready, they arrive with a support group and hold a large gospel meeting. They do not emphasize the truth, the ground of the church, or the way of the church, nor do they discern these matters. They only make a united effort to preach the gospel. This group is prevalent in America.</p>
<p>A third evangelical group uses healing to preach the gospel. However, in most cases this is not divine healing. Most of the people whom this group claims to heal are not really healed. When I was in Manila, I attended this type of meeting because many brothers and sisters went there to be healed. Divine healing must not be based on feeling. It must be based on medical facts. A person who is sick with a fever may claim to be healed because he feels better after a preacher lays his hands on him. Feelings, however, are not sufficient evidence of healing.</p>
<p>A brother in Manila had a Christian neighbor who had a stomach disease and therefore went to a &ldquo;divine healer.&rdquo; After the healer laid his hand on the neighbor, he felt better and stood up to testify that he was healed. When he went home, however, the pain in his stomach returned. Some among us may have gone to be healed by these preachers, but they were momentarily healed psychologically rather than physically. In conclusion, the evangelistic groups send missionaries to foreign countries, unite to preach the gospel to their countrymen, and preach the gospel through &ldquo;divine&rdquo; healing.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ATTITUDE OF CHRISTIANITY TOWARD HONOR OAK</h2>
<p>The two major Christian groups in the West are the Keswick Convention and the evangelicals. But these two groups are actually interconnected. One of the past chairmen of the Keswick Convention was also the president of the China Inland Mission. These two groups lead Christians in the West. In the recent two to three years these believers have strongly opposed Brother Sparks&rsquo;s fellowship in Honor Oak. They even printed their opposition.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong I read a book which said that Brother Sparks says that the believers need to know the Body and that a believer who does not know the Body has not entered into the Body. The book refuted this statement and asked whether a person could be saved without entering into the Body. The influence of these statements in Christianity is serious. The book concluded that the teaching from Honor Oak is heresy, because a person who is saved has the life of Christ and is therefore a member of Christ. It also asks whether anyone can say that a saved person has not entered into the church or the Body, and concludes that anyone who teaches this teaches heresy. Christianity in the West has reached the point of absolute hostility toward Brother Sparks and Honor Oak, regardless of how congenial Brother Sparks is in his attitude and how cautious he is in his speaking and his work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ATTITUDE OF CHRISTIANITY TOWARD US</h2>
<p>The brothers in the Far East have not taken the time to know the situation in Christianity. They know only how to work, lead meetings, give messages, and visit people. They do not care about other things. Christianity, nevertheless, is determined to oppose us. Their opposition toward us is more severe than their opposition toward Honor Oak. The believers who take the lead to oppose us are the missionaries from China Inland Mission. They do not express anything, but inwardly they oppose us.</p>
<p>The Western missionaries from China Inland Mission oppose us when they come to the Far East. After they lost the field in China, they began to work in the Chinese communities on the islands near mainland China&mdash;from Japan to Southeast Asia. These missionaries no longer establish their own churches; instead, they help existing Christian groups. If the Baptists, the Presbyterians, or the Methodists invite them to give a message or to labor, they are willing. But they do not receive a salary from any group, because they are supported by China Inland Mission. This was not their policy and goal when they were in China. This is my analysis, not a criticism.</p>
<p>For many years we nullified the ground of organized Christianity in our attitude and our way, because of the light that we received. Hence, the missionaries in China Inland Mission feel that we are the least cooperative group and the most exclusive. They feel that they can work in any place, but we feel that they cannot work with us. Although we are diametrically opposed in our ways, it is not our intention to oppose them. Nevertheless, they feel that our attitude is an obstacle to the goal of their work in East Asia and in the Far East. Therefore, they take the lead to oppose us.</p>
<p>In expounding the truth, the heart and attitude of a believer must be proper. In addition, his words must be appropriate. This is a serious matter before God. Every believer will be judged by God. Whether or not a believer&rsquo;s argument concerning the truth is right, his heart, attitude, and words must be proper. He should not criticize others in a casual manner, nor should he make false and inaccurate statements. In 1939, after we published messages on the truth concerning the kingdom, someone put out a book to strongly oppose us. The author of the book slandered us and said that &ldquo;those who advocate entering into the kingdom say that it is possible for a saved one to be in &lsquo;the dark hell.&rsquo;&rdquo; When we refute someone&rsquo;s statements, we should use their terms. We should not create our own terms. We have never used the terms <em>the dark hell</em> or <em>the black hell.</em></p>
<p>The author of an article entitled &ldquo;My Little Testimony&rdquo; said that he heard a message by a Mr. So-and-so. This &ldquo;Mr. So-and-so&rdquo; was me. The author said that the message was about the believers&rsquo; accepting the local church&rsquo;s control in their marriage and that Mr. So-and-so said that if the saints do not overcome, they will go to the black hell. I would like to ask the saints who have listened to my messages whether I ever spoke on accepting the local church&rsquo;s control or on controlling the believers&rsquo; marriage? That article did not contain the truth.</p>
<p>Over the years in Taiwan we have been attacked and severely opposed by other believers because of our attitude and our ground. There is no middle ground. Christians in the Far East have misunderstood our heart and our attitude. In their eyes we &ldquo;create difficulties&rdquo; among the believers.</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO THOROUGHLY KNOW LIFE,<br />
THE CHURCH, AND THE KINGDOM<br />
IN ORDER TO MEET GOD&rsquo;S NEED IN THE PRESENT AGE</h2>
<p>As I observed the situation, I asked the co-workers, especially the senior co-workers, to consider certain things. We can say with a clear conscience, that from the time we began to serve the Lord until today, we had no intention to be in Christianity. Neither do we intend to create our own sect. We do not covet anything. We only want to keep a pure conscience and to hold the light of the truth that we have seen. The attitude of Christianity toward us merely causes us to focus on the matters that we received from the Lord. I spent a considerable amount of time before the Lord concerning these matters in order to know how we should proceed.</p>
<p>Just as Brother Sparks and the brothers who gathered in Scotland carefully considered the way that the Lord wants them to take and the work that they should do, we also feel that we should focus on certain things. First of all, we need to know life. We may be familiar with the word <em>life,</em> but we should not treat life as a term. Next, we need to know the church, and then we need to know the kingdom. These three items are comprehensive. Life is the most comprehensive; it includes the knowledge and the experience of life. We should also have a thorough understanding of the two aspects of the church. We should know the ground and the way of the church and the content and the reality of the church. In addition, we need to know the truth and the reality of the kingdom.</p>
<p>If we, the co-workers, do not have sufficient knowledge concerning life, the church, and the kingdom, we will not be able to meet the need of this age. If we only preach the gospel with zeal and hold revival meetings, just as Christianity does, we will not be able to meet this need. The work that God wants to carry out in this age is rejected by the world and ignored by Christianity. The Protestant denominations have expressed their attitude in their opposition to us. This does not mean that they have not done anything for God. They preach the gospel, but merely preaching the gospel cannot meet the need of God in this age. Therefore, we are forced to rise up to meet God&rsquo;s need in this age. If we merely have some knowledge of the truth and are zealous for the gospel, this need will not be met. We need a thorough understanding of life, the church, and the kingdom.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not sufficient for the brothers who labor to merely be zealous for the gospel and have some knowledge of the truth. This cannot meet the need of this age, nor will it meet our own need. There is a situation in our midst that we cannot cope with unless we know life, the church, and the kingdom.</p>
<p>We gave many messages concerning the content and the testimony of the church. The brothers and sisters need to review these messages. Then they will receive new light. When we studied the book of Ephesians, we spoke concerning the content and the testimony of the church. This is the hidden aspect of the church. The messages that were released in the last year mainly covered matters concerning the visible aspect of the church, that is, the ground and the way of the church. We also need to know this aspect of the church.</p>
<p>There is also the truth concerning the kingdom. The chapter entitled &ldquo;Entering into the Kingdom of the Heavens&rdquo; in <em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures</em> is on the kingdom. Even though this book covers practical matters, it gives a clear presentation of the truth. However, the chapter on the kingdom does not say much concerning the reality of the kingdom. It is focused on spiritual authority. I recently gave a message in Manila on what the kingdom is to the believers, in which I emphasized the reality of the kingdom. Then I gave several messages in Hong Kong concerning what the kingdom is to the church. The messages given in Manila and in Hong Kong provide a thorough explanation of the reality of the kingdom and supplement the chapter on entering into the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>The saints who are co-workers need to know where we are, the situation we are in, what our need is, what our focus should be, and what we should be doing. We can then work out something that will meet our need and also meet the need of this age. We must not merely be zealous for the gospel, have some knowledge of the truth, and give a few messages to help the saints to be zealous, to be revived, and to serve. This is not enough. We must see the crucial matters of life, the church, and the kingdom.</p>
<p>If our eyes are opened to these three matters and we have a thorough understanding of them, our work will begin to meet the need of this age. The district meetings in Taipei lack life, the church, and the reality of the kingdom. This lack cannot be met by a little knowledge of the truth; rather, we need a vision. I cannot force the brothers and sisters to see, nor can I help them see. All I can do is fellowship. May the Spirit operate within us and give us the desire to see these three great visions.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE VISION OF GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE<br />
TO BE MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that only when we have a thorough knowledge of life, the church, and the kingdom can our work meet the need of this age. Both the church and the reality of the kingdom depend on life. The content of the church is life, and the reality of the kingdom is also life. If we have the truth concerning the church but do not have life, we cannot have the testimony of the church. Neither can we have the reality of the kingdom if we have only the truth concerning the kingdom but do not have life. Therefore, we must have life. Then we will have the content and the testimony of the church, and we will have the reality of the kingdom, which is the authority of the kingdom. This does not mean that the truth is not important. The reality of anything related to life must be matched by truth. But truth without life is empty, superficial, and outward. Truth must contain life. The content of reality is life.</p>
<p>We are concerned, because the believers who serve God do not seem to know God as life. We often speak about life, and we know that God is life and that life is God. Moreover, we frequently speak of God becoming our life and of His being our life. Nevertheless, we are still short of knowing God as life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRUTH OF GOD DESIRING TO BE MAN&rsquo;S LIFE<br />
NEEDING TO BE REVEALED</h2>
<p>During the past two thousand years of church history, only the apostles clearly saw the truth concerning God as our life and God&rsquo;s desire to be our life. This does not mean that believers did not know that God is their life, nor does it mean that they did not experience and enjoy God as life. However, for the past two thousand years, no one emphasized the truth of God as man&rsquo;s life or of God&rsquo;s desire to be man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>For example, the truth concerning justification by faith was seen by the apostles in the early church. However, this vision was &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; after the time of the apostles. It was not until Martin Luther was raised up that the truth of justification by faith was declared. This does not mean that the believers who lived before Martin Luther did not experience this truth. We believe that even during the darkest period of Catholicism many believers genuinely experienced being justified by faith. However, it was not until Luther was raised up that the vision and revelation of justification by faith was as clear as a scientific law.</p>
<p>People also know that they need to eat nutritious food, but it was not until a few years ago that the various vitamins found in food were identified. Similarly, the fact of justification by faith has existed for a long time, but the truth of justification by faith was clearly defined by Martin Luther. Since then this truth has been shining brightly among Christians.</p>
<p>Another example is the assurance of salvation. Just as people know that there are numerous kinds of vitamins, believers can know that they are saved and can be assured of their salvation. Before George Cutting wrote the pamphlet <em>Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment,</em> countless believers had the assurance of their salvation. However, the truth concerning the assurance of salvation had not been clearly presented. If the believers who lived before George Cutting were asked whether they knew they were saved, they may not have said with assurance that they were saved. They may have had some assurance of their salvation, but this truth was not spoken. It was not until the 1800s that George Cutting declared the truth concerning the assurance of salvation. Since then this truth has shined brightly and clearly in the West.</p>
<p>When Christianity spread to China, the missionaries took the gospel to China, but they did not take the truth concerning the assurance of salvation. Thirty years ago the Lord raised us up as a group of young brothers, and He used Watchman Nee to recover the truth of the assurance of salvation. This does not mean that before Brother Nee none of the Christians in China had the assurance of their salvation. Many Christians truly had the assurance of their salvation. However, prior to Brother Nee the believers did not teach this truth. It was not taught among Christians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPREADING THE TRUTH CONCERNING<br />
GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE TO BE MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p>During the past two thousand years countless believers experienced God as their life, but they did not speak this truth; this truth was not clearly and thoroughly expounded. Madame Guyon knew God as life, but she spoke only about loving God, desiring God, and being &ldquo;lost in God.&rdquo; We speak of God being mingled with man, but Madame Guyon did not have this utterance. God used Brother Nee to say that God is constituted into us, but today we say that we should absorb God so that He can become our constituent, and we also say that the divine nature and the human nature are mingled together. We are even bold enough to use the expressions <em>eating God</em> and <em>drinking God.</em> Madame Guyon may have had many experiences of this, but she did not use these words. The truth concerning these matters was not released at that time.</p>
<p>Andrew Murray lived after Madame Guyon, and he enjoyed God. In his book <em>The Spirit of Christ,</em> it seems as if he wanted to use the words <em>eating God</em> and <em>drinking God.</em> We almost expect to read these words when we read his book. Although Andrew Murray saw these truths, he did not have the words to express them.</p>
<p>In these last days the recovery has intensified. This recovery has given us a vision, a revelation, and the utterance to speak clearly concerning God&rsquo;s intention to be man&rsquo;s life. When we first heard the expressions <em>eating God</em> and <em>drinking God,</em> they sounded raw and wild. However, I believe that in eight or ten years these will be common words in our daily life and even in Christianity.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago one did not ask a person if he was saved. In those days no one even dared to say that he was saved. A person who said that he was saved seemed proud. In particular pastors and elders opposed such speaking. Now, however, the truth concerning the assurance of salvation is common among Christians. Christians not only experience this truth, but it is also common knowledge, just as vitamins are common knowledge. Today many Christians no longer say that they are going to Sunday service; instead, they say that they are going to a meeting. Furthermore, the schedule posted at the entrance of many church buildings uses the word <em>meetings</em> and not <em>Sunday worship.</em> In a short time many Christians will say, &ldquo;I rise up early every morning to eat, drink, and enjoy God. I absorb God every morning.&rdquo; These words will soon be common among Christians.</p>
<p>A message concerning God as our life may initially be criticized, but eventually it will be accepted. This is what happened with the assurance of salvation. However, the truth concerning the church ground is a different matter, and it has been opposed by many believers. Christian groups acknowledge the truth concerning the assurance of salvation, because by so doing, they gain more members; they do not suffer loss. Similarly, if Christians accepted the truth of God as man&rsquo;s life and man&rsquo;s food, they could have a revival.</p>
<p>For the past one hundred years the writings of Andrew Murray are the most popular books published among Christians. This is because Christians can touch something and can taste God when they read these books. Therefore, I believe that soon all of God&rsquo;s children, even those who oppose us, will not only receive our messages concerning how to enjoy, eat, drink, and absorb God, but they will also speak these very things. In less than ten years these messages will spread among Christians in the Far East. In these last days God will accomplish this.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PICTURE IN THE BIBLE<br />
CONCERNING GOD BEING MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p>Hence, we need to be alert so that we do not become &ldquo;dropouts&rdquo; in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We need to catch up with God and see what He wants to recover. We should ask ourselves why God placed Adam and Eve in front of the tree of life after He created them. I have considered this matter many times. If I were God, after I made Adam and Eve, I would tell Adam why I created him. Then I would tell him what to do because I have a purpose in creating him. Finally, I would tell him what he should not do.</p>
<p>After God made Adam and Eve, He did not tell Adam why he was created or what he should do. Instead, God placed man in the garden that He had planted. In the middle of the garden, there was the tree of life. There was also a river that watered the garden, and there were gold, bdellium, and onyx stone (Gen. 2:8-12). Everything was wonderful, except one item. Therefore, God said to Adam, &ldquo;Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die&rdquo; (v. 17).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VISION OF GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE TO BE MAN&rsquo;S FOOD</h2>
<p>This simple description from Genesis 2 reveals God&rsquo;s mysterious intention. According to our natural concept, we think that God wants us to worship and serve Him, that is, to do things for Him. It is difficult for us to drop this concept. But the Bible reveals that God wants us to take Him as food. Genesis 2 presents the first vision in the entire Bible. This great vision controls all the visions in the Bible.</p>
<p>God wants us only to eat Him. He does not want us to do anything else. As long as we assimilate God into us, we have everything, and everything is accomplished. Nothing in the universe is more crucial than this. The Bible shows that after God created man, He placed man in front of Himself as the tree of life so that man would take Him as food. God presented Himself to man as food for man&rsquo;s enjoyment. God&rsquo;s unique intention, His desire, is for man to eat and drink Him daily.</p>
<p>We would never have this thought in our natural concept. We think about how to serve God and how to do things for Him. It is difficult for us to drop this concept. We do not know that God wants us to enjoy Him. Christianity needs to see this vision. All of God&rsquo;s children need to see this vision. During the time of Martin Luther, Christianity promoted the practice of asceticism and doing good in order to please God and be justified by Him. However, a hidden group of believers experienced justification by faith and not by good deeds, but the truth concerning justification by faith was not taught.</p>
<p>Today the atmosphere in Christianity is for man to zealously serve and worship God. Even people in the world have the natural concept that Christians are people who worship God and zealously serve Him. Almost every person has this concept. Even though some believers enjoy God as life in a hidden way, most believers do not have the concept that God can be enjoyed. When Luther was alive, he declared that man is justified, accepted, by God not by works but by faith. God needs some to stand up in these days and cry out, &ldquo;Brothers, God does not intend to ask us to do something for Him. God wants to be our food. He wants us to eat Him and enjoy Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God wants us to eat Him as food. God does not want us to worship Him or to be zealous for Him. God&rsquo;s desire is that we eat and enjoy Him. We need to speak this in order to turn the concept of Christianity. This is the purpose of Genesis 2. Moreover, the Bible ends with God&rsquo;s desire to be man&rsquo;s food. At the end of Revelation we see the tree of life and the river of water of life.</p>
<p>The first thing that God showed Adam was food. God wanted Adam to eat. This has been God&rsquo;s intention for the past six thousand years. God wants man to eat Him as the tree of life. God does not want man to do anything else. God&rsquo;s relationship with the children of Israel in the Old Testament reveals this matter of eating. The passover lamb and the unleavened bread were for God&rsquo;s people to eat. Manna was for them to eat, and the daily peace offering was also for them to eat. After the children of Israel entered the land of Canaan, all the produce of the land was for them to enjoy.</p>
<p>When God rescued the children of Israel out of Egypt, He did not ask them to do this or that. Instead, God wanted them to eat the passover lamb and unleavened bread. As the children of Israel journeyed through the wilderness, God wanted them to eat manna and to drink the water that flowed out of the smitten rock. God wanted the children of Israel to enter into the land of Canaan by faith. Canaan was a rich land flowing with milk and honey; it was a land where they could eat and drink. However, the Israelites did not understand God&rsquo;s desire. They wanted to do things for God. This forced God to give the law in order to show them that they could not do anything to please Him. It is difficult for the human mind to drop the concept of doing things. No matter what God says, man still wants to do something for God. Therefore, God gave the children of Israel the law for them to see that they could not please God. After God decreed the law, the children of Israel were unable to keep it.</p>
<p>When God became flesh and dwelt among men, the questions people asked Him were mainly concerning what work they should do (John 6:28). The people thought that the Lord came from God to be their teacher. Hence, their questions were related to doing and working. But the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life&rdquo; (v. 35), and &ldquo;I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever&rdquo; (v. 51). The Lord came to earth as the bread of life. He did not come to teach people what they should do; rather, He came for people to eat Him. He came that man may have life (10:10). The Lord came in the form of food to enter into people and give them life.</p>
<p>When we come to the Lord, should we ask what we should do, or should we eat Him as our food? We daily need to eat Him and enjoy Him. This must be our vision. Our living and work should be controlled by this vision. In the past our work was controlled by our natural concept. We constantly directed people to do things for God. We hardly ever dispensed God, that is, ministered God, into people for them to enjoy Him. We seldom led others to eat God.</p>
<p>At the end of Matthew 21 there is the parable of the vineyard, and in chapter 22 there is the parable of the wedding feast. The parable at the end of chapter 21 signifies the labor of people under the Old Testament law to plant, take care of, and prune the vineyard so that they can give the harvest to God. The parable at the beginning of chapter 22 is about a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son and invited people to the feast. The parable in chapter 21 is about people laboring, and the parable in chapter 22 is about a feast. The one parable refers to the Old Testament, which is under the law, and the other parable refers to the New Testament, which is under grace.</p>
<p>God did not originally intend to give the law; grace is His original intention. God&rsquo;s original intention is not for us to do things for Him but for us to enjoy Him by eating and drinking Him. In the parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15, the son&rsquo;s work after he left the father was to feed hogs. When he returned to his father, he said, &ldquo;I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants&rdquo; (v. 19). To be a hired servant is a matter of working. But the father said, &ldquo;Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry, because this son of mine was dead and lives again; he was lost and has been found&rdquo; (vv. 23-24). The fattened calf signifies God in the Son for man to enjoy. The believers who serve God need to let this vision control their work.</p>
<p>We need to see this basic vision: God does not want us to do anything for Him. God has only one intention&mdash;He wants to give Himself to us as food in order to be our life. Let me repeat: God wants to give Himself as food to be our life. God wants us to enjoy Him. If we do not see this vision, we will not have a clear knowledge of life. If we want to know life, we need God to open our eyes so that we can see that God has come to be our food.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE BEGINNING AND ENDING<br />
WITH GOD BEING FOOD TO MAN</h2>
<p>The Bible begins and ends in the same way. The vision of eating and drinking God begins with the tree of life in Genesis and ends with the tree of life at the end of Revelation. In the beginning of the Bible God is food to man, and at the end of the Bible God is still food to man. At the end of Revelation is the New Jerusalem. In the middle of the street in the city is a river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. On both sides of the river is the tree of life (22:1-2). In the city there is no work and no zeal; rather, we take God as the fruit of the tree of life and as the water of life. The issue of enjoying God and letting Him flow through us is the expression of God.</p>
<p>The last two lines of <em>Hymns,</em> #255 in Chinese read, &ldquo;Breath by breath I live upon Thee, / May Thou be expressed through me.&rdquo; God expressed through us is the New Jerusalem. There is no need for us to do anything for God. We only need to enjoy God. We need to be filled and saturated with God so that He can flow out of us and be expressed through us. This is what is manifested at the end of the Bible, and this is what God wants to accomplish.</p>
<p>In the New Jerusalem the believers are not zealously working, nor do they resolve to do good and endeavor to improve themselves. In the center of the New Jerusalem God is on the throne. Within the believers a river of life is flowing continuously. They also have the fruit of the tree of life. The glorious God is continuously flowing within and supplying His people. As a result, the glory of God is expressed through them. In the New Jerusalem there is no work and no zeal. This is what God desires.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MESSAGES WITHOUT GOD BEING WINDS OF TEACHING</h2>
<p>Have we truly seen this vision? Are all our activities controlled by this vision? I am afraid that we have not yet seen the vision of the garden of Eden and the New Jerusalem. Instead, we speak as though we are on Mount Sinai and say that we should do this and that. May the Lord have mercy on us and show us this vision. Everything we do and all our labor should be the outflow of life. Christians who live according to the concept of revering, serving, and working for God do not live as genuine Christians. If we want to live as genuine Christians, we must see that God does not want us to do anything for Him. God wants us to eat Him as food and to digest and assimilate Him into us so that He can transform us, be mingled with us, and eventually be expressed through us. Such believers are genuine.</p>
<p>If we see the vision in Genesis 2, we will drop our methods of studying the Bible and the reference books, because they do not supply us; they do not fill our hunger and quench our thirst. The methods and the books do not give us God. If we see this vision, whenever we give a message, we will not speak about anything else. This is the only light that we will see when we read the Bible. We will want to touch God in every chapter, every verse, and every word in the Bible.</p>
<p>Many preachers like to speak from Psalm 23, but few see that everything in this psalm is God. The green pastures signify God, the waters of rest signify God, the paths of righteousness signify God, the rod and the staff signify God, and even the valley of the shadow of death signifies God. Some may wonder how we can say that the valley of the shadow of death signifies God. Nevertheless, our experience confirms this word. May God open our eyes to see that the whole Bible points to God. Sadly, many people today speak about the Bible, but they do not speak about God. Even the messages that we give do not contain much God. Therefore, the saints do not receive much supply. They listen to the messages and receive teaching, but they do not gain much God. Messages of this nature are what Ephesians calls &ldquo;every wind of teaching&rdquo; (4:14).</p>
<p>Winds of teaching refer to teachings that do not cause people to be mingled with God, to gain Christ, to be joined to Christ, or to grow with the growth of God. Such teachings are winds of teaching. For the past five years, from 1953 until now, I have listened to the messages that the brothers gave from the podium. Most of the messages were teachings that did not give God. We need to see the vision in Genesis 2. May the Lord have mercy on us in these days that we may see this vision. Then we will receive much grace.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE CHURCH DEPENDING<br />
ON THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PERFECTING THE SAINTS FOR THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The principle for the practical building up of the church is revealed mainly in Ephesians 4:11-16: &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error, but holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind of teaching in verse 14 should not be understood as a wind of heresy. In this verse the word <em>teaching</em> is used according to its common meaning in the New Testament. It does not imply heresy. A teaching may be scriptural but still distract the believers and carry them away from God&rsquo;s central purpose, which is to build up the church as the Body of Christ. Such a teaching is a &ldquo;wind of teaching&rdquo; sent by Satan to entice the believers.</p>
<p>In this portion of Ephesians the phrase <em>building up</em> is used twice. It is first used in verse 12 and then in verse 16. In verse 16 <em>building up</em> refers to the Body itself; that is, the Body builds itself up directly. If we have only verse 12 but not verse 16, we will not be clear whether the building up in verse 12 is by the gifted persons spoken of in verse 11 or by the Body itself. Without verse 16, verse 12 is not clear.</p>
<p>There are many debates among Bible translators concerning how to punctuate Ephesians 4:12. Translators of the Bible differ in their views concerning how to punctuate this verse. One view is that verse 12 should be punctuated with semicolons: &ldquo;For the perfecting of the saints; unto the work of the ministry; unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; Another view is that commas should be used instead of semicolons. The Chinese Union Version uses commas.</p>
<p>The original text of the Bible does not have any punctuation. Therefore, the way a verse is punctuated depends on how the Bible translators understand the text. We should not think that the punctuation used in a verse is an insignificant matter. When semicolons are used to punctuate verse 12, the three things listed are carried out by the gifted persons referred to in verse 11. The gifted persons perfect the saints, they do the work of the ministry, and they build up the Body of Christ. The punctuation of the Chinese Union Version gives a different understanding: The gifted persons perfect the saints, and the perfected saints do the work of the ministry. As the perfected saints do the work of the ministry, they build up the Body of Christ. There is a significant difference in meaning.</p>
<p>If verse 12 is punctuated with semicolons, the gifted persons build up the church directly. But if this verse is punctuated with commas, the gifted persons do not build up the church directly. Instead, the saints who are perfected by the gifted persons build up the church. Therefore, the punctuation is an important factor in determining the meaning of this verse. Because of the strong arguments concerning the use of both punctuation marks, I have spent much time considering how to punctuate this verse.</p>
<p>A careful study of Ephesians 4:12 shows that it is more accurate to punctuate this verse with commas than with semicolons. We need to consider the goal of perfecting the saints, the function of the saints after they are perfected, and whether the perfected saints have a function. Is it possible for the gifted persons to continue to do the work of the ministry and build up the Body of Christ while the perfected saints are idle? Are the perfected saints unable to do the work of the ministry and build up the Body of Christ? The gifted persons perfect the saints. Then the perfected saints take part in the work of the ministry because they are perfected. Since the perfected saints are members of the Body of Christ, the result of their participating in the work of the ministry is the building up of the church as the Body of Christ. This explanation is according to the truth, and it is logical. Otherwise, the perfected saints do not function, and the gifted persons continue to do the work of the ministry and build up the church as the Body of Christ. This explanation is not logical.</p>
<p>Another reason for using commas is in verse 16, which states clearly that every member of the Body operates and functions. This function corresponds to the work of the ministry in verse 12 and issues in the Body building itself up. Therefore, according to verse 16 the building up of the church in verse 12 should be directly by the perfected saints and not by the gifted persons. These two reasons are based on the text of Ephesians 4.</p>
<p>A third reason is found in the teaching of the New Testament. The apostles, including Paul, rarely stayed in one place for a long time to build up the church in that place (Acts 8:25; 14:20-26). Most of the time there were no apostles in a local church. Some may wonder how a local church can be built up if the gifted persons spoken of in Ephesians 4:11 are not present. The church must be built up, but how is the church built up, and who builds it up? The local church is built up through the operation in the measure of each one part. This is the way the local church builds itself up. The teaching of the New Testament also proves that the building up in verse 12 is not only by the gifted persons; it is by the saints whom the gifted persons perfect.</p><h2 class="head1">IN THE PROPER SERVICE<br />
ALL THE BELIEVERS BEING PRIESTS</h2>
<p>Many portions in the Bible show that the church must be built up. However, no portion speaks of the building up of the church as clearly as Ephesians 4. If Matthew 16 was the only portion that spoke of the building of the church, we would think that the church is built directly by the Lord Jesus, because in verse 18 the Lord said, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; This verse says that the Lord builds up the church.</p>
<p>Someone who opposed the Lord&rsquo;s recovery said, &ldquo;Some people claim that they will go and build the church in every place. Can human beings build the church? Of course not, the church is built by the Lord Jesus. The Lord explicitly said that He will build His church upon the rock.&rdquo; This is what the Gospel of Matthew says. However, the facts and the truth further revealed in the Bible prove that the Lord Jesus does not build the church directly.</p>
<p>The New Testament contains Matthew 16 and also Ephesians 4. Ephesians 4 reveals that after the Lord ascended to the height, He gave gifts to the Body. These gifts are the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Therefore, the Lord does not build the church directly; rather, He builds the church in and through these gifts. There is not one local church that is built directly by the Lord Himself. For the past two thousand years every local church was built by the Lord through men.</p>
<p>Verses 8, 11, and 12 in Ephesians 4 reveal how the church is built. The Lord ascended to the height and received gifts. Then He gave these gifts to His Body, and finally the gifts work to perfect the saints. The word <em>perfect</em> implies taking material that has no function and making it into something useful. Therefore, to perfect the saints means to make the saints useful vessels. The apostles and the other gifts perfect the saints and thereby make them functioning members. The saints who formerly could not function as elders can function as elders after they are perfected by the gifts. Similarly, saints who could not function as deacons can be deacons after they are perfected by the gifts. The saints, who formerly did not manifest their ministry, their function, or their gift, manifest their function after they are perfected. This is the work carried out by the apostles and other gifts in various places. The perfected saints become proper, useful material; hence, they can participate in the work of the ministry. The result is that the church is built up. This is how the church builds itself up.</p>
<p>Three persons participate in the work of building up the church: the Lord Jesus, the gifts, and the perfected saints. The Lord does not build the church directly; neither does He want the gifts, such as the apostles, to build directly. The Lord gave the gifts to the church for the perfecting of the saints. Then the saints who do not function can be perfected to become functioning vessels. When the perfected saints fulfill their function, the church is spontaneously built up. The church is built up directly by the perfected saints.</p>
<p>Let us consider the building of the church as presented in the entire divine revelation. According to God&rsquo;s ordination the believers in the early church practiced the universal priesthood (Rev. 1:6; 5:10; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9). In other words, all the believers served God as priests. However, the church deviated from this practice, and the service of God fell into the hands of a small number of believers known as the clergy. Thus, the priestly system of the Old Testament was brought into the church. From that time onward only a few saints in the church served God; most of the saints did not serve God. This resulted in the formation of two classes&mdash;the clergy and the laity. This was also the beginning of the priestly system in the Catholic Church. The Protestant churches may be reformed in name, but they have retained the same system of service adopted by the Catholic Church. The state churches call it the clerical system, and the independent churches call it the pastoral system. Some people even say that we have a &ldquo;system of workers.&rdquo; Any such system is according to one principle; that is, only a small number of believers serve, while the majority of the believers do not serve.</p>
<p>The Bible says that all believers should serve God as priests, but the church has practiced two kinds of service. In the service practiced by the initial church, all believers were priests. This kind of service is according to God&rsquo;s original intention (Exo. 19:6), the &ldquo;pattern, which was shown to you in the mountain&rdquo; (25:40; Heb. 8:5). In the other kind of service a small number of believers serve, and the majority do not serve. This is the deviated way, not the original way. This way is derived from man&rsquo;s ideas; it is not according to God&rsquo;s original intention. Hence, if we want to serve according to God&rsquo;s original pattern, the building up of the church must involve all the saints. If we serve according to the deviated way found in Christianity, only a few believers can participate in the building, whereas the majority of the believers cannot participate in the building.</p>
<p>The service in Christianity has deviated because one or two pastors are in charge of a congregation, or one or two preachers are assigned to give sermons. The saints in these congregations only attend the services. When the pastor or the preacher leaves, all activities stop. This situation proves that the service is carried out by a few believers, not by all the believers. This also proves that the building is in the hands of a few believers. In other words, a few saints replace the rest of the saints in the building work. As a result, when the small group of believers leave, the building stops, and the service to God also stops. This is a great mistake.</p>
<p>In every locality we must pay attention to the building up of the church. The churches need to be built up by the growth of life. However, as we pay attention to the building up of the church, we must understand that no worker can build up the church directly. Every worker builds up the church indirectly by perfecting the saints. When we work in a place, our primary work should not be to build up the church directly. Our primary work should be to perfect the saints. The direct building up of the church should be by the perfected saints, not by us. After we labor in a place, we should be able to say that instead of building up the church directly, we have perfected a group of saints who can now fulfill their responsibility and manifest their function. When we leave, the saints we have perfected will manifest their function in a stronger way. This is the way to build up the church. This is entirely different from what is practiced in Christianity.</p>
<p>In Christianity there must be a pastor or a preacher in order to have Christian activities. As soon as the pastor or the preacher leaves, the activities stop, because no one can give the sermon. If the co-workers work according to this principle, we have made a serious mistake. It is wrong for us to build up a church directly, because the building will stop when we leave. The proper situation is for us to perfect the saints. The longer we stay in one place, the more we should be able to perfect others. Eventually, the saints are perfected. After they are perfected, the saints who were idle and did not function much become useful. Formerly, these saints could not manifest their gift and their function. But after they are perfected, they manifest and exercise their function. The saints who could not supply others in the meetings are able to function and supply others after they are perfected.</p>
<p>After we labor in a place, there should be a number of perfected saints. Then the building up of the church will not stop when we leave; instead, it will be more active. This is the proper service, and this is the way that the Lord builds up the church.</p><h2 class="head1">PERFECTING AND NOT REPLACING</h2>
<p>There are three steps in the building up of the church. The Lord first gives gifts to the church, and the gifts perfect the saints in different places. Then the perfected saints are able to function according to their measure because their organic function has been activated through the perfecting. As a result, the perfected saints are the ones who build up the church directly. To perfect means to make a person useful. Hence, to perfect a saint is to make him useful in the building up of the church.</p>
<p>Does a worker build up the church in a locality directly, or does he perfect others? The direct building up of the church should be carried out by the perfected saints, not by the workers. A worker perfects the saints; he does not build up the church directly. If we labor in a locality, but the building of the church stops after we leave, our work is wrong. What kind of work are we doing? Are we building up the church directly? Of course, there is a portion of the building up that we do directly according to our function, but our primary work is to perfect the saints. Otherwise, what will happen if we, like Philip, are suddenly caught away (Acts 8:26, 39)? What will the churches do if we are suddenly raptured? Whether we are raptured will not matter, if the saints are perfected and can build up the church directly.</p>
<p>If we, the workers, build up the church directly, we are replacing the saints in the building up of the church. However, the fact that we perfect the saints to build the church does not mean that we absolutely do not build up the church directly. Rather, it means that we perfect the saints instead of replacing them. Some saints do not know how to build up the church, so we teach them. Other saints are not able to build up the church, so we perfect them and make them able. We do not replace the saints, but we perfect them and let them do the building work directly. This needs our consideration.</p>
<p>The ability to accomplish a task by yourself is not necessarily an indication of great capacity. However, a worker who can teach the saints to do something better than he can, truly has great ability. The workers should perfect the saints. Then the saints will be as capable or even more capable than the workers.</p>
<p>We should not replace the saints in the building up of the church; rather, we should perfect the saints. We should make the saints useful and let them build up the church directly. We may think that we are very clear about this principle, but we may be clear only while we listen to a message. We may not be clear when we serve in our localities. Our work proves that we are still not clear concerning this principle. Some workers say that since they are neither an apostle nor a prophet, they cannot perfect anyone. In their display of humility, they even ask whom they should perfect. Although this sounds right, their words are used to enable them to continue to replace the saints. This is not right. Under no circumstance should we replace the saints. It is not a matter of whether we are gifted but of whether we can perfect others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GIFTS PERFECTING<br />
THE SAINTS TO BUILD UP THE CHURCH DIRECTLY</h2>
<p>The elders and the saints responsible for the group meetings must remember this principle. When they labor, they must perfect the saints. Otherwise, their work replaces the saints. For example, the elders know how to administrate the church. When an elder labors, he should have some saints with him in order to perfect the saints. The saints responsible for the meetings must also labor by this principle. A brother may work in such a way that the more he works, the more responsibility he bears; however, the other saints participate less, and he is unable to perfect the saints. In this situation his work is not proper.</p>
<p>The apostles, prophets, and even the saints responsible for the meetings must work according to this principle. Initially, the elders bear the responsibilities in a church. The saints who are raised up to share the responsibilities tend to do everything themselves because few saints are perfected to serve. However, after the responsible saints serve for a few months, they should bring other saints into bearing responsibilities. This does not mean that the responsible saints lightly relinquish their responsibilities. The responsible saints perfect the saints by serving the saints. They should teach the saints according to the ability of the saints. A saint can be taught to bear responsibility, and if he makes a mistake, he can be corrected. Soon he will be able to bear responsibility by himself.</p>
<p>Then another saint can be taught to bear responsibility. In two or three years all the saints will be able to do what you are able to do. In addition, when the number of saints in a meeting increases to a hundred saints, the meeting should split into two meetings. Then there will be many saints who can bear responsibility in the new meeting, because they were perfected by the leading of the responsible brothers.</p>
<p>In the building up of the church it is crucial for the saints who know how to build to perfect the other saints to build. In principle, the gifts know how to build up the church. We may say that there is no prophet or apostle in our locality, but we must admit that we can build up the church a little; we do have a little gift. A brother who has a desire to serve in a locality for five years must have a &ldquo;five-year plan.&rdquo; What will happen to the saints when he leaves? Will the church become weak and &ldquo;close its doors,&rdquo; or will it continue to function with a stronger service? Whether a local church will be able to continue after we leave is what matters.</p>
<p>A person who knows how to work will always seek to perfect others. This does not mean that he does less work. Rather, he works more than the rest of the saints, because most of his work is to perfect the saints. After he has served for three to five years, the saints can do and are doing whatever he can do. This requires a great deal of consideration. This is the way for us to build up the church. Leading others to be spiritual does not mean that we are building up the church, because to be spiritual is not the same as to be useful. We may lead others to be spiritual without leading them to exercise their function according to their measure. Hence, there are many spiritual saints in the church, but there is not much building.</p>
<p>Please forgive me for this frank word. I serve and work with you, and I am responsible before the Lord to observe the condition of the localities. Perhaps you feel that I cannot understand your situation because I am not in your locality, and I did not fellowship with you. However, there may not be another person who is as concerned for your situation as I am.</p>
<p>Some of the workers lack spiritual weight in their work, and therefore there is no result. Some workers render spiritual help to the saints, but they do not perfect the saints to be useful. The saints whom they serve do not become useful. A good carpenter can use wood of any quality to make something useful. However, even though some of our workers render the saints spiritual help, the saints are still not useful vessels. This can be compared to a carpenter who works on different pieces of wood until the pieces are smooth and have nice colors but are not useful. They are just pieces of wood; nothing useful, like a desk or chair, has been produced.</p>
<p>We need to see our lack and be humbled. It is foolish for us to be proud. If a local church has been in our hands for many years, what is the result? We should not be proud. Our condition should humble us. Many saints have passed through our hands; we contacted and led them. How many of these saints did we perfect to become useful? We should not say that we have poor quality material. Some of the material may be poor, but not all the material is poor. The problem is not the quality of the material; it is whether we can make useful vessels out of the material that we have. It may be a waste to make a chair out of top quality wood, but the chair is useful. It may be an even greater waste to make a chair out of pure gold or diamond, but the chair can still be used. Even if we use wood of the poorest quality, the chair will be useful. Hence, it does not depend on the kind of material that we have but on whether we have perfected the material. The saints in our locality may be &ldquo;poor quality wood.&rdquo; They might not be good material, much less gold or diamond, but we still must make them into something useful.</p>
<p>The building up of the church is not done directly by the gifts but by the gifts perfecting the saints. The perfected saints then build up the church directly. In principle, the gifts are the saints who know how to do things. A believer who receives the Lord&rsquo;s grace is able to do things. However, the Lord does not want us to do things by ourselves. He wants other saints to accompany us when we do things so that they can be perfected to do what we do. We must learn how to perfect the saints; otherwise, the church will not be built up.</p>
<p>This problem is not obvious in smaller churches. In the larger churches, however, it is visible. This problem is the reason that the church in Taipei is not built up. The saints who met in the six or seven district meetings were not built up. Even after we formed twenty smaller meetings, the saints were still not built up, because few saints know how to perfect others. There are many saints who know how to do things, but they do not know how to perfect others. The church needs a group of saints who not only know how to do things but also know how to teach others to do the same things and thereby perfect them.</p>
<p>It is difficult to give examples of spiritual matters because they are abstract. Business affairs, however, are concrete and clear. Some saints are very good at doing things in the large meetings, but they do not know how to perfect others. As a result, there were not enough saints who could handle the church affairs when we formed smaller districts and needed more responsible saints. Hence, the church affairs suffered. This shows that our urgent need is to learn to perfect others. If there are not enough perfected saints, the church cannot be built up, and our numbers will not increase. Moreover, when there are not enough perfected saints, any increase makes the meetings chaotic. If we have only three or four stones, they do not need to be built. But thousands of stones must be built; otherwise, there will be chaos. Even if the stones are polished and look nice, they are of no use because they are not built; they are a pile of stones. For the sake of the building up of the church, we must have a plan to perfect the saints.</p>
<p>The material in the church is for building; it is not for display. Construction workers build with materials; they do not beautify materials. However, some co-workers only beautify the building materials. They do not know how to perfect others, which is the real building. The saints who know how to perfect others are genuine co-workers of God.</p><h2 class="head1">FEW PERFECTED SAINTS IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>What does it mean to be perfected? Suppose we need a table, and we have a pile of wood. We should not merely beautify a piece of wood by sanding and polishing it, we should also determine what type of furniture we can make with the wood. If it can be made into a leg for the table, we should &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; it into a leg. We should repeat this procedure until we make the table. We may need to cut a piece shorter, or we may need to sand a piece. This is what it means to perfect; we make the material useful and buildable. Eventually, the pieces of wood not only look nice; they are also useful.</p>
<p>When the table is built, the pieces of wood are no longer in a pile; they are arranged in an orderly manner and have a function. The principle is the same with making a desk or a chair. When pieces of wood are built into furniture, each piece has a place and a function. This is building. If the pieces of wood are not built up, they are useless. Regardless of how nice they look, they are useless.</p>
<p>In order for the church to advance, we must not be stubborn and think that it is good enough to help the saints to be spiritual. The Bible says clearly that the church needs to be built up. First Corinthians 12:14-27 says that the members need to be blended. Yes, we need to lead the saints to be spiritual; this is a basic need. It is like sanding a rough and uneven surface of a piece of wood before using it. However, it is not enough to make it smooth; it also needs to be cut to the right shape. Therefore, we need an eye to see how we can best use the piece, and then we must know how to cut the wood. This is an example of perfecting the saints.</p>
<p>If all the workers serve in this way, eventually all the saints will be perfected. For instance, if the ushering in the six large meetings was done in a proper way, there would be no problem with the ushering in the smaller district meetings, because it is easier to maintain order with fewer saints.</p>
<p>The visitation service is another example. Only a small number of saints take care of the visitation. They visit people year after year, but there is no result. This means that even though they visit, they do not know how to perfect others to visit. One out of every five saints should be able to serve in this way. The church has increased to two thousand saints; therefore, we need three to four hundred saints on the visitation service. These saints should be perfected by the one hundred who are presently serving. In other words, while we serve on visitation, we should perfect some saints to serve with us. If every one of the one hundred saints perfects three or four saints, we will have three to four hundred saints who can serve. Therefore, for the churches to go on, we must humble ourselves and be willing to learn; we cannot be indifferent. Even if we know how to do certain things, we must admit that there are other things that we do not know how to do.</p>
<p>To be proud is foolish. We need to learn to be humble and be apt to learn. Even if we can lead others to have some measure of spiritual growth and to have a greater measure of the stature of Christ, we must confess that we are limited in what we can do. There are many things that we need to learn. We need to learn how to perfect the saints. Regardless of whether we are a brother or a sister, as workers, we need to ask ourselves whether the saints become useful after we are with them for a time. We can do certain things because we have been shown mercy, but have we perfected others to do the same things?</p>
<p>I gave a sober word in one elders&rsquo; meeting. I said that if the ushering in the large meetings was proper, it would also be proper in the district meetings. A problem with the ushering indicates that the ushers in the large meetings did not perfect other saints to usher. If the initial ushers perfected other saints to usher, there would be saints in the district meetings to take care of the ushering. This also applies to the business affairs of the church and to the spiritual matters in the church. When there are few perfected saints, everyone is content to merely have a meeting, even if there is not much supply in the meeting.</p>
<p>We need to humble ourselves and learn to do the work of the Lord. The church in Taipei has thirty-nine full-time serving ones and twelve elders. If these brothers and sisters are willing to change their concept and learn that the best way to labor is to perfect others to serve with them, the district meetings will not be weak and poor. However, if these workers are not willing to change their concept, the church in Taipei will not be built up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO PERFECT THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>Hence, every worker must learn many things. There are always things that we need to endeavor to learn. Regardless of how much we can supply the saints with Christ and help them gain a measure of the stature of Christ, this is only one aspect of our work. We always need to learn how to perfect the saints so that they may be useful vessels. We must perfect the saints to be useful. Our ability to perfect the saints determines how much the church can be built. If we do not perfect the saints, they will not be useful material, and as our number increases, the amount of material that is not useful will also increase.</p>
<p>We need to perfect the saints and build them into the church according to their measure so that every saint is perfected to stand in his place and fulfill his function. Then regardless of how large a church is, it will not lack order. It is only when we are perfected that we are genuinely built up. This can be compared to the wood in the meeting hall. It does not cause confusion, because it is built up and has a function.</p>
<p>Suppose that we have material to make some benches, but instead of building the benches, we leave the material scattered in a room. No one will be able to use the room. The church in Taipei is large, but we must be careful. More believers are being added, but we cannot do anything with them, because there are few perfected saints. We have formed more meetings, but we do not have perfected saints in all the meetings. The workers and the elders bear this responsibility. We need to be humbled and confess that we still have many lessons to learn. We do not know how to perfect the saints. We must learn to perfect the saints in order for the church to be built up.</p>
<p>In a normal situation, after a worker labors in a locality, there should be a strong service when he leaves. If the service collapses after the worker leaves, there was a problem with his work; that is, a large portion of his work replaced the saints instead of perfecting them.</p>
<p>May our eyes be opened to the revelation in Ephesians 4:11-12. These two verses say that Christ gave apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers as gifts for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry and unto the building up of the Body of Christ. The building up of the Body is not carried out directly by the gifts; rather, the gifts perfect the saints, and the perfected saints exercise their function to build up the Body of Christ. This is the real building up of the church. How much we perfect the saints is how much we build them up. If we labor in a city without perfecting any saints, we are not building up the church in that city, and the church will remain desolate. After we leave, the church will suffer and have no way to go on. This means that our work was a failure.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PERFECTING THE SAINTS TO BUILD UP THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We need to consider this matter and be willing to change and to learn something new. We must see that the first step of the building up of the church, the primary step, is that we learn to perfect others. It is good that we can do things, that we are willing to do things, and that we are actually doing things. However, it is a shortcoming if we cannot lead, teach, and perfect other saints to do what we can do. We need to learn, and to endeavor, not only to do things ourselves but also lead, teach, and perfect others to do the things that we do. In this way the church will be built up.</p>
<p>This is the urgent need in all the local churches. It is especially the need in the large churches such as the church in Taipei and in Kaohsiung. Since new ones are constantly being gained, if we do not learn how to perfect the saints, it will be difficult to continue the work in a good way. This is the result of increase with little perfecting. We cannot rely on splitting the large meetings into smaller district meetings. The district meetings in the church in Taipei prove this. There is the need to raise up more saints by perfecting them. If there are few perfected saints and we continue to split into smaller meetings, the church will eventually be desolate.</p>
<p>Since there are few perfected saints, we should be aggressive and learn to perfect the saints. Even the workers in the smaller localities should be aggressive to perfect the saints. We need to perfect the saints to be useful. While we work, we perfect others to do what we are doing. We should not be idle and direct others to do things. Rather, we should work diligently. The most important thing, however, is that we learn to perfect the saints. We should not perform a task by ourselves. Even if a saint seems unable to perform a task, we should let him do it to perfect him. After some time there will be a result.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are many lessons for us to learn while we perfect the saints. Many circumstances will force us to go to the Lord. For example, in order to perfect the saints to contact and enjoy the Lord, we must contact and enjoy the Lord. Hence, perfecting the saints will also benefit us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">PERFECTING THE SAINTS TO ARRIVE<br />
AT A FULL-GROWN MAN AND<br />
TO SUBMIT TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE HEAD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CO-WORKERS ALWAYS PERFECTING THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>Wherever the workers are, they must perfect the saints. If the workers replace the saints instead of perfecting them, the church will not be built up. To perfect the saints is to build up the church. In order to perfect the saints, we do not work by ourselves; instead, we work with the saints to teach them to do what we do. Our goal is to perfect the saints until they can replace us. Initially, we work by ourselves, but after a while the saints are able to work with us and are even better than we are. In the process of perfecting the saints, we pass responsibility to them. Initially, we are responsible for the work, but after a while, the saints are responsible. When the saints are responsible for the work, we can leave. This sounds simple, but the principle is crucial. The result of this type of work is the building up of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CO-WORKERS SERVING IN ONE PLACE</h2>
<p>According to my observation our work is short in perfecting the saints. In other words, the element of working with others to perfect them is inadequate. There is another matter that we need to consider seriously before the Lord. When we came to Taiwan, we took the way of a worker serving in a locality for a long time to take care of the church. We took this way because it was convenient. This may have been the right way for us to take in the past, but to continue the work in this way may create problems.</p>
<p>Even though it is beneficial for a worker to stay in one place for a long time, there are also disadvantages. The longer a worker stays in one place, the more likely he is to replace the saints in their function. In other words, a greater part of his work will result in replacing the saints rather than perfecting them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some workers tend to become isolated or even peculiar after they stay in a place for a long time, because they do things by themselves and are not balanced by others. They lack a balanced view of the churches and other workers because they have made decisions and have led and encouraged the saints by themselves.</p>
<p>On the one hand, there may be some loss when a worker travels frequently, but on the other hand, there is much benefit. The more a worker travels, the more he sees, and the broader his view becomes. A broader view is often a balancing factor and a salvation. A worker who stays in one place is bound to become local, narrow, shallow, and peculiar in his view. Hence, it is easy for him not to be balanced. A worker also becomes more subjective the longer he stays in a place. According to our present practice, most places have one main worker. It would not be good for this worker to become subjective. A person who is subjective becomes peculiar and has a narrow view. In all the places that I have visited, I have rarely met a worker who has a very broad view. When we travel, our view is enlarged, and we are balanced by others.</p>
<p>Moreover, when a co-worker stays in one place, the local saints have less of an opportunity to receive fellowship from other gifts. When the supply in a locality always comes from one gift, it is not easy for the saints to receive the supply from other gifts.</p>
<p>In spite of these considerations, it is difficult for us to decide how to deal with this matter. We do not know how the Lord will lead us. It may be that instead of staying in one place, some of the workers should travel frequently to fellowship with and supply the saints. But there are still advantages for a worker to serve in one place. A worker who stays in one place will bear more responsibility and is more likely to carry out specific burdens in a locality. In contrast, a worker who travels all the time may end up with no responsibility and no specific burden. Both sides have their merits and disadvantages.</p>
<p>We need to evaluate every aspect of our situation. Some workers might stay in one place for a long period, and others might spend more time to visit different localities. Regardless of whether we stay in one place or travel frequently, our goal must be to perfect the saints. Some brothers may say that since they are workers, what they do perfects the saints. This may be true, but even the pastors and preachers in the denominations say that their work is to perfect the believers. Their perfecting, however, is different from ours. When we refer to perfecting the saints, we are referring to the perfecting in Ephesians 4:12 that enables the perfected saints to take part in the work of the ministry to build up the church. This is not what Christianity refers to when they speak of edification. Many believers in Christianity are edified by their pastors or preachers, but they are not perfected. The perfecting that we speak of is not merely to edify the believers; it is more than edification, because it has the element of building.</p><h2 class="head1">PERFECTING BEING BUILDING AND<br />
NOT MERELY EDIFICATION</h2>
<p>To edify means to make something better, that is, to improve it. Edification also implies that something is made useful. Building, however, does not mean only to make something better and useful but also to build something as part of a house. Suppose we have some wood. We should work on it not only to make it smooth; we should also use it as a beam or a pillar in a house. It should be built as part of a house. This is the meaning of <em>perfecting</em> in Ephesians 4:12.</p>
<p>We stopped using the term <em>edification meeting</em> and started saying <em>building meeting,</em> because we are not merely edifying the saints. A person who makes wood or stone sculptures is doing a work of edification. After carving, edifying, the wood or stone, it is put on display for people to admire. This kind of work is incomplete. Most of the work in Christianity of preaching the gospel and holding revivals and Bible studies merely edifies the believers to improve them. This work does not contain much perfecting or building. As a result, many Christians receive spiritual edification and are beautiful, but they are not built up.</p>
<p>We can cut a precious stone and make it beautiful for people to appreciate, but this does not mean that the stone has been built into a building. Some believers are qualified to be admired by the church or by Christianity, but they cannot coordinate with others to become the dwelling place of God in spirit. They cannot be built. They are individual Christians who are good and beautiful, but they cannot be built up with other believers to function and serve in coordination.</p>
<p>There is a big difference between edification and building. We do not want merely spiritual brothers and sisters who are individuals in the district meetings. Rather, we want every meeting to have brothers and sisters who are perfected to exercise their function and are built up. We still need to learn in this matter.</p>
<p>We should not understand this to be something organizational and think that we need to learn to arrange and organize the district meetings. It is vain to organize the district meetings, because organizing is not building. The work that we are speaking of should be done in every locality and in every meeting. We have learned something from the Lord, and we know how to work, but while we are working, we need to perfect others so that they are built up. Then every saint can be responsible and manifest his function. He can also coordinate with other saints. This is the way that the church will be able to develop and expand and will be able to meet the many aspects of the Lord&rsquo;s need locally.</p>
<p>If there is a need to preach the gospel, a local church that is built up can preach the gospel. The church will also be able to support, shepherd, and care for new believers. There will be a genuine expression of the Body in that locality such that the saints who desire to learn to serve will be in the coordination. This church is the house of God, where God&rsquo;s people belong and have a home. These are the obvious functions of a church that is built up. There are also still deeper functions. All the functions result from a group of brothers and sisters who are perfected and built up in a locality. Therefore, we should not despise perfecting and building up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COORDINATION AND BUILDING<br />
BRINGING IN GOD&rsquo;S BLESSING</h2>
<p>There are no spiritual giants among us. Every one of us is a nobody. If we compare what we have with what is in Christianity outwardly, we will see that we have very little, and our condition is far from satisfactory. We truly feel that we are short in many matters; we are inadequate in many matters. Therefore, God can bless us only in a limited way. Nevertheless, the blessing that we receive is more than what other Christian groups receive.</p>
<p>Take the church in Taipei for example. Even though the district meetings are weak, the church was able to establish twenty-nine meetings where numerous brothers and sisters meet and serve together regularly. We once notified the saints that we would hold a conference the next day, and more than two thousand saints attended the conference. In contrast, many Christian organizations may use advertisements but still have only two or three hundred people in a conference. What is the source of our blessing? We are blessed, not because we have spiritual giants or famous preachers but because we have the elements of coordination and building. If we remove the elements of coordination and building, our situation will be more desolate than the situation in Christianity.</p>
<p>We are being blessed because we pay attention to coordination and building. The little amount of coordination and building among us causes God to bless us. Coordination and building uphold God&rsquo;s blessing. This fellowship is to strengthen our impression of building. The workers may consider that it is sufficient to have the tree of life, but this is not enough.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GROUND BEING BLESSED BY GOD<br />
AND THE BUILDING RETAINING THE BLESSING</h2>
<p>I have been in the Lord&rsquo;s work for at least twenty-five years, and I have suffered much during this time. Therefore, as soon as a situation arises, I know whether it will be a gain or a loss. For example, because I knew that we would suffer a great loss when Brother T. Austin-Sparks was here last spring, I tried to prevent anything from happening. I acknowledge that Brother Sparks is spiritual. It is difficult to find another person on the earth today who is as spiritual as he is. Hence, for the past thirty years Brother Nee, some saints, and I have appreciated him. We also spent the past thirty years observing him, and we wonder whether his understanding of the Body of Christ is appropriate.</p>
<p>The treasure and the earthen vessel (2 Cor. 4:7) must match. The container is important. Hence, we spent quite some time last year to stress the ground of the church. This is also the reason that we are fellowshipping concerning the building up of the church. If the ground and the building up of the church are not proper, there will be no result to our work, and the Lord&rsquo;s blessing will not remain. We cannot let this happen. Therefore, the blessing and the container must match.</p>
<p>If our intention is to form a separate group in Christianity and thereby become a sect, we deserve to be cursed; the Lord will never bless us. We also deserve to be cursed if we always dispute with other believers and try to be different. However, because the church is in a state of confusion, we must find the way to obtain God&rsquo;s blessing and find the proper ground that will retain God&rsquo;s blessing. Moreover, we have to find a way for the believers who stand on this ground to be built up so that God&rsquo;s blessing will not leak out.</p>
<p>We cannot change the condition of Christianity. God allows this state of confusion to exist, and we cannot change it. Any intention to change this is foolishness. However, since we desire to follow the Lord, live in His presence, and be useful to Him, we must find a way to retain what we know and have experienced. We need the ground and the building up to keep the blessing that we have gained. Otherwise, the fruit of all our labor will disappear.</p>
<p>We must not labor in a foolish way. Our work can be compared to drawing water out of a well with a bucket. If we pour the water on the ground, it will disappear. Therefore, we need to consider how to bring in the blessing, the proper ground that contains the blessing, and the building that preserves the blessing.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s blessing, which is among us, has much to do with our way and the ground on which we stand. It is also related to our service in coordination. Without our way, our ground, and our service in coordination, we would not have God&rsquo;s blessing. However, if the building up and coordination among us were stronger, there would be at least five thousand saints in the meetings.</p>
<p>Even though we do not emphasize the result of our work, it would be better to have five thousand saints who can hear the messages that are being released instead of two thousand saints. It would even be better for ten thousand saints to hear these messages. We do not desire a large crowd, but we nonetheless want the word of God to reach many people. Therefore, it is important that we know how to keep the believers after they are saved. We have baptized between seven and eight thousand people, but only one-fourth of this number were in the conference. This shows that the coordination and building up among us are weak. If our coordination were strong, about five thousand saints would attend the conferences.</p>
<p>In comparison with other Christian groups, we have received more of God&rsquo;s blessing. But our numbers are an indication of our weakness and inadequateness. The blessing that we receive is because of our coordination. Even though our coordination is inadequate, we still have a measure of coordination. Other believers do not have God&rsquo;s blessing because they do not have this coordination. We are blessed by God because we have some coordination and building, even if they are weak. We thank the Lord for this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PERFECTING THE SAINTS<br />
TO DO THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY</h2>
<p>The work has many aspects. There is nothing that has only one aspect. For example, there are many aspects to be considered in order to build a house. A house cannot consist of only walls with no windows; neither can a house have windows and doors in every wall. It is not a simple matter to plan where the doors and windows should be. This also applies to spiritual work. We should not think that it is good enough to lead the saints to be spiritual. We need to be spiritual, but we also need coordination. Our most obvious need is the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ. This is the most important aspect of the work.</p>
<p>If I always did everything by myself and did not perfect the saints, what would be the result? There would be only thirty to fifty saints who would be helped to be spiritual, and they would eventually become spiritual antiques. They would be beautiful and spiritual Christians who are useful only for exhibition. If there were a Christian exhibition, my work might be the best display. However, my work would have no usefulness in the building. This is the reason that I did not labor in this way.</p>
<p>When we began the work, we took the way of perfecting the saints. If there were an exhibition, none of the saints would be good enough to display, because our work is not for exhibition. We had only poor quality materials that we patched together. However, we thank the Lord that even though the materials were poor and unsightly, thousands of believers, when patched together, learned to serve the Lord and bring in the blessing. This is the right principle for our work.</p>
<p>We must see this principle and hold it. This does not mean that we do not need to be spiritual but that in whatever we do, we must learn to perfect others. We must perfect the saints whenever we do something. Our gifts and capacity vary, but we must still grasp this principle so that the brothers and sisters under our leading will learn to do whatever we can do. Let me repeat, we may differ in our gifts and capacity, but it is not right for the brothers and sisters under our leading not to understand what we do. The principle of our work must be to bring the saints who are under our leading to do whatever we can do, even if they do not have our capacity or know as much as we do.</p>
<p>Just like the apostle Paul in Acts 20:27, in our labor we should not shrink from declaring all the counsel of God to the saints. We should declare all that we know to the saints and teach them everything that we can do. We should not have any reservation. We want the saints to know what we know and to be better at doing what we do. This is what it means to perfect others. We must hold on to this principle when we labor. The result will be the building up of the church.</p>
<p>When the church in a locality is built up, we can leave. While we are with the church, it has one extra pair of hands to help. When we leave, the church lacks only one pair of hands. This is not a serious lack. Whether we are present or absent, the church service continues. The service in the church must not stop when we leave. This is not like the situation in some groups in Christianity where the Sunday worship stops when the pastor leaves. Our labor must not have this result. A strong church and a strong service must remain when we leave a locality. This is the right kind of work according to the proper principle.</p>
<p>This type of work will force us to learn many things and to change our old ways. We should never be content with merely leading people to salvation and helping them to love the Lord. While we lead people to salvation and to love the Lord, we must grasp every opportunity to teach them everything that we can do in order to perfect them and make them useful vessels. We should work with the saints individually and make them useful vessels so that they may function according to their measure. This is to build them up. Furthermore, they will be able to coordinate with other saints in the service. If we labor in this way, we are a proper worker who is doing a good work. Then the Lord can gain a corporate vessel in the locality where we labor. This corporate vessel has a capacity that is larger and more useful than ours. The spiritual issue and blessing of such labor are unlimited. We are one person, but the issue is a church that comes out of our labor and continual perfecting of the saints. We must see this principle and learn to work according to this way.</p><h2 class="head1">PERFECTING THE SAINTS TO ARRIVE AT<br />
THE MEASURE OF THE STATURE<br />
OF THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST AND<br />
TO SUBMIT TO THE HEAD</h2>
<p>We have to be clear concerning the building in Ephesians 4. Verse 13 clearly says that the building is for us to arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God so that we have the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Thus, as we perfect the saints, we cause them to know the Son of God and to have the increase of the stature of Christ. We perfect the saints with the tree of life, the living God, and with the resurrected Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p>Therefore, there must be no lack in our knowledge and experience of the tree of life. If we do not experience the tree of life, breathe the living God, and know and appropriate the riches of Christ, the Son of God, we will not be able to build others with these items. The number of messages that we can give does not matter. What matters is how much we can dispense the riches of Christ into the saints, give them the tree of life to eat, and help them to breathe the living God. This requires us to experience these things first; otherwise, how can we lead others to know and enjoy these things?</p>
<p>Verse 15 says that we should lead all the saints, ourselves included, to hold to truth in love and to &ldquo;grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.&rdquo; In other words, perfecting is not only a matter of life but also of authority. To &ldquo;grow up into Him&rdquo; indicates the aspect of life, and to &ldquo;grow up into...the Head, Christ&rdquo; indicates the aspect of authority. <em>In all things</em> means that in every item of our daily life we live in Christ, we breathe God, we eat the tree of life, and we enjoy the Son of God. Formerly we were outside of Christ. After our salvation we may be in Christ in certain things, but in other things we are still outside of Him. Now we need to grow up into Christ in all things. This is growth. In all things we should breathe, eat, drink, and enjoy Christ. In the end, we submit to Christ&rsquo;s authority in whatever things we have grown up into Him. This is because the One into whom we grow is the Head of the church and our Head.</p>
<p>Our work should be according to our experience. We need to learn to always enjoy and absorb God, live in His life, and enjoy His riches. As we grow into Him in one item after another, we submit to His authority as the Head. Because we bring everything under the ruling, the authority, of the Head, when we labor to perfect and lead the saints, we will spontaneously lead them to grow up into God, that is, to enjoy and absorb God in everything. As the saints are joined to God in all things, they will spontaneously bring every matter under the authority of the Head and submit to the authority of the Head. This is the kind of work that we should do.</p>
<p>Our work is to perfect the saints so that they can be built, function, and be responsible. The content and element of our work, however, must be God, the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, who is the Son of God, and the life and authority of the Head. The issue of such a work will make the church the Body of Christ and will cause the church to build itself up in love.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TWO ASPECTS OF OUR WORK</h2>
<p>The brothers and sisters who serve in the localities must know that in our service and labor there must be the elements of God and the stature of the fullness of Christ. These elements cause our work to be solid. We should never be satisfied and proud because we lead many people to salvation. We should not be satisfied because we are able to deliver good and interesting messages that supply the saints. Neither should we be satisfied because we lead the saints to be in one accord, to love one another, to zealously pursue the Lord, and to serve in oneness. These are not sufficient. These things are good according to the concept in Christianity, but we should not be satisfied with these things.</p>
<p>Our work is to help the saints to enjoy God, know the Son of God, and grow unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. In everything we lead the saints into the life and authority of the Head, Christ. We must be impressed with this. At the same time, we perfect and build up the saints. Then the saints in the locality where we labor will not only know how to absorb and enjoy God, to grow in Christ, to touch the divine life in everything, and to submit to God&rsquo;s authority, but they will also be perfected and built up to be the church. They will be a supply so that the Body of Christ can be built up in love.</p>
<p>Whether we remain in the locality or leave, there will be a corporate entity that is full of God, has a measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, and is full of the life and authority of the Head. There will also be a good coordination, and many will be perfected and built up to exercise their function to do the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ. Whether we stay in that locality, are raptured, or leave, the church will be built up. This is the work that we should do.</p>
<p>Hence, we must be delivered from our old concepts. We may have the concept that the place where we labor is our field, as if the church is our personal enterprise. We must drop this concept. We do not have a personal field, and no church is our personal enterprise. The content of our work must always cause the saints to gain God; in everything we must lead the saints to breathe God, to enter into the life of Christ, and to submit to the authority of the Head. Our work must also perfect and build up the saints.</p>
<p>If we labor in this way, it will not matter whether we stay in a locality or leave. There will always be a group of believers who are built up in a solid way. This is the kind of work that we are doing. If we do not work in this way, we will either become a resident pastor or a traveling evangelist. If we labor in only one place, we become resident pastors, and if we travel to different localities, we will be traveling evangelists.</p>
<p>Every day I pray, &ldquo;Lord, I do not want to be a resident pastor or a traveling evangelist.&rdquo; When people ask me what I do, I say that I am neither a resident pastor nor a traveling evangelist; I just work according to my portion. In simple terms, my portion is to impart God into the saints and perfect them so that they can be built up. If we can all do this, it will not matter whether we stay or leave. What matters is the content of our work and how we work. Whether we stay in one place or travel to many places is insignificant if we work God into others and perfect them. This is the crux of all our problems.</p>
<p>Christianity is in a poor condition, but we have received mercy from the Lord to see the New Jerusalem. God has brought us to a high mountain to see the New Jerusalem. He has brought us also to the wilderness to see the condition of Christianity. The contrast between the New Jerusalem and Christianity gives me a heavy burden. Furthermore, the situation in our meetings and the condition of the serving ones make my burden heavier.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us and show us a clear vision that surpasses the condition of Christianity and meets His need. Then our work will be of value in this age. Otherwise, we will merely be resident pastors and traveling evangelists. When we truly see a vision, our work will excel; it will not be low. We will be neither a resident pastor nor a traveling evangelist; rather, we will be ministers appointed by God. We will have a portion, and we will work according to our portion.</p>
<p>We must see these two crucial points. First, we must minister God and Christ. Second, we must perfect and build up the saints. If we neglect both or either one of these points, our service is not up to the standard. Instead of being a worker in the present age, we will merely be a preacher in traditional Christianity. These two points are serious: on the one hand, we minister God, and on the other hand, everything that we do is to perfect and build up the saints.</p>
<p>If we can grasp these two points, the churches will have a future, and our work will be of value and surpass the situation in Christianity. Instead of being traditional Christians in Christianity, we will be workers in the present age who have a clear vision of what the Lord desires to do in this age. We must be strong and always impart God into others and lead them to enjoy the riches of Christ. We must also perfect and build them up. Then the place where we labor will have the increase of God, it will not lack the building, and there will be the continuous perfecting and building up. A vessel will be built up that can bring in and contain God&rsquo;s blessing and distribute it to others. This is what we should do today.</p>
<p>We must understand that the Lord did not raise us up to fight with other believers concerning the interpretation of the truth or even concerning spiritual matters. The Lord raised us up and blessed us for the building up of the church. We should fight the good fight and engage in spiritual warfare for the building up of the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CHURCH<br />
AND THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE URGENT NEED TODAY</h2>
<p>The ministry of the word refers to the messages that we give. In the past we paid much attention to the exercise of the brothers when they minister the word. For more than three, close to four, years I have observed and paid particular attention to the ministry of the word in the different localities. Many brothers still need to exercise when they minister the word. It is difficult to speak clearly concerning this in a few words. It seems as though there is no problem with the messages given from the podium. However, if we study our situation carefully, we will see that there is a big problem. Because of the shortage among us, I hope that we can gather all the serving ones together in the fall and spend some time to focus on the administration and building up of the church and on the ministry of the word. This shortage is especially evident in the church in Taipei. There is, therefore, a need to address these two matters.</p>
<p>The administration of the church and the ministry of the word are related. The ministry of the word is related to the administration of the church. It is difficult to build up a church if we administer but do not have an adequate supply of the word. The serious problems in the larger churches, especially the churches in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong, are due to a weakness in the administration, the building up, of the church, and the ministry, the supply, of the word. It is difficult to say which is more important. Both are equally important.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ministry of the Word<br />
Producing Building Materials</h2>
<p>The ministry of the word produces building materials. In order to build a house, we must have materials; without materials we cannot build a house. The materials for the building of the church are produced by the supply from the ministry of the word. We should not think that if we have three to five thousand saints, we have materials for the building up of the church. Without the proper ministry of the word, every saint will become a problem. The more saints there are, the more problems there will be. An increase in the number of saints does not mean that there are more materials. The amount of materials does not depend on the number of people but on the supply from the word. A rich supply is needed for the saints to become useful materials. Hence, the materials for the building up of the church come from the supply in the ministry of the word. When the supply is abundant and rich, there will be materials for the building up of the church. Without the supply from the ministry of the word, even if there is a multitude of brothers and sisters, we will sense a lack of materials for the building up of the church. We have many brothers and sisters, but we lack building materials because of a shortage in the ministry of the word. The supply from the word is the source that produces materials for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei is a large local church, because it has many saints. Hence, all the serving ones in Taipei want to know how to build up the saints. However, because there is a weak supply from the word, there are many saints but no materials. In other words, many brothers and sisters cannot become building materials and be built up together, because there is a shortage in the supply. In order to have building materials for the church, there is the need for a rich supply in the ministry of the word. When there is a rich supply in the ministry of the word, the saints will not merely be brothers and sisters; they will become materials for the building up of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Administration of the Church<br />
Being the Skill for Building</h2>
<p>The administration of the church can be considered the skill needed for building. Having materials does not necessarily mean that a house can be built. We need skill. There must not be a shortage in materials or in skill. If we do not have the proper skill, we will not be able to build even when the materials are prepared. For example, if we are skilled in carpentry, masonry, or ironwork, we will not be able to build anything with materials such as wood, stones, bricks, cement, reinforced bars, glass, and steel rods. Therefore, we must see that on the one hand, the urgent need today is the supply from the ministry of the word, and on the other hand, it is the administration of the church. One concerns materials, and the other concerns skill.</p>
<p>The administration of the church includes governing and management. To govern requires people or things to be placed under authority. To manage means that people and things are not merely placed under authority but are directed in an orderly fashion so that their function is manifested.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH NEEDING<br />
TO BE GOVERNED AND MANAGED</h2>
<p>Anyone who visits Hong Kong sees the governing and management of the British officials. They govern and manage land, transportation, traffic, and many other matters. As a result, many places that previously were inaccessible to the public are now accessible. Some places where the land was too high were made flat, and places that were low were filled in. For instance, they leveled a hill in Kowloon City and made a new runway for the airport on land that they reclaimed along the coast. In the past it was difficult for planes to take off and land at the airport in Hong Kong, because the airport, which is located at the foot of a hill, was affected by slight changes in the weather around the hill. The government leveled the hill in Kowloon and used the earth to reclaim and develop land along the coast. Moreover, the large rocks from the hill were used for construction. The land that was reclaimed was also used for a park, and portions were sold to individuals and businesses. This benefited the people.</p>
<p>This example shows that administration includes both governing and management. The elders in a local church should not only govern but also manage. A person who does not govern cannot manage; if he does not have the position and the authority to govern, he cannot manage. However, a person with the position to govern must also manage. We do not seem to have a problem governing the church, but we have a problem with management. The problems in a large local church may be the result of our not knowing how to manage. When we speak of perfecting the saints in these messages, we are emphasizing management, which covers many areas.</p>
<p>If we want a local church to be built up, we must have a rich supply from the word and proper administration, which includes governing and management. The churches under our responsibility need to be governed and managed. Some localities are governed, but they do not seem to be managed. For example, the elders must make up the lack in the meetings. The elders should not govern the saints while neglecting the management of the meetings. They should be concerned if a meeting lacks content and not let a weakened situation continue.</p>
<p>Hong Kong was previously a deserted island with hills, valleys, and barely any roads. It was difficult for airplanes to take off and land and transportation was not convenient. Then Hong Kong was placed under the British administration. This is an example of how we need to administrate the church. We should not require a church to merely be put under the governing of the elders. Governing is for management. An elder should manage a meeting that is under his care. He should make up for what is lacking and strengthen what is weak. Our lack is management, not governing. In a family the parents cannot demand that the children be under their governing but not manage the children&rsquo;s needs for clothing or food. If the parents do not manage the needs of the children, they are governing without management.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances we should manage more than we govern. In the churches we need more management than governing. We must admit that we are weak in the matter of administration. However, our basic problem is our lack of the supply from the word. The supply from the word is a big lack among us. Let us consider the positive aspect of the ministry of the word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPLYING THE WORD</h2>
<p>The saints responsible for the district meetings should pay attention to supplying the word. A primary matter in society is to take care of the supply of food. This is the reason that every administration focuses on supplying people with food. If the people in a country are not fed, it is difficult to administrate that country. Similarly, if the children in a family are hungry and lack proper nutrition, there will be many problems. This also applies to the church. If the ministry of the word is weak, the saints will lack the supply from the word; they will come to the meetings hungry and leave hungry. The saints who are hungry will eventually stop attending the meetings and will backslide. Moreover, many problems will arise.</p>
<p>A person who is malnourished suffers from different kinds of diseases. In the same way, opinions, criticisms, judgments, and reasonings come in and produce a negative atmosphere when a church lacks the supply from the word. A rich supply of nutrients enables a person&rsquo;s body to destroy germs so that diseases are swallowed up. Similarly, if there is a rich supply from the word, the negative speaking is swallowed up.</p>
<p>On the negative side, we can focus on the diseases in a person, but on the positive side, if we want a person to have normal growth, we have to give him adequate nutrition. A malnourished person cannot grow properly. Similarly, a church that does not have a rich supply from the word cannot develop, the function of the saints will not be manifested, and the various needs in the church will not be met. We need to see the importance of supplying the word. When there is a rich supply from the word, every problem will be terminated and every need will be met. Taking care of problems and needs depends on the supply of the word.</p>
<p>Diseases in the body are eliminated by the nutrients in the food a person eats. The proper growth and development of every part of a person depend on the nutrients in food. When there is a shortage of nutrients, the proper growth and development of the body stops, and germs that enter the body can cause diseases. Hence, it is useless to try and cure a disease if a person refuses to eat. Likewise, there will be no effect if we repeatedly attempt to solve the problems in a church when there is a shortage in the supply of the word. The problems in the church are not really problems; they are the result of a shortage in the supply of the word. As soon as there is a sufficient supply, the problems will spontaneously disappear, and there will spontaneously be the growth and building up. When we lack the supply of the word, everything becomes a demand, and the more demands that there are, the less likely that they will be met.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who serve in the ministry of the word must know that a church is weak when the supply of the word is weak, it is poor when the supply of the word is poor, and it has problems when there is a problem in the supply of the word. When there is a shortage in the word, a church cannot be built up in a good way and materials will not be produced for the building. In our service in the church we should not complain about this or about that. We should not blame the brothers, sisters, elders, or deacons for the different problems. Our complaints will not solve the problems. If we give the church a &ldquo;physical checkup,&rdquo; we will see different germs that indicate a lack of nutrition. The root of the abnormal situations in the church is an inadequate supply from the word; the saints have not been given a sufficient supply of nutrients.</p>
<p>Children who do not eat well and are skinny and sickly are prone to suffer from different diseases. Instead of blaming the children for being sick, we should blame the parents who do not feed the children. If parents feed their children with sufficient nutrients, the children will be healthy and strong. As long as the children have enough nutritious food to eat, they will not be sick. This is an accurate illustration. If we want to solve the problems in the church, we should forget about everything and minister the word. As soon as there is a rich supply of the word, there will be many vitamins and nutrients supplied to the saints. As a result, the problems and diseases will be eliminated, and the church will be strong and healthy. The key is in the supply of the word.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EFFECTIVENESS<br />
OF THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD</h2>
<p>The Chinese have a saying that a single statement may cause a nation to rise or to fall. This shows the serious effect of words. Words can save a person&rsquo;s life or destroy a person. Words can also cause a country to rise or to fall. Likewise, the building up or the tearing down of a church depends on the ministry of the word. The brothers serving in the ministry of the word must realize the importance of their responsibility. If we minister the word in a poor way, the church will suffer loss, but if we serve well, the church will benefit. Hence, whether the church suffers loss or is benefited depends on us. One day we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ to give an account to the Lord. The Lord will surely question us concerning this matter.</p>
<p>The brothers who minister the word must not blame the saints or the church for not doing well. Instead, we must bear the blame and admit that the problems are a result of a deficiency in our ministry of the word. We must not shirk our responsibility. We may blame the church, but when another worker, who can supply the church with a strong ministry in the word, comes, the condition of the church will change. The ministry of the word causes the saints to rise up. It is wrong for a mother to beat and scold her children because they are thin and sickly in appearance. The condition of the children is the result of poor nutrients. A mother may think that she gives her children sufficient nutrients, but the food she prepares tastes like medicine. She may think that the food is nutritious, but to the children it tastes like bitter medicine. Similarly, the speaking brothers may feel that the message they give is rich, but the saints do not receive a supply. The brothers may blame the saints and even rebuke them for their lack of comprehension. However, the saints do not eat, because the brothers prepare only &ldquo;bitter medicine.&rdquo; Therefore, we should not blame the &ldquo;children&rdquo; for being thin and sickly. We should rather make sure that the food we give them has flavor. We must understand that the root of the problems in the local churches is related to the ministry of the word.</p>
<p>If the word of the gospel is properly preached, crowds of people will repent and be saved, but if the word is not properly preached, few people will be saved. Therefore, the word that is spoken makes a difference. This applies to the word spoken to sinners and to the word spoken to the believers. Therefore, we must pay attention to the ministry of the word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BEING WITH GOD AND<br />
THE WORD BEING GOD</h2>
<p>The word that we are referring to is the word of ministry spoken from the podium, not the common words spoken in the world. The brothers who serve in the ministry of the word must grasp a basic principle&mdash;the word that they minister must be God. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; John did not begin the sentence with <em>the Word was God.</em> He first said, &ldquo;The Word was with God,&rdquo; and then, &ldquo;the Word was God.&rdquo; The spoken word must be with God so that the saints receive God. Oftentimes when we listen to a message, the word that is spoken is not God and does not have the presence of God. Such words are empty and can be idle talk.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BEING SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2>
<p>The words spoken by the brothers must cause the saints to see God. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (6:63). The words released through the ministry of the word should always be the utterance of God, and they should be spirit and life. The apostles wrote the Epistles according to this principle. For example, sometimes the apostle Paul spoke his own words, but he felt that God was in his words (1 Cor. 7:10, 12, 25, 40). This is what makes the Bible special and proves that the Bible is God&rsquo;s Word. Most people are afraid to speak about themselves, but much of what Paul said was concerning himself. It seems that Paul in his Epistles spoke more about himself than about the Lord Jesus. He never mentioned where the Lord Jesus was born, but he gave a clear account of his own background. While most people today dare not speak about themselves, Paul spoke about himself, particularly in the books of 1 and 2 Corinthians. However, as we read the words concerning Paul, we sense God. Paul even said that it was necessary, not expedient, for him to boast and that he boasted like a foolish man (2 Cor. 12:1; 11:16-17). In these words Paul did not speak about God, the Lord, or the Spirit. However, when we read them, we sense God, because Paul spoke forth God. Even though Paul spoke concerning himself, his words conveyed God.</p>
<p>It is possible for us to say &ldquo;God&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; in every sentence but have nothing of God when we speak. What Paul said was full of the element of God. Hence, when we read Paul&rsquo;s words, we touch God. Paul&rsquo;s words are God, the Spirit, and life. If we want our words to convey God, the Spirit, and life, our words must pass through God and be in God.</p><h2 class="head1">USING REFERENCE BOOKS</h2>
<p>The brothers who minister the word must not merely collect some points from reference books. If our speaking consists of only what we collect from reference books, the words that we speak will not come from our experience of God and will not pass through God. This does not mean that reference books are useless, nor does it mean that we should not use them, but the words that we speak must pass through God, and they must have the element of the experience of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Making the Vision and Experience of Others<br />
Our Vision and Experience</h2>
<p>What is the use of reference books? Good reference books contain some light. An example is Andrew Murray&rsquo;s <em>The Spirit of Christ.</em> This is a valuable reference book because Andrew Murray was enlightened and saw the truth concerning abiding in Christ. When we read this book, however, we should not treat it as a reference book. In order to speak it to others, we need to pass through God. Otherwise, we are those who &ldquo;buy and sell goods&rdquo;; we have not passed through God, and we have no experience that comes out of God.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we should not read reference books. However, instead of merely quoting a book, we should bring the content&mdash;what the author saw and experienced&mdash;to God. Then the content will become our vision and experience. We need to see what the author saw and experience what the author experienced. Then the book is not merely a reference book. We read reference books because we want to see what others saw and experience what they experienced. Then we will have something that is in God and has passed through God; their vision will become our vision, and their experience, our experience. This is the primary purpose of reference books.</p>
<h2 class="head2">For a Proper Understanding<br />
of Words and Phrases</h2>
<p>Reference books also help us study the meaning of words and phrases. If we do not thoroughly understand the original language, it is difficult to determine the proper translation of some words and phrases. Hence, we can consult reference books written by people who understand the language. In this respect reference books are useful, and we should use them. However, the words and phrases that we study should help us in our utterance.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Finding Proper Utterance</h2>
<p>Reference books can help us with our utterance. Sometimes the authors have good utterance. However, we should not accept everything that is in a reference book. For example, Madame Guyon spoke about &ldquo;being lost in God.&rdquo; This is good utterance, but it is not sufficiently high or clear. It seems as though Madame Guyon used these words to mean being blended and mingled with God. When we say that we are lost in God, it implies that we no longer exist. However, according to our experience, we are mingled with God, not lost in God. Therefore, reference books should merely be used for consultation. We should not quote everything that is written. The reference books that we read should inspire us to develop our phrases and utterances.</p>
<p>Our use of reference books can be compared to a commander-in-chief who consults his advisers for their opinions in order to develop a strategy. Sometimes these opinions give us good ideas. If we do not read or consult reference books, we limit ourselves. The reference books that we consult can be helpful in improving our understanding.</p>
<p>Hence, we should not wait until we are about to give a message to consult a reference book. Rather, we should read reference books regularly in order to gain a resource of material. For example, the books concerning fellowship between man and God by Andrew Murray, Madame Guyon, and Mrs. Penn-Lewis have their own characteristics. We therefore should not wait until we are about to speak on fellowship with God before we consult these reference books. The proper way is to read these books on a regular basis and store what we read within us. Then when we are ready to give a message on fellowship with God, there will be a foundation within us, because we have consulted what others wrote. We should use what they wrote as reference material, but we should not quote everything. This is the way to use reference books.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Avoiding the Exposition of the Bible<br />
in Reference Books</h2>
<p>Furthermore, when we use reference books, we must not rely on their expositions of the Bible. We should never think that we can quote someone merely because he expounded a verse in a good way. If we do, our speaking will not be the word of the ministry, because it did not pass through God and does not have the Spirit of God. Rather, our speaking is borrowed. Whether we give messages or lead others to study the Bible, this is an inappropriate way to use reference books. The words that we speak must pass through God and must be in God. We can consult what others write in order to understand the meaning of phrases and words in the Bible, and the light that others receive from the Bible may inspire us. However, what we speak must be in God, and it must pass through God. The words that we speak must also be spirit and life. We can be helped in our utterance without quoting everything we read. We need to study, learn, and consider what others write. Then we will be more advanced and higher.</p>
<p>I received much help from the writings of Mr. J. N. Darby. There is a statement in his writings that I believe is a great word, even though some people may consider it insignificant. He said that the Psalms are the expressions, feelings, and impressions of godly men. Most people would think this is an ordinary word. In Darby&rsquo;s <em>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</em> he commented on all one hundred fifty psalms. Many important statements can be found in his comments. However, except for the statement of the Psalms being the expressions, feelings, and impressions of godly men, I consider his comments to be ordinary. The Psalms are the expressions and feelings of godly men. I was helped by this crucial word because it opened up the book of Psalms to me.</p>
<p>In the Life-study Training on the Psalms in 1956, I strongly disagreed with one of Darby&rsquo;s interpretations. Darby said that Christ is the One who meditates on the law of Jehovah day and night, but I cannot agree with this interpretation. Psalm 1 is the speaking of a godly person who has the law as his background. In Psalm 2 there is another person who lives before God and who, through the Spirit of God, speaks something that is contrary to Psalm 1. Instead of regarding the law, this person exalts the Son of God. I did not agree with Darby&rsquo;s view regarding Psalm 1, but I agree with Darby&rsquo;s statement that the Psalms are the expressions and feelings of godly men. The contents of these expressions, however, require much discernment.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should limit our use of reference books to the ways that we have described. We should not accept everything indiscriminately. There will be problems if we rely excessively on reference books. Even the book <em>The Spirit of Christ</em> by Andrew Murray will be dead letters if we merely quote it. The words that we speak must pass through God and must be in God.</p>
<p>The light that others receive can inspire us, and we can be helped with the meaning of words and with our utterance, but we must never take what others say as ours. What we speak must pass through God and must be in God. The usefulness of reference books depends upon how we use them. If we do not know how to properly use them, we will be led into a forest filled with trees of the knowledge of good and evil. We may feel that the trees are good, but the fruit that they bear is called knowledge. If we are controlled by the vision of Genesis 2 and know how to properly use reference books, we will realize that most reference books are trees of knowledge that are full of all kinds of opinions.</p>
<p>In summary, we need to learn how to use reference books. These books can give us good impressions. In addition, before we give a message, we may fellowship with a young brother who seemingly speaks nonsense. But our utterance is improved by the fellowship. We should never blindly receive what others write; otherwise, we will be led into a forest of trees of the knowledge of good and evil. We can use the books for reference, but we should not quote them blindly.</p>
<p>Most of the expositions of the Bible that were written over the past two thousand years have not been much help to us. They were merely references. Most books on exposition are related to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Few books are related to the tree of life. Besides Darby, F. W. Grant was a great expositor of the Bible among the Brethren. But many of the expositions in his book <em>The Numerical Bible</em> are on the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; they focus on knowledge, not life. This does not mean that his expositions are useless. Whether a reference book is beneficial depends on how it is used. Reference books should be used as a source of reference. We should not quote them in their entirety; otherwise, the issue will not be life. We have to grasp this principle. The words that we speak must be spirit and life. If we keep this principle, we can use reference books.</p>
<p>Some brothers like to use Bible handbooks, which give information related to history or geography, but they are not of much value. What we can give the brothers and sisters from these books is worse than the carob pods that the prodigal son in Luke 15 ate; it is useless. Some brothers say that since we do not know the background of the Bible, we can use a Bible handbook to learn, for example, where the book of Ephesians was written, where the city of Ephesus was located, and what its population was. This information is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. When we eat of this tree, our eyes are opened, but we do not touch God. There is no loss if we do not know this information. On the contrary, if we know these things, we will suffer loss, because when we speak on the book of Ephesians, we will tell people only about the size of the city of Ephesus and how large its population was. What is the benefit of having such information? If we needed to know these things, God would have written about them in His Word. Since He did not write about them, why do we need to spend time on them?</p>
<p>It is possible not to know where the book of Ephesians was written but still supply the saints. We can say that according to the riches of His glory, God is strengthening the saints through His Spirit into their inner man that Christ may make His home in their hearts that they may be filled unto all the fullness of God (3:16-19). Even if what we say seems a little confusing, we need to transfuse Christ into the saints. We can say that Christ wants to make His home in our hearts through faith so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God and even become the fullness of God. We can also say that God is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us (v. 20). This is what we need to say to the saints when we speak on the book of Ephesians. There is no need to speak about the size of the city, its population, or who the governor was. In my youth I also liked to read Bible handbooks; however, one day I threw them away. There is more than enough of value in the Word of God than we can understand.</p>
<p>The word that we minister must not be knowledge, doctrine, or even explanation. It must be the utterance of God. If we keep this principle, we can use numerous reference books.</p>
<p>I never saw anyone use reference books as much as Brother Nee. Before Brother Nee spoke on the Gospel of Matthew, he consulted almost all the commentaries on Matthew. However, he never gave a message that came from a book. He often said that there was nothing in the reference books. Everything depends on whether we know how to use these books. For example, a young brother may not give a clear word concerning prayer, but what he says can draw out words from within us. Then when we speak, we are able to use the words of the brother and minister a clear word concerning prayer. We use what the brother said as reference material. If we use everything in a reference book, what we minister will not pass through God.</p>
<p>The brothers who minister the word must speak a word that is spirit and life, has passed through God, and is in God. We must keep this basic principle in the ministry of the word.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">SEVERAL MATTERS REQUIRING ATTENTION<br />
IN THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIC PRINCIPLE IN THE SERVICE OF THE WORD<br />
BEING TO MINISTER GOD</h2>
<p>Those who serve in the ministry of the word need to supply the saints with God. Moreover, their words should be spirit and life and should pass through God and should have the experience in God. We must understand this basic matter in the ministry of the word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOLDING THE CENTRAL LINE<br />
REVEALED IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Since we minister the word to supply the saints, we must always hold the central line revealed in the Bible, which is God as life to man. No matter how many messages we give, how logical our messages are, or how many topics we cover, we should always focus on God as life. Regardless of how we preach the word, we should always take this as the center. Therefore, we need a clear vision of God being our life. We need to see how God becomes our life. We need to see how God the Son became flesh, died, resurrected, and brought all that He had obtained and attained into the Spirit to be man&rsquo;s life. Furthermore, God is now working in man to make man His counterpart, His dwelling place, His Body, as a vessel to express His glory.</p>
<p>If we lack the vision of the central line revealed in the Bible, our messages are winds of teaching. In other words, no matter how logical and eloquent our speaking may be, without this vision our message is a wind of teaching and belongs to the tree of knowledge. It will harm the saints and not benefit the church. Throughout the history of Christianity countless believers have been harmed and misdirected by winds of teaching. Most of what is preached in Christianity is harmful to people because it has delayed God. What the church needs the most is to echo the words of Peter, when he said, &ldquo;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life&rdquo; (John 6:68). When the Lord said to His disciples that His words are spirit and life (v. 63), many disciples left Him and no longer walked with Him. The Lord then asked the twelve disciples, &ldquo;Do you also want to go away?&rdquo; (v. 67). Peter rarely spoke sensibly when the Lord Jesus was living on the earth. However, this time he spoke clearly, and he said that the Lord had the words of eternal life. The church needs the words of eternal life, not any other kind of words.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Taking Life as the Center and<br />
the Controlling Factor</h2>
<p>The sixty-six books of the Bible include many teachings. Many things are spoken of in the Bible, including heaven and earth, God and man, males and females, masters and slaves, the garden of Eden and the New Jerusalem, the old testament and the new testament, and eternity past and eternity future. The Bible spans a period of over seven dispensations. Many things are recorded in the Bible. There is not another book that covers as many topics as the Bible. It was written by more than forty authors in over sixteen hundred years, that is, nearly two thousand years. The Bible is truly an all-inclusive book. However, we must see the vision of the New Jerusalem. We need to see that God and the Lamb are seated on a throne in the New Jerusalem. We also need to see the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne and the tree of life growing on both sides of the river (Rev. 22:1-2). Everything in the Bible focuses on this vision and is developed for this vision. God rules in His life; He rules by being man&rsquo;s life. This is the controlling factor.</p>
<p>Some may say that the saints need to be well-behaved, but this is only a result. It is not a source. We must show the saints that God needs to be our life in order for us to be proper. We may even speak about husbands loving their wives and about wives obeying their husbands, but if our speaking does not clearly present God as man&rsquo;s life, our exhortation belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. It will not bear the fruit of the tree of life. We may also speak about serving in coordination. However, if we do not help others see that serving in coordination is the result of God being man&rsquo;s life, our teaching belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. There are only two trees in the universe, and we are either on one tree or the other tree. Anything that is not the issue of God being our life is man-made and belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>It is easy for believers to speak about the portions in Ephesians concerning human conduct, because it is easy to understand these portions. However, before speaking about human conduct, Paul says that we are in Christ (1:7), that Christ is in us (3:17), and that we are to be filled unto all the fullness of God (v. 19). He also says that the power of God operates in us (v. 20) and that we should walk worthily of the calling with which we were called (4:1). We need a deeper realization that God is in us and that He has called us to enjoy Him. God is for our enjoyment. This is the purpose of His calling us. God wants us to enjoy Him so that we would match Him.</p>
<p>God is in us; therefore, we should walk worthily of God. We should match Him. God lives in us, but a husband who mistreats his wife does not match God, who lives in him. Since God is in us as grace, our walk should be worthy of Him. In other words, we should let God live out of us. John 15:5 says, &ldquo;He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit.&rdquo; The love with which we love our wife should be the issue of Christ living in us. The fruit of our walk needs to be worthy of God, who indwells us. Our walk must match God. However, our understanding of Ephesians is that God is good to us, but if we are not proper in our walk, we will not be worthy of His calling. This understanding is according to the natural concept. The proper understanding is that since we are called by God and God indwells us, we should enjoy God so that we may match Him in our walk.</p>
<p>We know that God&rsquo;s calling is related to His being in us, because Ephesians 4 begins with the word <em>therefore.</em> This continues the thought of what is said in chapter 3. We need to walk worthily of the calling with which we were called, because Christ is making His home in our hearts through faith that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God. This means that because the God of fullness indwells us and operates in us, our walk should match Him. He operates in us so that we may love our wife. In this way we match Him. Our living is the working out of the inner operating God.</p>
<p>In addition to our walk, all our activities, our work, such as our service in coordination and our preaching the gospel, are the working out of the inner operating God. Our activities are the fruit of God being our life and living in us. God as our life is the unique subject and center of our messages. If we depart from this center, we have no way to speak. Every message we give that is apart from this center belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>It is difficult for some brothers and sisters to change their concept. Previously we said that prophets preach the tree of life and call people to enjoy God. Then a brother said that prophets also exhort people to leave evil and cling to good, that is, to do good instead of evil. We need to discern the source and the inward content of doing good. For example, what is the difference between a disciple of Confucius honoring his parents and a Christian honoring his parents? If we do not know the difference, we are not qualified to minister the word. The honor that a disciple of Confucius gives to his parents belongs to the good aspect of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, but the proper honor that a Christian gives his parents is Christ. The prophets do not want people to do the good that belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Ephesians 2:10 says, &ldquo;We are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them.&rdquo; This verse shows that God has prepared good works for us to walk in. But there are two different sources of good works. When we are the source, the good works come from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. However, when God, who lives in man as his life, is the source, the good works within man come from the tree of life. Some believers are naturally zealous. Such zeal is from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Some believers are zealous, because God operates within them. This zeal is from the tree of life.</p><h2 class="head2">Taking Heed to the Help That We Receive<br />
and the Words That We Preach</h2>
<p>The brothers who minister the word need to see that the word as the utterance of God is spirit and life and that God enters into man to be man&rsquo;s life. The messages that we preach have to be controlled by this vision. We should not give messages that draw out people&rsquo;s curiosity. We should also consider the kind of help that we receive from reference books. Do they help us give messages along the line of God being life to man? Or do they merely help us give messages on how to improve our outward behavior? If our messages only sustain the second kind of help, we should reject them because they are from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, not the tree of life.</p>
<p>In the Gospels a Canaanite woman asked the Lord for the crumbs that fell from the table (Matt. 15:21-28; Mark 7:24-30). A book that was based on the Canaanite woman said that the Lord Jesus and His salvation are not only for the Jews but also for the Gentiles and that Jesus cared for the Canaanite woman even though He is the Son of David. This book included references to verses in the Old Testament that speak of the Gentiles and verses from the New Testament that speak of the salvation of the Gentiles. The author gave a logical presentation to prove that the Lord Jesus is the Savior not only of the Jews but also of the Gentiles. He used the story concerning the Canaanite woman to develop a great truth in the Bible. A message that merely repeats everything from this book, however, is from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. It will not have the controlling factor of the tree of life.</p>
<p>What type of response does this book produce in us? We should never think that simply because a message refers to content in the Bible that it is related to life. Some brothers respond to whatever they read, even if it belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. We have to respond in a discerning way.</p>
<p>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil indicates that good and evil cannot be separated from knowledge. What we minister must be controlled by a vision of the tree of life. A message that does not have this vision is in the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If we have a vision of the tree of life, we will know that the focal point of the incident with the Canaanite woman is related to the Lord as the bread of life for man to eat and have life. It is not about His caring for the Gentiles. The book I previously spoke of said that the Lord Jesus as the Son of David had become the light of the Gentiles. It also explained from the Old Testament and the New Testament that the Lord is the Savior of the Jews and the Gentiles. However, it did not say that He is bread for us to take in as our life.</p>
<p>The brothers who minister the word must be able to discern. We may have the desire to feed the saints, but if our messages lack life, they will poison the saints. According to my observation many of the brothers&rsquo; preaching is similar to the situation described in 2 Kings 4. There was a famine in the land and no food was available. An attendant of the prophet Elisha went out into the field to gather herbs, and he found a wild vine and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and he cut them up into the pot of stew. The disciples of the prophet ate and were poisoned (vv. 38-40). I am always concerned that when we are short of messages of life and the brothers and sisters are hungry, some &ldquo;attendants of the prophet&rdquo; will go out and find some &ldquo;wild gourds.&rdquo; These wild gourds do not necessarily look dangerous. There is nothing seemingly wrong with a message about the Lord Jesus being the Savior of the Jews and the Gentiles, but it can be compared to the wild gourds in 2 Kings 4:38-40. It does not give life. The story of the Canaanite woman does not focus on the Lord being the Savior of the Jews or the Savior of the Gentiles. People called the Lord the Son of David, but He said that He is the children&rsquo;s bread (Matt. 15:26). He did not come to be a king. He wants to be man&rsquo;s food; He wants to enter into man in order to be man&rsquo;s salvation. The purpose of the incident with the Canaanite woman is to reveal that the Lord is the bread of life.</p>
<p>I once gave a message during the Sino-Japanese War based on the Canaanite woman. I said that the woman received grace because she took the position of a dog to eat the crumbs that fell from the table. The saints were touched and saw that they should take the position of a dog. Looking back on that message, I must condemn myself. The Lord did not want me to speak concerning taking the position of a dog but to speak concerning His being bread. That message did not give the saints the divine life.</p>
<p>I could speak such a word twenty years ago because I did not have this vision. Many saints responded to that message and understood the matter of being in the position of a dog. The Canaanite woman stood on the Lord&rsquo;s word concerning being a dog; therefore, the Lord had to save her and heal her daughter. He was bound by His word. However, in that portion the Lord Jesus revealed that He is bread for us to eat. A message based on the Canaanite woman should focus on the Lord as bread. This is the word of life that will supply the saints. The brothers who minister the word must learn to discern whether a message or a book is from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil or whether it is from the tree of life. Then we will not give the saints wild gourds to eat.</p>
<p>Some may feel that they are unique in their expounding of the Bible, that their way of expounding cannot even be found in our books. However, this new speaking will be harmful to the saints because it does not have life. Every message must be God and focus on God as man&rsquo;s life. Every message should be controlled and measured by this principle. Someone may use Romans 12:11 to give a message about being fervent for the Lord. However, Romans 12 is the issue of the preceding eleven chapters. In 7:18 Paul said, &ldquo;To will is present with me, but to work out the good is not.&rdquo; This shows that it is of no use to exhort the saints to be fervent, because we cannot determine to be fervent. Chapter 8 shows the Spirit of life in verse 2, and it says that those who are &ldquo;led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God&rdquo; (v. 14). This is a matter of being led by the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot say that the saints need to be fervent based only on Romans 12. This is based on the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The tree of life must be our controlling factor, whether we speak concerning prayer, our daily walk, or working zealously for the Lord. We must speak from the tree of life and say that God enters into us to be our life. This is the way to minister the word. Anything that is not out of life is from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. We need to see this controlling factor.</p>
<p>The only thing that matters in the universe is that God wants to be man&rsquo;s food. This is the source of everything in our Christian life. All our activities are the result of this. God is in us to be our food and our life. We must see this vision.</p>
<p>We often say that God is life and that He enters into us to be our life. However, because we do not see this vision, we do not speak concerning this in our messages, nor do we help the saints to see this. Those who minister the word must see that the church needs the supply of life, words of life, not the interpretation of doctrines. The ministry of the word is to supply the saints with God as the Spirit of life. The word that is spoken must be spirit and life. This causes the saints to touch God. This is the urgent need in the churches today. The churches are weak because there is a lack in the word of life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MINISTERS OF THE WORD<br />
REPRESENTING GOD</h2>
<p>Those who minister the word represent God. This concerns our person. We must be persons who speak for God as His representatives. Since we are God&rsquo;s representatives, we cannot speak our own words. We should be persons who also contact God and fellowship with Him continually. We should not give a message if we cannot touch God and fellowship with Him. When we give a message, we should fellowship with God. When our condition does not match what we speak, we are not speaking for God. What we speak should minister God; otherwise, we are not speaking for God, and our words are vain and empty.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MESSAGES NOT DEPENDING<br />
ON THE SUBJECT BEING SIMPLE OR DEEP,<br />
NEW OR OLD, BUT ON BEING LIVING</h2>
<p>The messages that we give should not depend on whether the subject is simple or deep. A message that is deep may not necessarily be good. We may consider that we would speak on something that is deep, because others have spoken on regeneration already. This concept needs to be dropped. We can give a simple message on regeneration even if others speak about abiding in the Lord or about regeneration in a deep way. It does not matter whether a message is simple or deep; neither does it matter whether it is new or old. We should have a willingness to speak on the same subject. It may be that a brother spoke on regeneration last week, another brother may speak on regeneration this week, and still another brother may speak on regeneration next week. We may speak on regeneration for several weeks. The more we speak on regeneration, the more the saints will be supplied. We should not be afraid to repeat topics. We do not have to always be looking for new topics. If we are always looking for some new topics, we will be speaking on many strange topics.</p>
<p>Our only concern should be that a message is living, not whether it is simple, deep, new, or old. We can speak the same message in many different ways. If the brothers who minister the word in the church in Taipei give fifty living messages concerning regeneration, the church in Taipei will be enlivened. We should speak messages that are living, not messages that are deep, new, or strange. In order to speak a living message, we must not be at ease and rely on our mind too much. If we want to speak a living message, our spirit must be fresh and living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT STRESSING LOGIC</h2>
<p>Furthermore, instead of stressing logic, we should focus on whether the saints can touch God and life and whether the message is living. Not many people focus on the logic of a message in a meeting. Some saints are not even clear concerning the topic of a message, but they remember what touches them. Hence, we should not focus on presenting a message in a logical way. The Scriptures were written by men who were borne by the Holy Spirit. While the Bible is not illogical, it is not rigidly logical. Nevertheless, the Bible has its logic.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING BIBLE EXPOSITION AND<br />
THINGS OF KNOWLEDGE</h2>
<p>The brothers who minister the word should not quote from too many sources, because this does not help the saints. Quoting from many sources inevitably leads to messages that merely contain knowledge in a way of Bible exposition. We should try to avoid this. An exposition of the Bible should give life. If it does not give life, we should not use it. Whether we give a message in an edification meeting, in a Bible-study meeting, or for fellowship, we should try our best to avoid bringing in too many things. We should not think that it is useful to quote many sources. If we expound the Word, we should do so according to life to meet the need in the meeting. This can be likened to a fruit tree, which has branches, leaves, and fruit. The edible part of a tree is the fruit. The function of the other parts of the tree is to produce the fruit.</p>
<p>There are many words recorded in the Bible, but some of them are branches and leaves that support the things which supply us. They are not the fruit. We cannot eliminate these words, because without them the central words will not survive. This can be compared to cutting off the leaves and branches from a tree but still expecting the tree to grow fruit. The words that are the branches and leaves support the fruit which supplies life. We should not give the saints &ldquo;branches and leaves&rdquo; to eat. Some brothers quote too many sources when they give a message. We must check and be sure that what we quote gives life to the saints. We should not give messages that stir up the saints&rsquo; curiosity; rather, we should supply life. The food prepared in a kitchen is to supply people with nutrients. We do not give people branches to eat. It is not a matter of whether something is from the Bible but whether it supplies life. It is useless to give the saints something that is in the Bible if it does not supply life.</p>
<p>It may be difficult for us to receive this word. However, according to my observation, the brothers who minister the word quote too many sources when they give a message. This often causes the saints to only debate about the Bible. Over the years saints have come to me with many questions concerning Bible exposition, but I never answered their questions. I rarely answer questions after I give a message, because most questions lead to debates. The brothers should learn to eat only the fruit, not the branches and leaves.</p>
<p>We need to be delivered from debates. Thus, in order to avoid debates, we should not bring distracting things to the saints. The more distracting things that we bring in, the more debates there will be. We should give only one kind of message, which is a word of life. We should receive only the things that supply us with life from the Word of God. Expositions and word studies should be on our desk, not on the dining table. What we present from the podium must supply life.</p>
<p>Some of the brothers may be offended by this word. As your brother, I must admonish you. If we do not receive this fellowship, we will reap the fruit of our labor in the future. Whatever a person sows, this he will also reap (Gal. 6:7). If we give the brothers and sisters life, we will enjoy the fruit of our labor. It is a small thing for us to suffer, but it is a great matter for the church to suffer loss. May the Lord have mercy on us and cause us to take heed to this matter. May we know only that God in His Son through the Holy Spirit is our life, and may we speak only this word.</p>
<p>We do not want anything other than this word. Just as fish bones are to support the fish and are not for us to eat, some words in the Bible support the words that give life. These words were needed to write the Bible, but we do not eat these words, nor do we give them to the saints to eat. We give the saints only the words that give life. We are foolish to give the saints bones to eat. We should give them meat. We should give the saints only food to eat; otherwise, what we give them will harm them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>The ministry of the word is to minister words that are spirit and life and that cause the saints to touch God. These words focus on God as man&rsquo;s life. Therefore, we must learn to contact God and fellowship with Him so that our words are God&rsquo;s utterance, and we represent God. When we give a message, we should not look for deep, new, or strange material. A message should be living. It does not matter whether the content is deep, simple, old, or new. When we speak, we must follow the inspiration of the Spirit and not care about being logical. We should follow the impression in our spirit and not care about being thorough or complete. Logic does not give people life. The Spirit enlivens people and gives them life. The brothers who minister the word truly need to look to the Lord, because this is a great lack among us.</p>
<p>Many problems among us cannot be solved at this time, because we are short of the words of life. May the Lord have mercy on us, and may we know only to give messages concerning the Triune God as our life. May we continually learn, experience, and grow in this so that we supply the saints with words of wisdom. We may speak on many topics but give only one message. Then the church will be glorious.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">IMPRESSIONS AFTER VISITING CHRISTIANS<br />
IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>During the past few months the Lord led me to visit Japan, the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and several places in Southeast Asia. After this trip to America and Europe, I spent time before the Lord to consider the situation in those places. I feel that I should fellowship with the brothers and sisters about the situation in the different places and my personal impressions.</p>
<p>During the trip I was surprised to see that Christians highly regard any group of believers who meet in a way that is similar to the way we meet. Whether the group is large or small, strong or weak, it is highly regarded, and it often has good meetings. This surprised me, and I feel that believers think too highly of us.</p>
<p>The churches in Taiwan have an extraordinary reputation. The regard that the Christians abroad have for the churches in Taiwan may even be too high. Whether or not a saint from Taiwan has spiritual weight, the local believers regard him as a spiritual giant. A brother may not even be in the meetings in Taiwan, but if he goes overseas and says that he is from Taiwan, the local saints will hand everything in their meetings over to him. He then has to take the lead and minister the word to supply the saints. This situation has revived and uplifted some brothers who did not meet regularly when they were in Taiwan. Even if the brother says that he does not know what to do and that he cannot speak, the local saints are satisfied if he gives a report concerning what he has seen and heard in Taiwan. These two points indicate that the esteem for us is too high and inaccurate.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VISIT TO JAPAN</h2>
<p>Our first stop was in Japan. We spent most of our time preaching the gospel in Tokyo, and we spent a few days in Osaka. We were in Japan for two weeks. There are over thirty saints in the bread-breaking meeting in Tokyo, and there are one and a half households in Osaka. During this trip my impression of Japan changed. In the past I considered that it is difficult for the Japanese people to receive the gospel and that it is not easy to lead them spiritually. Such an impression was not founded. While I was there, I contacted several people and saw that my previous impression was inaccurate.</p>
<p>It was easy for us to preach the gospel in Japan, and it was easy for people to be saved. Since the Japanese people have good character, once they receive the Lord, they diligently study the truth and are willing to pay a price to know the truth. This makes it easy for them to love the Lord. When our brothers went to Japan, they did not have gospel preaching meetings or give messages. They only contacted the Japanese people directly and led several of them to salvation. The ones whom they contacted had never heard of the gospel or the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. One brother has a university education, and we conversed with him in English. He is not satisfied with merely being saved; he has a heart for the Lord and a desire to pursue the Lord. Besides him, there were other believers in various places. Two of the saints in Tokyo are Japanese.</p>
<p>In matters related to science the Japanese people are inclined to follow the West, but in matters related to religion they are inclined toward the Chinese people. Consequently, it is easier for a Chinese brother to preach the gospel and labor for the Lord in Japan than it is for a Western missionary, because of the similarity between the Chinese and the Japanese dispositions and daily habits. Many Chinese people develop intimate relationships with their Japanese friends. Therefore, Japan is a vast field for the gospel. We do not need many saints to go there. If five or six workers go to Japan and labor with the saints who are already there, we should be able to gain many people rather quickly.</p>
<p>It is even worthwhile to labor with the ten thousand Chinese people in Tokyo. The brothers can labor in the Chinese communities. It would be easy to spread the gospel from the Chinese communities to the Japanese people. It is difficult to preach the gospel directly to the Japanese, because they value friendship. But it would be easy to reach them through their friends, that is, through the Chinese people residing in Japan.</p>
<p>The brothers in Japan desire fellowship. They hope that brothers will go to Tokyo to labor for the Lord. They are willing to prepare everything, including the necessary paperwork. They are willing to receive workers, and they hope that some will migrate for the sake of the work. I agree with their feeling, and I hope that when we fellowship about this matter in the next workers&rsquo; gathering, some brothers and sisters will be burdened to go to Tokyo for the Lord&rsquo;s work. I believe that immigration procedures will not be a problem, that the Lord will confirm this matter, and that everything will be arranged in a good way. The brothers and sisters should pray concerning this matter. Our work is not for our personal interest or for our own meeting but for the Lord&rsquo;s interest on the earth. Our work is for His gospel and His kingdom.</p><h2 class="head1">THE VISIT TO AMERICA</h2>
<p>After leaving Japan, we went directly to America, and stopped briefly in Honolulu. When we arrived on the West Coast, we visited San Francisco. Most of the meetings in America that are similar to ours do not have a large congregation. The largest group, which is in New York City, has about eighty or ninety saints. The second largest group is probably in San Francisco. There may have been two other groups of about the same size&mdash;one in the south, and the other in the north. These groups have thirty to forty believers. The group in the north and the group in the south consist of mostly Caucasian saints, and the group in San Francisco has only Chinese saints who are mainly from Taiwan, particularly from Taipei. The core of the group in San Francisco is mainly made up of students who study at the University of California. There is much work to be done there. They need workers who can work with the Chinese-speaking people and then spread the work.</p>
<p>After San Francisco we went to Los Angeles. The meeting in Los Angeles is probably larger than the one in San Francisco. When they first began to meet, two Chinese brothers took care of the meeting. Now a brother from London labors there. There are only a few Chinese brothers and sisters in this group; most of the saints are Caucasian. Afterward, we went to the southwest corner of America.</p>
<p>We then visited the Northwest and learned that there is a group of Chinese brothers who meet on a university campus. An American brother is taking the lead in that group, and they have a few American students. This group is doing well, but they do not have a formal meeting.</p>
<p>From there we visited several places, including Chicago and Detroit. We also went to Pittsburgh and met two families there. One family came from Hong Kong, and the other, from Shanghai. These two families meet together every Lord&rsquo;s Day and listen to a message that was given either in Hong Kong or New York City. We spent a short time with them. Their condition is good, and they are learning to live before the Lord.</p>
<p>The meeting in New York City has a history of at least twenty-five years. However, their meetings are not stable and even stopped for a period of time. About half the saints who meet regularly are Chinese, and the other half are Caucasian. During the period when their meetings stopped, the Chinese saints continued to meet because they had a Chinese-speaking meeting. Before our visit, the Chinese and Caucasian saints met together only to pray and listen to a message. They did not break bread together. After our visit they began to have the Lord&rsquo;s table together. Now their meetings are lively and strong. However, there are only eighty to ninety saints meeting in a city as large as New York.</p>
<p>A large portion of our trip was spent in America, specifically in New York City. We stayed there for a longer time because I had some personal things to take care of, and my wife needed medical attention. We also visited the capital of America, Washington, D.C., where there is a small meeting that is stable. One brother in this meeting is originally from Shanghai; he and his wife migrated to Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>During this visit my view concerning the situation in America changed. In the past I considered Americans to be materialistic because they pay too much attention to material things and worldly enjoyment but are indifferent to religious things. However, the few people whom I contacted gave me a different impression. According to my observation there is much work to do in America, and our work would be effective.</p>
<p>Compared to Japan, which is a Buddhist country, America is a genuine Christian country. Before the Korean War less than half of the American population attended Sunday service. In other words, out of every one hundred Christians less than fifty regularly attended a Sunday service. However, because the Americans suffered many casualties in the Korean War, they were stirred up to attend Sunday service in search of consolation and peace. Since that time onward, the number of Americans who attend Sunday service has increased to more than sixty percent of the population.</p>
<p>Most of the Christian groups in America preach an orthodox gospel. There is an increasing number of modernists, but there are still more orthodox groups. Over the past ten years, especially after the truce in Korea, several evangelists have emerged from the Assembly of God. Because they work in a way that is according to the common sentiment of the American people, some of them have congregations of over ten thousand people. While I was in New York City, a group called Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses held a gathering, and about thirteen to fifteen thousand people attended. This group has increased because their work fits in with the way of the Americans.</p>
<p>Even though people are being saved, on the spiritual side there is a lack of spiritual depth among Christian groups in America. There is a group in New York City that was started by A. B. Simpson, who founded the Christian and Missionary Alliance. That group teaches the believers&rsquo; co-crucifixion with Christ. Mrs. Penn-Lewis also taught this. Many believers regard this teaching to be the deepest among Christians in America. The messages that we gave in New York focused on how God came in the Son to be man&rsquo;s life. After more than ten meetings an older sister, who labored in China and met with us, came to me and said that no one in America speaks about taking Christ as life. This comment shows the situation in America. The orthodox gospel is preached in America, but there is not much depth.</p>
<p>It is not easy to find a group of believers who teach the orthodox truth and also have spiritual depth. We have to admit that there is a need for the Lord&rsquo;s work in America. Hence, America is also a large field for the work.</p>
<p>Our impression of America is that as long as what we have is genuine and good, the Americans will receive it, and the result will be rich and solid. The brothers in San Francisco and the church in New York City want us to help them. It would be good if some of the saints or some workers would be burdened to migrate there to meet this need. Some of the saints may be concerned about the language, but this is not a great problem. The saints who go can focus their labor among the Chinese people, and after three to five years the language issue will be resolved.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE SITUATION IN SOUTH AMERICA</h2>
<p>I initially planned to visit South America, but because of time constraints I was not able to go there. Even though I did not go to South America, I received information concerning the situation there. The saints in South America want some saints to migrate there. If any of the workers have a burden, there is a need.</p>
<p>There is a need for some workers to go to Brazil and live in S&#227;o Paolo to propagate the Lord&rsquo;s work. A report in <em>Church News</em> says that one of the brothers there has a meeting in his home, and about thirty or forty Christians from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Manila have attended this meeting. They do not have a meeting that is only for the overseas Chinese. A worker or a strong brother who moves there and begins a meeting will meet the need. The gospel can then gradually spread from the overseas Chinese saints to the Brazilians.</p>
<p>In Brazil there is freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of press. Even though many countries in South America are Catholic, they cooperate with Protestant countries who send missionaries to them. The strongest Protestant meeting in Brazil has a large gathering and is led by Westerners, not Brazilians. Therefore, Brazil is a large field for the Lord&rsquo;s work. Some of the Chinese there are from Taiwan and Hong Kong. If we labor among them, we can spread the work even to the Japanese people. There are seven to eight hundred thousand Japanese immigrants there, and their number is increasing by thirty to forty thousand every year. The Japanese people in Brazil are also a good field.</p>
<p>We stayed in America until the end of July and left there on July 31.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VISIT TO EUROPE</h2>
<p>We arrived in London on August 1 and immediately held a conference. After the conference we went to Denmark for another conference.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Special Work by the Holy Spirit in Denmark</h2>
<p>Every summer there is a conference in Denmark with an attendance of seven hundred to a thousand believers. This year the attendance was higher. Most of the believers who attended are from state churches. However, a number of them are under the leading of a Western brother and have had a solid spiritual background. They do not hold the concept of a state church.</p>
<p>About forty believers who were in the congregation are more enlightened. They came from Norway, Sweden, and other countries. Because the believers were from many countries, the messages were translated into Danish on the podium and then translated into English and German in the audience. There were three meetings a day in the conference: in the morning, afternoon, and evening. However, due to the work of the Holy Spirit, all the saints focused on the meetings in the afternoon. The meetings in the morning and evening were mainly miscellaneous fellowships. The meetings in the afternoon emphasized God in Christ as life for the building of His house, His temple, and the Body of Christ. These messages stressed life and the building up of the church. These two points had an impact on the saints and stirred them up.</p>
<p>During the conference all the fellowship was on how to enjoy Christ as life and how to build up the church in every place, and most of the questions were concerning the church. This was the work of the Holy Spirit. The saints wanted to know what they should do after the conference and where they should meet. Instead of saying what they should do, I advised them to pray and follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading, just as Abraham left Ur of the Chaldeans and went to the place that the Lord called him to.</p>
<p>After the conference the leading brothers requested that we stay for two more days to fellowship with several leading brothers and sisters. That time of fellowship was a crucial turning point, and we saw a special work of the Holy Spirit. There were no debates. All the fellowship was about the practical way to go on. The Holy Spirit was working in many of the saints before the conference; therefore, after we arrived, they spoke about only the practice. We shared our experience with them, and they treasured every point. The saints had never heard what we fellowshipped and fully accepted what we said. After that, we returned to Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark.</p>
<p>In Copenhagen the leading brothers requested that we spend one evening to fellowship with some brothers who desire to pursue the Lord and another evening to fellowship with the young saints. There were close to two hundred young saints who truly pursue the Lord. The brothers requested that I speak to the young saints concerning how to coordinate in service. The young saints do not have their own meeting, but they want to begin a meeting, and they also want to learn to coordinate in service. My fellowship with them covered many aspects of how to coordinate and serve together.</p>
<p>Shortly after we left, the saints in Copenhagen began to meet in twenty-one homes. I heard that they have a good situation. Many of them love the Lord and are good material with much potential. Most of the saints are middle-aged. There are not many older saints.</p>
<p>We stayed in Denmark for about ten days and saw that there is much work to do there. Their situation exceeded our expectation. This proves that the Holy Spirit began His work long before we arrived. This does not apply only to Denmark. The Lord&rsquo;s work can be seen in all of Scandinavia, including Norway and Sweden. We met many promising brothers who requested that we send them <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> so that they can translate it into their language. If time permits, we will visit them again, because there is much work to do there.</p>
<p>Two brothers from Norway came to meet us, and we had good fellowship with them. The impression I have from the trip to Denmark is that all the places in Scandinavia need to be led to know Christ as life so that God&rsquo;s house can be built up in every locality. The Scandinavian countries have state churches that are formal and dead. Hence, many people become &ldquo;homeless&rdquo; once they believe into Christ. There is a need for them to know life so that God&rsquo;s house can be established in every locality.</p>
<p>After our fellowship in Denmark, we returned to London and stayed there for ten days. We had good fellowship in London also. The brothers and sisters felt that the messages met their need. There is much that can come out of the situation there.</p><h2 class="head2">The Visit to Rome</h2>
<p>Most of our time in Europe, about four weeks, was spent in England. After England we went to several places in Europe, including Rome. In Rome we visited several archeological sites. We saw the places where Christians were martyred and some underground caves where Christians held meetings. We also visited several Catholic cathedrals, as well as St. Peter&rsquo;s Basilica. We were not actually interested in the cathedrals. We preferred the places where the believers sacrificed themselves because of their love for the Lord. The places where the martyrs fought with wild beasts still exist. These sites are now used to promote Christianity.</p>
<p>Everything that Catholicism embraces and promotes belongs to the physical realm and is therefore superstitious. For example, there is a statue of Peter in a cathedral that tourists and Catholics from South America and even South Africa pay tribute to. People are eager to touch and even kiss the foot of the statue. As a result, two toes on the statue have almost disappeared. Many people go to kiss and touch this statue. This is a superstitious practice.</p>
<p>From Rome we went to the northwest part of Greece that has rich soil and pleasant scenery. We were told that Paul preached the gospel there. Since the city of Corinth was close by and we have read the Epistles to the Corinthians, we stopped for a brief visit. After Greece we went to the Middle East.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VISIT TO ISRAEL</h2>
<p>Our aim in going to Israel was to see the city of Jerusalem. The old city of Jerusalem is in the hands of the Jordanians. The Israelis live close to the old city, which is near the center of Jerusalem. Even though there is only a short distance between these two parts of the city, the Israelis and the Jordanians are enemies and do not communicate with each other. The United Nations finds it hard to reconcile the two nations; at best, the United Nations can only restrict them from taking action against one another.</p>
<p>We visited most of the places recorded in the Bible, such as the Mount of Olives, Mount Zion (which is Mount Moriah), the Garden of Gethsemane (where the Lord Jesus was betrayed), and the places where the Lord was judged and crucified. We also saw where He ascended. On the Mount of Olives there is a big rock with a footprint, which is said to be the last place the Lord Jesus stood before He ascended into heaven. Of course, this is superstition.</p>
<p>We visited the city of Shechem, and we saw Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, where the children of Israel stood to bless and to curse after they heard the law. According to the Bible the good land is a land flowing with milk and honey, but the land that we saw is desolate and barren. The area near Jerusalem is very desolate. There are no trees, grass, or even dirt; there are only large and small rocks.</p>
<p>The people in Israel are poor and live a difficult life. They are poorer than people in Asia. It seems as though the environment is attacked by the wind. The wind blows for ten months every year, and then the rain comes to wash the dirt away. As a result, not much soil is left on the ground. There is no grass or trees, because no vegetation can survive with such little soil. The more the wind blows, the less soil there is, and the more it rains, the more the dirt is washed away. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to develop anything.</p>
<p>The foundation of the Old Testament temple is on Mount Moriah. This is where Abraham offered Isaac. David also offered sacrifices on this place. The Arabs occupy Mount Moriah, and they built a Muslim holy site there. This is the second most important Muslim site. The most important site is in Mecca. The dome of the mosque on Mount Moriah is overlaid with gold. The Muslims occupy that place and will not return it to the Israelis, but the Israelis regard it as their own place of worship.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s judgment and curse need to be feared. In His wisdom God destroyed many Jewish and Christian archeological sites so that people would not worship these sites. God used the Roman general, Titus, to devastate the city of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, and He used the Persian Empire, the Arabs, and the Turks to further devastate the city. Now few archeological objects remain. From Israel we bypassed Iraq, which has the city of Babylon, and Iran, previously Persia, and arrived in Pakistan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VISIT TO SOUTHEAST ASIA</h2>
<p>From there we went to Burma and then to Bangkok, the capital of Thailand. There is a meeting in Bangkok with a regular attendance of about fifty to sixty saints. One of our brothers is serving there. We stayed in Bangkok for three days and saw how the Lord has blessed them by adding people. The church in Bangkok has about one hundred saints. We held a conference there, and on the last day of the conference the meeting hall was filled to capacity and overflowed into the courtyard. Bangkok is an area for the work. There are three million overseas Chinese in Thailand, and at least eighty thousand of them live in Bangkok. Several million people live in Bangkok. There is a need for the saints who can manage both the Suatow and the Amoy dialects to migrate there. The brothers there hope that some workers will receive a burden to labor there.</p>
<p>Other places in Southeast Asia requested that we visit them, but we were limited by time. All of these places have a need and continually ask for help. Twenty-four serving ones would not be able to meet this need.</p>
<p>On October 4 we arrived in Hong Kong and stayed there for twelve days. The brothers arranged for us to be in meetings until we boarded the plane. This is a rough sketch of our trip abroad.</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD OF BURDEN&mdash;<br />
CHRIST AS OUR LIFE AND<br />
THE BUILDING UP OF GOD&rsquo;S HOUSE</h2>
<p>In our visit to the different places we observed that believers do not know Christ as life, and they do not have the building up of God&rsquo;s house. Suppose some brothers go to Japan because of the need there. They must help people know that God in Christ desires to be man&rsquo;s life, and they must build up the house of God so that God has a dwelling place on earth and God&rsquo;s children have a home. There is such a need in Japan. When we visited Japan, we went to Tokyo, Osaka, and Kobe. These places are close to each other and conveniently located. However, the Lord&rsquo;s testimony is not in these three cities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even though the United States is a Christian country, there is a need to help people know Christ as life and to build them up as God&rsquo;s dwelling place locality by locality. This also applies to Europe. In a message I gave in Europe, I said that it is difficult to find a place in Scandinavia that resembles God&rsquo;s house. God&rsquo;s children are stirred up, but they feel as if they are homeless. Hence, the knowledge of life and the building up of the church are needed everywhere.</p>
<p>There is nothing in southern Europe, because the influence of Catholicism is very strong there. Spain, Portugal, Italy, and even France are Catholic countries. Greece is located in southern Europe, and it is spiritually and materially desolate. The entire situation in Europe is desolate. Thus, there is a great spiritual need in Europe. There is also such a need in different places in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Every place needs to know Christ as life and to have the building up of God&rsquo;s dwelling place so that the believers can have a home. There is a need for life and the church. Even though we often feel that we are weak and poor, God has bestowed His grace upon us. It is difficult to find a place that is as blessed as we are.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we know that this way is one hundred percent of the Lord, but on the other hand, it is difficult to see anything like this in church history. Furthermore, we seem to be the only believers who are taking this way. We are sure that this is of the Lord, but when we are weak, we ask whether we are wrong or if we are too much. Otherwise, why can we not find a similar situation in church history and why is there not another group to confirm this way? We seem to be the only ones who are taking this way.</p>
<p>We visited many countries on this trip and were strengthened in our inner realization. We also received a burden to see the need in every place. Japan, the United States, Scandinavia, and South America need a testimony like ours. This is the only thing that can meet the need of God&rsquo;s children today. The genuine need of God&rsquo;s children is to know Christ as life so that God can build up a house on earth among His children and so that His children can have a home.</p>
<p>Many Christians receive help from the messages that they listen to, but they do not know what their need is. We should lead them to know that Christ is our life. They also need to see that the result of Christ being our life is that God&rsquo;s house is built up for His children to have a home. Only these two things can satisfy the need of God&rsquo;s children. God&rsquo;s children in Japan, the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia confirmed this way of life. After we saw that this is the need in every place, our realization was strengthened, and we were encouraged.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE IMPORTANT MATTERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Co-workers Needing to Go Out<br />
and Work for the Lord</h2>
<p>We need a clear understanding that Christ is our life for the building up of God&rsquo;s house. At the beginning of this message I said that Christians highly regard any believers who meet the way we do. We believe that it is of the Lord that the churches in Taiwan, especially the church in Taipei, are highly regarded by other believers. If we are faithful to the Lord, He will give us a strong and definite leading and some of us will go to other places. We need to grasp this opportunity.</p>
<p>We have trained many saints. Some of the saints who are trained serve full time, and others have a job. There may be more saints who can serve full time and then go to serve in other places. Some saints can meet this need. As more saints rise up to meet this need, there will be a steady flow of saints who leave their jobs and serve full time. We cannot study indefinitely. We must have graduates. Every school must produce graduates. Similarly, it is not normal for the children in a family to not grow up. Therefore, we need to continually produce workers who can serve full time in other places.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Brothers and Sisters Needing to Emigrate</h2>
<p>In view of the overall situation, it is profitable for the brothers and sisters to consider migrating to other places. Some of them may get jobs abroad. This is an age of mobility that is not stagnant. Active people are mobile.</p>
<p>These are impressions from my trip abroad. We need saints to go out. The more the saints go out, the more the way will be opened to us. All the saints need to go out. This will profit the saint, his family, the church, and even the country. I do not want to exhort you too much. This is my fellowship in response to the request of the brothers. If ten to twenty families and a few workers migrate to Brazil, they could start meeting immediately. This would be a good testimony, and the result would be good.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Strengthening the Literature Work</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the literature work needs to be strengthened. In the past only a few saints helped in this work. The few publications that we put out are of three categories: <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> magazine, booklets such as <em>Enjoying God,</em> and <em>Church News.</em> All three categories are effective. Hence, we need to strengthen the literature work in order to propagate overseas, and we need to increase the circulation of <em>Church News.</em> The serving ones also need to put out some publications in English. This will cause our testimony to spread.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>In conclusion, there are three crucial matters. Workers need to go and labor, brothers and sisters need to migrate, and the literature work needs to be increased and spread. In order to fulfill these needs there is the need for more manpower. I believe that there will be no shortage of manpower. We should not fear a shortage of manpower, because some saints are going out. Rather, we should believe that as more saints go out, more will be added to the labor. The brothers and sisters need to pray concerning this matter. We should all go before the Lord to seek a burden. It may be that some saints will receive the burden and be sent out by the Lord and labor for Him. Other saints may be led by the Lord to migrate abroad. Still others may be burdened to give money to meet the need. The Lord will surely give us a strong confirmation since this is His leading. The direction of the Lord&rsquo;s leading over the years is not merely limited to the island of Taiwan. The Lord is preparing us for the spread of His testimony in the last days.</p>
<p>Over the years we never advertised ourselves; nevertheless, during this trip, the Lord opened many doors for us. Before we went on the trip, our consideration of the actual situation was limited. What we saw, however, exceeded our expectations.</p>
<p>The high regard Christians have for us causes us to be humble. It is unprecedented for a meeting and all the speaking to be handed over to someone else. But this was our experience in every place where we visited. This was of the Lord, and the Holy Spirit confirmed it. This fellowship is to give us an impression and to show what the Lord has done.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s work exceeds all our expectations. He has given us a broad and effective way. The brothers and sisters need to be strong and brave for the Lord&rsquo;s sake and receive His burden. Many places need our help. I do not want to initiate anything, and we do not want mere activity. This fellowship is for us to receive a burden and bring the blessings that we have received to the places that are in need.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">IMPRESSIONS AFTER VISITING CHRISTIANS<br />
IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>On the one hand, I am disappointed with the condition of Christianity that I saw during my visit abroad, but on the other hand, I have more faith in the way of the church that we are taking. I cannot fellowship concerning all my inner feelings, but I will share something as an introduction.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DISAPPOINTING CONDITION<br />
OF CHRISTIANS IN THE WEST</h2>
<p>Even though the condition in the Far East is not ideal, the condition in the West is worse. We did not fellowship with all God&rsquo;s children in the West, but in the past we contacted Christianity in the West through their publications. We also studied their history. We did not fellowship with them often, but we became familiar with them through their writings. Hence, even though we did not contact every Christian group, we feel that we have a clear understanding of the situation in the West.</p>
<p>Before this trip it did not occur to me that the situation in the West could be so poor. Before we left England, a brother asked me about my impression of Christians in America and Europe. I responded that I was disappointed. I said that because the believers who preached the gospel in the Far East came from Christian countries in the West, I had not thought that the condition in the West could be so poor.</p>
<p>I will not give all the reasons for my disappointment, because an inaccurate repetition of this fellowship can cause misunderstandings. However, I am not the only one who has this realization. The brothers whom I spoke with in the West did not say that the condition in the West is good. These brothers were not being humble, nor were they being polite. They were sincere and honest in what they said. The believers with whom I fellowshipped spoke of the poor condition in the West.</p>
<p>Nearly all the saints here asked me about the spiritual things I saw in the West. I did not touch many spiritual things during my trip. In the one place where I should have seen something spiritual, I saw a lack of harmony. There was no spiritual atmosphere. Most of the believers there, who fellowshipped with me, acknowledged that there was a lack of harmony. There was almost nothing spiritual.</p>
<p>I received some help from this trip, because it is always profitable for a person to visit other places. However, the help that I received was not on the positive side. Instead, I was greatly disappointed. I also saw that believers have an exaggerated opinion of us. The believers whom I visited received me as someone who could help them, not as someone who could receive help from them. Hence, most of the believers fellowshipped their difficulties with me, just as a patient speaks to a doctor. They did not speak of any positive situations with me.</p>
<p>I traveled from the Far East to the West and back to the Far East, and the brothers in every place that I visited fellowshipped about their problems. It may be that the believers came to us with their problems because they regard us too highly and think that we can help them solve their problems.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Confirmation of the Way<br />
of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery</h2>
<p>As I visited the different places, observed the local situations, and contacted the saints, I gained an understanding of the actual condition in each place. My observation of the condition also strengthened my faith in this way. My faith is strengthened to take the way of the recovery. The more places I visited, the more I understood that their problems and difficulties are because they do not take this way.</p>
<p>Even though the needs and problems in every place differ, the answer to these needs and problems is found in this way. If the believers could know, see, and receive this way, spontaneously their needs would be met and their problems would be solved. Therefore, what I observed strengthened my faith in this way.</p>
<p>It is difficult to find an example in church history of the way that we are taking. It is also difficult to find a person who has taken this way. According to our consideration, we discovered this way. We did not invent it; we discovered it. Hence, as we take this way, on the one hand, we feel that it is according to God&rsquo;s leading, but on the other hand, we sometimes feel that we may be too much, since there is no precedent in church history.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we feel that this way is of God and is according to His leading; on the other hand, since there is no precedent in church history, we feel that we may be peculiar. However, what we saw in the different places gives us a strong confirmation that this way is truly according to God&rsquo;s leading. The different needs and problems are the issue of a lack of vision and revelation concerning this way.</p><h2 class="head2">Building Up the House of God<br />
Being the Urgent Need</h2>
<p>Before I went on this trip, I did not expect that the urgent need in every place is the building up of the house of God. Based on this need, the messages that I gave in Hong Kong were concerning the building of God. The main point in my fellowship was that the saints must build up the house of God in every locality.</p>
<p>The saints can testify that they see the building up the local church as the house of God, and they fellowship concerning this. Many messages have been given concerning this. However, after visiting so many places, my feeling concerning the building up of the house of God is even stronger.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SITUATION IN JAPAN</h2>
<p>Our first stop was in Japan. After we arrived, I realized that Japan is a large and modern country that has a large population and many Christians; however, God&rsquo;s house is not there.</p>
<p>The three largest cities in the world have about the same population. Tokyo, New York, and London each have between eight and ten million people. If we include the suburbs, metropolitan Tokyo, New York, and London have even larger populations. Even though I have visited these cities before, I had not been very interested in Tokyo. But this time when we were in Tokyo, I was amazed because from morning to night the streets are filled with cars and people. Even though Japan has a large population and two to three thousand missionaries, God does not have a house there.</p>
<p>While I was there, this feeling was constantly in me. Japan has so many people and so many Christians, but God does not have a house. Many of the Lord&rsquo;s seekers also feel that they do not have a home. The believers who meet in other groups and the saints in our meetings asked where they should go. They feel homeless.</p>
<p>There are Christian groups that were established by local Japanese believers, and there are mission groups that were established two hundred years ago by Western missionaries. Moreover, there are two to three thousand Western missionaries who labor diligently in Japan. However, the first thing that the seeking believers asked me was where they should go. Sometimes I inquired why they asked this question, and they replied that they do not receive much supply and help where they meet. In other words, there is no pasture with food to eat. They do not have a home that can give them food.</p>
<p>No matter what our children do or where they go to play, at a certain time they say that it is time to go home and eat. There is a place where they can rest and enjoy food when they are hungry and need to eat. However, many saints cannot say that they have a place where they can eat when they are hungry or can rest when they are tired. Their needs are not met.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SITUATION IN AMERICA AND CANADA</h2>
<p>After Japan we went to America. Wherever we went, from the West Coast to the East Coast, I tried to understand the situation of the Christian groups. We stayed in New York City for quite a while and thought that if we could understand the situation in New York, we would understand the situation in the whole country. New York City is representative of America, but other places are not representative of America. From my observation I saw that the large country of America, which has thousands of Christians, does not have a house for God&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>When we were in San Francisco, I attended the crusade of a famous evangelist. The crusade truly had the Lord&rsquo;s presence, and many people were saved. Someone said that more people were saved when this evangelist was in New York. However, after their salvation, the newly saved ones are like newborn babies who do not have a place to grow up. In other words, there is no home to feed and care for the newborn babies.</p>
<p>When we were in New York, we did not announce our meetings, but believers, especially the Chinese believers, wanted to attend our meetings. After they listened to the messages, they cried out that they do not have a home. There are several Christian groups among the Chinese believers, but they all said that they do not have food. They do not have a place to rest; they do not have a home.</p>
<p>In summary, the impression we received from our visit is that the children of God do not have a home. This is the situation in America and in Canada. We did not contact many people in Canada, but we made a special visit to a well-known group founded by Oswald J. Smith. While we were there, he was holding a revival meeting in another place. The group is called the Peoples Church. Over the past fifty years this Christian group has supported the largest percentage of missionaries. It is a well-known fact that they are still supporting more than two hundred missionaries. They meet in a small chapel, but they are zealous in their support of missionaries. When we were there, a group of sisters was meeting and praying.</p>
<p>The information we received concerning Canada is that Canada is desolate and without any large gatherings. In America there are evangelists who attract large crowds of people to hear the gospel. In Canada, however, there does not seem to be any activity. This indicates a desolate situation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SITUATION IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK</h2>
<p>After our time in America we went to England. I will skip the details and relate only one incident. The day before we left England, we had our last time of fellowship with the saints at Honor Oak. During this meeting everyone could ask questions, and I answered them. The first two questions were general, but the third question was concerning the local churches. In response I spoke concerning the establishing and the ground of the local churches. Then a brother asked whether it is necessary to pay a price in order to establish a local church. I said that there is the need to pay a price and to fight.</p>
<p>I was standing in front of several hundred believers, and I said that God&rsquo;s children want to rise up to serve God and take the way of the Lord, but where is a place in the West that is practicing this pattern according to God&rsquo;s heart? Brother T. Austin-Sparks and all the elders were sitting beside me.</p>
<p>I continued to say that the entire West is covered with fog and does not have a way out. If a child of God wants to rise up to take the way of the Lord, who can show him the right way? I asked the brothers and sisters whether they see this matter and added that we need to pay a price and to rise up to be the fighting pioneers who open up the way.</p>
<p>I then gave an illustration, using a trip to Scotland that I made with Brother Sparks, in which he drove. It took us only a few hours to drive five hundred miles, because someone had opened the way and paved it with tar. This highway made it easy for us to reach our destination. Where is such a highway in the West? God&rsquo;s children rise up and want to take this way, but there is no way; there is only fog. Where is this highway? Is there a meeting in the West that can serve as a standard, a model, or a pattern? Where is the highway that God&rsquo;s children can walk on? In this situation we need to pay a price, and we also need to fight and open up a way for God&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>I am giving the details of this fellowship so that we can know the situation in the West. My time at Honor Oak can be compared to a doctor&rsquo;s office hours. Everyone who came to me asked what he should do and where he should go after Honor Oak. Their questions strengthened my impression that there is no home for the believers in the West. Both God and man do not have a home. If the believers had a home, they would not ask what they should do and where they should go.</p>
<p>After England we went to Denmark. Of all the places we visited, Denmark had the most positive situation. Many believers in Denmark also asked questions, but their questions were positive. Their questions were not in a negative context. Since the believers had a positive attitude, the situation in Denmark was straightforward. As long as my suggestions were good and proper, they accepted them. What I said was short and simple, and they put everything to practice. We did not expect them to meet in their homes, but in a letter I received from them recently, they said they are now meeting in more than twenty homes.</p>
<p>My overall impression is that there is a need in every place to build up God&rsquo;s house so that the wandering believers can have a home. If there is another opportunity for me to speak with the children of God, I will say that the greatest need on earth today is to build up God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>There is still a great need for the gospel, but if we study the situation, we will see that the gospel is not the primary need. The primary need today is a home for the believers. In other words, the gospel is to beget children, and a home is to raise children. The need today is not to give birth to children but to raise them up. Since there are many children who do not have a home, why should we focus on giving birth to more children? The ones who give birth to children are also homeless. The pitiful situation today is that it is difficult to find a home on the earth today.</p>
<p>This description is not too much. The Lord, whom we serve and who indwells us, will confirm this word. If you ask me what Japan needs the most, I would say that the need is God&rsquo;s house. If you ask me what America needs the most, I would say even more strongly that the need is to establish God&rsquo;s house in every place. If you ask me what England needs the most, without a doubt I would say that England needs God&rsquo;s house. Every place needs God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>At the end of the conference in Denmark, as everyone was leaving, a sister from Sweden came to me in tears and said that she will never forget the help she received from the conference. She also said that she looked to the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to live what was presented. Most of the saints asked what they should do when they went back and where they should meet, but this sister said that she would never forget the help she received and that she desired to live in God&rsquo;s life so that God&rsquo;s house can be built up.</p>
<p>It is not that there are shepherds with no sheep but that there are many sheep with no shepherds; there are many homeless believers. Hence, there was a feeling at the end of the conference that the saints were reluctant to leave. They wanted to know where they should go after the conference. Therefore, what every place needs the most is the satisfaction of having a home.</p><h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SPREADING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Meeting the Need in Every Place</h2>
<p>After this visit I feel that the situation of Christians in the West is disappointing, that their questions and their situation confirm that the way we know and are taking is the right way, and that the urgent need in every place is God&rsquo;s house. In light of this situation, I ask whether we should limit what God has entrusted, measured, to us to the island of Taiwan? Or will God enlarge our borders because of our growth in Him? We need to spread, but how should we spread? What are the borders for our spread? Should we be limited to the Far East, or should we spread also to the West?</p>
<p>In terms of needs, every place has needs. The brothers in Tokyo have repeatedly asked for some workers. They requested that I present their need to the brothers here and ask that some workers be sent to them. The brothers from Bangkok sent me a letter in which they asked us to send more than two workers to them. When I was there, they said that if I cannot go there, I have to send some workers. There is also a need in America. The saints there requested that we send several brothers to them.</p>
<p>The question that we must ask is whether we should spread abroad. Should we limit ourselves to the Far East, or should we go to the West? This is what I want to fellowship with the saints. I am also willing to hear your feeling concerning this matter. We need to spend time in the Lord&rsquo;s presence to see how we feel about this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Being Limited by<br />
What We Have Learned and Are Doing<br />
but Having a Feeling for the Body</h2>
<p>I also have a feeling about the overall situation in Taiwan and the situation of the workers. The Lord in His mercy has used the brothers and sisters in every place to do His work. However, several factors limit our usefulness in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. One factor is that our spiritual view is narrow.</p>
<p>There are two aspects to our narrowness. We are limited by what we have learned, and we are limited by what we are doing. The help we can render others is only according to what we have learned. We cannot go beyond this. We are also limited by what we do. This also narrows our view. We are useful, but we are limited in our work by these two points. We do not have a feeling for the Body.</p>
<p>Our work must not be limited by what we have learned or by what we are doing. Our work is to build up the Body of Christ, which has a local aspect and a universal aspect. We are not merely helping individual believers to be spiritual or helping a group of believers to grow in life. Rather, our work is for the churches in the localities. At the same time, we are building up the Lord&rsquo;s universal Body. May the Lord grant us another opportunity to fellowship further concerning this point. In the Lord&rsquo;s work we should not be limited by what we can do or by what we have learned. We must have the view and the measure of the local and universal aspects of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>For example, Hudson Taylor was not a gospel preacher. He was a person who learned to abide in the Lord because of what he saw in John 15. However, he received a burden to evangelize the whole of China. While China was still under the Ching Dynasty, Hudson Taylor said that he would use the Lord&rsquo;s gospel to evangelize imperial China. His burden testified that his work was not limited by what he had learned. The burden that he received was beyond what he had learned and experienced. This is the reason that he was blessed by God.</p>
<p>Every believer who is limited by what he has learned is under the influence of the mystics, who were not productive in relation to the work. The evangelicals were raised up to make up the lack of the mystics. The Lord must enlarge us. We should not be ambitious to be great; we must remain humble. We must also allow the Lord to enlarge us. This will affect whether our work will spread.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Other Reasons for Our Work Being Restricted</h2>
<p>Some workers are useful but restricted by what they have learned and by what they are doing because they are not broken. The work in some places is restricted, or even suffers loss, because we are not broken. Another factor that restricts the work is our lack of coordination. We do not coordinate because we are not broken. Hence, there is a lack of harmony.</p>
<p>Another factor that restricts the work is that we still have a problem with our skills. In some places there is not enough perfecting of the saints. We even replace the saints in their service. This is also a factor that restricts the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>In summary, there are several factors that restrict the Lord&rsquo;s work. We are limited by what we have learned and are doing, we are not broken, we lack coordination and harmony, and we replace the saints instead of perfecting them because we lack skills.</p>
<p>The Lord has still used us, and our work has some results, but these factors limit the Lord. If the Lord was not limited, the work would be stronger, and it would have reached more places.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Spreading and Strengthening</h2>
<p>On the one hand, we need to spread abroad, but on the other hand, we still have some weaknesses. We do not have a strong model because of our weaknesses. It may be of the Lord that believers regard us too highly. On this trip I felt that the Lord opened a door that no one can shut. The Lord has opened the door and done the work; hence, we should not be proud.</p>
<p>Whether in the Far East or in the West, the Lord values our meetings and people regard them. This is the reason that believers came to us and asked for instructions and help. It is true that believers regard us too highly. They consider the meetings in Taiwan or a brother who says that he is from Taiwan to be wonderful. Wherever we went, we said that the situation in Taiwan is not so good and that there are many saints who are dormant and many saints who are still childish. Even though we said this, wherever we went, the believers waited for us to speak, they asked us for help, and they expected us to lead the meetings. They regarded us too highly. We are not that high; we have many weak points.</p>
<p>This fellowship is for us to consider which way the Lord is leading us. Should we strengthen the work and establish a model, or should we spread abroad? May the Lord enlighten every one of us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CONCERNING THE VISION AND BURDEN<br />
IN THE WORK</h1>
<p>One of the feelings I have from my visit abroad is that the Lord has opened a door for us. Even if we do not take into account the openness in the West, but only consider the openness in Southeast Asia and Japan, we can see that a door is wide open. There are opportunities for us to go and labor. In Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Burma, and Thailand there are at least fifty places with meetings, and every place needs saints to go and help them. They are waiting and hoping that saints from Taiwan will go and help them.</p>
<p>Some of the Lord&rsquo;s workers want a good opportunity and a good location for their work. Hence, they often write letters to advertise their availability. If they want to labor in a place, they write and ask whether there is an opportunity to labor there. In this way, they seek for an opportunity and a place to work. But the Lord has given us a wide-open door. Believers want us to help them. In contrast to workers who seek opportunities to work, the Lord does not require us to seek opportunities to work for Him. The opportunities are waiting for us and are even looking for us.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters need to understand that the places abroad have a great need and are open to us. We know our true condition in Taiwan. Even though the saints abroad respect us and regard us highly, we know that we are not that high. We have to know our condition.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if we compare our condition with that of other places, we see that we are able to meet the needs in some places. For example, there is a brother who was originally from Indonesia. He lived in Taipei for many years and met in the third district. However, he has returned to Indonesia and is somewhat useful there. He is able to help the local saints, particularly the young people, and his function has become manifest. Another example is that some meetings overseas depend on the saints from Taiwan. In many places brothers from Taiwan are responsible for the ministry of the word. It is as if the meetings cannot continue if the saints from Taiwan are not present. This situation proves that there is a great need in all the places.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING SPIRITUAL AND BECOMING NOTHING</h2>
<p><em>Question: Can you fellowship more about our work being limited by what we have learned and what we are doing? Does this mean that our usefulness is not related to our spiritual learning? Should we pursue spirituality in order to be more useful to the Lord? How can we solve the problems in a place if we do not know what their problems are?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We should not use spirituality as a means to measure the usefulness of a believer in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. None of the believers who are confined in their service by their spirituality have a good ending. However, every serving one must learn to live in the Lord&rsquo;s presence. This is to pursue being spiritual. I do not like to use the word <em>spiritual.</em> Especially after my visit overseas, I am not sure what it means to be spiritual.</p>
<p>I do not understand the expression <em>pursue spirituality.</em> What does this refer to? What does it mean to be spiritual? I know what it is to be humble and to be proud, and I understand what it is to persevere and to love. Does spirituality mean that a person can be built with others? I do not understand what it is to be spiritual.</p>
<p>Eventually, a person who constantly seeks spirituality does not become spiritual; instead, he becomes nothing. This was the failure of the mystics. In order to be spiritual, the mystics maintained a life of privacy. They focused on their relationship with God, on learning to fellowship with God, and on living in God&rsquo;s presence. They considered this to be crucial and maintained a life of privacy in order to learn these lessons. As a result, they became nothing, because they have no spiritual posterity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;SPIRITUALITY&rdquo; CAUSING A PERSON TO BE LAZY</h2>
<p>Many believers who have an understanding of spiritual matters reject things from the mystics. Brother Yu Cheng-hua translated some of Madame Guyon&rsquo;s books and introduced them to us. These books are still being read among us. The first book that he translated was an abridged version of her autobiography. The Chinese translation, entitled <em>Fragrant Myrrh,</em> was published twenty years ago in 1938. He also translated <em>A Short and Easy Method of Prayer</em> and a book by Brother Lawrence entitled <em>The Practice of the Presence of God.</em> Have these books rendered us any genuine help in the past twenty years? If we study this matter seriously, we will see that the way of the mystics has no future.</p>
<p>The practices of the mystics can only produce a group of special believers. Believers who may have been good material before they were &ldquo;helped&rdquo; by the mystics are damaged, and their progress is frustrated after they begin to follow the practices of the mystics. They turn inward and practice short and easy prayers. I know these things because I witnessed this situation. Believers who practice these things become lost in mysticism, and they are hindered and delayed. In order to avoid a conflict among us, we have not rejected the things of the mystics.</p>
<p>I stopped receiving the teaching of Madame Guyon in 1943. However, in order to diffuse a crisis among us, I spoke according to her writings. I went along with the situation, and by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, some saints were recovered.</p>
<p>Several of the saints here are from Shanghai. If they consider our past, they will understand what I am saying. I went to Shanghai to diffuse a crisis. One aspect of this crisis was related to the teachings of the mystics. I do not deny the need to turn to our inner man. This teaching of the mystics has its value. However, there is a danger that we will have problems if we are constantly turning inward. Therefore, instead of opposing the practice of touching an inner feeling, I turned the saints to preach the gospel and to start new meetings. This was a rescue and a release. After I was in Shanghai for more than a year, the atmosphere changed. I encouraged everyone to preach the gospel and to start new meetings instead of continually turning inward.</p>
<p>When Brother Nee resumed his ministry, he said to me that many of the things by Madame Guyon should not have been brought in. To repeat the mistake of the mystics produces a manufactured, or artificial, spirituality. Such spirituality often turns into personal freedom and results in spiritual laziness. For example, so-called spiritual believers can say that even if thousands of people go to hell, they must seek the inner feeling. They must also seek the inner feeling even if the churches are desolate. To <em>turn inward</em> is a euphemism. It is a sign of laziness and indicates that they do not have a burden. A person with a burden does not continually declare that he must turn inward to seek the inner feeling. Only a mother who does not care about her children would say that she must maintain her cleanliness at the expense of her children. A mother who is truly burdened for her children will take care of her children.</p>
<p>Please do not misunderstand me. It is difficult to find a brother among the workers as pure, absolute, and faithful as Brother Yu was. However, if we follow the way that he introduced, we would have no future.</p><h2 class="head1">PERSONAL SPIRITUALITY<br />
NOT ALLOWED IN THE LORD&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s Epistles do not speak of his spirituality. Instead, they deal with the problems in the churches. Only the book of 2 Corinthians seems to speak of Paul&rsquo;s personal spirituality. Hence, we must read 2 Corinthians to know Paul. The emphasis of 2 Corinthians, however, deals with the problems in the church. Paul spoke of his spiritual life to solve the problems in the church. The person of Paul was totally for the church. He spoke of his spirituality for the church.</p>
<p>If we spoke concerning spirituality to Paul, he might say that he knows only a few things and that he does not understand us. He knows to save sinners, to build up the church, to labor for the Lord, to learn to live in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, and to enjoy the Lord. He does not know anything besides these things.</p>
<p>Recently, the Gospel Book Room reprinted <em>The Spiritual Man.</em> I was rather reluctant to agree with this suggestion. Brother Nee wrote this book, but he was later unwilling to reprint it. He did not want to reprint it, because it is about a &ldquo;spiritual man.&rdquo; God does not want spiritual men. Moreover, the book is too analytical and is prone to draw readers into self-analysis. This was the main reason that Brother Nee was not willing to reprint it. Brother Nee also pointed out another reason to me. <em>The Spiritual Man</em> does not give a vision; it merely focuses on analysis. A believer can become well-versed in <em>The Spiritual Man</em> but have no vision. He can have knowledge concerning the flesh and the spirit and know what is of the mind, the emotion, and the will, but have no vision, no revelation, and no experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GENUINE SPIRITUALITY<br />
BEING MAINTAINED BY A VISION</h2>
<p>Hudson Taylor had a vision. One day as he walked by the seashore in England, he looked over the Atlantic Ocean and saw a great imperial state by the shore of the Pacific Ocean. This state had thousands of souls who needed to be saved. That was when he received a burden. He forgot about his own spirituality and received this one burden from the Lord. If we asked him about his spirituality, he may have said that he did not know what it is to be spiritual. He only knew that he had a heavy burden. He wanted to preach the gospel to the thousands of souls who were perishing daily. It did not matter whether he was an evangelist or whether he knew how to preach the gospel. He received a vision, a burden, that was beyond his spiritual learning, and he followed it.</p>
<p>Every person who wants to be useful to the Lord must learn not to trust in what he has learned but to go beyond it. Our spirituality is a small matter. As long as we receive a vision from the Lord, the vision will keep us and make us spiritual. This is genuine spirituality. The vision will keep us living in God&rsquo;s presence. The vision will not let us go; it will keep us. In contrast, if we pursue spirituality but do not have a burden from God, the more we pursue, the less spiritual we will be.</p>
<p>When the book <em>Fragrant Myrrh</em> was first published, there was a group of brothers and sisters in northern China who imitated Madame Guyon. There was even a sister in Taiwan who was quite successful in imitating her. <em>Fragrant Myrrh</em> and <em>A Short and Easy Method of Prayer</em> have a particular flavor. This sister was so successful in imitating Madame Guyon that she had a particular walk and way of speaking. Whenever the saints saw her, they would say, &ldquo;Here comes the &lsquo;Fragrant Myrrh&rsquo;; here comes Madame Guyon.&rdquo; We have to be clear that this kind of imitated spirituality is useless. Please forgive me for saying that believers who engage in this type of spirituality have a tragic end. Mrs. Penn-Lewis, for instance, had a miserable ending, because she paid too much attention to being spiritual. This led her into spiritual warfare in her latter years, and she eventually focused on demons.</p>
<p>Without a commission from God, we cannot be protected. Without a vision from God, we cannot be saved. We cannot pursue spirituality without a commission and a vision from God. After following the Lord for more than thirty years, I can only say that I do not know what it is to be spiritual. Every believer who receives a burden has a glorious ending. Maybe D. L. Moody was not clear concerning the way of the church, but he was a person who received a burden. His burden was to preach the gospel. Hudson Taylor was not a gospel preacher, but he received a burden, and his end was glorious. However, the saints who paid attention to their own spirituality and desired to improve their spirituality did not have a good ending. The Lord does not honor our focusing on spirituality.</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO HAVE A VISION AND BURDEN<br />
FROM THE LORD</h2>
<p>I would like to say something further. I hope that this fellowship will be of help to all of us. No one who serves the Lord should be limited by what he has learned and by what he can do. When called by the Lord, Moses said, &ldquo;I am not a man of words,...for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue&rdquo; (Exo. 4:10). God does not call us because we are capable, and He does not call us when we are capable. Rather, the Lord calls us when we are not capable. The Lord does not care whether we are capable. He asks only whether we are willing. The question is not whether we can do something but whether we have a burden. The flame of fire burned within the thornbush (3:2). It is not a matter of whether we can do something but of whether the Lord is burning within. It does not depend on our ability but on whether we let the Lord burn us.</p>
<p>When Jeremiah was called by the Lord, he said that he was a youth and did not know how to speak (Jer. 1:6). He admitted that he was a young person and doubted his ability to bear the ministry. However, the Lord replied, &ldquo;Do not say, I am a youth; / For everywhere I send you, you shall go; / And everything I command you, you shall speak&rdquo; (v. 7). In other words, the ministry depended on the Lord, not on Jeremiah.</p>
<p>A believer who desires to receive God&rsquo;s calling must be delivered from himself and deny himself. He must be delivered from his capability, from what he has learned, from what he can do, and from what he has done. He must be delivered from these matters and deny them. The Lord&rsquo;s commission does not depend on what a person is. A person may say that he can serve in coordination because he is capable, spiritual, has a supply of life, and is eloquent. He may also say that since he has learned all the matters related to service and coordination, and he is familiar with all the matters related to the building up of the church, he is full of confidence to go and do the Lord&rsquo;s work. We must realize that as long as we are the source, we are useless to God.</p>
<p>It is an offense to the Lord to say that we cannot solve the problems in a place if we do not know what they are. The Lord does not want us to solve people&rsquo;s problems. He never asks us to know the problems of others. We do not learn lessons in order to solve problems. When the Lord sends us, He wants us to go with a vision. We should know the vision, not others&rsquo; problems. We do not need to know how to solve problems; we should know only how to pass on the vision that we have received to others and to speak of what God wants. We should never have the intention to help the saints solve their problems when we go out.</p>
<p><em>Question: How can we be sure that the Lord has called us?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We must always receive a vision. When I went to Shanghai in 1946, there was already an unresolved problem there that began in 1942. When I was there, everyone who had a problem came to see me. Because I did not know the history of the problem, I had an advantage. Even though I was open in my attitude toward the saints, I could say that I did not understand the problem. Whoever came to me could speak of his problems, but I did not hear anything.</p>
<p>I did not go to Shanghai to solve the problems. I did not understand the problems. I was not concerned with who was the source or whether it was a matter of someone being dishonest or crafty. I knew only that I went to Shanghai with the burden and the vision that God is the tree of life and that God desires to build up the church so that the church will rise up and serve Him. I did not know anything else. I did not want to know whether the saints had a problem with this or that brother. I knew only that God is the tree of life.</p>
<p>One day a brother told me that I was very clever because I pushed all the problems aside and did not touch them. He felt that I was carefree and unperturbed even though some problems were very serious. It seemed as if I did not have any problems and that I was transcendent. I replied that I was not clever. I was not sent by the Lord to Shanghai to take care of the problems. If God could not take care of the problems, how could I solve them? I knew only that God sent me to help the saints see that He wants to be man&rsquo;s life and that man must live in Him. I had to show the saints that God wants to build up His church in every locality so that the church will rise up to serve Him. This is the only thing that I knew. I was not being clever.</p>
<p>I hope the brothers understand why I said this. We should look at the situation in Shanghai between 1946 and 1948. If we had pursued spirituality, we would eventually have had nothing. However, if we had a vision and a commission, there would have been genuine spiritual building. Hence, we should not think that we are going out to supply the saints, solve their problems, and help them. This way will not work. Instead, we need to receive a vision and a commission.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING CARRIED BY THE COMMISSION BUT<br />
NOT CARRYING THE COMMISSION</h2>
<p>The believers who know God realize that we do not carry the commission but that the commission carries us. We do not uphold the vision; the vision upholds us. If we receive a vision, we will not be concerned about problems when we go forth. We will know only that God has entrusted us with a commission. This is the greatest power. This is something that cannot be subdued. We will be able to subdue others, but they will not be able to subdue us. This is similar to what God said in Jeremiah 1:19: &ldquo;They will fight against you, but they will not prevail against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must be broad when we touch different matters. It is not that we are broad in ourselves; we need God to enlarge us. We should not be trapped in certain feelings and seek spirituality. Neither should we seek what kind of work we should do nor how to solve people&rsquo;s problems and meet their needs. The Lord has shown us mercy and has opened our eyes to see a genuine vision. The need abroad is not to supply individual needs or solve problems. The great and genuine need is the need of this age. If the Lord has mercy on us, some of us will receive this vision, and the Lord&rsquo;s presence will be with us.</p>
<p>We should not be proud. We must be persons who are broad because of the vision that we receive from the Lord. We must have faith. In order to receive a commission from the Lord, we must have faith in the spiritual supply, not only in material offerings. We must believe in God&rsquo;s commission, believe that God is with us, believe in the vision God gives us, and believe that God will uphold us with His authority and His power. We must have faith in this.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING<br />
THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
AND THE SPREAD OVERSEAS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BURDEN FOR<br />
THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>This chapter is a continuation of the previous chapter concerning what we observed during our trip abroad. In these days God wants to recover one church in one city as His practical testimony on the earth. Such a recovery will meet the inward, spiritual needs of the believers in every place. It is also what the Lord earnestly desires.</p>
<p>We have not seen this light as clearly as we do today. Even when I was in Shanghai, my view was not this clear. We were enlightened concerning the building up of the church until 1953. Over the past five years my view of the building has become clearer, my burden heavier, and my understanding richer.</p>
<p>These are not the first messages being released on the building. We emphasized the building up of the church in past trainings and conferences. I spent three years, from 1955 to 1957, to speak concerning the building in Manila. By the Lord&rsquo;s leading, I have gained a deep impression during this trip that there is a need to build up the local churches in order to have a house for the satisfaction and rest of both God and man.</p>
<p>God should have a house because He has so many children. How can a person have many children but not have a house? Today God has many children, but He does not have a house on earth. We should not be proud, but if we stopped the meetings in Taipei, we would not have a home.</p>
<p>I am not speaking of the importance of this work merely because this is our work. If this is the work of man, it can be destroyed. Where should a child of God meet if he goes to Kaohsiung? Where can he find a home? A casual believer who is indifferent to God&rsquo;s desire or a believer who lives in the world is not interested in a home. However, a believer who has a heart for the Lord and lives in His presence will be homeless in Kaohsiung. Wherever we go, God does not have a house, even though He has so many children. If we are objective and sober and consider this matter from God&rsquo;s point of view, we will realize that God has many children in many places, but He does not have a home.</p>
<p>I have never had a burden as heavy as this during my thirty years of serving the Lord. Neither have I had a burden as definite as this. This is the need in every place. Most of the places that we visited were large cities. We were in more than twenty countries and visited thirty large cities and over twenty smaller cities. We did not rest; we tried our best to observe the situation.</p>
<p>We initially planned to go to Berlin, but we were told that Berlin no longer occupies an important position since it is not the capital of Germany. We therefore changed our itinerary and went to Zurich, Switzerland. We tried to visit large cities. Eventually, we gained the same impression wherever we went: every place has a need for the house for God. The three largest cities in the world&mdash;New York, London, and Tokyo&mdash;have thousands of Christians, but they do not have a house, a dwelling place, for God. Wherever we went, we saw that the children of God have this need.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING THE GOSPEL AND LIFE SUPPLY<br />
BUT STILL NEEDING GOD&rsquo;S HOUSE</h2>
<p>This realization strengthens me. I sense that God will recover His building among His children. At the same time, we have to see that God has raised up many believers to work for Him, but not many can meet the need of His building. In America Billy Graham preaches a genuine and living gospel. I attended a crusade that he held in San Francisco, and I can testify that the gospel he preaches is genuine. He has a genuine burden for the gospel. He was truly raised up by God to preach the gospel in America.</p>
<p>Brother T. Austin-Sparks is a believer who lives before God. His exercise to live before the Lord is genuine. I can testify that Brother Sparks does not seek anything outside of the Lord. He is genuinely learning to live in the presence of God. Even though our way and the light we have received differs, I can testify concerning his living before God. May the Lord cover me to say that apart from the work of these two brothers, according to my observation, the activities in Christianity are either insignificant or are conducted to gain a following. It is difficult to find a person with a pure heart.</p>
<p>This situation shows the widespread desolation on the earth today. Surely the Lord is great. He can still use believers who seek their own gain for His purpose. God can even use Catholicism. Therefore, people everywhere are still being genuinely saved. However, these believers have a need, and no one is meeting this need.</p>
<p>Brother Sparks saw that the children of God are hungry, and he wants Honor Oak to be a place that supplies food. He wants to be like Joseph, and he wants Honor Oak to be a place that gives people food, just as Egypt did in the years of famine. This is his intention. However, during my trip I saw that the children of God do not need only food. God&rsquo;s children need a house. It is not enough to supply them merely with food. There is also the need to give them a place to rest. The children of God are at a stage where it is not sufficient merely to be fed. They need a house, a place of rest.</p>
<p>The function of a house includes supplying food. The most important matter in a home is to eat. But not every place that gives food is a home. Restaurants are places where people can eat, but they are not homes. The most practical need of believers today is to have a home. Hence, the difference between what Brother Sparks sees and what we see is this matter of the house of God. Brother Sparks says that it is sufficient to supply spiritual food. We say that there is still the need for God&rsquo;s house. I was at Honor Oak for only a few days, but I felt this need. Brother Sparks gives the saints food, but they are still homeless. Nearly everyone at Honor Oak longs for a home, a place of rest. What I observed strengthens this feeling within me and assures me that this is exactly what God wants to do in these days.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT PERSONAL SPIRITUALITY<br />
BUT THE BUILDING UP OF GOD&rsquo;S HOUSE</h2>
<p>Therefore, I am burdened to show the saints that those who serve the Lord should not focus only on spiritual matters. If we focus only on being spiritual, eventually we will not be spiritual. It is not a matter of whether we are spiritual. The issue is whether we let God open our eyes to see a vision and whether we receive a burden. If we focus on our spirituality and learning instead of receiving a vision, burden, and revelation from God, we will eventually fall. God&rsquo;s revelation, vision, and burden are great. They can uphold us and make us stand. Then even if we stumble, we will not fall down.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul said that he was not disobedient to the heavenly vision (Acts 26:19). This vision followed him and continually upheld him. If we are caught in the trap of being spiritual, we will have a tragic end and become useless to God. Such spirituality is manufactured and does not necessarily have its source in God. We do not learn to be spiritual. We can read <em>The Spiritual Man</em> ten thousand times but not become spiritual.</p>
<p>A person who pursues God and enjoys God will be spiritual. Only God can make a person spiritual. Hence, if we are in God, in His hand, plan, and move, we do not need to pursue spirituality. We will be spiritual. We cannot make ourselves spiritual; only God can make us spiritual. I have been considering what being spiritual means. My understanding of spirituality is different from what it was in the past. What we thought was spirituality is not spirituality. Genuine spirituality depends on our learning to receive God&rsquo;s burden.</p>
<p>Hudson Taylor received a burden that was different from his spiritual learning. If he had been zealous for the gospel, like Billy Graham or John Sung, it would not be strange that he received a burden to evangelize China. However, Hudson Taylor was not such a person. He learned to live in the presence of God and to fellowship with the Lord. He then received a burden that differed from what he had learned. He was neither trapped nor limited by his learning.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING ONLY TO WORK AND TO HELP OTHERS</h2>
<p>I usually do not expect a result in whatever I do, nor do I care for the result. I know only to labor. I also do not hold many opinions. This characteristic was recognized by the senior co-workers. I do not wish to speak about myself, but I want to fellowship with you. Whenever there was a crucial matter to be decided, the senior workers would first fellowship with others before they fellowshipped with me. When it was time to carry something out, they fellowshipped with me to ask me to carry it out. They would first fellowship with others to hear their opinions, then they fellowshipped with me to ask me to carry it out. They did this because I did not have many opinions. This is one thing I can boast of. I am a person who knows only to work; I do not give opinions or care for results.</p>
<p>May the Lord cover me to testify that I do not covet anything. From the day I began to serve full time, I have not coveted anything. I know only to immerse myself in the work, and I do not care who is credited with the result of my labor. Therefore, I find it difficult to make a plan and instruct others how to carry it out. It is not that I do not wish to take the lead but that I do not have many opinions or care for results. I know only to work. When the Lord led me to northern China, I knew only to work hard and let go of any results. I did not care about any gain or loss. When the Lord led me to Shanghai, for about three years I knew only to immerse myself in the work and nothing else. I was still working the day before I boarded an airplane to come to Taiwan. I did not know what would be the result of my labor, because the result was not in my hand.</p>
<p>I say this so that no one will depend on me to push them or to make plans and arrangements for them. On the one hand, there are still things that I need to learn, but on the other hand, for the past seven or eight years I have tried my best to help the brothers in Taiwan serve the Lord. I did not express any opinions. I knew only to work and help others to work. I never had the thought of controlling anyone or lording it over anyone. I do not care for this. I know only to take care of my responsibility. This has always been my practice.</p>
<p>Brother Sparks once testified concerning me and said that Brother Lee does not know anything but to work. This comment may be too much, but it is true that I know only to work. In my relationship with the saints I try my best to assist, encourage, and admonish without assuming a position. Therefore, I hope that we can learn to be before the Lord and coordinate for the building, instead of waiting for someone to motivate us.</p>
<p>We also need to see that coordination for the building is the secret to being blessed. I thank the Lord for His mercy that I have not had problems with any workers in the service. This is especially true in regard to coordination with the senior workers. I learned that the good points, faults, strengths, and weaknesses of the saints are not my business. I do not work with the saints because of their strengths or weaknesses. I work with them for the Lord&rsquo;s interest, testimony, and glory. As long as the Lord&rsquo;s interest, testimony, and glory are not hindered or damaged, I will coordinate with the saints by complementing what they can do. I will not step on them. We have to learn to work in this way and not oppose or step on others. Everyone&rsquo;s work has its place and its value. We should learn to work with others by adding our portion to theirs. The workers should learn to serve in this way before the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">LEADING THE CHURCH<br />
INTO THE PRACTICAL BUILDING</h2>
<p>The brothers have expressed a desire to lead the church into the practical building and to send workers to propagate overseas. I wish to fellowship some practical steps concerning this.</p>
<p>I am burdened to spend several weeks to help the churches in Taiwan. During this time we may focus on perfecting the saints responsible for the district meetings. In the larger localities we need to perfect the saints and focus on the practice of building. During a recent elders&rsquo; meeting some elders suggested that we use this time to have a life-study of the books of the Prophets in the Old Testament. Even though I want to study these books, I feel we should focus on the practice of building.</p>
<p>I have considered the building up of the church, and I hope to learn something during this time. In particular, I want to learn how to administrate a large local church. Before I went overseas, I said to the brothers that I wanted to see how the Brethren administrate the church. While we were overseas, we contacted the Brethren several times but did not receive much help from them. The closed Brethren continue to be closed, and the open Brethren are so open that they want their young people to study in seminaries. Brother Sparks was also discouraged by the present condition of the Brethren. Even some brothers in America said that they visited the Brethren, and their meetings are desolate. Therefore, since we clearly see the building, we have to spend time to find a practical way to have the building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPECTING SOME TO PROPAGATE OVERSEAS</h2>
<p>From the fellowship in the last two meetings and from fellowship with some of the saints, I have the assurance that some brothers and sisters have a burden to go overseas for the propagation and that we need to strengthen the testimony here. The testimony here is not to make a display of ourselves but to have a place with a strong testimony so that we can render help to others. Then saints from different places abroad can come and stay for some time to obtain practical help. We can also call a large meeting for saints from different places to come and participate, and we can have a time of training. I believe that this will render much help.</p>
<p>The service the Lord is leading us into is not something that we can put in writing and send out in printed form for other believers to read and understand. Printed messages cannot meet this need. There are many skills for us to learn in our service, even if we do not feel that this is our need. It is difficult to understand something that is described only in printed material. In order to receive the proper knowledge, it is best to see a practical demonstration. In secular terms, we need to send people out as &ldquo;technical personnel,&rdquo; who can live in a place for two to three years to help the local church there and then move to another place. The &ldquo;technical personnel&rdquo; go out to instruct people. The church here also needs to serve as a &ldquo;factory&rdquo; where believers can come to learn and to do an &ldquo;internship.&rdquo; In principle, this should be our future situation. We should send saints out, and saints can come here to learn.</p>
<p>I do not know where we should go or how many believers should be in the city we go to. These matters depend on the burden that the brothers receive from the Lord. We should not expect anyone to push us if we do not have a burden. Do not expect me to motivate you to carry out a work for which you have no feeling. We need to see a vision and receive a burden. Then we should devote ourselves wholeheartedly to our burden. If we do this, we can receive help and be motivated. We must respond before someone can help us. Where we should go depends on the burden that we receive from the Lord.</p>
<p>It may be of the Lord that many places overseas are waiting for help from Taiwan. Japan and different places in Southeast Asia are expecting helpers to come from Taiwan. The door is wide open. If the brothers have the burden to learn some lessons and to receive a burden to labor in these places, we will receive the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. As long as we go and labor, God&rsquo;s blessing will be upon us. Of course, wherever we go to labor will not be as convenient as here. This is our home where everything is convenient. If we go abroad, we will need to learn many things. We will need to learn the lesson of faith to take risks, to meet different needs, and to deal with different problems. In all of this we should trust that the Lord&rsquo;s grace is sufficient and that His blessing will overflow.</p>
<p>We should also consider how to give practical help to the saints who visit us from overseas. We should not try to do something too large. I have been reluctant to have a training on how to practically carry out the building, because of the practical arrangements that need to be made. We do not want the training to be formal and lack flexibility. Furthermore, because the procedure for entry into Taiwan is complicated, a large number of people cannot come at the same time. If we are willing to conduct a large training and the entry procedure into Taiwan is relaxed, we might be able to have a training in the fall of next year. More saints will be able to come at that time.</p>
<p>I believe that the Lord is leading us to have some saints go out and is leading others to come here to learn. In this way the Lord will have a practical way to propagate among us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEARNING IN THE WORK</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORKERS MEETING THE LOCAL NEEDS<br />
AND THE OVERSEAS PROPAGATION</h2>
<p>After much fellowship we are clear that several brothers need to move for their service and labor. Some brothers want to move, and there are places that have a need. Moreover, it may be necessary to reassign the responsibilities of some co-workers. This applies to our service in Taiwan, particularly in Taipei.</p>
<p>Concerning going abroad, we feel that we should take care of Japan and Southeast Asia. There is an urgent need in Tokyo and Bangkok. We hope that at least two brothers can go to Bangkok or that a brother and his family can go there. At least one brother should go to Tokyo. There is also a need for some brothers to go to different places in Southeast Asia. It would be good for more brothers to receive a burden to go overseas for the propagation. For example, if a brother has a clear leading from the Lord and has a burden to go to the West, especially to America, it would be very good. However, the urgent need is in Tokyo and Bangkok. I hope that some brothers will be open to seek the Lord&rsquo;s will and receive a burden to go to these places.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the past most of the co-workers in Taiwan stayed in one place for a long time and bore the responsibility there. The workers did not travel and labor in different places. In principle, we stayed in one place and were responsible for the work in that place. We did not work like the apostle Paul, who traveled from place to place without staying for long in any one place. It may be time for us to have a change. This does not mean we should all move to different places, but we need to make changes that will involve a few workers. There should be a group of workers, brothers and sisters, who receive the leading to travel from place to place on a regular basis to supply the needs of the churches.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BENEFITING THE WORKERS</h2>
<p>According to the fellowship from the brothers, some workers cannot leave immediately to supply the churches, but other workers can. A brother who receives the burden to go to supply the churches in different places should help the church where he is and also set aside a portion of his time to travel for the supply of other churches. In this way the workers can supply other churches and learn more related to the ministry. This will enlarge their heart and broaden their view.</p>
<p>The workers who do not travel regularly can stay in larger cities, such as Kaohsiung and Taichung. The workers who travel regularly can stay in smaller cities, such as Chiayi and Tainan. They should go to a place and then return to their locality when it is necessary. It is time for us to work in this way. We will benefit from traveling to different places. This will prevent the workers from being narrow in their view, and it will enlarge their capacity. The workers who travel to supply other churches will be enlarged in their view and capacity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BENEFITING THE CHURCHES</h2>
<p>Furthermore, when a co-worker goes out from his respective locality, the saints in his locality have an opportunity to serve and supply the church. When the worker returns, he can help locally. With the service being carried out mainly by the local saints, the workers can assist and guide the saints. When the workers are in a place, they should advise and assist the saints so that the saints will be able to take care of the practical service after he departs. When the worker returns, he can consider the service of the saints. Some areas of service may need adjustment, and the saints may need support or motivation. This will perfect the local saints who have the opportunity to serve.</p>
<p>We need a good coordination in every place. Some of the co-workers who travel can labor in the gospel, but they should not preach the gospel outside the fellowship of the church. They should preach the gospel in coordination with the brothers and sisters in a locality. In this way the church will preach the gospel, even when the workers bear responsibility for giving messages.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR PRACTICE</h2>
<p>The best practice is for two workers to travel together. The biblical principle is to go out two by two and work in coordination (Mark 6:7; Luke 10:1). The workers can hold conferences related to the building work, helping the saints in the matter of life or in reading the Word of God. It is best to go to the different places in twos and work in coordination. Then the churches in Taiwan will have an opportunity to receive the supply from many gifts. Moreover, some of the local brothers will have the opportunity to rise up and learn to bear responsibility. This will, in turn, provide the workers with more opportunities to travel.</p>
<p>The workers who travel should first go to places that are close to their present locality. This will give the saints in their locality the opportunity to bear more responsibility in the church. When the local saints are able to bear more responsibility, the workers can go to places that are farther away. With time, the workers as well as the local brothers will receive practical training. This is our present need.</p>
<p>Some saints may feel that we should continue to stay in one place for many years. Other saints may agree with this change in our practice. There are many patterns in the Bible. The apostle Paul stayed in one place for three years (Acts 20:31), in another place for a year and six months (18:11), and in several other places for a much shorter time (13:42, 44-52; 14:1-21; 17:2). He was flexible, because his labor was based on the need. Hence, we should not be as rigid in our labor as we have been in the past, when we stayed in one place for a long time and visited other places occasionally. It is time for us to travel to other places.</p>
<p>The localities that are new may not be ready for this change, but the local saints in more established localities should be given the opportunity to rise up and serve. Although the workers can guide the saints, their main responsibility is to supply the churches. A worker should be able to supply even the church of another worker. For example, a worker in locality A can supply locality B, and a worker in locality B can supply locality A. In this way there will be a mutual supply, and the capacity of life and service in the local churches will be enlarged.</p>
<p>A worker who travels to supply the churches should not abandon his locality. Just as Paul returned to Antioch, the locality that sent him out, the workers should return to the locality that sent them. Paul was sent out to labor, but he returned to Antioch to fellowship with and supply the saints. He did not abandon Antioch. Paul continued to care for the church in Antioch while he cared for the churches that were raised up among the Gentiles (14:26-28; 15:30, 35; 18:22-23). The brothers need a proper understanding of this matter, but we do not need rules related to how the workers travel. The brothers should always be ready to receive the Lord&rsquo;s leading to visit and to render practical help to the churches. How long the workers should stay in a place depends on the Lord&rsquo;s leading.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT BEING ABLE TO COORDINATE WITH OTHERS<br />
WITHOUT LEARNING LESSONS</h2>
<p>However, it may not be beneficial for the workers who have not learned any lessons to move. It may be better for these workers to remain in their locality until they learn some lessons. We all have a portion of supply, and we have our problems. These problems hinder us from learning lessons. In some places the workers and the local saints are unable to coordinate. A worker who cannot coordinate with the local saints has not learned some lessons. Every worker must learn lessons to be able to coordinate with the saints in any locality. When a worker has problems coordinating with local saints, the difficulty in coordinating is not because of the local saints; it is because the worker has not learned some lessons.</p>
<p>In a recent training we said that the character of a worker must be as pliable as paste. Paste can be applied to any surface. It can be applied to a surface that is hollow or that protrudes. It can be applied to a surface that is rough or that is smooth. There is hardly a surface to which paste cannot be applied. Therefore, if a worker is not able to coordinate with the local brothers, most likely it is because he has not learned the lessons that make his character as pliable as paste.</p>
<p>Workers who travel to a place and lord it over the saints have not learned this lesson (1 Pet. 5:3). The workers who are pliable as paste will be subject to the local brothers and willing to learn from them. If the local brothers need them to sweep the floor, they will sweep the floor. The workers should be willing to learn from the local brothers who take the lead. We first need to learn from others before we can lead others to learn from us. If we have a better way to sweep the floor, the leading brothers will notice and learn from us. However, some workers think that they are assigned to bear all the responsibility in a place. Therefore, they take over everything and assign the saints to sweep the floor, move tables, set up chairs, and do other services. It is not right to overturn everything that has been arranged by others.</p>
<p>It is also inappropriate for a worker to hold a conference simply because he knows more than the saints. Even if he truly knows something, there is no need for him to hold a conference. If there is a need to hold a conference, the local brothers should initiate it and ask the worker to help. A worker should never insist on holding a conference because he was sent by the workers to care for the church and to supply their need.</p>
<p>This has happened in the past, and it indicates that workers who have not learned some basic lessons should not go out to help the churches. Workers who have not learned these lessons are always eager to travel. They want to coordinate with saints in other places, even though they cannot coordinate with the saints in their own locality. Hence, the workers who want to go out must learn some serious lessons. In many cases, the workers who want to travel should stay in their locality, and the workers who are reluctant to travel should be sent out to supply the churches. Often, the workers who want to travel have problems in their locality; consequently, they are eager to go out. The saints are happy when these workers go out to travel. Such workers should not travel. When workers who may not want to travel are sent out, the saints miss them because these workers are always taking care of the needs of the church. Such workers truly supply the churches. This is a good lesson for us to learn.</p>
<p>A worker who cannot coordinate with the local saints should examine himself. The workers must learn this lesson. We should never blame the saints and say that they cannot coordinate with us. Rather, we should find the reason that we cannot coordinate with them. This can be compared to a child learning to write. There is no problem with the pen and the ink; the problem is that the child lacks practice and skill. Hence, when we encounter a problem, we should consider ourselves, not the saints. We must learn this lesson.</p>
<p>There are many scientific things that I do not understand, but I know and understand spiritual matters. We should be able to coordinate with anyone. As long as we learn spiritual lessons, we will be able to coordinate with any brother.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING SKILLS<br />
IN ADDITION TO LEARNING LESSONS</h2>
<p>In order to coordinate, we not only need to learn lessons; even more we need to learn skills. To learn a skill does not mean that we are political. Rather, it means that we learn to handle a situation. When we cannot coordinate with the saints, we should consider whether we should change the way that we coordinate. We need to willingly and in all sincerity seek the advice of the saints whom we are coordinating with.</p>
<p>I am the most troublesome worker. I have adjusted others frequently and pointed out their mistakes. Nevertheless, wherever I go, I can coordinate with the saints and not cause anyone to be irritated and stop serving. In order to coordinate, we must learn to accommodate others and be willing to learn from them. This requires much learning. This is a spiritual lesson in the divine life that requires much time and practice to learn.</p>
<p>In the same principle, we should never say that we cannot get through because the saints do not accept our work. We should never condemn the saints and say that they are too busy, their hearts are hardened, or they do not have a heart for the Lord. There would be no need for us to preach the gospel if the people in the world had a heart for the Lord. Neither would there be a need for us to supply the saints if every brother and sister were like the apostle Paul. The saints need us to work with them and serve them because they are busy and have a less than fervent heart for the Lord. Therefore, we should never leave a place simply because we encounter some difficulty. If we cannot get through in one way, we should find another way, and if the second way does not work, we should try a third way. We should continue trying until we get through.</p>
<p>There is no place or person that cannot be built up. Some tools can cut wood, and other tools can cut diamonds. When we were in England, we were taken to a place where diamonds are cut. Diamond is the hardest rock. It is easy to find a person who can cut glass or metal, but it is difficult to find a person who can cut a diamond. To cut a diamond requires skill; it does not depend on the diamond. Therefore, we should never say that we cannot work in a place because the saints are not good and because they reject our work. We must learn spiritual lessons and also learn skills.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO BE FLEXIBLE IN THE WORK</h2>
<p>In addition to learning to coordinate and learning skills, the workers must learn to be flexible in their work. Sometimes the workers are rigid and cannot accommodate others. The medicine that a doctor prescribes for a patient can be taken in different ways. The medicine can be injected into the patient, or it can be taken as a pill, as powder, or as a solution. The same medication can be dispensed in many ways. Similarly, our labor should not be rigid. We should consider the situation and be able to adapt.</p>
<p>We should not say, for example, that we cannot do anything because the saints do not want our help in a particular matter. For example, we should not be helpless if the saints do not want to study the Bible. Some people are able to receive an injection, but others are frightened as soon as they see a needle. They may need to take the medication orally. We need to be flexible. If it is difficult to lead the saints to study the Bible on their own, we should speak something concerning the Bible to stir up their interest. We can also ask questions related to the Bible. We should be willing to try different ways.</p>
<p>The character of a worker should be strong yet pliable. It is regrettable that some workers are stubborn and have a strong disposition. They always do what they want to do. Once they decide to do something, they cannot be changed. They desire to impart the Lord into others, but they are strict and inflexible in their way. Every mother must learn to feed her children and not force them to eat.</p>
<p>I enjoy helping the young saints and the older saints. I would never say that I am here to help only the young people and will not work with the older saints. We must serve the Lord even if there are no young people. We need to help and supply all the saints, whether they are old or young.</p>
<p>We should not require others to accommodate us, neither should we demand that the environment cooperate with us. Rather, we should be flexible to work in any environment and to fit in with the local situation. Even if the local saints do not seem like suitable material and are barely alive, we need to supply them and enable them to rise up. Those who serve the Lord need such a spirit. The workers who have this spirit are effective. They grasp every opportunity to labor. When there are many opportunities, we need to consider which is the best or which requires the most attention. If there is a group of young people longing to be supplied, we should grasp the opportunity to supply them. This is to be flexible. Some workers are so rigid that they are willing to supply only the older saints. The younger saints may express a desire to be supplied, but these workers will supply only the older saints.</p>
<p>A worker of the Lord must be flexible and lively. For example, a successful businessman, who is occupied with making a profit, cannot easily be offended. He does not have time to complain. If he has an opportunity to make a profit, he will do business since he cares only about making a profit. This is the way that we should labor. We should always endeavor to impart something into the saints and help them.</p>
<p>A worker who wants to coordinate with the local brothers must learn to be strict with himself and not blame the brothers. He must not, for example, say that he cannot work in a place because the local saints do not accept his fellowship concerning the cross. Neither should he say that he cannot work in a place because he wants to preach the gospel, but the local saints do not have a gospel spirit. Instead, he should say that he cannot work in a place because he does not know how to coordinate with others.</p>
<p>I cannot defend a brother who says that he is unable to work in a place because the saints are difficult. His complaining shows that he still has lessons to learn. We have heard messages concerning the discipline of the Holy Spirit. We should accept the situations that we encounter as the discipline of the Holy Spirit and learn from them. We should consider the reason that it is difficult to coordinate with the saints, and the reason that the saints do not respond to our work. This is the discipline of the Holy Spirit so that we can learn the lesson of the cross and can coordinate with others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING NOT TO HAVE OPINIONS</h2>
<p>Everyone has opinions. No one can claim that he does not have opinions. However, as long as we have opinions about any place or person, we have not learned the necessary lessons. When we learn the lessons, we will not have opinions about the brothers and sisters living in the workers&rsquo; home or about the church service. Instead, we will be in harmony with the saints.</p>
<p>Arguing with the brothers shows that we need to learn the lesson of not having opinions. I have learned this lesson. I have encountered opinionated brothers, ill-tempered brothers, and difficult brothers. The Lord put me with these brothers, and by His mercy I do not have opinions, nor do I complain. I know only to learn the lesson.</p>
<p>If we are willing to receive this word and learn the lessons that we need in order to coordinate with others, to be flexible, and to not have opinions, we will be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand and gain spiritual weight. Our inability to coordinate with others proves that we still need to learn some lessons. If our work is not effective, it means that we are not flexible. We should not have opinions about anyone or anything in the work.</p>
<p>These may seem to be small matters, but they are serious. If we cannot coordinate with the local brothers or the local saints, we cannot coordinate with our fellow workers. If our work is ineffective in one place, it will be ineffective in every place, and if we are in discord with the brothers in one locality, we will be in discord with the brothers in every place. This is a serious test.</p>
<p>If we do not want to serve the Lord, we can ignore these matters. However, if we want to serve the Lord, we must learn these practical lessons. Then we will be able to coordinate with any brother. We will also be able to be one with any brother, regardless of how quarrelsome and troublesome he may be. We will not murmur. Then we will have the Lord&rsquo;s blessing, no matter where we are or what we do. Moreover, our work will have real spiritual weight.</p>
<p>Some may consider this as a matter of being broken. But instead of stressing being broken, I would rather speak of learning the lessons. We need to learn these lessons. Over the years many brothers and sisters have learned these lessons, and as a result, they have genuine spiritual growth. However, we still have more to learn.</p>
<p>There are two more matters that require our attention. One is the effectiveness of our work, and the other is the messages that we give from the podium. Some brothers are capable, but their work has no effect. We need to pray and look to the Lord to find out the reason and make any necessary adjustments. Similarly, some brothers can give good messages, but there is no effect. We must also seek the Lord concerning this to find out the reason. Every good tree produces good fruit. A tree that does not produce fruit is not a bad tree, but there is something wrong with it. May we all learn to solve the problems so that the Lord&rsquo;s work can have a clear and free way among us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">OUR USEFULNESS IN THE LORD&rsquo;S HAND</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF THE LITERATURE WORK</h2>
<p>The saints who labor in the literature work need a proper understanding. It may seem that the work done in the editorial room is insignificant, but it is greater than the work of speaking from the podium. We distributed over one hundred forty thousand copies of the pamphlet concerning how to enjoy God. This shows that the literature work is not a small matter. Therefore, we should not despise the work in our hand. The editorial room may seem small, but the work is not small.</p>
<p>In Washington, D. C., there was a Chinese sister who met with us, and she asked where she could find messages that were similar to the ones that she had heard. This sister attended meetings in different places but had never heard messages like the ones in our meetings. Our messages touched her inner being. For this reason she asked where she could find more messages. I referred her to the Gospel Book Room in Taipei and told her that it published many books and had recently printed a pamphlet on how to enjoy God. I also wrote the Book Room and requested that some copies of <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> magazine and books on the enjoyment of God be sent to her. In a short time, she received the publications. Since she did not want to receive the books for free, she made a small payment to the Book Room.</p>
<p>In a letter to me she wrote, &ldquo;Among the so-called spiritual books in this age, one can rarely find words that shine forth so brightly. I pray that the Lord will use you and that your books will be translated into many languages to enlighten and satisfy the hungry ones everywhere. After you left, my husband was saved, and he now meets with some brothers once a week to pray. I thank the Lord that we have His presence, oneness, and sweet fellowship. The brothers and sisters are praying for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This testimony should burden us to pray for the literature work. The brothers and sisters who are laboring in the literature work should be encouraged by the great and urgent need among Christians and by their positive response to our literature.</p>
<p>This is the reason that we should translate some of the important messages into English. People in Japan also understand English. We met a Japanese brother who is a university graduate and speaks very good English. We spoke with him in English and had no problem understanding him. When we were in Japan, I sometimes spoke a message in Chinese, and a brother would translate it into English, because we do not have brothers who speak Japanese fluently enough to translate my messages. The majority of people in Japan with a college education understand English.</p>
<p>The situation is the same in other countries. People who have higher education understand English. We do not need to use advanced English grammar when we translate our messages. Simple English is good enough. Even though the English is simple, it is full of spiritual content. This is similar to using the level of English spoken in elementary school to explain an important scientific principle. The ministry will spread farther if we publish our books in English. I believe that this is the Lord&rsquo;s leading. If our literature does not go out and if the saints rarely go out for the propagation, we will be limited in what we can supply to other believers. For example, during my trip overseas, I did not have much opportunity to contact people and I was not able to speak many messages. Moreover, only a limited number of people, maybe not more than two thousand, were able to attend the meetings that we held in the different places. If the literature goes out, however, it will reach more people. Through the written word people will become clear concerning the messages that the Lord is releasing among us.</p>
<p>Because Brother T. Austin-Sparks often speaks of us in his ministry, many places in America and Europe are aware of us. However, they do not know what kind of &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; we have. They are not clear concerning our ministry, because our literature does not reach them. Thus far only two books are available to believers in the West. One book&mdash;<em>The Normal Christian Church Life</em>&mdash;is composed of messages given by Brother Nee in London twenty years ago. The other&mdash;<em>The Normal Christian Life</em>&mdash;stirred up a strong response when it was released, and it has rendered much help to many believers.</p>
<p>There are also a few articles written by a sister in the West and published in Brother Sparks&rsquo; magazine, <em>A Witness and a Testimony</em>. Last summer, when Brother Sparks held his annual conference, many believers read the articles. One of our brothers who attended the conference said that the articles in the magazine did not adequately represent what was available through our ministry. The believers abroad do not know about the work that we are doing in the Far East. They do not know our ministry or our focus. However, once our literature goes out, they will be clear concerning our focus, and I am convinced that this is what they need.</p>
<p>Believers in the West do not have the messages that our literature provides. The books in Christianity do not contain what we have. Hence, the believers are spiritually impoverished. Not many good Christian books have been printed in recent years; therefore, in America classical Christian books from the second and third centuries are being reprinted. There is a market for these books in seminaries and Christian libraries, and believers who seek the Lord are collecting these books. In recent years a large number of out-of-print classics have been reprinted. Books concerning church history and books written by the church fathers are also being reprinted in large sizes and in sets.</p>
<p>The reprinting of spiritual classics indicates that not many books with content have been printed in recent years. The subject matter of nearly all of the new books is sugarcoated; the books do not have any content. This is the condition of Christianity in the West. Except for the magazine <em>A Witness and a Testimony,</em> put out by Brother Sparks, the publications available to believers do not contain any substance. Most of them contain only promotional material, advertisements, and photographs.</p>
<p>If the Lord would have mercy on us and raise up some brothers to translate our literature into English, there will be a good response after our literature is distributed. The Lord did not give us these messages only for us; they are for His entire Body. We should enjoy these messages in the Far East, and the churches in the West should also receive the supply. Therefore, the messages that we labor on are the foundation. As soon as there are saints available to do the translation work, we should translate our books into English. This will be a great benefit to the believers in the West. The translation work is somewhat easier than the work on the original messages. The saints who are preparing the messages to be printed in Chinese are laboring to put out the spiritual supply in a solid way. This labor is worthwhile. For the sake of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, we must continue in this work.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING BEING USEFUL IN THE LORD&rsquo;S HAND</h2>
<p>I would like to fellowship concerning our usefulness in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. As those who serve the Lord, our usefulness is crucial. We want to have spiritual weight, but we must realize that spiritual weight is for us to be useful. As we serve the Lord, the most important matter is our usefulness.</p>
<p>Over the years the Lord has used us for His work on this island. However, we have limited the Lord much more than we have been used by Him. In other words, we have not been as useful as we could have been, because there are problems that hinder our usefulness. These problems limit the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Therefore, we all need to go before the Lord to see how we limit Him. We all limit the Lord in one way or another. We may limit the Lord in one way, in a few ways, or in many ways. Consequently, we are used by the Lord on the one hand, but we limit Him on the other. Instead of being greatly used by the Lord, we are used only in a limited way. This proves that there are problems in our usefulness. If we do not resolve these problems, we will always limit the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Heart Being Enlarged</h2>
<p>The heart of the Lord&rsquo;s worker must be enlarged. A worker must have a large heart. This does not mean that we should be proud. Things in the world and in human society are often full of contradictions. For example, a person with a small heart is more likely to be proud, but a person with a large heart is less likely to be proud. It may seem that a person with a large heart would be proud. However, a person who is truly enlarged is not proud, but a person who is small and fine is often proud. The smaller a person&rsquo;s heart is, the prouder he tends to be, and the larger a person&rsquo;s heart is, the humbler he tends to be.</p>
<p>To have an enlarged heart does not mean to be proud. It means that a person&rsquo;s heart is as inclusive and broad as God&rsquo;s heart. Solomon is an example of a person with a large heart. In 1 Kings God gave Solomon largeness of heart and wisdom (4:29). Most believers know that God gave Solomon wisdom (3:9, 12), but they do not know that God also gave Solomon a large heart. First Kings 4:29 says that largeness of heart is like the sand on the seashore. The seashore encloses the sea. Therefore, God gave Solomon a heart that is larger than the sea.</p>
<p>Everyone who is truly wise has a large heart. A person with a narrow heart is foolish, but a person with a large heart is wise. A large heart and wisdom cannot be separated. A wise person has a large and broad heart. God gave Solomon wisdom by giving him a large heart.</p>
<p>A person who has a large heart is inclusive. A person who aspires to be great or to do a great work does not have a large heart. None of us should have the thought to be great or to do a great work. On the contrary, as those who serve the Lord, we must learn to let God enlarge our heart so that we are considerate of God&rsquo;s heart. When we are concerned with what is on God&rsquo;s heart, our concern will match God&rsquo;s concern, and our intention will match God&rsquo;s intention. This is closely related to our capacity and affects our usefulness in God&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Some people aim too high and are not realistic. This is not a large heart. These believers dream of the day when they are able to lead a multitude of sinners to salvation and perfect many saints. To have such thoughts is to give free rein to fantasy. This is to have a heart that is not large. We must learn to come before the Lord, be calm, and allow Him to enlarge our heart so that we consider His heart and care for what He cares for. Then our spiritual knowledge and learning will not be one-sided; instead, it will have many sides. An enlarged heart is not one-sided. A person who is one-sided can be compared to an unturned cake (Hosea 7:8). With time he becomes spiritually unbalanced and deficient. A spiritually unbalanced believer does not have an enlarged heart.</p>
<p>If our heart is enlarged, we will not be unbalanced in our spiritual knowledge and learning. Moreover, we will not be unbalanced in the ministry. Every worker should have a particular ministry, but we should not focus on our ministry. If we do, we will suffer loss. We should be general rather than specialized. It is better to know a little of everything than to know only one thing. When the young saints begin to serve the Lord, it is better for them to learn to be general. This is the way that students are taught in the world. A medical student must study every field. He studies the ear, nose, and throat, the eyes, internal medicine, gynecology, and pediatrics. He must learn everything. After he has a solid base of medical knowledge, he can specialize in one area. He would have serious problems in the future if he were to begin his medical training by specializing in one area. Hence, it is necessary for him to first study general subjects.</p>
<p>Those who are beginning to serve the Lord must learn to do everything. We should not say that we want only to preach the gospel. This is our preference and not the result of being enlarged by God. We must be enlarged by God until we are willing to learn to pray, read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, touch the inner sense, fellowship with the saints, be proper deacons, and even learn to be elders. We should not despise our youth. Not only so, the brothers should learn to do the things that the sisters do, and the sisters should learn to do the things that the brothers do. When we begin to serve the Lord, we must begin with &ldquo;general practice.&rdquo; If after seven years we know only how to read the Bible or how to enter our private room and pray, we will not be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>The best preparation for one who serves the Lord is for him to endeavor to learn as many things as possible in the first ten years of his service. Any believer who wants to learn how to serve the Lord should be helped to learn every service. It may be that he learns one service for two months and then another service for another two months. It is important for him to learn to do everything. If he serves in this way, after a while he will be clear concerning the focus of his service.</p>
<p>A believer who is restricted to a particular service is not very useful. A believer who is useful is not restricted in his service. He can be specialized in one thing but not restricted to one thing. Rather, he does many things and functions in many areas so that he is not limited in his ministry.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Broad in the Ministry</h2>
<p>If we receive a definite commission from the Lord, we will not be limited in our usefulness. Hudson Taylor is an example. For decades I considered different things related to him. However, it was not until recently that one particular point impressed me. Hudson Taylor was not a person with the gift to preach the gospel. According to his biography, he was not good at preaching the gospel, but he received the burden to preach the gospel. Hudson Taylor was not a powerful evangelist. The messages he preached were mostly related to living in the Lord&rsquo;s presence and fellowshipping with the Lord. Over the past two thousand years no one has spoken a clearer word on John 15 than the word he spoke. He touched the essence of this chapter. However, the commission that he received from the Lord was not to preach John 15. His commission was for something different.</p>
<p>Our problem is that we either receive a burden but lack spiritual learning, or we have the necessary spiritual learning but are trapped in the learning and reject everything else. Either we are trapped in what we know, or we are enthusiastic and attempt to work in an unrestrained way without the necessary learning. These considerations make us useless in the Lord&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Hudson Taylor is one of the few believers who were greatly used by the Lord in the last one hundred years. He was greatly used by the Lord because he was not limited to his learning to live in the Lord&rsquo;s presence. He received a burden and a commission that were beyond his learning. Hudson Taylor was a great person. He had a heart that was truly enlarged by God; hence, he did not desire to be great. His biography shows that he was a humble man. Hudson Taylor was one of the believers who was truly low. He felt that he was useless, but his heart was enlarged by God.</p>
<p>One day as he stood by the seashore and looked over the ocean, he received a burden from the Lord. He considered that in the vast land of China four hundred million people had not heard the gospel. Even though Christianity had come to China, the missionaries mostly worked along the coastal regions. They did not go inland. He considered the thousands of people who died every day without hearing the gospel. Therefore, he said to the Lord that he was willing to receive a burden. He formed the China Inland Mission with the particular burden of spreading the gospel to the interior of China. Initially, he oversaw everything, and there was not much organization. It was only later that it became a large organization. Hudson Taylor was moved by God. Regrettably, when other workers joined him, other elements were added, which weakened the work. The burden that Hudson Taylor received from the Lord, however, was truly a spiritual matter that touched God&rsquo;s intention.</p>
<p>Hudson Taylor&rsquo;s move not only enabled many Chinese people to hear the gospel, but it also stirred up many believers from Europe and America to rise up to spread the gospel, especially to China. Moreover, a large amount of money was given for the gospel. This was a great matter that brought in innumerable blessings to the church of God. Hudson Taylor was a lowly man. He did not regard himself as someone great and important. His heart was enlarged by God. He was not limited by what he knew or by what he was able to do. His heart was enlarged by the Lord.</p>
<p>If we are proud, we are foolish and vain. Our heart needs to be enlarged by God. We should ask God to enlarge our heart. When our heart is enlarged, we will not care only for the work that we are doing; neither will we care only for the church in our locality. We will not say that because we are in Kaohsiung or Keelung, we care only for Kaohsiung or Keelung. Instead, if we are in Kaohsiung, we will care for Kaohsiung more than we did previously, and if we are in Keelung, we will care for Keelung in a better way than we did previously. But at the same time we will care for the churches in other places. This depends on our being broadened.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Inclusive and<br />
Able to Coordinate with Others</h2>
<p>When our heart is enlarged, our spiritual knowledge and learning will not be unbalanced and lifeless. At the same time we will be broad in the ministry and care for the churches everywhere. If we want to be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, our heart must be large. God cannot use a person with a narrow heart. If God gives us a few workers to coordinate with, we might say that there are too many and that they are bothersome. Workers who say this are useless in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. Our heart must be so enlarged that we do not consider it a problem to coordinate with three hundred, five hundred, eight hundred, or even a thousand workers. We should be able to handle the situation, and whether or not the workers are useful, they should be able to work in coordination with us. Our heart must be enlarged so that whether or not the workers are good, they can labor with us. The larger a person&rsquo;s heart is, the more he is able to keep others in the coordination. Therefore, our ability to labor with others depends on our heart being enlarged.</p>
<p>The main reason we cannot coordinate with the brothers in the different places is that we have a small, narrow heart. It is not that the saints are a problem but that we have a narrow heart. We should never blame others and say that their heart is narrow. It does not matter whether their heart is narrow. If our heart is large, we will be able to embrace the saints who have a small heart. As soon as we include them, there will be harmony. There will be a harmonious situation with no disputes. The main reason we cannot get along with the saints and coordinate with them is that we have a small heart. Our heart is not enlarged, and we are limited. Because we are limited, we do not include others. Therefore, we have problems. On the contrary, when we accommodate the saints, there are no problems. This does not mean that we are like people in the world who play politics. We need to go to the Lord in all sincerity to be trained by Him so that our heart is enlarged. Then we will be able to include the saints.</p>
<p>If God can enlarge our heart, there is no way to estimate how useful we will be to Him. Our heart determines our usefulness. A person with a narrow heart is not that useful in God&rsquo;s hand. Our usefulness is related to the largeness of our heart.</p><h2 class="head2">Having Faith</h2>
<p>It is not easy for a person with a small heart to have faith. It is rare for a small-hearted person to have genuine faith. Anyone who has faith has a large heart. From God&rsquo;s point of view, our faith is as small as a mustard seed (Luke 17:6). However, every matter related to faith is immeasurably great. The mustard seed is small, but the issue of such a small seed is immeasurable. A small amount of faith can produce a great result. Our faith depends on our heart. If our heart is large, we will spontaneously have faith.</p>
<p>We may speak of faith as being large or small, but a small-hearted person does not have faith. Only a large-hearted person has faith. If our heart is large, we do not need to plan how to take care of our living or how to pay for our expenses. A large-hearted person does not worry about such minor items. This is the kind of help that we receive from reading the biography of spiritual persons. Hudson Taylor and others who were used by God did not have banks or committees to support their work. This is a reason that we should learn to have a large heart. Once our heart is enlarged, it will be easy for us to have faith. The larger our heart is, the more faith we will have. Our faith will be so immeasurable that we will believe that God can do extraordinary things. However, no one can encourage or force us to have such faith. Having faith that trusts in God depends on our heart being enlarged.</p>
<p>The population of the world has increased over the years. Even though the rate of increase is constantly accelerating, people today do not necessarily live in a poorer condition than people in the ancient days. The larger a population is, the greater the financial pressure, but it seems that people are even wealthier. For example, the population of Taiwan is ten million, and it increases yearly by three hundred thousand people, which is the population of the city of Kaohsiung. This poses a problem to the government in Taiwan, because in ten years the population increase will be ten times the population of Kaohsiung. Moreover, the population increase is exponential; more people beget more children. Thus, in ten years there may be a yearly increase of four hundred thousand. We should not worry about how these people will live. Taiwan will probably be more prosperous by then. All the numbers are in God&rsquo;s hand. God allows people to be poor or rich. Whether a person is poor or rich is in God&rsquo;s hand. No one can control this.</p>
<p>We should never consider how poor the saints are or how impoverished the place is where we labor. Once we consider these matters, we have no way to go on. Even when we are financially pressed on every side with no way out, our help comes from God. This is beyond our expectation. Hence, we need living faith. A mustard seed may be small in size, but because it is living, it can produce great results.</p>
<p>Living faith depends on a heart that is enlarged. A believer who is specialized does not have much potential before the Lord. No matter how much he endeavors to learn, he will not be useful to the Lord. His primary need is to allow God to enlarge his heart. Once the heart is enlarged, it is easy to have living faith. A worker should believe in God&rsquo;s grace and mercy and not in his planning or imagination. What God measures out to us is not according to our expectation, and it is beyond our calculations. If we allow God to work in us and enlarge our heart, it will be easy for us to have faith that grows and is living. Instead of being influenced by the environment, we will receive God&rsquo;s mercy to see that all things in the universe are in His hand for the accomplishment of His work. The Lord&rsquo;s special mercy and blessing exceed our faith.</p>
<p>If we would work for the Lord and be useful in His hand, we must have living faith. We should learn to receive a burden from the Lord; that is, to receive His commission. We cannot receive a burden if we have a small heart, do not have faith, and only walk by sight. Even if God gives us a vision and a burden, we will not receive it if our heart is small. If we have a small heart and no faith, the vision with the burden that comes from the Lord will simply vanish like a fleeting cloud. It is not that God does not give us a vision but that we do not receive it, because our heart is small and we lack faith. God&rsquo;s vision and burden are great, but if our heart is too small to receive them, our usefulness will be limited.</p>
<p>God gives faith and enlarges our heart. When our heart is large, it is easy to have living faith. Living faith enables us to receive God&rsquo;s commission, God&rsquo;s burden. This has everything to do with our function and our usefulness. Billy Graham was raised up by the Lord less than ten years ago and is not yet forty years old. The reason he is able to carry out his work is that he has a large heart. He is young, competent, and steady, not proud or arrogant. His large heart gives him a living faith that enables him to receive the burden of the gospel. The burden he received is from God.</p>
<p>Some orthodox Christians in America are unreasonable in opposing Billy Graham. Without the proper view from God, a doctrine may be dead. God asked the prophets to do things that seemed unreasonable. For example, He asked the prophet Hosea to marry a prostitute (Hosea 1:2). Hosea could only follow this command, even though he would be criticized. Some believers are opposed to Billy Graham and his crusades because even people from heretical groups attend the crusades. Billy Graham, however, cares only that people hear the gospel. He does not care who hears the gospel. He would preach the gospel even if the devil attended a crusade.</p>
<p>This shows that Billy Graham has an enlarged heart. He stands with God and preaches the word to whoever attends. He does not try to please people. He has living faith and receives his burden from God. The Spirit affirms his labor with a strong result and supplies him. This does not mean, however, that we should imitate him. In principle, we should receive help from others, but we are accountable to God for our work.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SKILLS FOR SERVING</h2>
<p>Many brothers are still not willing to learn lessons. They lack resolution and perseverance. For example, we have heard about the skill to labor, observed how others labor, and we have labored; however, we still are not skilled, because our heart is not set to learn in a deep way. We know how to preach the gospel, but the way that we preach is not so effective. We may all know how to do something, but how much you know is different from how much I know. Different degrees of knowing make some workers skilled and others not as skilled. We all know how to preach the gospel, but some of us are determined to learn in a deep way and others are not.</p>
<p>Some workers do not have the skill to preach the gospel, give a message, lead the saints, or fellowship with the saints. Hence, their work is average. They are not effective when they minister the word, preach the gospel, or help the saints. We should not continue to labor in this way. Spiritual labor requires much skill. The workers who are most capable are the ones who are willing to spend much time and effort to learn. We should not think that we can gain something by taking shortcuts. We should never take shortcuts to learn a skill. The only way to learn a skill is to have a strong resolve and to persevere and endeavor to learn.</p>
<p>When I was at Honor Oak, I noticed that the believers were encouraged to be spiritual, but they were not given the opportunity to manifest their function in the meetings, they did not receive practical training, nor did they have the opportunity to serve. When the saints came together, they only listened to messages. Most of the time Brother T. Austin-Sparks spoke, and the rest listened. Brother Sparks has a portion from the Lord and renders much help to others, but he does not give others the opportunity to learn to serve.</p>
<p>I stayed with them for more than a month but did not meet many elders. It did not seem as if the elders have much work, because they met only once during that month. Brother T. Austin-Sparks asked me to speak in almost every meeting. He may have done this because we asked him to speak in every meeting when he was here. Before the meeting the elders met together and prayed on their knees for twenty to thirty minutes. Sometimes Brother Sparks also made arrangements for practical matters.</p>
<p>I observed brothers and sisters who have a heart to learn spiritual things, but they were not given the opportunity to serve. Some of them are called by the Lord and should go out to labor, but there are no arrangements for them to go, and they do not receive any confirmation. The answer they received was to seek the Lord further and see how He leads them. Eventually, they do not know what to do.</p>
<p>This is the reason that I released a message concerning the need to manifest our function for the building up of the church. I pointed out that instead of replacing the saints, the gifted members should perfect the saints to manifest their function. I also said that the gifted saints should not hold everything in their hands. They should give every saint an opportunity to practice. I emphasized many times the matter of giving everyone an opportunity to learn and practice. In our physical body every member requires exercise. A child begins to crawl when it is ten months old. Then he learns to stand and then to walk.</p>
<p>My last meeting with the whole congregation was a week before my departure. The meeting was open for everyone to ask questions. Brother Sparks was the moderator, and he encouraged the brothers and sisters to grasp the opportunity to ask questions. A brother said that they were taught that function comes from the growth in life; consequently, they were taught that there was no need to practice. He asked whether growth and practice were contradictory. This question indicated that there was a response to the messages that I had given concerning the building. In my answer I said that life is definitely needed. We can give a dog or a cat lessons on pronunciation, but a dog will always bark and a cat will always meow. A cat will always sound like a cat, and a dog will always sound like a dog. Neither can speak like a human. This is according to their growth in life.</p>
<p>I then gave another example and said that I am in my fifties and am quite experienced, but my English is not as fluent as an eight-year-old boy in England. This is not a matter of life but of training. If I grew up in a British family, I would speak excellent English, even though I am Chinese. My English is poor because I did not have the opportunity to practice.</p>
<p>Their reaction to my response indicated that my answer was different from what they were taught. After this illustration, I did not feel that it was necessary to speak further. My intention was to show that we would be limited in our work if we focused only on life and ignored practical training. We should never think that we are a slow learner and therefore cannot preach the gospel or give a message. Except for those who are born dumb, everyone is able to speak. How we speak depends on whether we are willing to make an effort to learn and practice.</p>
<p>Before I left Honor Oak I gave another message on the three <em>T</em> books, which are 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus. I said that there are two lines in the Epistles. One line, from the book of Romans to 2 Thessalonians, shows that Christ is our life and that the church comes out of Christ as a product of Christ. Even though we know that the church is out of Christ and is in Christ, we may not know how to take care of the church. We may know that there are elders in the church, but we may not know the function of the elders. We may also know that there are deacons in the church, but we may not know the function of the deacons.</p>
<p>This is the reason that there is a second line in the Epistles, the three <em>T</em> books, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus. The general subject of these three books concerns how we should conduct ourselves in the house of God. In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul said, &ldquo;If I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God.&rdquo; In these three books the apostle presents the qualifications of the elders and how elders are appointed, the qualifications of the deacons and how they are chosen, and how to treat the saints of different ages.</p>
<p>These three books say that we should learn, practice, train, and teach. If we read these books, we will find the words <em>learn, closely followed my teaching, knowing from which ones you have learned them,</em> and <em>you have heard from me</em> (1 Tim. 2:11; 5:4; 2 Tim. 3:10, 14; 1:13; 2:2). Paul even charged Timothy to commit what he learned to faithful men who could teach others also (v. 2). Paul did not speak much concerning life or spiritual things in these three books. Instead, he spoke much concerning learning, teaching, exercising, and practical arrangements. He said, &ldquo;Exercise yourself unto godliness&rdquo; (1 Tim. 4:7). This is the second line of the apostle&rsquo;s fellowship in the Epistles.</p>
<p>We should not focus only on one line. We need to be filled with Christ, take Christ as everything, and see that the church is Christ. However, if we know only this line but not the second line, we will encounter problems. What should we do when we are filled with Christ, and how should we conduct ourselves in the house of God? We need the three <em>T</em> books to see the aspect of practical training. These books are full of arrangements, even concerning trivial matters. Paul said, &ldquo;The cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, bring when you come, and the scrolls, especially the parchments...Be diligent to come before winter&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:13, 21). These are practical arrangements that are not the result of the growth in life. Timothy could be spiritual and speak of life, but here Paul said that he should bring the parchments. This proves that the divine life, without training, is not sufficient in the administration of the church. There must also be practical arrangements.</p>
<p>The apostle made many arrangements. He seemed to say, &ldquo;Timothy, find believers who are competent and teach them what I taught you so that they can teach others.&rdquo; This is an arrangement and a training. Hence, we should not trust only in the gifts of life. There is no problem with the divine life, but we do not have enough learning. We have not made sufficient effort to learn. Therefore, we should not say that we are not as talented as Brother So-and-so or Sister So-and-so and that we will give up because we lack spiritual gifts. If we are not willing to learn, our situation will definitely become worse over time. We were called by God and have consecrated ourselves to Him. Hence, we should be desperate to learn. If we do not learn and are not skilled in our work, we will cause the Lord&rsquo;s work to suffer loss.</p>
<p>Some workers in the past were not serious in their service; however, we must be serious and learn earnestly. After this trip abroad I have much feeling. Many elementary school students study until eleven o&rsquo;clock at night and get up in the morning earlier than their parents. By seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning they are ready for school, and they do not return home until six in the evening. It is not easy for elementary school students, because if they do not study hard, they will not pass the entrance examination for middle school. If the workers were as diligent as elementary school students, they would be more useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Elementary school students do not study hard of their own accord. They are forced to study hard. In contrast, we often shirk our responsibility with the excuse that we are not capable. We need to learn because we are not capable. If we are capable, we do not need to learn. We also need to learn because we do not understand. If we understand, there is no need to learn. Some workers could be very useful, but they do not have a heart to learn, to persevere, and to make an effort to be useful. If we want to learn something, we must persevere until we learn. We also need a will to suffer. We should not back down in the face of difficulty. Hence, it is not a matter of knowing how to do something but of whether we are willing to learn. We should never say, for example, that we cannot speak. If we are willing to learn, we will be able to speak.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BROKEN IN OUR DISPOSITION<br />
TO COORDINATE WITH OTHERS</h2>
<p>Some among us are not able to coordinate with others. This is a problem. Some of us have a mild disposition and some tolerance. We may not argue or quarrel with others outwardly, but this may not reflect our true inward condition. We are in the Lord&rsquo;s work, but we cannot work with others. When we cannot coordinate with others, the Holy Spirit has no way to work with us.</p>
<p>To not be able to coordinate is more serious than to not work. If we cannot coordinate with the saints, it is better that we do not work. If we want our work to receive the Lord&rsquo;s blessing, we must be in one accord with others. A brother may know that he is in discord when he works with the saints and bears responsibility with them. In this situation there will be no blessing, regardless of how hard he works. At the same time he will not be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. His usefulness will be annulled if he cannot coordinate with others. If this is our situation, we must seriously deal with ourselves until we can be in one accord with others.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some brothers cannot be subject to others. They are not satisfied when others are above them. This is also a problem. We cannot expect to always be above others. We must learn to be under others and to be in one accord with them. However, some workers always want to be above others. They are not satisfied when others are above them.</p>
<p>These points are all related to our usefulness in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. If I were beginning to serve, I would not understand these things. I do not know many things in the world, but to some extent I know how to serve the Lord. There is no situation in the service that I do not understand.</p>
<p>We all love the Lord, and it is important for every brother and sister to love the Lord. We also know the flesh and the cross. Hence, there is no quarreling among us. However, it is not enough merely not to quarrel. Our inner being is still not up to the standard, because we are not in harmony with others, and we cannot coordinate. As a result, our work is short of the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. This is the issue of not learning lessons.</p>
<p>We have to learn skills for our labor and also lessons of life. These are related to our usefulness in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. On the one hand, we must learn lessons to have a large heart, to have living faith, and to receive the Lord&rsquo;s commission. Then one aspect of our usefulness will not be limited. On the other hand, we need to learn the skills to give a message, preach the gospel, expound the Bible, fellowship with the saints, and visit them.</p>
<p>We should not waste our time and think that it is easy to serve full time. If we do not learn these matters, our work will not have results, and there will be no blessing. If we want to have results and receive the blessing, we need to learn these things. When we coordinate with others, we need to learn the lesson of being broken in our disposition. This does not mean that we play politics. That is what society does, but it is not our way. We should learn the lesson of being broken so that we can be gentle and meek. Then we will be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, and our usefulness will increase with time.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH<br />
PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship a few matters concerning preaching the gospel. The church has decided to hold a gospel campaign during the Chinese New Year. Gospel meetings will be held simultaneously in numerous meeting halls. Therefore, we will fellowship concerning the practice of the church preaching the gospel and the way that we have learned to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>Nearly twenty years ago, in 1940, we received a clear revelation from the Lord that if we want the gospel to have impact, the whole church must preach the gospel. The first time the whole church rose up to preach the gospel was during the Chinese New Year of 1940. God&rsquo;s presence was with us, and the whole church preached the gospel.</p>
<p>Before we went out to preach the gospel, the church gathered together to fast and pray. In our prayer we touched heaven. I have attended numerous Christian prayer meetings over the past thirty years, but no meeting impressed me as much as that prayer meeting of the church. It shook the heavens and the earth. Perhaps some of the brothers and sisters here were present in that gathering. The saints fasted the whole day and came together in the evening to pray. Our prayer touched the throne of God and shook the power of Hades. We sensed this in our spirit. As a result of the prayer, everyone who participated on the first day felt the authority and power of God. We felt that God was manifested.</p>
<p>The saints later testified that everyone who attended the gospel meeting prostrated themselves before God. As soon as a person arrived at the meeting, he felt compelled to prostrate himself before God. This was not a physical falling down but the complete submission of a person&rsquo;s will. They could not help but receive the living Savior. In the gospel meeting we showed people that Satan, the devil, is an evil power in the universe, who has usurped man and put man in bondage. Everyone is under his authority. However, there is One who can deliver man out of the devil&rsquo;s hand. This One is Jesus Christ, the living Savior.</p>
<p>During the ten years prior to that gospel gathering, we never baptized more than fifty people in one month. But after that gathering we baptized at least one hundred twenty people every month for many months. In addition, everyone who was gained during that period experienced a dynamic salvation, and many are now serving full time in different places. This was the result of the church preaching the gospel.</p>
<p>Since that time we have emphasized the whole church preaching the gospel, particularly during the New Year celebration. The New Year is a time when people in the world, who are under the usurpation of Satan, indulge in all kinds of pleasures and lusts. This is the time when Satan deceives people the most. Hence, the church should rise up during this time and fight for men&rsquo;s souls and for God&rsquo;s name, His gospel, and His kingdom. For this reason, it was almost a rule that the whole church would preach the gospel during the New Year. We did not celebrate the New Year according to the custom of the world, because we do not accept the custom of celebrating New Year.</p>
<p>We decided that at the end of this year, 1958, we will use the beginning of a new year to preach the gospel. Furthermore, we will not follow any of the customs of the world. The Lord has enlightened us to see that in order to fight against the authority of darkness we cannot follow the customs of the world. If we celebrate the New Year as the people in the world do, we will fall into the hand of Satan and will not be able to fight against him. Neither will we be able to capture the souls that are in his hand. Therefore, in order to fight against Satan&rsquo;s authority of darkness, we must not be contaminated by worldly ways, such as the celebration of the New Year. We accept the years and months of God&rsquo;s creation, but we will not be contaminated by the customs of the world. We are on God&rsquo;s side to fight against Satan. While people in the world are eating, drinking, and making merry, we will pray and preach the gospel. Not only will we not eat, drink, or play as the world does, but even more, during that time we will fast. If we need to eat, our meals will be simple. We will devote all our time, energy, and strength to prayer and to invite people to gospel meetings, to lead them to salvation, to visit them, and to serve when the church preaches the gospel. All the saints will be mobilized in the gospel.</p>
<p>For the past ten years we have seen the special blessing by God and His presence whenever the church practiced this. This practice is not carried out by depending on a great evangelist; instead, the whole church has the priesthood. The church is a spiritual army in which everyone participates. This is the gospel preaching of the church. It does not depend solely on one person speaking from the podium. It is a matter of the church, not an individual matter. This is what Philippians 1 says. The believers in Philippi had &ldquo;fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel&rdquo; (v. 5), and &ldquo;in one spirit, with one soul&rdquo; they were &ldquo;striving together along with the faith of the gospel&rdquo; (v. 27). As a result, the church in Philippi was prosperous and full of joy. The brothers and sisters who take part in the service need to receive a burden. They should not come merely to listen to the gospel but to preach the gospel. We do not go to a gospel meeting to see how others preach the gospel. We have a burden for the gospel, and we bear the &ldquo;Ark&rdquo; of the gospel together with the other saints. We bear the same burden together. This is a matter for the whole church.</p><h2 class="head1">PREPARATIONS FOR PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Praying with Authority</h2>
<p>We will now fellowship a few matters concerning preaching the gospel. When we preach the gospel, we first need to pray. Preaching the gospel is a matter of spiritual warfare. Merely preaching doctrine cannot turn a person. People do not believe in the Lord, because they are completely deceived by Satan. Even though unbelievers realize that there are benefits to believing in Jesus, they still oppose the gospel and reject the Lord. Their refusal to believe in Him is the result of Satan&rsquo;s activity within them. Satan deceives, blinds, usurps, and controls men. For this reason, we must pray. We must pray to touch the throne of God, rather than pray merely for a powerful message. We must pray to shake the gates of Hades, that is, to shake the authority of Satan.</p>
<p>We should bow our knees and pray that the Lord would shake Satan&rsquo;s kingdom and men&rsquo;s hearts. Instead of asking the Lord and pleading with Him, our prayer should release people&rsquo;s souls. This is more than asking. We belong to Christ who is victorious; therefore, we are also victorious. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations&rdquo; (Matt. 28:18-19). The Lord charges us to go and preach the gospel to all the people in the nations so that they may become the Lord&rsquo;s disciples. Therefore, this is a time to exercise authority, not to cry and plead. We can exercise authority because all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to us. This authority was given to the Lord. Now the Lord has commissioned us to use this authority to deal with the authority of darkness. We should pray in this way. Every one of us should have such prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Cleansed</h2>
<p>When we preach the gospel, we also need to be cleansed. However, we cannot cleanse ourselves. Being cleansed means that we should go to the Lord and receive His shining, confess our sins, and ask for cleansing. If our conscience is not clean and our spirit is not fresh, we cannot preach the gospel. In order to preach the gospel, we must go to the Lord and consecrate ourselves to Him so that He can shine on us. Then we can deal with our sins and empty our entire being to clear out everything of the world inside and outside of us. Any connection with the world is a link to Satan, and if we are in communication and collaboration with the enemy, we cannot fight against him. We must cut our ties to the enemy by dealing with our sins and the world in us. Then Satan will be fearful when we pray.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Satan will accuse us before God when we pray. When Joshua the high priest stood before God in Zechariah 3:1-4, Satan was there also. Satan seemed to say to God, Joshua is clothed with filthy garments. On Joshua&rsquo;s behalf, God said, &ldquo;Jehovah rebuke you, Satan!...Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?&rdquo; God then asked the angels to remove Joshua&rsquo;s filthy garments and clothe him with stately robes. Thus, Joshua could stand before God to deal with God&rsquo;s enemy and lead the people to build God&rsquo;s temple.</p>
<p>If we want to preach the gospel in a prevailing way, we should not remember other people&rsquo;s souls but neglect our own soul. This is not merely to have good behavior before men. It is a matter of dealing with Satan&rsquo;s usurpation within man. We preach the gospel to chase out Satan from within men. To preach the gospel is to cast out demons. In order to cast out demons, we cannot have any connection or be in collaboration with them. They must not have any ground within us. Therefore, when we pray, we must be cleansed by allowing the Lord to enlighten us, deal with us, and cleanse us from our sins.</p>
<p>On the night that the Lord Jesus was betrayed, Peter publicly denied the Lord with an oath and said, &ldquo;I do not know the man!&rdquo; (Matt. 26:71-72). Fifty days later Peter could stand in the same city of Jerusalem, preach to the Jews, and say to them that they had denied Jesus (Acts 3:13-14). The word <em>denied</em> in this passage is the same word used in relation to Peter when he denied the Lord. But after fifty days Peter was able to say to the Jews that they denied the Lord. If Peter did not receive the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness and have a clear conscience, he could not have spoken to the Jews in this way. Instead, he probably would have said, &ldquo;I denied the Lord fifty days ago. I cannot hold you accountable for the same sin.&rdquo; Peter did not say this, because he was cleansed.</p>
<p>Formerly we were sinners, but if we still live in our sins and do not deal with them, we will not be able to speak. Moreover, when we speak with others concerning the gospel, our conscience will accuse us of not being qualified to preach the gospel if we are still connected to the world. Consequently, we will lack the boldness to speak strongly. In order to have a good conscience so that we can speak with boldness, we must be cleansed in the precious blood of the Lord. When our conscience is strengthened and our spirit is filled, we will be living and our words will be fresh, even if we only say, &ldquo;Jesus is our Savior,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Repent and believe in Jesus.&rdquo; When people hear us, they will feel the power of the Holy Spirit. Hence, if we want to preach the gospel, we must deal with the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Inviting Our Friends, Relatives, and Neighbors</h2>
<p>After a person is saved, he should make a list of his friends, relatives, and acquaintances who are not saved and have not heard the gospel. He should then pray for them one by one. We should all do this. Without exception, we should preach the gospel to all our friends, relatives, and neighbors. When the church preaches the gospel, the saints have an excellent opportunity to lead their friends and relatives to salvation. This is the reason that we should make a list of our friends and relatives and pray for them.</p>
<p>At an appropriate time we should also invite our friends, relatives, and neighbors to a gospel meeting. We can use an invitation card printed by the church or a gospel tract. We should even invite our gospel friends for a meal before the gospel meeting. Otherwise, our friends might not attend the meeting. But if we invite them to our home for a meal, we can take them to the meeting. They will not be able to make any excuses.</p>
<p>It is worthwhile to spend time and money on our gospel friends. If we do this, the Holy Spirit will be with us. We need to exert some effort for the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SERVICE IN A GOSPEL MEETING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Learning to Be an Usher</h2>
<p>In the gospel meeting some saints should serve as ushers. When people enter the meeting hall, the first ones whom they see are the ushers. A person needs the right demeanor in every situation. In a wedding we should be joyful. People who look miserable and sad in a wedding are an insult to those who are getting married. Sometimes the ushering brothers and sisters are expressionless. They lack &ldquo;the face of the gospel.&rdquo; This hinders people from seeing the gospel. When we spend enough time in prayer, we will have the face of the gospel.</p>
<p>Before we serve as an usher, we should pray and deal with the Lord so that we are filled with the spirit of the gospel. Then there will be no need for others to teach us how to usher. We will smile, greet people, and escort them to their seats in a proper way. In everything we do, people will sense the flavor of the gospel. This is not something that we can imitate or be taught. We can have the flavor of the gospel only by being filled with the spirit of the gospel. Once we are filled with the spirit of the gospel, our face will become the face of the gospel, our greeting will become the greeting of the gospel, and our ushering will be according to the gospel. This makes people feel pleasant. They will sense a special flavor.</p>
<p>This flavor cannot be found in a wedding or a party. This special flavor is the Holy Spirit and is also the gospel. Every saint who ushers should have this flavor. However, they often appear cold and stern, as if they are in a court of law. This is not appropriate. The ushers have to pray until their inward being is melted by the gospel. Then they will treasure every person who comes to the meeting hall.</p>
<p>All the sales clerks in the shops on Heng-Yang Street in Taipei warmly welcome the customers who enter their store. This encourages people to buy things from them. Some customers who only planned to buy one thing end up buying more because of the salespeople. The ushers should also be like this in a gospel meeting. The ushers should make people feel that they must believe in Jesus. The people who see an usher with a gospel face are touched and moved inwardly, before they even hear the gospel or sing a hymn. Their heart is softened. When people see a cold and stern face, however, they feel cold within and do not want to hear the gospel or sing. An usher can wound the heart of a new one and hinder him from receiving the gospel. This is not a joke. We have experienced this. Therefore, the ushers need to learn to have a spirit of the gospel through thorough prayer so that they can be proper ushers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Learning to Sit with Our Gospel Friends</h2>
<p>Another service in the gospel meeting is to sit with our gospel friends. We are believers and serving ones. When we come to a gospel meeting, we should sit with our gospel friends, not with the saints. It is best for every gospel friend to have a saint sitting beside them. The saints should always sit with the gospel friends. We should look for new faces in the meeting and converse with them. Perhaps the new ones have heard the gospel many times, or maybe this is their first time. Whatever their situation, we can always render some assistance. It is not appropriate for the saints to sit together in a gospel meeting, apart from the new ones. We have to care for the gospel friends. We need to learn and be flexible.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the gospel meeting, we always sing a few songs. We should help the gospel friends to sing. If we sing, the gospel friend will also sing. We should not be overzealous or hasty, nor should we be indifferent to the new ones when we sing. This will cause them not to sing. This will also force the brother leading the singing to ask everyone to sing loudly.</p>
<p>We have to learn to be flexible and exercise our spirit when we sit with a gospel friend. We should sing when it is time to sing and be attentive to their situation. If he sings softly, we should sing softly. If he sings too softly, we should encourage him to sing a little louder. If he does not sing clearly, we can help him by singing clearly. This requires much experience. We should not think that this is a light and trivial matter.</p>
<p>I heard of a story thirty years ago about the American evangelist, D. L. Moody, that has helped me preach the gospel. Once he was speaking with a woman concerning salvation. As he began to reach a crucial point in his preaching of the gospel, it began to rain. Shortly thereafter, a sister walked into the room where he was and loudly closed her umbrella. This noise distracted the woman, and she did not receive the gospel. Mr. Moody said, &ldquo;From that time until now, I have not been able to lead her to salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This can also be compared to preparing a Chinese breakfast pastry. The best pastry is crisp, puffy, full of air, and very thin. A person who is preparing these pastries must not be interrupted; otherwise, the pastry will be ruined. Preaching the gospel does not require that we shout. It is a matter of touching people&rsquo;s spirit. The Spirit is gentle and cannot be rushed. When we invite a friend to hear the gospel, we should be gentle with him. Whether we usher or sit with the gospel friends, we have to be sensitive to their future.</p>
<p>Some saints are too zealous and anxious during the singing and prayer time. They ask the gospel friends to close their eyes or bow their head when it is time to pray. We should not force our gospel friends to do anything. If we want to bow our head and pray, it should not matter whether others bow their head or close their eyes. We should be general and not force our friends to do anything. They will be influenced by our behavior. We should give them the freedom to follow their own feeling. I once saw a brother repeatedly pat the shoulder of a gospel friend and say that he should bow his head, but it will not do any good for him to bow his head if his spirit is closed. Our behavior may even annoy him and cause him to not come to another meeting. We should be careful when we sit next to a gospel friend. We must learn to be sensitive.</p>
<p>We also need to consider how we listen to the message in a gospel meeting. Our behavior can distract and disturb the ones sitting next to us. Sometimes even a cough can distract them. It can cause people to lose their concentration, and they will be unable to follow the message at a crucial point. Some saints suddenly yawn or sneeze at a key moment in the message. When a gospel friend is listening attentively and the Holy Spirit is moving and operating within him, the person next to the gospel friend can suddenly stretch his legs or move his chair. This can frustrate the gospel friend from believing. Such seemingly small things can make a difference. Hence, we must be alert when we sit next to a gospel friend. While we listen to the message, we should be praying for our gospel friends.</p>
<p>Human beings have a social nature. If one person laughs, others are affected by the laughter, and if a person cries, others are affected. If we listen attentively in a gospel meeting, the one next to us will be affected, and if we are touched by the message, he will also be touched. This is a marvelous phenomenon.</p>
<p>One time in a meeting the brother sitting in front of me began to shake violently. Consequently, everyone sitting around him was affected and could not concentrate; I also could not concentrate or write down the words which were being spoken. Even if some in the meeting were touched by the message, the violent shaking caused them to lose their concentration. Hence, we should learn how to conduct ourselves in a meeting. The brothers who speak from the podium know that those who are listening can affect their speaking. A brother or sister who is consistently looking around can disrupt the speaker and cause him to lose his train of thought. This is inexplicable, but it happens. We need to learn from this.</p>
<p>When we listen to a gospel message, we need to be keen to sense the feeling of the gospel friends to see if they are touched by the message or if they may have a question that causes them to reject the message. We need to learn to observe. Our observation will help us to speak with them in order to know their situation. Suppose a gospel friend is subdued by God, and it is clear that he has no problem with the existence of God or the matter of sin. If this is his situation, we should not waste time on these matters; rather, we should lead him to the Lord. This is the reason that we need to accompany our gospel friends and sit next to them in the meeting. We need to learn this practical lesson.</p>
<p>At the end of a gospel meeting, sometimes the speaker asks the gospel friends to respond by standing up, raising their hand, or bowing their head to pray. Some saints think that it does not matter whether the gospel friends respond. They consider that this should depend on the Holy Spirit only. They assume that if the Holy Spirit operates, the gospel friends will respond, but if the Holy Spirit is not working, they will not respond. They think that they cannot influence their gospel friends&rsquo; response. This is not a proper attitude. However, there are also brothers and sisters who are too zealous. If a gospel friend is unwilling to stand, they push him to stand up. It may be that he was willing to stand up with a little encouragement. However, if he is pushed too much, he will become offended and not stand up. We need to be sensitive to the situation. The willingness of a gospel friend to stand up and respond has much to do with the saint sitting next to him. If we are proper, the gospel friend often will listen to us.</p>
<p>Toward the end of 1941 I preached the gospel in a meeting, and a middle-aged woman was in the audience. Her husband was saved and had even begun a meeting in that town. Many of his colleagues and their wives were also saved, but his wife loved the pleasures of the world and enjoyed going to movies, playing mah-jongg, and having parties. She was not happy that her husband was saved and no longer lived according to his old manner of life. Consequently, she was unwilling to believe in the Lord. When the brother invited some brothers to his home for a meal, she even served cold leftovers.</p>
<p>This brother and his wife lived in a dormitory provided by the Chinese Customs Office. His colleagues, who also lived in the same dormitory, invited and urged the wife to attend a gospel meeting. In the meeting all the saints were praying for her and saw the working of the Holy Spirit. She listened to the message, and when it was time to respond, she could not sit still on her seat. Her youngest daughter, who accompanied her to the meeting, helped her respond. She said to her mother, &ldquo;Mom, I will stand up for you.&rdquo; Eventually the mother stood up. This example demonstrates the usefulness of sitting with gospel friends.</p>
<p>Not long after the wife was saved, she invited some saints to her home for a hot meal. Their household received much grace. This shows that in a gospel meeting we must learn to observe the reactions of the people whom we sit next to and respond appropriately. Everything we do should be spontaneous. If, at the appropriate time, we need to nod our head and help someone to stand up, we need to do it with grace.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING GOSPEL CONVERSATION</h2>
<p>The most important part of the meeting is after the gospel friends respond and the singing is concluded. This part is related to our gospel conversation. There are a few points that require our attention. First, the topic of our conversation should be focused on the message of the gospel meeting. Second, we should be sensitive to the feeling of the gospel friend. For example, if the gospel friend wants to speak about God, we should not bring up the matter of sin. I once observed a gospel friend who wanted to know about God, but the saints kept speaking about Bethlehem. This was inappropriate to that person&rsquo;s need. The topic of a gospel conversation should meet the need of the gospel friend, not our interest. If he says that there is no God, we should not argue with him but help him see the truth. Furthermore, we should not be silent if he blasphemes God.</p>
<p>For the most part, we should avoid arguing with the gospel friends. Arguments are useless and cannot solve any problem. We should not reply to issues that stir up debate. There is no solution to these issues. Instead, we should focus on positive things and engage our friends in positive issues. We should pay attention to this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STEPS IN A GOSPEL CONVERSATION</h2>
<p>There are several steps in a gospel conversation. We should lead people to know God and acknowledge that God exists. We should lead people to confess that Jesus Christ is God. Some people do not believe that God exists, and others believe that God exists but do not believe that Jesus Christ is God. We should also lead people to confess that they are sinners in more than a general way. We should help them feel that they have sinned and admit that they are sinners. We should also lead people to acknowledge the redemption of the cross by showing them how the Lord died on the cross and shed His blood to wash them of their sins. Furthermore, we should lead people to believe into the Lord, confess their sins, and receive the Lord Jesus as their Savior. When we follow these five steps, the gospel friend is ready to believe, and we can lead him to have a short prayer. However, we should not force him to pray. The prayer is for the gospel friend to confess his sins and receive the Lord. If he does not know how to pray, we can lead him to repeat after us. However, we should not force him to pray. We should never insist that he kneel down to pray. If the gospel friend wants to kneel down, we can kneel down with him, but if he has no such sense, he can pray while sitting. Whatever we do depends on the gospel friend&rsquo;s sense.</p>
<p>Finally, we should lead our gospel friend to know that he is saved. This assurance of salvation, or proof of salvation, is in the Word of God. We must help him with at least one verse in the Bible so that he knows that his sins are forgiven and that he has eternal life. Hence, in our gospel conversation, we need to lead people to believe in the existence of God, to believe that Jesus Christ is God, to see that man has sins, to acknowledge the redemption of the cross, and to believe and receive the Lord, which includes repentance and the confession of sins through prayer, and to have the assurance of salvation. We do not need to be legal and include all six points in every conversation. We need to be living in the application of these points.</p>
<p>When we speak with someone, we must first sense his feeling. For example, a gospel friend may have no problem with the existence of God and even know that Jesus is the true God. But he may not have much feeling in regard to his sins. We should help him touch his feeling concerning sins. It requires much skill to help a person touch his feeling concerning sins. We should not interrogate him and ask whether he thinks that he has no sins. Even a person who has committed a gross sin will deny it. When a person is put in a position of denying his sin out of a guilty conscience, there is no way to continue the conversation. Consequently, we need to speak wisely with others concerning sin. We can use our own experience of our attitude toward our parents as an example when we speak of sins. This will help our gospel friends touch their conscience. No matter how perfect a person is, if he considers how he has treated his parents, he will realize that he is not without blame. Even the best child in the world is short with regard to his parents. We should not condemn our gospel friends, but we should touch their conscience and leave them with no excuse. We should touch their feeling and not offend them or provoke them to anger. We can also use our thoughts as another illustration. We may say that sometimes we are covetous, and our thoughts are unclean. No matter how decent and upright a person is, he cannot claim that his thoughts are always clean. We should not begin a debate in an argumentative tone, but we should touch his feeling. We should also give him an example in our practical daily life in order to touch his feeling. Sometimes the Holy Spirit will work in him to touch his feeling. As a result, he will not only feel that he has sins but also confess his sins.</p>
<p>Suppose a person admits that there is God, that Jesus Christ is God, and that he has sins, but he does not sufficiently know the redemption of the Lord Jesus. We should begin to speak of the cross and lead him to know the cross. Perhaps he has no problems with the cross, and he also understands the gospel. He may agree with the gospel but not have believed in the Lord. He lacks the step of believing. He has not prostrated himself before God to confess his sins and receive God. At this time we may use an illustration and say that it is not enough to prepare a meal and admire it, we still need to eat it. In order to eat the Lord Jesus, we need to pray. We can then lead him in prayer and say to him that this is to believe in and receive the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>This person now has received the Lord Jesus and also has faith. However, he does not have the assurance of his salvation. He does not know for sure that he is saved. He has confessed his sins and received the Lord Jesus as his Savior, but he does not have the assurance that his sins are forgiven or that he is saved. Hence, we should lead him to read a few verses in the Bible to show him that when a person believes in the Lord Jesus, his sins are forgiven. Once a person believes, he is saved and has eternal life. To have eternal life means that we will never perish. We can use John 10:28, which says, &ldquo;I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever.&rdquo; We should be prepared with verses like this so that when the time is right, we can open the Bible and read the verses. Usually it is sufficient to use only a few verses.</p>
<p>Here is another example. Suppose a gospel friend feels that his sins are not forgiven. We can read 1 John 1:9, which says, &ldquo;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&rdquo; Then we can ask him whether he confessed his sins. If he says that he did, we can ask him what God says about that and then have him read the verse. We can ask him again in order to help him receive the Word of God. We can also explain that since God is faithful and righteous, as soon as we confess our sins, God will forgive and cleanse us. This word in the Bible is very clear. We should believe the clear word in the Bible. This can be compared to receiving a check. An amount of money is clearly written on the check. We should believe what is written on the check. We should not hold the check in our hand and say that we do not have money. To do this means that we do not believe what is written on the check.</p>
<p>We should all believe the words of God in the Bible, and we must learn to lead people to receive the word in the Bible. If we exercise to do so, we will receive light and will also lead others in a positive way. We should practice conversing in this way and not wait until the end of a gospel meeting. When we visit others, we can also apply these points. We must learn not to debate with others. We should also avoid answering too many questions. We should also learn to sense where people are in the gospel. Then we can lead them step by step and level by level.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING VISITATION</h2>
<p>At the end of the gospel meeting, we should take down the information of our gospel friends. The saints should visit the gospel friends in the following days. When we visit a gospel friend, it is best to ask another brother or sister to go with us. When we are with our gospel friend, we should let the brother or sister who accompanies us speak, and we can assist. We should also keep a record of our visitation. The record can include the response of the gospel friend and whether he is saved and baptized. If he is ready to be baptized, we can give his name to the deacons, and the church will prepare him for baptism. When he is ready to be baptized, we should speak to him the truth concerning baptism, lead him to have an interview for baptism, and help him to be baptized. He will then be a believer who is in the Triune God and in the church, and our gospel labor on him will be concluded. This person is now a brother or sister in the church and can be handed over to other saints for more edification and perfecting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>This is the general procedure of our preaching the gospel. Even though many saints have experience in this work, we can still have more study and practice. We should not depend on our zeal to invite people, to usher, to sit with others, to have a gospel conversation, or to visit the gospel friends. These matters involve much practice.</p>
<p>We should begin with prayer and deal with our sins. Then we need to learn every step. We need to learn to invite the gospel friends to a meal, to usher, to sit with the gospel friends in the meeting, to have a gospel conversation, to visit the gospel friends, and to lead them to baptism. For the sake of the gospel every brother and sister should learn these steps. We should devote our energy and money to this. The apostle Paul in the New Testament not only spent money and energy for the sake of others&rsquo; souls; he also spent himself (2 Cor. 12:15). This is part of the work of the building up of the church. This is also what the Old Testament says in Haggai 1:8, which says that when we go up to the mountain and bring wood and build God&rsquo;s house, we please God and glorify God.</p>
<p>We preach the gospel so that we can gather more building material. The more we endeavor, the more material there will be. This pleases and glorifies God. May we begin with prayer and continue to learn, study, and practice.</p></body></html>
