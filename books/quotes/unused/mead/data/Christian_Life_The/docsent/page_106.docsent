   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Only the Lord knows the heavenly, spiritual mathematics concerning what in our environment works the best for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord gave Job many children, but one day all of his sons and daughters were killed Job 1:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Job prayed a good prayer by saying, "Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked I will return there.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jehovah gives and Jehovah takes away; blessed be the name of Jehovah" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This, however, is still not the best prayer, because it is an Old Testament prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A New Testament prayer would say, "Lord, thank You for giving me children and for taking away my children.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through Your giving and through Your taking away I have been transformed and filled up with You.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The coming and going of my children are all Your doing to transform me and fill me up."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Children are used by God to deal with the parents.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some parents are dealt with by God mainly by their children.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But God knows whether we need children or do not need children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He uses all things to conform us to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some persons may be nice, gentle, and faithful in their natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They would be good persons even apart from being regenerated or transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then what can God do to work Himself into such persons?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With such persons and with all of us, God must put us into certain circumstances to break us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's desire is for us to be broken so that He can work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul was a person who was conformed to the death of Christ by something mysterious called the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No one can be conformed to the death of Christ except by the resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is something within us hidden, mysterious, and dynamic called resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, we will learn that whether money comes or money goes, whether children come or children go, God remains.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is not our portion outwardly but our portion inwardly in the way of constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God has constituted and is constituting Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, God uses all things to make Himself our unique portion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our money, our children, our job, and our degree are not our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only God is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some of us have portions other than Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may have our own goals which we desire to reach, saying that we need to be practical.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But actually these goals are our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why God comes to "peel off" our natural life layer by layer throughout the years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have been under God's gradual "peeling" for almost seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am happy today because much of my natural life has been peeled off.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God uses all things to "peel off" our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God even uses all the brothers and sisters in the church life to accomplish this peeling.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are all under the accumulating process of God's "peeling off" of our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The day will come when we will have a great and serious peeling off.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we will be broken, "bankrupt."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"Bankruptcy" means brokenness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some today teach positive thinking as the way to be successful in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Such a teaching is terrible and absolutely off.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Did the apostle Paul practice positive thinking to be successful or to make money?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul was positive in martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was very positive in being ready to be poured out as a drink offering Phil 2:17; 2 Tim 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I would encourage all of us to read the biography of Brother Watchman Nee entitled Watchman Nee: A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brother Nee's ministry has spread throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many seeking Christians have received help from his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eventually, however, he died in imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the conformation to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Within Brother Nee there was a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That mystery within him was the power of resurrection.</S>
