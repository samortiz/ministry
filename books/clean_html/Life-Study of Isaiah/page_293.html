<P>The Angel of Jehovah, from Exodus 3 through Isaiah to Zechariah, was always with Israel. Quite often He was suffering with Israel. Zechariah 1 presents the vision of a man as the Angel of Jehovah riding on a red horse and standing among the myrtle trees in the bottoms of the valley (vv. 7-17). The myrtle trees signify the humiliated people of Israel in their captivity. Christ as the Angel of Jehovah was standing among these myrtle trees in the bottoms of the valley. This means that He was remaining strongly among the captured Israel in the lowest part of the valley in their humiliation.</P><P>Eventually, this One will tread the great winepress at Armageddon. Armageddon is referred to in Isaiah 63. That winepress will extend from Bozrah of Edom (vv. 1-6) to Armageddon (Rev. 16:16), a distance of one thousand six hundred stadia, that is, one hundred eighty-two miles (Rev. 14:20). The Angel of Jehovah, the coming back Jesus, will tread that great winepress. Without Isaiah we would not know that the treader of that great winepress will be the Angel of the presence of Jehovah.</P><P>The Anointed of Jehovah and the Angel of the presence of Jehovah are the last two items of what the all-inclusive Christ is to Israel in Isaiah. The Anointed of Jehovah is a sweet term to God's people. But the Angel of the presence of Jehovah is a term mostly applied toward the enemies of God's people. First, He was there dealing with Pharaoh and his Egyptian army. He was protecting God's people in the front and at the rear. Even in Zechariah He was the protecting Angel, depicted as the rider on the red horse. Isaiah concludes his view of the all-inclusive Christ with these two items&#151;one is so sweet to God's elect, and the other is so strong toward the enemies of God's elect.</P><P>Israel's last enemy will be Antichrist and all the nations with him. Revelation 19 tells us that Antichrist will collect all the evil persons on this earth to be the armies to destroy Israel. Even today there are many Arab nations who would like to destroy Israel. The final one who will have a kind of conspiracy to destroy Israel will be Antichrist with his allies, the nations. But the Angel of Jehovah will fight him down, will defeat him, and will put him directly into the lake of fire. The Angel of Jehovah is the Lord Jesus as the presence of the Triune God. He will come to defeat Antichrist and his armies.</P>
