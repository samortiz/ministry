<h2 class="head2">Nan-Ping, Fukien Province</h2><p>After returning to Fukien, I taught for awhile at a girls' school, but I quit because I wanted to live for the Word which I believed. May the Lord cultivate me so that my suffering life will grow. I want to be faithful in this way and follow Him to the end! Where is Brother Tang Shou-ling? (Please read the fifth issue of this publication for the news from Brother Tang&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>Your little sister in the Lord,<br />Chou Gi-chen<br />March 1<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Yi-Yang, Hunan Province</h2><p>Dear X in the Lord:</p><p>I received and read The Open Door and learned about the hardships of the brothers and sisters in each locality and how God preserved them. The Lord is worthy to be praised, amen! I deeply believe that God's children will know His love, faithfulness, and power better because of what they have suffered. I also believe that God wants His children to serve Him better and to preach the gospel of grace in every place. At the end of last November, God gave me a word when I left Tsen-Jiang: "Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!" (2 Cor. 9:15). God led me and my family according to His promise safely out of Tsen-Jiang through Jiu-Jiang and Hankow to Yuan-Jiang. In Yuan-Jiang, I found out that Mr. Chen Kai-yuan (formerly of Shanghai University) was the principal of the Yi-Yang Lutheran High School (a distance of ninety miles from Yuan-Jiang). I made a special visit to him and asked him to find me a job. The next day I received a word from God, saying, "Jehovah will complete that which concerns me" (Psa. 138:8). A few days later I received an answering letter from him inviting me to teach two classes of English in the junior high section. (I am now concurrently teaching another class in a girls' secondary school.) I came to Yi-Yang on February 17 of this year. Thank God for giving me an opportunity to testify in the school. Many of the teachers and students in this school desire the truth and like to listen to the Word. There are already several sisters in Yi-Yang (Mrs. Chiu and the rest) who were under the care of Brother Yu Cheng-hwa. They have prayed earnestly before God for the work in Yi-Yang and have asked Him to send workers. When they got the news that I had come to Yi-Yang, their hearts were filled with praise to the Lord because they thought He had heard their prayers. However, I really feel weak. I am not worthy to be His worker, so please do not forget me in your prayers. Pray that I would be a holy vessel, able to glorify His holy name, amen. There are more than ten brothers and sisters here. There is a prayer meeting every Lord's Day afternoon. After that meeting we study the Bible. We use Bible Studies for Beginners as our text. I hope that through the grace of God, I will lead sinners to the Lord, edify the brothers and sisters, and grow in life myself, despite my weakness. Every Saturday afternoon we take turns preaching the gospel in the brothers' and sisters' homes. The number of those who desire the Word is gradually increasing. Praise the Lord! May God continue to bless His work and cause all the work to be according to His heart's desire. Please do pray for us. The address of our meetings is 5 O-Yang-Chih, Er-Pao, Yi-Yang. Peace in the Lord! Please greet all the co-workers.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Zhang Gung-jih<br />March 13<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Chungking, Szechuan</h2><p>Greetings to all my dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>May you have peace! May we through grace run the race that is set before us in Christ. May the Lord grant us the grace to follow Him faithfully without flinching. The meetings here continue as usual. There was a ten-day conference beginning on March 7. Although this conference suffered the attacks of the powers of darkness, it still went on peacefully, thank the Lord. The Lord prepared everything for us, and He satisfied and comforted those who looked to Him. He also made us realize what poor failures we ourselves are. May the Lord deal with us more deeply so that His church may be revived. A nightly Bible study began on March 28. Sister Ruth Lee is still responsible for it. We are studying Genesis 25. We hope that through the earnest petitions of many brothers and sisters, Satan's frustrations will be foiled, and we will all have a receptive and submissive heart that seeks for something more than knowledge.</p><p>We really feel the importance and necessity of prayer. May we all pray earnestly for one another so that we would stand firm in this raging storm and glorify the Lord's name. Sister Lee and Sister Chang and the other brothers and sisters are all well. Brother Chang Yu-zhi and Sister Peace Wang are working very well in Ch'eng-tu. If the Lord allows, they will return to Chungking next month. Sisters Lee and Chang have said that they will go to Ch'eng-tu next month. Sister Han Feng-yi arrived in Chungking from Hankow on the sixth of this month. She left by bus on the fifteenth for the Kuei-yang Medical School to continue her studies. We have already received a letter from her saying that she arrived safely in Kuei-yang. Sister Wei Cheung-sien also came to Chungking and left for Kuei-yang on March 28. We hope you will pray for her. Brother Yuan How-tsai came to Chungking from Hankow on the twenty-fourth because his sister died. He returned to Hankow on April 1 with his elderly mother. Brother Liu Yi-peng went to Ch'eng-tu on business and will return to Chungking shortly. Finally, please do not forget to pray for the assembly here. May we testify for the Lord and glorify His name. May the Lord be with you forever and ever!</p><p>Your weak members in the Lord,<br />Lee Yun-sien, Liu Kwo-hwa<br />March 27<br />[Address omitted]</p>
