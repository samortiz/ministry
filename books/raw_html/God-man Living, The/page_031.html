<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 3:16; Heb. 1:9; Acts 10:38a; Luke 4:18-19; Matt. 12:18a; 4:1-2; Luke 4:1; John 3:34; Acts 10:38b; Matt. 12:18b, 28; Rev. 1:5; 3:14; 1 Tim. 3:16; Heb. 9:14</h1>

<li>In His ministry:
	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="4">
	<li>His moving for His ministry:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Under the Spirit&rsquo;s anointing:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>After He was baptized in the water, God anointed Him with the Spirit descending upon Him as a dove&mdash;Matt. 3:16.</li>
			<li>Anointed by God with the oil of exultant joy above His partners&mdash;Heb. 1:9.</li>
			<li>Anointed by God with the Holy Spirit and with power&mdash;Acts 10:38a.</li>
			<li>The Spirit of the Lord was upon Him&mdash;Luke 4:18a.</li>
			<li>God had put His Spirit upon Him&mdash;Matt. 12:18a.</li>
			<li>Led by the Holy Spirit to be tempted by the devil for forty days&mdash;Matt. 4:1-2; Luke 4:1.</li>
			<li>As the One sent by God, speaking the words of God and giving the Spirit not by measure&mdash;John 3:34.</li>
			<li>Going about doing good and healing all those who were being oppressed by the devil&mdash;Acts 10:38b.</li>
			<li>Announcing the gospel to the poor, proclaiming release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, and sending away in release those who are oppressed&mdash;Luke 4:18-19.</li>
			<li>Announcing justice to the Gentiles&mdash;Matt. 12:18b.</li>
			<li>By the Spirit of God casting out the demons for the coming of the kingdom of God&mdash;Matt. 12:28.</li>
			<li>Witnessing God faithfully&mdash;Rev. 1:5; 3:14.</li>
			<li>Justified in the Spirit&mdash;1 Tim. 3:16.</li>
			<li>Through the eternal Spirit offering Himself without blemish to God that He may purify our conscience with His blood from dead works to serve the living God&mdash;Heb. 9:14.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>That the God-man as God&rsquo;s anointed One, Messiah, Christ, moved under the anointing of the Spirit of God is the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal economy in the God-man&rsquo;s ministry while He was in the flesh and on the earth.</li>
		<li>Christ as the first God-man on the one hand lived by the Father, who abode and worked in Him, and on the other hand moved and ministered by the Spirit. This indicates that the living of the first God-man was actually the living and moving of the processed Triune God in Christ&rsquo;s human living on the earth.</li>
