   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Wood</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Specifically and practically, wood here refers to the human nature of the Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By nature the Greeks are very philosophical.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe they even philosophized concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, wood refers to their nature, their natural makeup.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the same principle, wood denotes what we are according to our natural makeup.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, the Chinese have an ethical nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is their wood.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not build the church with wood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that we should not build it with our nature, with our natural makeup.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>C. Grass</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have pointed out that grass signifies the unredeemed man of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Wood signifies the nature of the Greeks, whereas grass signifies the natural man of the Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To build the church with grass is to build it with what we are in our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, the leader of the Brethren assembly I attended in Chefoo was a very slow and steady person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He always walked slowly, carefully, and deliberately.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once in teaching the Bible he said that God always does things slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because of the influence of this leader, almost everyone in that assembly learned to be slow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When they came into the area of the meeting hall, they walked very slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, all the prayers in the meetings were offered in a very slow way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That entire Brethren assembly was according to the natural being of the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is an illustration of what it means to build the church with grass.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To build with grass is to build with what we are and with what we prefer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose a particular person has a strong preference for speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To seek to promote tongues-speaking is to build with grass.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever we build according to what we are in our natural being or according to our natural preference, we build with grass.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>D. Stubble</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Stubble signifies the work and living which issue from an earthen source.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Stubble is altogether without life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To build with stubble is even worse than building with wood and grass.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jealousy, strife, envy, gossip, and criticism are all aspects of stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Philosophical people are usually very critical.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more they think in a philosophical way, the more they criticize others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such criticism is stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is very difficult among Christians today to find the proper building materials.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Where can you find gold, silver, and precious stones?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, there is an abundance of wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everywhere we can see the natural makeup, the natural being, and even such things as jealousy, envy, strife, hatred, murmuring, and complaining.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In almost any Christian group you can find wood, grass, stubble; that is, you can find the building according to the natural makeup, the natural being, and the characteristics of earthly living.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In particular, in 1 Corinthians 3 wood, grass, and stubble refer to the Greek nature, the Greek being, and the evil of the Greek way of living, especially as these things were expressed among the believers in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In chapter three Paul charges the saints not to lay anything or anyone other than Christ as the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that we must not exalt anyone or anything in place of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we exalt someone or something instead of Christ, we lay another foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul also charges us to take heed how we build upon Christ as the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Corinthians were not to build with their Greek nature, their Greek self, or their Greek jealousy, strife, and criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In other words, they were not to build the church with anything Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>About fifty years ago there was a prevailing trend among many Christians in China to remove from the Christian churches there any trace of Western culture.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The desire of those in this movement was to have everything in the church according to native Chinese culture.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They even wanted the chapels and church buildings to be constructed in a native way instead of in a Western way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Christians in this movement appreciated the Bible, but they rejected the culture brought over by the missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Their goal was to make their church Chinese in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church, however, should be neither Western nor Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It should simply be Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means that the church should be built with Christ in every way and in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everything related to the church must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although the church should be built with Christ and Christ alone, virtually every denomination and Christian group seeks to be native or natural in some way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To have a native denomination or group is to build with our natural makeup and being, no matter what these may be.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some may desire a church according to the German nature, others according to the French makeup, and still others according to the Chinese constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is to build the church according to what we are and what we do in our natural life, makeup, and being.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many years ago I was invited to visit a place in England which was famous for the spirituality among the people there.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I stayed for a month, and I did find some genuine spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, what I saw more was their emphasis on the British way of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They unconsciously intended to make others British and even exerted control over places far away.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On two occasions the leader of this group came to Taiwan at our invitation to minister to us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>His first visit was wonderful and very profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, his second visit was quite damaging, for he sought to impose on the saints certain British habits and customs.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For example, during a time of fellowship he remarked, Why do you brothers who are servicemen put on your caps when you are still in the meeting hall?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As soon as the meeting is dismissed, you put on your caps, even before you are outside the building.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>According to his opinion, the brothers were wrong in wearing their caps indoors.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A certain brother tried to explain the custom among military personnel in the Far East, that it is not the practice for a soldier to remove his cap whether inside or outside.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Nevertheless, the military brothers always remove their caps during a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But as soon as the meeting is over, they put on their caps, not caring whether they are inside or outside the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Nevertheless, this brother was very strong and asked, Do you follow human customs, or do you follow the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After he responded in this way, I said to myself, Brother, you are not fair.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We definitely follow the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>According to the Bible, when a brother prays in a church meeting, he should not have any covering on his head.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But there certainly is nothing wrong with putting a cap on one s head when he is still in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To claim that a soldier must wait until he is outside the hall is to follow your Western custom.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In Britain this may be your practice.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But it is unfair to accuse us of not following the Bible because we do not keep your custom in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Realizing the seriousness of using natural things to build up the church, I have earnestly endeavored, by the Lord s mercy, not to bring Chinese things into the Lord s recovery in this country.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Moreover, I certainly do not want anything of what I am to influence the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>None of us should build the church according to what we are in our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We should not allow anything of our natural being to be put into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Concerning this we all need to look to the Lord for His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>May the Lord have mercy on us that we will not build the church with what we are by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If the church expresses the natural makeup or natural being of the leading ones, this indicates that, at least to some extent, the church has been built with grass.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Something of the unredeemed natural man has been put into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is an element which has not been redeemed, terminated, and replaced by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Although I was born a Chinese, I can testify that my desire is to be terminated and replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I do not want to build the church with grass, with what I am in my natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>None of us should build with wood or grass, much less with the stubble of jealousy, strife, and criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we look at the situation among Christians today, we shall realize that Paul s word about wood, grass, and stubble is not a mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We all must exercise our spirit, look to the Lord, and pray, O Lord, have mercy on me that I would not build Your church with my natural makeup, with my natural being, or with anything of jealousy, strife, or envy.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Lord, I want to build Your church with the gold of the Father s nature, with the silver of the cross which redeems, terminates, and replaces me, and with the transforming work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I want to build the church in the mingled spirit where I experience the Father s nature and the Son s redemption, and eventually have the Spirit s transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Lord, I desire to build the church in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Now we can understand Paul s concept concerning the proper materials used in building the church.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In chapter three Paul was actually telling the Corinthian believers, You are plants on God s farm.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Now you need to grow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The more you grow, the more you will become gold, silver, and precious stones for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Do not lay any foundation other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Do not exalt anything, anyone, or any doctrine or practice.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Simply build upon the all-inclusive Christ as the unique foundation already laid.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>But take heed not to build upon this Christ with anything Greek; rather build with the Father s nature and the Son s redemption which will result in the Spirit s transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Then the church will be golden and full of silver and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>TO BE CONSUMED</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>In verse 15 Paul issues a word of warning: If anyone s work shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss, but he shall be saved, yet so as through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The work of wood, grass, and stubble is fit only to be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This is the work which shall be consumed by the Lord s judging fire at His return.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>TO SUFFER LOSS</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>When Paul says, he shall suffer loss, he means loss of reward, not loss of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>To suffer loss here absolutely does not mean to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The salvation which we have received in Christ is not by our works Titus 3:5 and is eternal, unchangeable in nature Heb 5:9; John 10:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Hence, those believers whose Christian works will not be approved by the judging Lord and who will suffer the loss of reward will still be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>God s salvation to all believers as a free gift is for eternity, whereas the Lord s reward to those whose Christian works are approved by Him is for the Kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The reward is an incentive for their Christian work, and it is not given to all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Although those believers whose Christian works will not be approved by the Lord at His coming back will be saved, they will be saved so as through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Through fire surely indicates punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>However, it is altogether not the purgatory heretically taught by Catholicism in its superstitious quoting of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Nevertheless, this word should be a solemn warning to us today concerning our Christian works.</S>
