   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE FORTY-FIVE THE CLEANSING OF THE DISCHARGES FROM MAN'S AND WOMAN'S BODY Scripture Reading: Lev 15:1-31</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Leviticus 11 through 15, a section of five chapters, four troubling things are covered: our contact with people, the uncleanness of our birth, leprosy, and our discharges.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message on 15:1-31 we shall cover the matter of the cleansing of the discharges from man's and woman's body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have pointed out that chapters eleven through twenty-seven of Leviticus intend to give us the way to live a holy life as God's holy people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we would live such a life, we need to realize that we are involved with four things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, we are involved with the common matter of the contact with people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second, we must recognize the uncleanness of our birth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The source, the origin, of our being is unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Third, we have the problem of our leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our condition is one of being filled with leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Fourth, we have the problem of discharges.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No matter what kind of person we may be, we all have discharges, and, as chapter fifteen shows us, these discharges are altogether unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, the uncleanness of our discharges is contagious.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Leviticus indicates strongly that whatever comes out of our being is unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, chapter fifteen tells us to stay away from any discharge that issues from the human body and from the contagion of uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because we were born uncleanness and are a totality of uncleanness, whatever comes out of us is unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Also, the uncleanness of what issues from us is contagious and therefore causes others to be unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the crucial point in chapter fifteen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Chapter sixteen of Leviticus is actually a continuation of chapter ten.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The intention of God's revelation in the five chapters that come between chapters ten and sixteen is to show us four basic troubling factors.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first of these factors is our contact with people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not consider this an insignificant thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the contrary, our contact with people is of great importance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Contacting the wrong kinds of persons can cause us to be defiled and thus discredit us in the matter of a holy living as God's holy people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The second troubling factor is the uncleanness of our birth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to realize that our source, our origin, is uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are uncleanness itself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our birth, source, and constitution are all uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The third factor is our leprous condition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Inwardly and outwardly we are leprous.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The fourth factor is our discharge with its uncleanness and contagion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the discharges, all the things that issue from our body, are unclean and contagious.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the Bible, our body is our embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our body is our being, our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whatever comes out of our body, out of our constitution, as a discharge is unclean and contagious.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 15:1-13 we see that the one who has a discharge is unclean and anything or anyone he touches becomes unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we consider these verses, we realize that there is uncleanness everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everything has been dirtied by human discharges, by that which comes out of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more we realize this, the more we shall treasure those verses in chapter fifteen which indicate that Christ is the factor of our cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that whatever issues from us is unclean and should be condemned and eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After reading 15:1-13, we may wonder where we can stay without being defiled by the uncleanness of human discharges.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everywhere there is the uncleanness that issues from us human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we realize this, we shall not want to remain on earth but desire to be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After studying the four troubling factors in chapters eleven through fifteen, I have come to realize fully that we are unclean, corrupt, and contagious.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The things that come out of us are uncleanness, and this uncleanness is contagious.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These five chapters on the four negative things show us that we all are a heap of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The entire world, all of humanity, is a heap of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Apart from Christ, there is no place for us to be.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only the Lord Jesus can cleanse us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He alone is the cleansing factor.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The title of this message is "The Cleansing of the Discharges from Man's and Woman's Body."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here "body" means our being, our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, the discharges from our body are the discharges from our being or from our constitution.</S>
