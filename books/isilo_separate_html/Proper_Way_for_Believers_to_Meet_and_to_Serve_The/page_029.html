and the Rest Listening</h2>
<p>The practice of one person speaking and the rest listening is a heavy burden to the speaker. It is difficult to be a pastor or a preacher. After studying theology, some people prepare fifty-two sermons to use while they are learning pastoral duties with their first congregation. Having to prepare sermons is a suffering to the young pastors. However, congregations are happy when their pastor is knowledgeable, eloquent, and able to tell stories. If the pastor is not eloquent and does not use parables or tell stories, the congregation will get tired of listening to him. Although there are advantages to one person speaking and the rest listening, there are more disadvantages.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Practicing Mutuality<br />
for the Building Up of All the Saints</h2>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching in the Scriptures does not instruct us to practice having one person speaking and the rest listening in the meetings of the church. Rather, it teaches us to practice mutuality. I was very zealous when I was first saved. The denomination that I attended had a prayer meeting and a message every Tuesday night. The pastor had been there for over a decade and had exhausted his messages, so he proposed that another person should be asked to speak or that everyone should take turns to speak. I was known in that denomination as a person who loved the Lord and the Bible, so I was asked to speak. However, that was still one person speaking and the rest listening.</p>
<p>Christianity cannot avoid the practice of one person speaking and the rest listening. But according to the teaching of the apostles, whenever the believers gather together, each one has (1 Cor. 14:26). We have practiced each one having a psalm in the sense that we have the right to select a hymn for everyone to sing. In the worship services in the denominations, only the person designated by the pastor can call a hymn. This is against the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching is with a view to the mutual building up of all the saints. A feast is not composed of only one dish. Regardless of how much one person speaks, it is still only one &ldquo;course,&rdquo; not many &ldquo;courses.&rdquo; A meeting in mutuality may be likened to a rich feast with numerous courses of delicious food. A real Chinese feast has at least twelve courses. If there are only three or four courses, it is considered as an ordinary meal. When we invite people to a feast, we should not prepare only three or five courses. We must prepare at least twelve courses; twenty courses would be better. Not only so, the twenty courses should be in &ldquo;mutuality&rdquo;; if every course is steak, people will not like it. A good restaurant always serves a variety of dishes. The Lord&rsquo;s arrangement is much better than the arrangement in a restaurant. His Word says that when Christians come and meet together, each has to prepare a &ldquo;dish.&rdquo; These &ldquo;dishes&rdquo; should be in mutuality. This will express the riches of the church and enable all the saints to be built up.</p>
<p>Some people think that such a practice would cause chaos in the meetings. If this were true, we would lose the Lord&rsquo;s presence. When we come together, there should be the supply of grace, not disturbance or confusion. Such meetings will cause everyone to learn and to be encouraged. Such meetings will be full of peace, not chaos (vv. 31, 33). In order to supply grace, we must first have grace. A brother once suggested that we ask a restaurant to cater our love feasts. I was greatly opposed to this suggestion because it would annul our love feasts. We have the most enjoyable and rich love feasts when every saint prepares a dish. This also applies to our meetings. We should never serve &ldquo;catered food&rdquo;; instead, each person must prepare something. </p>
<p>In America every household is asked to bring one dish to the love feast. With this kind of arrangement there is not much variety; hence, it cannot be considered a love feast. In this respect, the Chinese saints are better than the American saints. When the Chinese saints have a love feast, every home will prepare different kinds of food. As a result, a hundred homes will bring more than a hundred dishes. Even if two households bring the same dish, they are prepared differently. Whether steamed buns, boiled dumplings, fried dumplings, stir-fried beef, or spicy chicken, every household prepares them in different ways. This kind of love feast is truly rich! This is a picture of the church meetings. When three hundred saints meet together, there should not be only one person speaking. Everyone should speak, and everyone should listen; we speak to one another, and we listen to one another. This is not confusion; it is active mutuality. The richness of such a meeting is indescribable.</p>
<p>Most of us have probably not tasted such a meeting. If we would taste it, we would not like the meetings with one person speaking and the rest listening. We would hate such meetings. Suppose I am your pastor, and I must preside over and speak in every meeting. Regardless of how eloquent I am, after half a year you will be tired of listening to me. But the taste would be different if everyone would speak. It does not matter whether or not we know how to speak. If we would practice this, at least twenty out of a hundred saints will learn to speak, and the meetings would be enjoyable. This is the strong point of mutuality; it is for the building up of all the saints.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:25 says that we should not abandon our own assembling together. This word was written to the Jewish believers, and it urged them to not shrink back to Judaism. For them to go back and meet in Judaism was to abandon their own meeting as believers. Not only so, in the meetings they needed to exhort one another. When I was with the Brethren, they frequently quoted this verse without emphasizing the phrase <em>exhorting one another.</em> They applied this verse to a &ldquo;one-way&rdquo; exhorting, that is, the speaker exhorting the congregation instead of everyone exhorting one another. At that time, I did not see this light. Later, I heard Brother Nee say that the meeting spoken of in Hebrews 10:25 is mutual, not &ldquo;one-way.&rdquo; It is not a meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening, but at least eight or ten people speaking in order to have mutuality.</p>
<p>Hence, the believers&rsquo; meetings must be mutual and should not be like the meetings of a conference. During conferences the workers or apostles who have received a burden from the Lord invite people to listen to God&rsquo;s speaking. However, due to our fallen nature, we like such meetings. We are not saying that such meetings are wrong, because they meet a particular need related to the work. But genuine church meetings must have the characteristic of mutuality.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
