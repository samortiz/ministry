   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ will also be the stone falling on the Gentile kingdoms and scattering them as chaff.</S>

   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verses 34 and 35 say, Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These verses indicate that when Christ comes the second time, He will be a stone cut without hands falling from the heavens upon the great image.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The great image signifies the worldly powers from Babylon down to the ten kingdoms of the restored Roman Empire, which will exist at the time of Christ s coming back.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then He will become a great mountain the kingdom of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Matthew 21:44 the Lord, referring to the stone in Daniel 2, says that on whomever it falls, it shall scatter him as chaff.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those on whom the stone falls will be the nations which Christ will smite at His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To the believers, Christ is the foundation stone, the building stone, in whom they trust Isa 28:16 ; to the unbelieving Jews, He is the stumbling stone Isa 8:14; Rom 9:33 ; and to the nations, He will be the smiting stone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We, the believers, experience Christ as the building stone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the Jews who reject Him and are stumbled by Him will experience Him as the stumbling stone and be broken to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, the unbelieving Gentiles who fight against God will know Christ as the smiting stone, for He will smite them and scatter them like chaff driven by the wind.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the millennium there will be three realms: the realm of the earth, where the blessing of God s creation, as mentioned in Genesis 1:28-30, will take place; the realm of the nation of Israel, from Canaan, from the Nile to the Euphrates, in which the saved Jews will rule over the whole earth Isa 60:10-12; Zech 14:16-18 ; and the heavenly and spiritual realm 1 Cor 15:50-52 , which will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, where the overcoming believers will enjoy the kingdom reward Matt 5:20; 7:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Speaking of Christ s kingdom, 1 Corinthians 15:25 says, He must reign until He puts all His enemies under His feet.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>for the Truthfulness of God</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Romans 15:8 says, I say that Christ has become a servant of the circumcision for the truthfulness of God, to confirm the promises given to the fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The expression the circumcision refers to the Jews, God s covenanted people.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The fact that these prophecies are fulfilled in the New Testament is a strong proof that whatever the New Testament reveals is fully of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only God can write such a book.</S>
