<h2 class="head1">THINGS THAT AN AWAKENED SINNER SHOULD DO</h2><p>When we reach this point, a sinner will ask, "What should I do to be saved?" Here are also four things.</p><h2 class="head2">Confess</h2><p>The first thing we should do is to tell an awakened sinner to confess his sins. First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." Although this verse is for Christians, in principle anyone who confesses his sins to God will receive His forgiveness. We must be clear about confession. Confession means to stand on God's side and to acknowledge sin as sin. Many people only plead for forgiveness without making any confession. For example, many people say to God, "I am proud. I am envious. I am lustful. I hate others." They only ask God to forgive them, but they do not acknowledge these as sins. The fact of the matter is that as soon as a sinner acknowledges a sin to be sin, God will forgive him. Confessing to God means acknowledging before Him that a sin is sin indeed. We have to lead sinners not only to pray for forgiveness but to confess sin as sin.</p><p>Everyone has a few particular sins of his own. He does not commit all sins in a general way. For this reason, confession means to confess the few particular sins that one has. Confession cannot be general. One has to confess his sins in a specific way. We should not say to God, "I am proud. I am envious. Please forgive me." Rather, we should confess, saying, "I am proud, and this is sin. I am envious, and this is sin." If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins.</p><p>The worst thing that an evangelist can do is to invite a sinner to the feast but fail to introduce him to the Host. Our purpose is not to make others nod at our doctrines, but to touch God. After they have understood the four points spoken of above, we should lead them to kneel before the Lord and pray. Once a man confesses his sins, he stands on God's side and condemns sin as sin. If he does not confess his sins, he is still standing on the side of sin. We have to bend the stiffened knees; we have to lead him to kneel down to pray. We should not ask him to just ask for forgiveness; we have to make him confess first and then ask for forgiveness. A great advantage of this confession is that the confessor will never forget what he has done. Once he prays this way, he will no longer be able to escape. This confession will count in the eyes of God.</p><h2 class="head2">Read God's Word</h2><p>After a man confesses his sin, we have to give him God's word. This will establish him in the faith. If a man does not believe in his heart, his prayer and confession will be useless. A sinner's body does not play any part in his salvation and regeneration. His spirit is dead. His understanding is darkened, his emotion is void of aspirations, and his will is definitely antagonistic. How can such a person believe? First, something outside of him has to get into him. We have to deposit something into him, something that will not come out once it gets into him&mdash;the word of God. Only God's word works. No doctrine will work, and no casual remark will work. Only God's word works. Only His word will enter and operate within man. Hence, the second thing to do with an awakened sinner is to let him read the Bible. Let him read God's Word over and over again, until this word gets into him. This is what Romans 10:14 and 17 mean when they say that seeking comes from believing, believing comes from hearing, and hearing from the word of Christ. James 1:21 says that God's implanted word can save a sinner's soul. Second Peter 1:4 says that a man partakes of God's nature through the promises in His word. Acts 2:41 says that men were saved through receiving God's word, the word which Peter preached at Pentecost.</p><p>All of God's work is included in His word. When a man receives God's word, he receives God's work. The content of God's word is His work. Man does not touch God's work directly; he touches God's word, and through His word he touches His work. Gospel preachers must try to memorize many verses concerning God's salvation. In preaching the gospel, we should announce God's Word sentence by sentence until sinners are fully clear. In this way they will never forget God's word.</p><p>We have to make others trust in God's word. They have to rest on God's word, to the extent that they treat God's word as a pillow. Such a pillow supports their head all the time even after they are saved.</p>
