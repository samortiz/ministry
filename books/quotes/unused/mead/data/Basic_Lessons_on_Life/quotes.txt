[4]  LESSON ONE THE CREATION OF MAN Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26-27; 2:7-9; Prov 20:27; 1 Thes 5:23 OUTLINE The Creator the Triune God.
[5]  Colossians 1:15 says that the beloved Son of God is the image of the invisible God, and 2 Corinthians 4:4 says that Christ is the image of God.
[6]  Another proof that man did not have God's eternal life when he was created is that after man ate the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, God closed the way to the tree of life lest man partake of the tree of life and live forever with his evil nature Gen 3:22-24 .
[7]  God created man with the breath of life that man might have a spirit as a kind of receptacle to receive God.
[8]  The intention of God's creation of man is that man may understand God's desire with his mind, like God's desire with his emotion, choose to take, to receive, God with his will, and eventually exercise his spirit to receive God as his life.
[9]  God put man before the tree of life, indicating that God wanted man to receive Him as life.
[10]  With a mind to understand God Luke 24:45; Rom 12:2.
[11]  Many Bible readers mistakenly think that the breath of life breathed into the nostrils of the dusty man was the life of God.
[12]  But when God breathed the breath of life into the dusty body of man, that breath of life became man's human spirit.
[13]  Because our human spirit is close to God and there is a transmission between God the Spirit and our human spirit, our human spirit is able to contact God and to be one with God.
[14]  John 4:24, which says that God is Spirit and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit, proves that our spirit is able to contact God.
[15]  God putting man before two trees indicates that man had a free will.
[16]  LESSON THREE GOD'S INTENTION IN MAN Scripture Reading: Gen 2:8-9, 16-17; Rev 2:7; 22:14; John 6:35a, 57b OUTLINE Two choices remaining in front of man: The tree of life: Signifying God as life to man.
[17]  We have to stress again and again that the tree of life signifies God as life to man and that once man takes the tree of life, takes God as life, right away this divine life issues in a dependent life in man.
[18]  The other choice before man was the tree of knowledge.
[19]  Eating is the unique way, and God is the unique food to man.
[20]  LESSON FOUR SATAN'S PLOT TO SPOIL MAN Scripture Reading: Gen 3:1-7; Rom 7:17-18a, 21, 23; Eph 2:1, 12; 4:18 OUTLINE Being God's adversary Matt 13:28a.
[21]  Hiding himself in the subtle serpent Gen 3:1a; 2 Cor 11:3; Rev 12:9a.
[22]  In this point we have to make it clear that God's intention was to enter into man to be man's life.
[23]  But in the Bible we can see that when Satan realizes that God intends to do something, he will do it earlier, to prevent God from carrying out His intention.
[24]  By this, man was alienated, cut off, from God and even cut off from the life of God.
[25]  LESSON FIVE THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF MAN'S FALL Scripture Reading: Gen 3:1-8; Rom 5:12, 14-16; 7:14b, 17-18, 20-21; Eph 2:1, 5a; 4:18; 1 Cor 15:22a OUTLINE Not only: Transgressing against God's commandment Rom 5:14b.
[26]  Adam forsook the tree of life, which denotes God as life, to pursue the tree of knowledge, which signifies Satan as the source of death Gen 2:8-9, 17; 3:1-7 .
[27]  God created man with a pure body, but something of Satan was received into man's body and man's body changed in nature.
[28]  Through man's fall, man let sin enter into him.
[29]  Death being the ultimate issue of Satan's plot concerning man Gen 2:17b.
[30]  God is now saving us in the life of His Son.
[31]  Romans 5:10 says, "For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled."
[32]  LESSON SEVEN THE DEFINITION OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Eph 4:18; Rev 22:1; John 14:6a; 1 John 1:2; 5:12a; Col 3:4a; Rom 8:2a; 2 Cor 3:6b OUTLINE Life is not devotion: Devotion is our exercise of piety.
[33]  We need to know what life is, so this lesson is on the definition of life.
[34]  All the verses cited in the Scripture reading above are very crucial.
[35]  Ephesians 4:18 speaks of being alienated from the life of God.
[36]  Our human life is not the life on which the Bible focuses.
[37]  LESSON EIGHT REGENERATION Scripture Reading: John 3:3-8, 36; 1:12-13; 1 Pet 1:3, 23; James 1:18; 1 Cor 4:15; 1 John 1:2; 2 Pet 1:4 OUTLINE The definition of regeneration John 1:13.
[38]  The way: To realize our need of the life of God John 3:3.
[39]  In the previous lessons, a foundation concerning life has been laid.
[40]  Now we can get into the experiences of life, and the first experience of life is regeneration.
[41]  Needs to Be Buried in the Water of Baptism
[42]  In John 3:5 the Lord Jesus said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."
[43]  We are reborn, not of earthly parents but of the Spirit of God, not in our body or in our soul but in our spirit.
[44]  In this lesson we want to see the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit spoken of in Titus 3:5.
[45]  I. THE WASHING OF REGENERATION A. Regeneration Being a Change of Position
[46]  The washing is mainly to purge away the old things of our natural life on the negative side, and the renewing of the Holy Spirit is to reconstitute our being on the positive side.
[47]  The renewing of the Holy Spirit is not just to reconstitute our being on the positive side but also to transform us.
[48]  Second Corinthians 3:18 says, "But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."
[49]  Ezekiel 36:27a says that besides giving us a new heart and putting in us a new spirit God also put His own Spirit into our being.
[50]  Romans 8:9 and 11 show that the Spirit of God dwells in us to saturate our being with divine, resurrection life.
[51]  The focus of this message may be expressed in the following statement: the washing of regeneration is to purge away the old things of our natural life, and the renewing of the Holy Spirit is to reconstitute us and transform us with the divine life and the divine nature into the image of God.
[52]  LESSON TEN THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:2-3, 5-7, 9; 1 Cor 10:16; 2 Cor 13:14; Phil 2:1; John 15:4-5; Philem.
[53]  6 OUTLINE The meaning of the fellowship of life: Sharing in common 1 Cor 10:16; Philem.
[54]  The King James Version renders the word fellowship as communion.
[55]  The flowing of the divine life within us first is vertical between the Father, the Son, and us 1 John 1:6, 3 .
[56]  The fellowship of life not only brings light to us but also brings the practical cleansing of the blood to us.
[57]  The fellowship of life is preserved, safeguarded, protected, by the sense of life.
[58]  The focus of this message is as follows: the fellowship of life, being the flowing of the divine life, comes from the life of God and is preserved by the sense of life to supply us with the riches of the divine life.
[59]  LESSON ELEVEN THE SENSE OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Rom 8:6, 2, 11; Eph 4:18-19; Heb 8:10; 1 John 2:27; John 15:4-5; Phil 2:13 OUTLINE The meaning of the sense of life: The feeling of death weakness, emptiness, uneasiness, restlessness, depression, dryness, darkness, pain, etc. on the negative side Rom 8:6a.
[60]  The feeling of life and peace strength, satisfaction, peace, rest, release, liveliness, watering, brightness, comfort, etc. on the positive side Rom 8:6b.
[61]  Now that we have seen something concerning the fellowship of life, we want to go on to see the sense of life.
[62]  We saw in the previous message that the fellowship of life is realized by the sense of life and that the sense of life preserves the fellowship of life.
[63]  Romans 8:6 says that the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.
[64]  The law of life is the natural ability and function of life Rom 8:2; Heb 8:10 and is another item of the source of life.
[65]  Because this life-law functions within us, it surely gives us a certain kind of sensation, so it is an aspect of the source of life.
[66]  Now that we have seen something concerning the sense of life, we need to go on to see the dispensing function of the Triune God.
[67]  Once in 1933 or 1934, Brother Watchman Nee spoke with me concerning the basic truths.
[68]  In these verses we can see the Triune God dispensing Himself into the tripartite man.
[69]  First, He dispenses Himself into our spirit, and then from our spirit into our mind.
[70]  If we set our mind upon the spirit, the life in the spirit will get into our mind.
[71]  First, we need to see that God the Father is the source.
[72]  INTO THE THREE PARTS OF MAN Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2a, 6, 10, 11, 9 OUTLINE The divine life v. 2a: The Spirit of life.
[73]  Romans 8 reveals the divine life dispensed into the three parts of man.
[74]  Then verse 11 says that the Spirit of the One who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life to our mortal body through His Spirit who indwells us.
[75]  Thus, verse 2 speaks of the divine life, verse 10 says that our spirit is life, verse 6 says our mind can be life, and verse 11 says that even our body may be given life.
[76]  Verse 8 speaks of God, verse 9 of the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ, and verse 10 of Christ.
[77]  When the Bible says "the Spirit of God," that means the Spirit is God; when the Bible says "the life of God," that means the life is God; when the Bible says "the Spirit of Christ," that means the Spirit is Christ; and when the Bible says "the love of God," that means love is God.
[78]  Romans 8:10 says that since Christ is in us, our spirit is life.
[79]  This is because Christ Himself is this life, and this life is in our spirit.
[80]  Because Christ is in us, our spirit is life.
[81]  First our spirit becomes life and then our mind becomes life.
[82]  This means that the divine life has spread from within our spirit into our soul to saturate our mind.
[83]  Romans 8:11 says that the Spirit of the very God who raised Christ Jesus from the dead gives life to our mortal body, our dying body, through the Spirit who indwells us.
[84]  The final thing we need to stress in this message is the dispensing of the Triune God.
[85]  We need to say repeatedly that in Romans 8 there is the dispensing of the Triune God.
[86]  The Spirit being the source of life and life being the issue of the Spirit v. 6b.
[87]  This life is not our physical life or our soulish life but the very divine life, the life of God, the eternal, uncreated life, which has been imparted into our spirit to be our life.
[88]  This shows that the Spirit not only belongs to life but also has the life law as the law of life.
[89]  AND KNOWING THE SPIRIT 2 Scripture Reading: Romans 8:2, 6 OUTLINE previous chapter Consciousness: Of life: The higher the life, the richer being its consciousness.
[90]  The divine life being the highest life with the richest consciousness.
[91]  This life within us causing us to be full of spiritual consciousness, enabling us to sense the spirit and the things of the spirit.
[92]  In this lesson we want to continue our fellowship on the sense of the spirit and knowing the spirit.
[93]  In the previous lesson we saw four things related to the sense of the spirit: life, law, peace, and death.
[94]  Now we want to talk about the consciousness of these four things and about how to know the spirit by the sense of the spirit.
[95]  After we realize the consciousness of life, the law of life, peace, and death, we can know the spirit by the sense of the spirit.
[96]  Eventually, the divine life becomes the life not only of the Holy Spirit but also of our spirit, because now the Holy Spirit in whom the divine life is contained mingles Himself with our spirit.
[97]  B. By the Sense of the Law of Life 1.
[98]  36:26m; 2 Tim 4:22a; John 3:6b; 1 Cor 6:17; Eph 2:22b; Gal 5:16, 25b; Rom 8:4b; Rev 1:10a OUTLINE Its creation: By Jehovah God breathing the breath of life into man Gen 2:7.
[99]  All of the saints need some basic knowledge of the human spirit.
[100]  This is a great topic, but it is good to have this basic lesson to give the new ones and young ones a general knowledge of this important yet greatly missed point in the Bible.
[101]  What was breathed into man was just the breath of life, but we must be clear that it is very close to the life of God and very close to the Spirit of God.
[102]  Proverbs 20:27 says, "The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah" ASV .
[103]  Generally speaking, the word in Hebrew for spirit is ruach, but the Hebrew word for spirit here is neshamah.
[104]  This indicates that the spirit of man was created for the purpose of receiving and containing the life of God and the Spirit of God.
[105]  Another part or function of our human spirit is the fellowship.
[106]  LESSON SEVENTEEN THE EXERCISE OF OUR SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Prov 20:27; 1 Pet 3:4; Eph 3:16; Ezra 1:1, 5; Rom 12:11; Acts 18:25; Eph 6:18; John 4:24; Luke 1:46-47; 1 Cor 14:32; 2:11a; Mark 2:8a; Acts 19:21a; 1 Cor 5:3-5a; Rev 1:10 OUTLINE Our spirit being the lamp of the Lord, searching all our inward parts Prov 20:27.
[107]  Our spirit being the hidden man of the heart 1 Pet 3:4.
[108]  First Peter 3:4 reveals that our spirit is the hidden man of our heart.
[109]  This man is hidden from the eyes of man, but it is not hidden from the eyes of God, because such a hidden man, that is, a meek and quiet spirit, is pretty in the eyes of God.
[110]  X. OUR SPIRIT KNOWING THE THINGS OF A MAN
[111]  To know the things of a man, we cannot depend upon our mind.
[112]  FOR GODLINESS Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:3-4; 3:15-16; 4:7-8; 6:11; 2 Tim 3:12, 5; 4:22; 2:22 OUTLINE God's economy 1 Tim 1:3-4.
[113]  The mystery of godliness 1 Tim 3:15-16: God manifested in the flesh.
[114]  In this lesson we want to see the exercise of our spirit for godliness.
[115]  All of the verses in the Scripture reading are from 1 and 2 Timothy.
[116]  Strictly speaking, the word exercise, in the sense of the exercise of our spirit for godliness, is used in the New Testament only in 1 Timothy.
[117]  First Timothy 1:3 and 4 say, "Even as I exhorted you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things nor to give heed to myths and unending genealogies, which produce questionings rather than God's economy, which is in faith."
[118]  God, however, is dispensing Himself into us, the living vessels, who already have our own taste, choice, preference, feeling, thinking, mentality, will, etc. If we do not exercise our spirit strongly to cooperate with the Lord, God cannot dispense Himself into us.
[119]  Godliness is a Christian life, a godly life, that expresses God as the issue of God's dispensing, and this is a mystery.
[120]  The promise of the present life, a life that is in this age, is like the promises in Matthew 6:33; John 16:33; Philippians 4:6-7; 1 Peter 5:8-10; etc. Here the present life does not mean our physical life, because the word here is zoe, referring to the divine, uncreated life of God.
[121]  The promise of the coming life, a life that is in the next age and in eternity, is like the promises in 2 Peter 1:10-11; 2 Timothy 2:12; Revelation 2:7, 17; 21:6-7, etc. Godliness is profitable for all things of the present life and also of the coming life, referring to our spiritual life, not our physical life or soulish life.
[122]  Paul told Timothy, "But you, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, meekness" 1 Tim 6:11 .
[123]  LESSON NINETEEN A PROPER SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Psa 51:10b, 12b, 17a; Isa 57:15; 66:2; 1 Pet 3:4; Gal 6:1; 1 Cor 4:21; Matt 5:3; Luke 9:55 OUTLINE A right spirit Psa 51:10b.
[124]  Also in Psalm 51, in David's repentance and confession, he prayed that God would give him a willing spirit.
[125]  A contrite and humble spirit is very close to a broken spirit.
[126]  LESSON TWENTY DISCERNING SPIRIT FROM SOUL Scripture Reading: Heb 4:12; Matt 16:24, 26; Luke 9:25; Rom 8:6b, 4; 1 Cor 6:17 OUTLINE The spirit being concealed in the soul as the marrow is concealed in the joints Heb 4:12.
[127]  The soul needing to be broken that the spirit may be divided from it as the joints need to be broken that the marrow may be divided from them.
