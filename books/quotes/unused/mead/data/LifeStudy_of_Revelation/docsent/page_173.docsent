   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ANGEL OF THE ABYSS A. Coming up out of the Abyss</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Antichrist will also be the angel of the abyss 9:11 , which is a deep shaft.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that Antichrist will come out of the abyss 11:7; 17:8 and will possess the spirit of Nero.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some may wonder how we know that the resuscitated Antichrist will possess the spirit of Nero.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the one hand, as far as his physical origin is concerned, Antichrist will come from one of the four kingdoms of the empire of ancient Macedonia and Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the other hand, the Bible clearly indicates that he will emerge out of the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, his name will have a number, six hundred sixty-six.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the numerical evaluation of the Hebrew letters, the number of the name Caesar Nero equals six hundred sixty-six.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that the coming Antichrist will be Caesar Nero.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With the help of some of the foregoing teachers, we have seen that after Caesar Nero died his spirit undoubtedly went to the abyss for some future use.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At a certain time, his spirit will be released from the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are told clearly in Revelation that the coming Antichrist will suffer a fatal blow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although he will be killed, his fatal wound will be healed 13:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This denotes resuscitation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we come to chapter seventeen, we shall see that Antichrist will be resuscitated with the spirit of Caesar Nero.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Antichrist will firstly be the seventh Caesar who will be assassinated, probably before the last three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then the spirit of Nero will be released from the abyss to enter into the body of the seventh Caesar, who will then be resuscitated to become the eighth Caesar.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This will be a counterfeit of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christians have been preaching that Christ was the only One to be crucified and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the day is coming when another one will be killed and seemingly resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Due to this counterfeit of the resurrection, the whole world will marvel after the beast 13:3 , Antichrist, the counterfeit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He, the seventh, will become the eighth; yet he will have the body of the seventh and the spirit of the fifth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all need the enlightenment of this proper understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>B. The King of the Army</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>of the Demon-possessed Locusts</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the angel of the abyss, Antichrist will be the king of the demon-possessed locusts 9:1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the sounding of the fifth trumpet, Satan will fall to the earth and will be given the key of the shaft of the abyss 9:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The star in 9:1 refers to Satan, who will be cast down from heaven to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After Satan has been cast down to earth, he will use the key of the shaft of the abyss to release an army of extraordinary, demon-possessed locusts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the time these locusts are released from the abyss, the spirit of Nero will probably be released with them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They may all come out of the abyss together, and Antichrist will become the king of this army of locusts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we have seen, these locusts will torment men for five months.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Satan, the dragon, and Antichrist, the beast, will collaborate to torment and injure man whom God created for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This will be the fifth trumpet, the first of the three woes, the beginning of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>C. Abaddon and Apollyon</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Revelation 9:11 says that the name of the angel of the abyss in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek is Apollyon.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Abaddon means destruction, and Apollyon means destroyer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Antichrist will be both the destroyer and the destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He will be consumed with rage, will be obsessed with a satanic hatred, and will bring destruction wherever he goes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Satan will realize that his time is short, that he has just three and a half years to act on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, working through Antichrist, he will do everything possible to damage mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE MAN OF SIN</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Antichrist will also be the man of sin 2 Thes 2:3-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the apostle Paul wrote 2 Thessalonians, he must have been impressed regarding this man of sin from his knowledge of the book of Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to Daniel chapters eight and eleven, Antichrist will exalt himself above all gods and call himself God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul s word concerning this in 2 Thessalonians 2 must refer to the book of Daniel.</S>
