<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. Believing and Good Works</H2><P>Some people think, "I am a sinner and need to have good behavior. Being saved just by believing in Jesus is too cheap. I should believe in Jesus and do good works so that I will be assured of being saved." But this is not the teaching of the Bible. Although God saves us unto good works, that is, we have been "created in Christ Jesus for good works" (Eph. 2:10) and "prepared unto every good work" (2 Tim. 2:21), nevertheless, we must remember that the Bible tells us that good works come after being saved. Salvation is not a result of good works, nor is it the result of good works in addition to believing. A child cannot walk before he is born; in like manner, we have to be reborn first, and then good works come. It is impossible to expect a person to do good works before he is reborn.</P><P>Romans 4:4 through 6 says, "Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due. But to the one who does not work, but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted as righteousness. Even as David also speaks blessing on the man to whom God accounts righteousness apart from works." The wages of the one who works are not accounted according to grace but according to what is due. He deserves his wages because he has done a good work. But the faith of the one who does not work but believes (let us note the word "believes") on Him who justifies the ungodly is accounted as righteousness. We can be saved not by works but by faith. Something else in addition to believing is not needed. We must remember that faith alone is sufficient. David said that "the man to whom God accounts righteousness apart from works" was blessed. "Apart from works" shows that salvation has nothing to do with works.</P><P>Ephesians 2:8 through 10 says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works that no one should boast. For we are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them." Verses 8 and 9 tell us that we are saved by grace through the faith which God has given to us and not by our own works. Verse 10 tells us that God has saved us to do the good works which He prepared for us. We are saved by grace through faith; after being saved we should do the good works which God prepared for us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>4. Believing and Praying</H2><P>Some people think that praying should also be a condition for salvation. They do not realize that salvation is by faith not by prayer. Since the Lord Jesus Christ has already borne our sins and been judged by God, we do not even need to pray; all we have to do is believe. To pray is to ask God to do something, but to believe is to accept what God has already accomplished. We believe that God has judged Jesus Christ and that Christ has died for us. The cross has fully accomplished the work of redemption so that whoever believes in what God has done shall be saved.</P><P>However, someone may ask, "Does not Romans 10:13 say that `whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved'? Does this not show us that we must pray to be saved and that if we do not pray we will not be saved?" But let us read the following verse which says, "How then shall they call upon Him into whom they have not believed?" Believing comes first, and calling comes after. First there is the believing, and then there is the calling. To call is an expression of faithâ€”it is not an independent or additional requirement. Believing includes calling, and believing spontaneously produces calling. Furthermore, the calling in this verse is not an ordinary plea; it is an invoking of the name of the Lord. This is similar to what was spoken in the previous text about confessing the Lord Jesus with the mouth. It is also referred to in 1 Corinthians 12:3: "No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit." The name of the Lord is salvation. Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord or says that Jesus is Lord will be saved. Can one say Jesus is Lord if he does not believe that Jesus is Lord? On the other hand, can one who believes that Jesus is Lord not say that Jesus is Lord or call on His name? Therefore, prayer is not a requirement of being saved. Faith and faith alone is the requirement.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>5. Believing and Baptism</H2><P>Some may rightly think that salvation is not dependent on hope, confession, works, or prayer, but still think that one must both believe and be baptized in order to be saved. This concept is also incorrect. Even though Mark 16:16 says, "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved," we have to pay attention to what the word "saved" refers to. In the Bible there are several kinds of salvation: the eternal salvation by which one obtains eternal life, the believer's daily salvation, the salvation through affliction, the salvation of the body, and the salvation of the soul in which one reigns with the Lord in the kingdom of the heavens. The salvation related to baptism is our salvation from the realm of the sinful world. This is different from having eternal life. Having eternal life is a personal matter of receiving eternal life, but being baptized is to be saved out of a sinful realm. If a person only believes but is not baptized, although he has eternal life, in the eyes of the world he is still not a saved one. He must rise up to be baptized and declare that he has nothing to do with the sinful realm. Others will then acknowledge that he has been saved. In order to receive eternal life, deliverance from condemnation, and eternal salvation, all that one has to do is believe; there are no additional requirements. The first part of Mark 16:16 says, "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved," and the second part says, "But he who does not believe shall be condemned." The second part does not say that "he who does not believe and who is not baptized shall be condemned." In order to be saved from the sinful realm of the world, one must believe and be baptized. In order to be condemned, however, all that he has to do is not believe. In other words, the requirement for not being condemned is just believing; it is not baptism in addition to believing. The criminal on the cross was not baptized, yet the Lord said, "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise" (Luke 23:40-43). He believed and was not condemned; rather, he was saved and had eternal life. Therefore, baptism is not a condition for receiving eternal life.</P>
