   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Building Up the House of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being the Urgent Need</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before I went on this trip, I did not expect that the urgent need in every place is the building up of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Based on this need, the messages that I gave in Hong Kong were concerning the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The main point in my fellowship was that the saints must build up the house of God in every locality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The saints can testify that they see the building up the local church as the house of God, and they fellowship concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many messages have been given concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, after visiting so many places, my feeling concerning the building up of the house of God is even stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE SITUATION IN JAPAN</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our first stop was in Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After we arrived, I realized that Japan is a large and modern country that has a large population and many Christians; however, God s house is not there.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The three largest cities in the world have about the same population.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Tokyo, New York, and London each have between eight and ten million people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we include the suburbs, metropolitan Tokyo, New York, and London have even larger populations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even though I have visited these cities before, I had not been very interested in Tokyo.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But this time when we were in Tokyo, I was amazed because from morning to night the streets are filled with cars and people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even though Japan has a large population and two to three thousand missionaries, God does not have a house there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While I was there, this feeling was constantly in me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Japan has so many people and so many Christians, but God does not have a house.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many of the Lord s seekers also feel that they do not have a home.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The believers who meet in other groups and the saints in our meetings asked where they should go.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They feel homeless.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are Christian groups that were established by local Japanese believers, and there are mission groups that were established two hundred years ago by Western missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moreover, there are two to three thousand Western missionaries who labor diligently in Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, the first thing that the seeking believers asked me was where they should go.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes I inquired why they asked this question, and they replied that they do not receive much supply and help where they meet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, there is no pasture with food to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They do not have a home that can give them food.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No matter what our children do or where they go to play, at a certain time they say that it is time to go home and eat.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is a place where they can rest and enjoy food when they are hungry and need to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, many saints cannot say that they have a place where they can eat when they are hungry or can rest when they are tired.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Their needs are not met.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE SITUATION IN AMERICA AND CANADA</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After Japan we went to America.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Wherever we went, from the West Coast to the East Coast, I tried to understand the situation of the Christian groups.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We stayed in New York City for quite a while and thought that if we could understand the situation in New York, we would understand the situation in the whole country.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>New York City is representative of America, but other places are not representative of America.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From my observation I saw that the large country of America, which has thousands of Christians, does not have a house for God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we were in San Francisco, I attended the crusade of a famous evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The crusade truly had the Lord s presence, and many people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Someone said that more people were saved when this evangelist was in New York.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, after their salvation, the newly saved ones are like newborn babies who do not have a place to grow up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In other words, there is no home to feed and care for the newborn babies.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we were in New York, we did not announce our meetings, but believers, especially the Chinese believers, wanted to attend our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After they listened to the messages, they cried out that they do not have a home.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are several Christian groups among the Chinese believers, but they all said that they do not have food.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They do not have a place to rest; they do not have a home.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In summary, the impression we received from our visit is that the children of God do not have a home.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the situation in America and in Canada.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We did not contact many people in Canada, but we made a special visit to a well-known group founded by Oswald J. Smith.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>While we were there, he was holding a revival meeting in another place.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The group is called the Peoples Church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Over the past fifty years this Christian group has supported the largest percentage of missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is a well-known fact that they are still supporting more than two hundred missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They meet in a small chapel, but they are zealous in their support of missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we were there, a group of sisters was meeting and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The information we received concerning Canada is that Canada is desolate and without any large gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In America there are evangelists who attract large crowds of people to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Canada, however, there does not seem to be any activity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This indicates a desolate situation.</S>
