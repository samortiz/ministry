Now let us consider the outline point by point. First, the law of the Spirit of life is the key to the mysterious organism in God's New Testament economy. The mysterious organism in God's New Testament economy is a matter of Christ being our life (Col. 3:4a). With life, there is the law. Without the law of life, what we have is just outward regulations and ordinances. For example, the Ten Commandments that God gave to Moses were not the law of life, but were laws in the letter. They were there to regulate man and to expose man's real condition. But the law of the Spirit of life that we talk about is a life-law. The life in this life-law is Christ. Christ is life, and in His life there is a law. Hence, the life of Christ is a law.</P><P>Furthermore, the mysterious law of the Spirit of life in God's New Testament economy depends on the Spirit of life as the law (Rom. 8:2a). Hence, the law and the Spirit of life are not separate. Rather, the law is the Spirit of life. Moreover, this law of the Spirit of life is the key to Christ being our life. According to the revelation of the Bible, on the one hand, the Spirit of life denotes Christ, because Christ is life. On the other hand, it denotes the Triune God. The Spirit of life is the consummated Spirit, who is the Triune God Himself.</P><P>In the whole universe, the highest and greatest law is one in which the Triune God is the law, because the Triune God is the highest, richest, and best life. There is no other life that is higher and better than the Triune God. Hence, there is no other law that is higher and better than the Triune God as law. Today, this law of the Spirit of life in us is tremendous, for this law is just the Triune God Himself. What Romans 8:2-13 talks about is actually this law. Verse 2 tells us in plain words that the law of the Spirit of life has freed us. After this it talks about the processed Triune God working Himself into us, the tripartite man. First, He enters into our spirit to make our spirit life (v. 10). Next, He saturates our mind, so that our mind also becomes life (v. 6). Finally, He permeates our bodies from the soul to which our mind belongs, giving life to our mortal bodies (v. 11). The purpose of the Triune God dispensing Himself into our whole being in this way is not merely to be life but to be a law.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Mysteries in God's New Testament Economy &nbsp; pg 34</div><br></body></html>
