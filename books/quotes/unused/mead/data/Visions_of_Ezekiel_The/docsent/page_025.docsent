   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN A SKY AS CLEAR AS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TERRIBLE CRYSTAL Scripture Reading: Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1:22-25</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These four verses are very profound and deep in their meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They tell us that upon the heads of the four living creatures there is the firmament or the expanse which we call the sky.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The appearance of the sky is like the terrible crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is so clear that it looks terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This sky stretches forth over the heads of all the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then it says that under this kind of sky the living creatures stretch their two wings straight.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the last chapter we saw that the straight wings are stretched forth and joined one to the other.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then it says that the four living creatures use the other two wings to cover their body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever they move and whenever they act, a voice or a sound comes from the wings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The voice that comes out of their wings is like the voice of great waters and also like the voice of the Almighty, that is, the Almighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is also the voice of a tumult, like the voice of an army.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word "host" here means army, so the sound is like that of an army.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, when they stop and stand still, they lower their wings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At that time a voice comes from the firmament above them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the voice comes, they stand still; they stop and lower their wings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must look into the spiritual significance and application of all these points.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>BASED ON THE PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must realize that these four verses are based upon the preceding verses.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Please remember that first we experience a storm with the wind blowing, which brings in the cloud of God's presence to overshadow us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we enjoy the presence of the Lord, the cloud brings in the fire to burn us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Out of the burning fire, we gain the electrum and become a living creature.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a living creature we can then express Christ with others in a coordinated way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have four faces to express the all-inclusive, corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we must experience and enjoy the eagle's wings, that is, we must move by the divine power, the divine strength, and by the grace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must also be able to cover ourselves, to hide ourselves, under His overshadowing wings, that is, under His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must also learn how to work as a proper man by using the man's hands.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, we need to learn how to walk on the calf's straight feet, having no crookedness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our Christian walk should be straight, frank, honest, sincere, and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This will qualify us to have the proper coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Within the coordination, the fire will be going up and down as coals to burn us and as torches to enlighten us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At such a time, the holy God, as the consuming fire, will be among us in a corporate way, burning and moving.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In addition, there will be a high and dreadful wheel beside us, meaning that we have God's move on this earth by us and with us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Within that wheel is a wheel, signifying that within our move is the Lord's move.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is moving within us and along with us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By having such a move, we will be full of eyes, having the insight and the foresight.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A CLEAR SKY, EXPANDING AND STABLE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After we have experienced the items of the first twenty-one verses, the sky over our heads will be crystal-clear 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It will be like a big expanse of crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We will have a wide, clear expanse above us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that above us is an open, clear heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The sky signifies the heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Not only is the sky clear above our head; it is also expanding.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not just a matter of having a clear sky, vertically, from the heaven to the earth, but it is also a matter of having a clear sky, horizontally, which means it is expanding.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our sky should be clear and expanding.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Before we were saved, our heavens were dark, cloudy, foggy, and even smoggy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was also very narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There was no wide expanse.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There was hardly any heaven and hardly any sky.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But one day we repented, confessed our sins, and accepted the Lord Jesus as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more we confessed our sins, the more the sky was cleared up for us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After such a thorough confession, we had, for the first time, the sensation that our sky was clear.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There was the sense that the day was dawning, that the clouds were leaving, and that the fog was lifting.</S>
