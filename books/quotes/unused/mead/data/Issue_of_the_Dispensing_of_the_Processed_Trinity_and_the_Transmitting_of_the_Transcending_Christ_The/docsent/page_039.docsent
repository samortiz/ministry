   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If you have received the gift of a spirit of wisdom and of revelation, you will see that the church is just one.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the eyes of God, all the local churches are just one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When you live in a certain town, you meet with the saints in that town.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You are still a part of the one church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You may say, "I'm burdened to build up the church in my locality."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You are burdened, but God is not so burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is burdened to build up His church, the one church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the church was first formed, it was very normal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But after a short while, Satan came in and did something to damage the one Body of Christ, the one church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Satan worked to such an extent to form the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word catholic means universally one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In a sense this is not bad.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the saints are one church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are all catholic, but the Catholic Church is under a pope.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Under the pope are the cardinals, who are the cabinet members of the papal government.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then under the cardinals are the archbishops, the bishops, and the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This forms a hierarchy to control people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That damaged the Body of Christ to the uttermost for ten centuries, from about A.D. 500 to 1500.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then Martin Luther was raised up in the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He left the Catholic Church, but he did not take care of the truth concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, he helped the Germans to form the state church, the church of a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, other state churches were formed in the Scandinavian countries and in England.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today there is the Church of England, and the queen of England is the head of the Anglican church, the Episcopalian church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some pursuers and lovers of Christ did not agree with the Catholic Church or the state churches, so they invented the private churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today there are private churches such as the Baptist church, practicing baptism by immersion, and the Presbyterian church, practicing the government of the church through the presbytery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, the Brethren rose up in England, and they stressed that the church should not be under anyone's control.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church must be free.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They were free to such an extent that they established local churches on streets.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These were not city churches but street churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not long after the Brethren were raised up, they were divided into hundreds of divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I know of one case where a group of them divided over whether to have a piano or an organ in their services.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, one group became a "piano church," and the other became an "organ church."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today there are also the Pentecostals who care only for speaking in tongues and miraculous gifts, not for God's desire to have His one church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many of them do not care whether their speaking in tongues is real or false.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Other seekers of Christ take the excuse that they do not like to be under any man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They only want to be under the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If I do not want to be under you and you do not want to be under me, we cannot have a church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead, each of us becomes a "church."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today there is much division and confusion among the Lord's children.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are many Chinese churches such as the Church of Taiwan in Anaheim and the Taiwan Church of the Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>People are too free to set up divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It seems that establishing a church is easier than establishing a restaurant.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to have a church life, so we need to be clear about today's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our constitution is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must come back to our constitution and check everything of today's situation with what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must come back to the Bible and see what the Bible says about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's economy is not for the purpose of having only individual believers to be saved, to be spiritual, and then to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is not God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the teaching of fallen Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bible tells us God has a desire, and He has made an economy to dispense Himself into His chosen people and make His chosen people His many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then He transforms them into His treasure and seals them with His life element unto the redemption of their body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Through the transcending Christ's transmitting, He brings them together to make them one church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is why we say that there is the need of a recovery of the proper church life according to God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Praise the Lord and thank the Lord that we have seen the light to this extent, and we have been brought into the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But regretfully, our seeing is not that high.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our sight is not up to the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are still merely for our local church in our city.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>None of us should be only for our church in our city.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are here for God's church in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Every local expression, every local church, should be the same to us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If I am in Anaheim, I surely should meet, worship, serve, and work in the church in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Next year I may go to Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then after another month, I may go to another place.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Every church is my church because that is God's church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There are no regional differences.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To think that a certain region is my region for my work is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Christ has only one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need a spirit of wisdom and revelation with the eyes of our heart being enlightened to see God's vision and to know God's economy in His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The center of God's economy is His desire to have many sons constituted through transformation into one Body, which is the church to be expressed on this earth in many localities as local expressions, local churches, and all these local churches are one church.</S>
