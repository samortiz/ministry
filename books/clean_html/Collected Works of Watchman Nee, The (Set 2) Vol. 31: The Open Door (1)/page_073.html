<h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Dear sister in the Lord:</p><p>I received your letter from Hankow and was filled with unspeakable joy! My living in the past several months has really been in a black tunnel. I have passed through many dangers, but thankfully the Lord's presence protected and constantly comforted me. Since I left Wu-Sung on October 31 for Hangchow, I stayed in town for fourteen days, and then I followed the people here from Hangchow on the fifteenth. On the nineteenth, we arrived in Jien-Teh, Chekiang and stayed for ten days. Later, I went with my elder sister to Li-Shui. We arrived on December 2. I really am not accustomed to life here. I have wanted to go to Shanghai for a long time, but the Father has not yet allowed me. I am still planning to go to Shanghai. I hope God will allow me to go and will open a way for me. I think that Miss Chang must be with you; please greet her for me. Where is Miss Wang? I miss her! Even though I am in this environment, I am together with you sisters every day in the Lord. I no longer have a home, so what will I do? God will decide! That's all for now. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your sister,<br />Jing-tze<br />February 18</p><p>(Sister Chao Jing-tze will be going to Shanghai soon. Letters for her can be sent c/o Ms. Cheng Yi-feng, 34 Lane 10, Hardoon Road, Shanghai&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Lien-Shui, Northern Kiangsu</h2><p>Greetings to Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>Bei Chien-ji in Lien-Shui was attacked and robbed by bandits on January 26. All the brothers and sisters lost some money, clothes, and other possessions. The bandits wanted to shoot the responsible brother, Brother Kao Yu-kun, but he strongly trusted in the Lord. He placed his body, soul, and spirit in the Lord's hands and received the Lord's protection. Afterward, the brothers and sisters did not grieve. On the contrary, they were exceedingly happy and met every day. Thank the Lord! God did a special work and saved more than thirty new brothers and sisters. This is something to rejoice about! The condition of the churches in Sun-Chiao and Lien-Shui is quite good. Please do not worry about them. Lien-Shui has received The Open Door. Chien-Ji and Sun-Chiao have not received their copies yet. Please check your mailing records. Peace and well-being in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Ge Chung-yi<br />February 17, under the lamp<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Shanghai</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings to my respected sister in the Lord,</p><p> Miss Ruth Lee:</p><p>I received and read your letter of January 22. In it I learned that you (Sister Wang and Sister Chang) and Brother Yu-zhi are all well. I was very comforted. I also heard that the Lord had opened a door for the gospel in Chungking, so I was even more joyful. May the Lord give you more wisdom and power from above so that you may be fishers of men for the Lord. We here can only pray for you. The meetings continue as usual by the Lord's grace. The brothers and sisters are beginning to pick up the responsibility because they see that the local church is really theirs. Therefore, they are all learning to go the way of the cross for the Lord's sake. Brother Nee has been in Shanghai recently, and he is conducting a Bible study. It will last for about two weeks. Then he will go abroad to England. I have enclosed an announcement for the Bible study. Please read it. The children's meeting on the Lord's Day morning began last Lord's Day. It is at 262 Hardoon Road. We were planning to have a baptism soon, but after considering the situation, perhaps we will not be able to do it for awhile. The book The Normal Christian Church Life is still being proofread. May the Lord bless this book so that many believers and workers will know their own position and be able to stand firm in it. If they do, the church and the work will be recovered back to the beginning. Moreover, the number of people in the Bible study is more than ever before. The brothers and sisters in fellowship with us are not the only ones who come; there are also many outsiders, and the meeting place is not big enough. May the Lord bless this conference so that every believer may be edified. May the grace of the Lord be with you! Greet the brothers and sisters in Chungking.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Du Tsong-chen, Wu Si-gu, Lin Kwang-biao<br />February 7<br />[Address omitted]</p>
