   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEADING IN THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When God's work started in several places in China in 1921, some truths were not clearly distinguished.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For instance, grace and law were not clearly defined; nor were the kingdom of heaven and eternal life, grace and reward, or salvation and victory clearly differentiated.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The understanding of truths in the Lord was neither deep nor rich enough.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the understanding of the gospel of grace was comparatively clear, and it was being quite clearly preached at that time when Mr. Wang Ming-dao was in Teh-Chow, Sister Pearl Wang and Ruth Lee were in Nanking, and some other workers and I were in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Publishing The Present Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By the end of 1922 I had a burden to publish a magazine, because a number had been saved in Foochow, and the number was increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time, Brother Leland Wang was away in the Yangtze region doing evangelistic work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only his wife and children were at home.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He asked me to move into his house to help take care of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Daily, Sister Wang and I prayed for the magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I was at that time extremely pressed financially.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After praying for more than a month, there was not a single dollar on hand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One morning I arose and said, "There is no need to pray further that would be a lack of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What I must do is start writing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God need not put the money into our hands before we begin to write!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Henceforth, I will no longer pray for this matter, but will proceed with the preparation of drafts."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When everything was ready and the last word had been written, I said, "Now the money will come."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, I knelt down to pray again, saying, "O God, the draft is ready for printing, but there is still no money."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After praying thus, I felt wonderfully confident that God would certainly give the money.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We began to praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The amazing thing was that we had no more risen to our feet than there was a knock at the door.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I thought someone was coming with the money.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That house being Sister Wang's, I let her answer the door.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To my surprise, the one who came was a wealthy yet stingy sister.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Oh, since it is she," I thought, "there could be no money."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But she said to me, "I have something extremely important to see you about."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"Please tell me," I replied.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then she asked, "How should a Christian donate?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I replied that we should not adopt the Old Testament way of paying tithes, but follow the word in 2 Corinthians 9:7, which says that each person should give according to the order of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He may donate a half, a third, a tenth, or a twentieth of his income.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She then asked, "Where should the donation be made?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I answered, "Do not give it to a church which opposes the Lord, nor to those who do not believe the Bible or the redemption of the Lord's shed blood.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If no one contributes to them, they will not be able to carry on their preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Pray before each donation; then give it either to the poor or to some work, but never to an improper organization."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She said, "The Lord has been speaking to me for many days concerning my excessive devotion to money.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At first I could not reconcile myself to this, but now I can do so.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When I was praying this morning, the Lord said to me, 'There is no need for you to pray anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just start giving away your money.'</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I was rather disconcerted, but now I am here with thirty dollars for you to use for the Lord's work."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This money was just sufficient for the printing of fourteen hundred copies of The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Later, another person gave an additional thirty dollars, which was sufficient for the postage and incidental expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is how the first issue of The Present Testimony was published.</S>
