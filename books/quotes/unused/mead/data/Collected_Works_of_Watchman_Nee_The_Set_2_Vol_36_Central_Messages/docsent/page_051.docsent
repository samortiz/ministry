   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"THINGS" CANNOT GO ON FOREVER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The same is true with spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What do many people desire and seek after?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are after a "thing."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many sisters have come to me and said that they want patience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I often felt that the word "patience" was too small to them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They wished they could be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They thought it would be wonderful if God gave them a dosage of patience and they took it and became patient.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They sought patience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a dosage to them, and it will last for three to five days.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But there is an expiration date on it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After a while, the word "patience" becomes smaller and smaller, until one day the word runs out.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If it is a thing, there is always a day when it will run out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even if it is something one receives through prayer, it will still run out.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sometimes to answer His children's immediate need and to accommodate their foolishness, God answers their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But God does not answer such prayers all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He will not go on this way forever.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In God's world, there are not many "things."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God only has Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He cannot allow patience, humility, or love to continue to exist as things by themselves on this earth forever.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What does He want in the end?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the end He wants to show us that Christ is patience, Christ is humility, and Christ is love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He gives Christ, not "things."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One day when our relationship with the Lord becomes proper, the matter of patience will be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is a matter of Christ, not a matter of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once our relationship with Christ is normalized to the degree that God expects it to be, the matter of patience will be settled, the matter of pride will be settled, and ten thousand other matters will also be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The issue is Christ; the issue is not "things."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE KNOWING OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, in God's eyes everything depends on how we know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What does it mean to know Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some people know Christ as their love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Others know Christ as their humility.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some know Christ more, while others know Him less.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whatever "thing" you know Christ to be, that "thing" becomes your proper knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the meaning of knowing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The "knowledge of Christ" is not an abstract term; it is not something objective.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our knowing of Christ is positive and substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We know Christ by knowing Him as the various "things"; we know that He is this to us or that He is that to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some of you can stand up and testify, "I did not know what it was to be clean, because everything with me, from my heart to my head and thoughts, was all unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But thank the Lord that Christ has become my cleanliness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God has made Him cleanliness to me."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You can see immediately that this "thing" is not something that you have; this "thing" is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When Christ lives in you, He brings this "thing" along with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is something that He brings along with Him; it is not something that you have in yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is genuine Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I must say bluntly that unless a child of God has his eyes opened to see that Christ is his things, he is not of much use, because all that he has is behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is always the one who is doing the works.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even if he prays and God gives something to him, he only has temporary things that have no spiritual value in God's eyes at all.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To some people, grace from God comes in the form of separate individual things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To others, who also have the experience of grace, their grace comes in the form of a person, who is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One day you will say to God, "I thank You and praise You because the grace I have received is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>My grace is a person; it is something personified."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When you can tell the difference between these two things, you can tell the difference between life and death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many brothers can only differentiate between right and wrong; they cannot differentiate between life and death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They can only differentiate between what is good and what is bad.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is only one simple explanation for this: they do not see that everything is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He, the person, is the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He, the person, is the thing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the spiritual realm, there is only Christ; there are not many matters or things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If God opens your eyes one day, you will see that this and that are things as soon as you touch them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is very strange, yet it is very real.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A man may be full of many things.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He may be patient, meek, humble, faithful, loving, warm, forgiving, and merciful; he may be filled with many things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But what you see is only a big pile of things.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You can at least tell the difference between a man's ring and his finger.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You can at least tell the difference between a man's hat and his head, his glasses and his eyes, or his clothes and his body.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you can tell the difference between these things, you should be able to tell the difference between a thing and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you have never seen this, you will be surprised by what I am saying.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But if you have seen this, you will see that this is a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Everything that is a thing is dead in itself, and outwardly it produces nothing but death.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is dead in itself, and when you perform this thing, if you have any spiritual sense at all, you will feel dead as well.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>While you are doing it outwardly, you sense that the result is death and not life.</S>
