   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 19 DAY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 26:6-16</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>6 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the 1 leper,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>7 A woman came to Him, having an alabaster flask of ointment of great value, and she poured it on His head as He reclined at table.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>8 But when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, Why this 1 waste?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>9 For this could have been sold for much and given to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>10 But Jesus, knowing it, said to them, Why do you trouble the woman?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She has done a noble deed to Me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>11 For the poor you have with you always, 1 but you do not always have Me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>12 For in pouring out this ointment on My body, she has done it 1for My burial.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>13 Truly I say to you, Wherever 1 this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, 2 what this woman has done shall also be told as a memorial of her.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>14 1 At that time one of the twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>15 And said, What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver Him to you?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And they weighed out to him 1 thirty pieces of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>16 And from then on he sought opportunity to deliver Him up.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>6 1 A leper signifies a sinner 8:2 and note 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Simon, a leper, must have been healed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Being grateful to the Lord and loving Him, he spread a feast v. 7 in his house for the Lord and His disciples in order to enjoy His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A saved sinner would always do this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>8 1 The disciples considered Mary's love offering to the Lord a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Throughout the past twenty centuries thousands of precious lives, heart treasures, high positions, and golden futures have been "wasted" upon the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To those who love Him in such a way He is altogether lovely and worthy of their offering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What they have poured upon Him is not a waste but a fragrant testimony of His sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>11 1 We must love the Lord and grasp the opportunity to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>12 1 Mary received the revelation of the Lord's death through the Lord's words in 16:21; 17:22-23; 20:18-19; and v. 2 of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, she grasped the opportunity to pour upon the Lord the best that she had.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To love the Lord with our best requires a revelation concerning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>13 1 In the foregoing verse the Lord spoke of His burial, implying His death and resurrection, accomplished for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, in this verse He called the gospel "this gospel," referring to the gospel of His death, burial, and resurrection 1 Cor 15:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>13 2 The story of the gospel is that the Lord loved us, and the story of Mary is that she loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must preach both the Lord's loving us and our loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One is for our salvation, and the other is for our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>14 1 At that time indicates that while one of the disciples was expressing her love to the Lord, loving Him to the uttermost, another was about to betray Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One was treasuring the Lord, and at the same time another was delivering Him up.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>15 1 I.e., thirty shekels of silver, the worth of a slave Exo 21:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Along with Simon, Mary also probably thought that this was her last chance to do something over the Lord's body to anoint Him for burial.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In a very real sense, Mary buried the Lord Jesus before He was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I believe that the others like Peter, James, and John did not receive the Lord's prophecy concerning His crucifixion properly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to the Lord's testimony, Mary certainly received His word regarding this, for the Lord testified that in pouring out the ointment, she had done it for His burial.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This was a sign that Mary understood what the Lord had prophesied concerning His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Life-study of Matthew, p.</S>
