<p>The evil one is very crafty. He concealed himself as a serpent (3:1). This serpent was not only subtle but also beautiful; it was attractive to man. Satan drew man&rsquo;s attention to himself through the subtle and beautiful serpent.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Approaching the Woman</h2>
<p>When Satan usurped man, he not only appeared as a serpent, but he also approached the woman. Satan is very subtle and clever. He knew that it was easier to tempt the woman than the man, so he approached Eve, not Adam (vv. 1-2). Women are more easily deceived because they are the weaker vessel (1 Pet. 3:7). Hence, when Satan wanted to deceive man, he approached the woman instead of the man. Because Satan took this way, he was able to deceive man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Causing Man to Doubt God&rsquo;s Word</h2>
<p>God said to man, &ldquo;Of every tree of the garden you may eat freely, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die&rdquo; (Gen. 2:16-17). When Satan asked the woman, &ldquo;Did God really say, You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?&rdquo; (3:1), his words caused man to doubt God&rsquo;s word. The first step in Satan&rsquo;s work is to cause us to doubt God and question God&rsquo;s word. Dr. Haldeman has said that when the serpent in the garden inquired, &ldquo;Did God really say?&rdquo; its posture was in the form of a question mark, with the head raised and the body bent. As long as Satan can put such a question into us, he will be able to deceive us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Deceiving Man with Lies</h2>
<p>God said, &ldquo;Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die&rdquo; (2:17). Satan, however, said, &ldquo;You shall not surely die!&rdquo; (3:4). This was a lie to deceive man. Furthermore, he told the woman that God commanded man not to eat of the tree, because &ldquo;God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil&rdquo; (v. 5). Here again Satan was crafty with his words in order to deceive man. This is the reason that the Bible speaks of the serpent deceiving Eve by his craftiness (2 Cor. 11:3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Infusing His Evil Thoughts into Man</h2>
<p>In Genesis 3:5 Satan said to Eve, &ldquo;God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil.&rdquo; With these words the evil one not only slandered God and caused Eve to be suspicious toward God; he also injected his pride into her so that she wanted to be equal to God. Satan rebelled against God because he wanted to uplift himself to be equal with God. In the garden he injected the same evil thought into Eve through his words so that man would join him in his rebellion against God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Tempting Man to Contact<br />
the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</h2>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s purpose in tempting man was to entice man to contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil so that the life of that tree would enter into man. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan, and the life of this tree signifies the life of Satan. By tempting man to contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Satan was actually tempting man to contact himself. He wanted to put the life of this tree into man. His evil intention was to inject his evil, contradictory, and rebellious life into man. God desired that man would contact the tree of life in order to receive His life and be joined with Him, thus enabling God to gain man in order to fulfill His plan and destroy Satan. Satan wanted man to contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in order to receive his life and enter into an illicit union with him so that he could usurp man, fulfill his evil intention, and frustrate God&rsquo;s plan. Before Adam was able to contact the tree of life, Satan tempted him to contact the tree of knowledge and receive the life of Satan, thus fulfilling Satan&rsquo;s evil intention.</p>
<p>By usurping and corrupting the man whom God had created for His plan, Satan frustrated God&rsquo;s plan. Usurping and corrupting Adam was the best way for Satan to enter into man, gain man, and have an illicit union with man. Satan tempted Adam to contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil so that he might enter into man, gain man, and have an illicit union with man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S FALL</h2>
<p>Man fell because he could not resist the temptation of the evil one. Although God commanded man to guard the garden, he failed and allowed God&rsquo;s enemy to sneak in. Although God had warned man, he fell because he accepted the suggestion of the father of lies and was deceived (John 8:44). Man&rsquo;s fall involved several steps.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
