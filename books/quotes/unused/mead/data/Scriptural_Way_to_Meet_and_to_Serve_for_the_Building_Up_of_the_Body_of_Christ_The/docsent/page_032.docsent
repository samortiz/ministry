   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TO HAVE THE TRIUNE GOD EMBODIED IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s New Testament economy is first to have the Triune God embodied in Christ Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit, the divine Three, are embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is not only divine but also human.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because He is human, He has a human body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His being the embodiment of the Triune God indicates that He had a solid, physical, touchable body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before God became incarnate, He was invisible, untouchable, and even unapproachable.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But this God was embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was made solid, physical, touchable, and visible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John 1:18 tells us that no one has ever seen God, but the only begotten Son has declared Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, Colossians 2:9 says that Christ is the embodiment, not only of the Godhead but also of the fullness of the entire Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Fullness in the usage of the New Testament means the expression of the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ was not only the embodiment of the riches of the Godhead but also the fullness of the Godhead, implying all the riches of the Godhead expressed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Godhead was made visible, touchable, and physical by God putting Himself into a human body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whatever the Triune God is was put into a human body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Triune God put Himself into a human Person who had a physical body, and this Person was Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This Man, Jesus Christ, had a body exactly the same as our body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since Christ became incarnate, clothed with a human body, the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in a bodily way, and in His glorified body Phil 3:21 now and forever it dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, the Triune God embodied Himself in Christ, and this embodiment was the first step for the completion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For the Incarnation of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In eternity past, Christ was anointed and appointed by God to be the Christ, the commissioned One, the anointed One, the appointed One Heb 1:9; Dan 9:26; 1 Pet 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although He was appointed, He still needed to be completed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although Christ was eternally perfect, He was not complete because he was still short of the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By what way was Christ completed?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Firstly, by incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first item in God s New Testament economy was to have the Triune God embodied in Christ for the incarnation of Christ John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For Christ to be God s commissioned One to carry out God s eternal purpose, He needed to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The divine Person alone, God Himself alone, could not accomplish or carry out His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In His eternal plan, His eternal economy, one item was needed: human blood was needed to redeem fallen humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To redeem the fallen human race, there was the need of human blood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Neither the angels nor God in his divinity alone has blood.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Blood is in the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Old Testament, before the incarnation of Christ, the blood of the animal sacrifices was used and that blood was a type of the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The blood of these sacrifices could not wash away man s sins, but this Man, Jesus Christ, died on the cross and shed His blood for us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His blood is surely human blood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet in Acts 20:28 this blood is called the blood of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How could God have blood?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God could have blood because He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This Man s blood is reckoned as God s blood, and it is also referred to in 1 John 1:7 as the blood of God s Son.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although the Son of God is divine, He has blood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The blood of Jesus, the Son of God, cleanses us from all sin, but the divine Son of God without humanity could not possess blood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, the One who accomplished God s commission needed to have the human nature so He could shed His blood for fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before His incarnation, Christ did not have humanity, so Christ had been anointed but not completed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The incarnation of Christ is the first step in the completion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His incarnation brought the Triune God into a human body to produce a God-man.</S>
