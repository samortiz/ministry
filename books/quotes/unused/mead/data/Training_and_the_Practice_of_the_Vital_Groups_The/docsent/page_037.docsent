   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I have said that you have to get a companion.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But you should not go to get a companion before going to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You must have a start by going to the Lord until He enlightens you, until He shines on you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then you will fully realize where you are and what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Spontaneously, you will begin to repent by saying, "Lord, I am dead."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>While you are saying you are dead, the Lord will say, "You are dead because you are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You are dead because you are dirty and filthy."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord will shine on you and show you that you are like a person buried under the earth with layer upon layer of dirt.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have to get out of that by making a thorough and detailed confession to the Lord so that you can be forgiven, washed, and released to emerge from the depths of your fall.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This thorough repentance and thorough confession will bring you into an intimate fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You must start the vital groups in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you have started from here, you then need to get a companion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before going to get a companion, you need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not do this hastily.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you do this hastily, you will not gain someone who is a real companion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You have to pray, "Lord, give me someone as a companion or send someone to me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lord, You lead me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Bring me into contact with the one whom You choose."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everything in the God-ordained way is always by prayer, not by our initiation or by our activity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not think you can get a companion within a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You need to spend more time to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not believe that just by one contact you can get a companion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything that is living, that has life, always takes time to produce.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For a child to be born requires nine months from his conception.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you sow a seed into the earth, it does not grow up the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Anything produced overnight is artificial.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you sow a seed, you have to wait awhile for something to spring up out of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have a real concern that we have not yet started the vital groups from the root.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The vital groups have not started yet because no one would start from the root by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A husband's wife cannot help him in this matter, nor can the husband help his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not look for anyone to help you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The only one who can help you is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You must go to Him directly by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I want to see that each of you is fully enlightened by God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You need to go to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even if you have not been enlightened by Him, you still have to go to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is the real source for you to start.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you go to Him again and again, He will shine upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He will enlighten you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He will bring you into the light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He will expose you to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then you will repent to the uttermost and even weep before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You will tell the Lord, "Lord, I am so dirty and sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am rotten and corrupted."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Spontaneously, you will make a thorough confession to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You may confess to such an extent that you would forget to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>While you are driving to your office, you may still be repenting to the Lord with tears.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I wonder how many of us have passed through this stage.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you have not passed through this stage, the vital group has not started yet.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The God-ordained way is not a matter of hearing some teaching, going to get another brother, and then making a decision to go out to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is an outward work, not the carrying out of the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We did things like this in the past to gain people, but where are these people today?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Most of them were not remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To have the vital groups you must be like a person sowing the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You have to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You have to be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You have to be touched by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You have to be exposed in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You have to make a confession to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You have to have yourself fully saturated by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then you will have a very close relationship with Him and an intimate fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the start of the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then you spontaneously will pray, "Lord, I need a companion.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Prepare a companion for me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I don't like to select one.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I don't want to exercise my choice, my preference, anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You lead me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You bring me someone or send me to someone."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I am very sorry today when I see your present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It seems that you have been moved, but you do not move.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is because you have not gone to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you do not go to the Lord and have a thorough repentance and confession in His presence, you are deceiving yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Repenting and confessing must be done by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Having an intimate fellowship with the Lord must be done by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Without these three things, you will remain the same until you see the Lord at His judgment seat 2 Cor 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should not read the Lord's Word in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Instead, we should tremble at His word Isa 66:5a .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Ephesians 5:14 says that the sleepers should awake and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We need to consider ourselves in the light of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Are we sleeping?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You may still be sleeping, and yet claim to practice the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>That is not the practice of the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>That is a new routine.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>According to the speaking Spirit within me, I feel that we have not yet had a real start in the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>You must go to Him to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Please take my word and bring this word back to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You can pray, "Lord, I have heard that we haven't started the vital groups yet.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Lord, I come to You.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Tell me how to start a vital group."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Right away the light will be there, because God is light.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>To go to the Lord is the first principle in carrying out the vital groups.</S>
