   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TESTIMONIES OF PRAY-READING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many believers throughout the centuries had the practice of praying with the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although they did not use the term pray-reading, they nonetheless had the fact in their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One of those who practiced praying the words of the Bible was George Whitefield, a contemporary of John Wesley.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>George Whitefield s practice was to pray the New Testament in Greek while on his knees.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This was the secret of his power and spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>George Whitefield pray-read the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To pray the Word is to use our spirit to strike the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have been reading and studying the Bible for more than fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I was a young man, I loved the Word of God and was ambitious to know it thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, I only knew to read the Bible with my eyes and my mind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then someone encouraged me not only to read the Word, but also to meditate on it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I began to spend time to ponder the Word, to consider it, to dwell on it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was somewhat helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I was also helped by reading George Mueller s autobiography.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to Mueller, we should not only read the Bible and meditate on it, but also pray over it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In his autobiography Mueller does not say that we should pray the Word; however, he does say that after reading a certain portion we should pray.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, if we read a verse concerning love, we should then pray regarding love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Likewise, we should pray concerning repentance when reading about repentance in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This practice of praying immediately after reading a verse is similar to pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>George Mueller s autobiography was very helpful, and I began to read the Bible and pray according to his practice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Often I actually prayed with the pure word of the Bible, making a certain verse my prayer to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In effect, I was pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although I had adopted the practice of praying while reading the Word, I did not yet know how to exercise the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From brother Watchman Nee I received help in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brother Nee emphasized the necessity of exercising the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He said that when we speak to others, especially in giving a message, we need to send forth our spirit by exercising it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He pointed out that if we use a certain part of our being while speaking to others, we shall touch the same part in them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, if we use our mind, we shall touch the mind of others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we speak from our emotion, we shall touch others in their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we would touch others spirit, Brother Nee told us, we must use our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit Being Dormant</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because man is fallen, his spirit is dormant, whereas the mind and the emotion of the soul are extremely active.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With men the mind is active; with women, it is the emotion which is active.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The most idle and dormant part of the being of fallen man is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even after we have been saved and regenerated, our spirit may remain idle and dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When certain sisters pray, they may pray by the emotion instead of by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As they pray to the Lord about their problems, they may weep.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If they exercise their spirit instead of the emotion, they will pray in a very different manner about their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead of crying, they may say, Lord, I thank You and praise You for all my troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I thank You, Lord, for my circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although we may be very strong in our mind, emotion, or will, our spirit may be weak, idle, and dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our mind, emotion, or will may react immediately to things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our spirit, however, may be very slow to respond.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our spirit may even be dormant when we come to the Bible, whereas other parts of our being, especially the mind, may be extremely active.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In reading the Bible, we may have very little exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Experiencing the Fire in the Word</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we fail to exercise our spirit in reading the Word, we fail to strike the match in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As a result, the phosphorus, the Spirit embodied in the Word, does not ignite.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we want to experience the phosphorus embodied in the match, the Spirit embodied in the Word, we need to exercise our spirit to pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then we shall strike the match in the right place and experience the fire in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can testify that by taking the Word in the proper way, exercising our spirit, we experience the burning in our spirit.</S>
