   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE COMPOUNDING OF THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gen 1:2b; Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>3:10a; Psa 51:11; Isa 63:10-11; Luke 1:15, 31-35; Matt 1:18, 20; John 7:39; Rom 8:2, 9; Acts 16:7b; Phil 1:19b; 2 Cor 3:17b, 18b; Exo 30:23-30; 1 John 2:20, 27</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we want to see the compounding of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I hope that this truth can be transfused into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Christian life is altogether a matter of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"No Spirit, no Christian life."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John 4:24 says that God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do not know the Spirit, we are through with God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As long as we are through with God, we are through with the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The revelation of the Spirit in the Bible is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>My burden is not to teach theology or biblical doctrines, but to minister the healthy teaching concerning the real Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The real Christian life is altogether a matter of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the first half of this century, there were two prominent and strong inner life teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They were Jessie Penn-Lewis and T. Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I would say that they are the ones who ended the inner life movement.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The inner life movement began with Madame Guyon, Father Fenelon, and others in the seventeenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are known as mystics, and their teaching as mysticism.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Madame Guyon and Father Fenelon never left the Catholic Church, but they were very strong in the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With them, however, the inner life was too mysterious and became a difficult thing for people to enter into and apprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the eighteenth century, William Law, a British scholar, improved the writings of the mystics, and this became a help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Later, Andrew Murray, a Dutch Reformed minister in South Africa, improved William Law's writing further.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Andrew Murray was a speaker in the Keswick convention.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His writing was very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His longest book is his exposition of the book of Hebrews entitled The Holiest of All.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His masterpiece is a book entitled The Spirit of Christ.</S>
