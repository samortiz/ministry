<P>Having seen this, we will realize the preciousness of the name of the Lord Jesus as the Son of God. He uses this name in order to show the saints in the apostate Thyatira the rich grace He has reserved for them. All those who follow the teaching of Jezebel receive but death and bondage. Those who follow the Son of God receive life and freedom. Although this title serves as a warning to the apostate church, it serves equally as a reminder of the Lord's power to His faithful children.</P><P>However, we have to know that although the Lord Jesus reveals Himself as the Son of God here, His intention was not to reveal Himself as the Son of God who gives life and freedom, but the Son of God who executes judgment. The present situation is very different from that in the ancient times. Other than judgment, there is no other way now. The church is too deep in degradation already; the only thing left for it is judgment. His eyes search all things, and His feet trample all things. Both of these speak of the judgment of the Son of God. How dignified He is in revealing Himself in this way!</P><P>As the Son of God He has the authority to rule over His own house. This is what Hebrews 3:6 reveals to us. He is ruling over His whole house in the status of the Son. Hence, although it mentions Him here as the Son of God, it also mentions His eyes being like a flame of fire, for He is the one who searches all things and discerns all things. As such He can freely execute His authority. His feet are like the shining bronze, which also signifies His authority. Bronze is a symbol of judgment. Hence, this signifies His firm attitude toward sin and His dealing with sin according to God's righteousness. If we consider the bronze altar in the Old Testament and the bronze serpent in the wilderness, we will know the meaning of bronze. It means God's requirement of man's responsibility before Him according to His righteousness. Among the Israelites, all those who wanted to be saved and draw nigh to God had to satisfy God's righteous requirement through the offerings.</P><P>Hence, the nature of Christ as mentioned here demands our utmost, solemn attention. This does not mean that He is now annulling His former relationship with the church in grace. Neither does it mean that His love has diminished at all towards His people. The emphasis here is His manifestation of Himself in dealing with the condition of a church in apostasy. The church should be His light and testimony in the world. In dealing with it, He is questioning whether it is in fact a light and a testimony for Him. Since the church has forsaken His authority, it has on the one hand lost its light and its testimony, and on the other hand become proud and arrogant and has forgotten that its position is but that of a slave. It has instead assumed itself to be the master. It is for this reason that the Lord told them that He is the Son of God and has the full authority to rule over His own house. All their conduct will be judged by Him. The Lord wants them to remember His all-searching and all-judging power and that He will not easily overlook sin. As long as the church is responsible for the testimony of the Lord on earth, such a nature of the Lord remains. No matter how much it has failed and lost its testimony, its responsibility before God does not change. This is true not only with the whole church but is also true with certain individuals. If we forget this fact, we will incur judgment from the Lord.</P><P>In considering the way the Lord addressed Thyatira, we realize that it has failed. The few churches that we have seen are all degrading. Thyatira is no exception. We can say that Thyatira is the most degraded of them all. When the church leaves its first love, becomes Judaistic, and receives honor in the world, it is unavoidable that it will lose its heavenly, holy, and separating characteristics. The world was never so victorious as it is now. With the erecting of a cross and the mere performance of baptism, the whole Roman population becomes the children of God! Nominally, surely Christianity has fully prevailed. Actually, this is only a cover-up of heathen teachings with Christian terminologies. We can imagine how great a loss the church suffers and how much shame the Lord bears when the church embraces the world's pitying love and turns its hope of the coming glory in the midst of earthly suffering into present greatness! Yet all the while they are boasting that they have now received the power and are able to Christianize the world. How pitiful this is! However, this was only the situation in Pergamos. By Thyatira, the darkness had deepened. This is the inevitable consequence when the heart has turned to the temporary enjoyment of sin. How can there not be a degradation when the emperor adorns himself with the cross, turning the cross of suffering into a cross of silver and gold, and when God's children receive special privileges from the government, having no more need to roam about in camel or goat skins or to hide in caves, but are instead admired by their adversaries for their positions? When Balaam's teaching prevails, spontaneously man will sacrifice the truth for the sake of wealth. By then, naturally Jezebel will have the opportunity to be the lord of all things and will be able to kill and persecute those who truly belong to God. Such a blood-shedding and idol-worshipping prophetess has indeed become the queen of the world in this dark age. Such a beginning surely will lead to such an ending. This age is known in history as the Dark Ages. According to the Lord's view, it was indeed dark!</P><P>Although the Lord's eyes were severe as a flame of fire, He is still the Son of Man, full of boundless mercy and lovingkindness. How wonderful it is that we can communicate with such a Lord. What joy it is that we can stand before Him. Although we are now in the midst of Thyatira and in a condition of corruption and sin, we see the Lord doing His best to enumerate the merits of His people. He loves mercy and not judgment. He tries His best to praise the least bit of goodness. Although it is such a corrupt church there, the Lord sees many things worthy of praise. Although the general condition tends to become darker all the time, the genuine believers become more zealous all the time.</P>
