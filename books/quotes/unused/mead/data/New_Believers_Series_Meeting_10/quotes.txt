[1]  MEETING Scripture Reading: Heb 10:25; Matt 18:20; Acts 2:42; 1 Cor 14:23, 26 I. CORPORATE GRACE BEING FOUND IN THE MEETING
[2]  If we do not meet with others, the most we can have is individual grace; we will miss a great part of the corporate grace.
[3]  After we have believed in the Lord there is a basic need we must take care of, that is, to come together with other children of God.
[4]  Chapter twelve speaks of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and chapter fourteen also speaks of the gifts of the Holy Spirit.
[5]  When we put chapters twelve and fourteen together, we see clearly that chapter twelve shows us the Body while chapter fourteen shows us the Body in function.
[6]  We do not go to a meeting to visit certain brothers or sisters, nor do we go because we are attracted by certain brothers or sisters.
[7]  Whenever we meet and whenever we fellowship with one another mutually, we should remember that, as believers, we are one in Christ.
[8]  First Corinthians 12:13 says, "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit."
[9]  There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus."
[10]  There cannot be Jew or Greek, slave or free man, male or female, because we have all become one in Christ.
[11]  Colossians 3:10-11 says, "And have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all."
[12]  In the Body of Christ, in Christ, and in the new man, there cannot be Jew or Greek.
[13]  If you bring the idea of kinship and regional flavor into the church, you do not know what the church of Christ is.
[14]  Once you become a Christian, you must leave your past temperament behind.
[15]  Once we are in the church, we should not have any distinction outside of Christ.
[16]  If we do this, there will be no division in the meeting of the church of God and in the fellowship between the saints.
