ACCORDING TO THE OPINION OF THE MIND</h2>
<p>About ten years ago in Taiwan a very spiritual brother with a high spiritual ministry came among us. We respected him very much, and we honored his ministry. Because we received much help from him, we arranged a meeting with him and about one hundred young co-workers, most of whom were under my training. While we were fellowshipping, he suddenly said, &ldquo;I am disappointed with the way you have your Lord&rsquo;s table.&rdquo; In his opinion we should have had one person to preside over the meeting. He said, &ldquo;You are too loose. Everyone behaves according to his or her feeling.&rdquo; I was surprised and dismayed by this speaking. I had invited him there to help the work. If he had seen something that was not fitting, the best and most proper way to deal with it would have been to speak privately about it.</p>
<p>Later I was invited to his place of meeting, and I stayed there for four weeks, attending the Lord&rsquo;s table meetings. He stood up to begin the meeting, and he announced the hymn, offered a prayer, read the Bible, and spoke a word. Then he offered a blessing for the bread, called for the deacons, and passed one plate to each of them. After the deacons took the plates to the attendants, everyone held the bread in their hand and waited. Finally he himself picked up a piece of the bread and said, &ldquo;Now let us eat.&rdquo; Then he offered another blessing for the cup in the same way, passed the trays of cups to the deacons, and again everyone waited until he took a cup and said, &ldquo;Now let us drink.&rdquo; After he offered another prayer, a time of &ldquo;public worship&rdquo; began in which certain others prayed. After about ten minutes he announced, &ldquo;Now the public worship is over.&rdquo; When this brother was among us, he told us that he was disappointed with our table meeting. If I would have spoken in the same way, I too would have said that I was very disappointed with his meeting. Nevertheless, we all practice the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting in a certain way. In Taiwan the churches practice one way, and in other places others practice in a different way. We cannot say absolutely which is the right way.</p>
<p>We may also use baptism to illustrate the problem of oneness. We all practice baptism, but some baptize by immersion, some by sprinkling, and some even baptize by waving a flag over people. A brother from Manila once asked me what words we speak when we baptize people. He told me that one group insists on saying, &ldquo;I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,&rdquo; but another group insists on saying, &ldquo;I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; These two groups contended with each other over this issue. This illustrates that simply in this one matter alone there are many opinions. Some brothers among us baptize without saying much; they only say, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; In other places the brothers baptize in the name of the Lord, in the name of Christ, or in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Some brothers like to speak more, so they say, &ldquo;Brother, I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I baptize you in the name of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; All of these ways are good.</p>
<p>In addition to contending over the name into which we baptize, others consider what kind of water to use. Some insist on baptizing in the sea, and others in the river, yet others baptize in a swimming pool. Moreover, some argue about how many times to immerse people. Some immerse once, but others immerse three times, once each for the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>One brother strongly told me that we should not baptize in water at all. He said that water baptism is dispensationally over and that today we need only the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Shortly afterward in another place, a sister stood up in the middle of my message and said, &ldquo;Tell me, do you baptize people with water? Without water baptism no one can be saved.&rdquo; One says that water baptism is dispensationally over, but another says that without it no one can be saved. The issues affecting the oneness among the Lord&rsquo;s children seem endless.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT ADJUSTING A CHURCH IN ANOTHER LOCALITY BUT GOING ALONG WITH THE CHURCH<br />
AND MINISTERING THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>We need to learn the lessons from history. According to history, all the denominations arose because someone began to stress a particular teaching or practice. This is the reason why in almost every city today there are many different denominations. The practice of different churches, what is emphasized in them, and their outstanding features may even be according to the natural disposition of the leading ones there. If a local church has been raised up under a certain kind of practice, we should be wise and not speak differently against its practice. Some may ask, &ldquo;What then shall I do? It seems that I can do nothing there.&rdquo; This is not the case. There are many things we can do. We can go along with the church to preach the gospel and bring people to the Lord. We can help the saints to know the Lord more in life and in the spirit without referring to particular practices or bringing in our own practice. Then we also can pray and wait. At a certain time the Lord may open the way to speak about a certain practice. Still, we should not stress it, and we should always be watchful as to whether or not our speaking will cause trouble. If our speaking causes trouble, we must stay silent. Otherwise, we can try to minister something in a positive way.</p>
<p>In my ministry I often tell people that man is a trichotomy, a person of three parts. However, in a local church that meets on the proper ground, the brothers and sisters may have been raised up under a ministry that teaches dichotomy. If I go to such a church, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace I will not speak a word about trichotomy. I will simply go along with the church in a positive way. I will simply say, &ldquo;Brothers, we need to love the Lord. We have been regenerated in our spirit, so now we have to contact the Lord by exercising our spirit.&rdquo; Some may come to me and ask, &ldquo;What about the difference between the spirit and soul?&rdquo; However, due to the atmosphere in that church I would say only, &ldquo;Brothers, forget about this. As long as we love the Lord and honor Him, everything is all right.&rdquo; I can still do many things to help the church there. If I have the measure and the stature, I can minister the riches of Christ to the saints without mentioning trichotomy and, even the more, without opposing dichotomy.</p>
<p>As long as the saints in a certain place are one in the Lord&rsquo;s life and in the church as His expression, they are the church on the proper ground. We must recognize this fact, and we must respect their situation. If we go to them openly or even privately to tell them that dichotomy is incorrect and to show them trichotomy in 1 Thessalonians 5:23, we are wrong. We may be right doctrinally, but we are wrong practically, and we will damage the church. We must not do this.</p>
<p>I have been in the United States for more than three years, and I have visited many places. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I did not correct, adjust, make proposals, or speak differently from them. Even when some have asked me to speak about a certain matter, I simply ministered something of Christ positively to help the church to go on. This does not mean that I agree with all the practices in every place. If a certain church were under my hand, its practice might be completely different. If the &ldquo;car&rdquo; were in my hand, I would drive it in a different way. However, it is not my car, so I should not be a backseat driver.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_052.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_054.html">Next</a> </body></html>
