   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PERFECTING BEING BUILDING AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NOT MERELY EDIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To edify means to make something better, that is, to improve it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Edification also implies that something is made useful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Building, however, does not mean only to make something better and useful but also to build something as part of a house.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose we have some wood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should work on it not only to make it smooth; we should also use it as a beam or a pillar in a house.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It should be built as part of a house.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the meaning of perfecting in Ephesians 4:12.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We stopped using the term edification meeting and started saying building meeting, because we are not merely edifying the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A person who makes wood or stone sculptures is doing a work of edification.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After carving, edifying, the wood or stone, it is put on display for people to admire.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This kind of work is incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most of the work in Christianity of preaching the gospel and holding revivals and Bible studies merely edifies the believers to improve them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This work does not contain much perfecting or building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a result, many Christians receive spiritual edification and are beautiful, but they are not built up.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can cut a precious stone and make it beautiful for people to appreciate, but this does not mean that the stone has been built into a building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some believers are qualified to be admired by the church or by Christianity, but they cannot coordinate with others to become the dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They cannot be built.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are individual Christians who are good and beautiful, but they cannot be built up with other believers to function and serve in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is a big difference between edification and building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not want merely spiritual brothers and sisters who are individuals in the district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, we want every meeting to have brothers and sisters who are perfected to exercise their function and are built up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We still need to learn in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not understand this to be something organizational and think that we need to learn to arrange and organize the district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is vain to organize the district meetings, because organizing is not building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The work that we are speaking of should be done in every locality and in every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have learned something from the Lord, and we know how to work, but while we are working, we need to perfect others so that they are built up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then every saint can be responsible and manifest his function.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He can also coordinate with other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the way that the church will be able to develop and expand and will be able to meet the many aspects of the Lord s need locally.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If there is a need to preach the gospel, a local church that is built up can preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church will also be able to support, shepherd, and care for new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There will be a genuine expression of the Body in that locality such that the saints who desire to learn to serve will be in the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This church is the house of God, where God s people belong and have a home.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These are the obvious functions of a church that is built up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There are also still deeper functions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the functions result from a group of brothers and sisters who are perfected and built up in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we should not despise perfecting and building up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>COORDINATION AND BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>BRINGING IN GOD S BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are no spiritual giants among us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every one of us is a nobody.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we compare what we have with what is in Christianity outwardly, we will see that we have very little, and our condition is far from satisfactory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We truly feel that we are short in many matters; we are inadequate in many matters.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, God can bless us only in a limited way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Nevertheless, the blessing that we receive is more than what other Christian groups receive.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Take the church in Taipei for example.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even though the district meetings are weak, the church was able to establish twenty-nine meetings where numerous brothers and sisters meet and serve together regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We once notified the saints that we would hold a conference the next day, and more than two thousand saints attended the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In contrast, many Christian organizations may use advertisements but still have only two or three hundred people in a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What is the source of our blessing?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are blessed, not because we have spiritual giants or famous preachers but because we have the elements of coordination and building.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we remove the elements of coordination and building, our situation will be more desolate than the situation in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are being blessed because we pay attention to coordination and building.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The little amount of coordination and building among us causes God to bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Coordination and building uphold God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This fellowship is to strengthen our impression of building.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The workers may consider that it is sufficient to have the tree of life, but this is not enough.</S>
