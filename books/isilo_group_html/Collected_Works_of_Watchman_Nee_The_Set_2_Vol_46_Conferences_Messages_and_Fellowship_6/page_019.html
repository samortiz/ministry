The eternal purpose was to be secured through man, but it was also to be secured for man. Man was to undo the enemy's work, and he was also to reap the benefit of that undoing. This is like sending a person for something, and then telling him that the thing for which he was sent also belongs to him. God's eternal purpose concerned Christ Jesus, but it also concerned man. This is the reason we were chosen by God before the foundation of the world. Many theologians miss this point. They try to relate predestination with redemption. Actually predestination is related to God's purpose. In God's original purpose He did not elect all mankind to be the Body of Christ. He elected some to have the characteristics of His Son, while He predestinated others to be His very sons in His Son.</p><p>In eternity past God foreordained His Son to be Head of all angelic beings (Eph. 1:20-21) and also to be Head of the church, that is, the Head of man. It was understood by the Son that He should take on a human form and become a real man with a physical body. This individual Man, Christ Jesus, was to become the Head of the corporate man. He in Himself is the personal Christ; He plus the church is the corporate Christ.</p><p>Man was created innocent. He was perfect but not per- fected. God intended him to be in union with His Son, having the life of His Son. Man was placed in the garden of Eden, in which were two trees: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Since man had a free will, he could choose according to his will. The tree of life is God Himself, who is the source of all life. The fruit of the tree of life is the tree of life in edible form, which is our Lord. In John 6:54 the Lord said, "He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life." Eating of the fruit of the tree of life would result in union with Christ in eternal life, whereas taking of the other tree would result in having independent judgment. Adam knew there was only One in the universe who could discern between good and evil. He knew that unless he ate of the forbidden tree, he would have to refer to God's judgment in all questions; he would have to rely on God in everything. If you saw a man with no knowledge of good and evil, you would say he was an undeveloped man, and Adam was undeveloped, even though he was perfect. By taking the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he developed his manhood, developed himself independently of God; he became a full-grown man. We hear preaching such as this: "You have sinned; therefore, you need the life of God in order to be saved." Quite apart from sin we need the life of God. Adam, even before the fall, needed the fruit of the tree of life. Apart from committing any specific sin, as long as man develops through his own natural resources, he needs salvation. If man only perfects himself as man, he cannot still dwell with God, because he does not have the life of God. Just being a man is the same as being lost to God. It is not necessary to sin in order to need the life of God. If you miss the tree of life, you can have no inward union with God. "He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life" (1 John 5:12).</p><p>God's purpose was that man should destroy the rebellious will by linking his will with the divine will, and man needed the life of God to fulfill the purpose of God. Alas, instead of linking his will with God's, man became Satan's ally so that both created wills were united against the uncreated will. How could God deal with such a situation? Man had failed God, but God's purpose could not be frustrated. He made another Man, the Man Christ Jesus. First, He is a typical man, a real man in every sense, yet with God's life as the mainspring, just as Adam would have been had he eaten the tree of life. He came not as the Son of God but as the Son of Man, as God's model man. Second, He fully answered to God's will for man. God's purpose was that man should be both an instrument and a vessel for His eternal purpose. Christ was both. On the earth there was one will and only one, which was perfectly linked with the will in heaven.</p><p>The more we appreciate the situation God sought to meet through Christ, the more we can appreciate what He has done. First, there was a rebellious will to be cast down. Second, there was the matter of sin to be dealt with. Third, there was life to be given. In the death of Christ all these things were accomplished.</p><p>Christ's propitiation was remedial, but His death was not just for propitiation. It was necessary, apart from redemption, for the fulfillment of God's original purpose. His death was necessary that He might become the fruit of the tree of life. He had to release His life through death (John 12:24). John 12 does not speak of propitiation, nor is it spoken of in Luke 12:49-50. Both speak of death and resurrection, not of atonement. Luke 12:50 says that He was "pressed," and He longed for His life to be released through baptism, which is death and resurrection. Ephesians 5:25 says, "Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her." Those in view here are not "sinners" as such, but the church. In this verse there is no mention of the shedding of blood. It is entirely a matter of flesh and bone, not of blood (v. 30). In verse 31 we see that the illustration is taken from the garden of Eden and is used in connection with Christ and the church (v. 32).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 46: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (6) &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
