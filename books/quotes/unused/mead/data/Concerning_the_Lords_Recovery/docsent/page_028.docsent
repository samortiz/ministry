   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That is ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you keep the commandment of the law to be moral and good, that is ethics.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I know that I came from China, but my teaching is not Chinese, nor is it something of man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>My teaching is just a quotation of the Holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you honor His Word, you surely would appreciate this kind of teaching.</S>
