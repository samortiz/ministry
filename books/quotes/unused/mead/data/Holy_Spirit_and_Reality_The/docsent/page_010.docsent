   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>It is a pity that many Christians are still living in outward appearances!</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There seems to be a supply only when they work, but this supply stops once their work stops.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When they open their mouths, they appear to be the best servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But when they do not open their mouths, they are no longer the best servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When others understand them, they can render others the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when they are misunderstood, they cannot render the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They have not touched the spiritual reality before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the reason that they cannot render the supply of life to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One brother may be in the company of others, and he may only open his mouth for five minutes in three hours, yet others receive his supply.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Body of Christ is a fact; one does not receive the supply only when there is the shaking of hands or face-to-face conversations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a man experiences something before the Lord, and when he receives the "death of Jesus" from God's hand, he has supplied the Body of Christ already.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, brothers and sisters, we supply the church with our inward knowledge of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not have to consciously do something to supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not have to intentionally do something to supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We supply others spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who have not touched reality cannot supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only those who have touched reality will supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no way to fabricate anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Paul's experience, the supply to the Body of Christ is a reality; it is not an act.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we have passed through something in a real way before the Lord, and if there is the real thing in us, we will supply the church spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As long as we have the real experience, the church will spontaneously receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul's word was quite peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It would be easy to understand him if he had said that the death of Jesus operated in him and the life of Jesus also operated in him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But he said that the death of Jesus operated in him, and that as a result, the life of Jesus operated in others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It would be difficult for anyone who does not know the Body of Christ to understand this word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since the Body is one, what operates in me spontaneously operates in others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is life, and this is supply.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we see this, we will rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everything that the members receive from the Head is found in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are all enjoying the same Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brothers and sisters, if we touch this reality, we will not feel that the church is poor or in desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of course, we admit that outwardly speaking, the church does manifest a condition of poverty and desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We admit that, outwardly speaking, individual Christians have failed and individual Christian groups have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But whenever we touch the reality of the church, we will say that the church is not poor and not in desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The riches of the church are not diminished through the failure of individual Christians and individual groups.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Day by day, everything that the members receive from the Head is supplied to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul touched the spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As a consequence, he could rebuke the church in Corinth on the one hand, and supply it on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ephesians 4:13 says, "Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is difficult to understand this according to our mind or according to outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Outwardly speaking, it seems as if the oneness of the faith is far away.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is difficult to say when the church will arrive at this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But when we touch the spiritual reality, we will feel that these questions no longer exist.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We will know that the church is one in the eyes of God and that it has never been divided.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once we touch reality, all outward problems will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we have not seen the reality, we will not have the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once we see the reality, the supply to others will begin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, supply is based on the experience of the cross, and it is also based on one's contact with the reality of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to realize that the supply of the word is also based on what we have already imparted to the church in life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Brothers and sisters, if what we speak is what we have already given to the church, the Holy Spirit will testify to our words.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But if what we speak is not something that we have before the Lord, the Holy Spirit will not testify to the words.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we have imparted a certain matter to the church in life and then speak about that certain matter, others will receive the help from our words.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But if our words merely provide others with clearer thoughts and more knowledge, we will only have fruits of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The food of the church is life; only the supply of life can be food to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The question is not what we can give to others, but what we have already given to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What have we contributed to the real church?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What can we say is our contribution when we stand before that church?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we have not touched reality, we will have nothing to supply to others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Spiritual things and the reality behind the words supply the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some Christians consider the Body of Christ to be an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They do not see the reality of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As a result they have no way to become a supply to others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you do not see the Body, there is no way that you can be a supply.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If it is the Body, the mouth's eating will be the Body's eating, the eyes' seeing will be the Body's seeing, and the ears' hearing will be the Body's hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One member receiving something is the Body receiving something.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>No matter which brother or sister, as long as one receives something, the whole Body receives it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have to see that the Body life is not just a matter of corporate living, but a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we do not touch the reality, the church will merely be a doctrine, the Body will merely be an illustration, and we will not receive any supply.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Brothers and sisters, we have to remember that we are members of the Body, and we are all one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are not alone.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Paul said, "And whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it" 1 Cor 12:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Was he speaking vain words, or is this a reality?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Paul was a person who had Body-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If he had not touched the reality of the Body, he could not have said such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>May God grant us to touch the source, and may He grant us to touch reality, so that we can supply the church in a spontaneous way.</S>
