   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT UPON ISRAEL 8 JEHOVAH'S FURTHER COMMISSION TO JEREMIAH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>HIS FURTHER STATEMENT OF JUDAH'S SINS 1 Scripture Reading: Jer 15:10 17:27</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we will begin to consider Jehovah's further commission to Jeremiah and His further statement of Judah's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I. JEHOVAH'S FURTHER COMMISSION TO JEREMIAH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jehovah's further commission to Jeremiah is covered in 15:10 through 16:9.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. Jeremiah's Remorse and</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jehovah's Encouragement and Strengthening</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 15:10-14 we see Jeremiah's remorse and Jehovah's encouragement and strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In these verses there are three parties: Jeremiah, his mother, and God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jeremiah was disappointed and said to his mother, "Woe is me, my mother, because you bore me, / A man of strife and a man of contention to the whole land.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>/ I have not lent with interest, / Nor have they lent to me; / Yet everyone curses me" v. 10 . Surely, no mother would be happy to hear such a word from her son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whereas Jeremiah's mother was silent, God came in to say something to him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I feel that it is very significant that as Jeremiah was speaking to his mother, God came in to speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that God was always with Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Wherever Jeremiah went, God was there with him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever Jeremiah spoke, God was present to participate in the conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God was with Jeremiah even when he, in his disappointment, was talking to his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She might have been very happy about how God spoke to her son to encourage and strengthen him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In His speaking to Jeremiah, God spoke not as the Divine Being, as the mighty One, but almost as if He were a man, talking in a very human and personal way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the record of this book, as God dealt with His people, He often spoke to them in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For instance, when He addressed Israel as His apostate wife and lovingly pleaded for her to return, He spoke in a human way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After Jeremiah told his mother that everyone was cursing him, Jehovah intervened and said to him, "Surely I will set you free for your good; / Indeed I will cause the enemy to make supplication to you / In a time of trouble and in a time of distress.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>/ Can one break iron, / Iron from the north, or bronze?/Your wealth and your treasures/I will give as plunder without price,/And that for all your sins,/And within all your borders.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>/ I will cause your enemies to bring it / Into a land which you do not know; / For a fire is kindled in My anger, / Which will burn against you" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>11-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to pay attention to the pronouns your and you in verses 13 and 14.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In verse 13 God refers to "your wealth" and "your treasures."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whose wealth and treasures are these?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They must be the wealth and treasures of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, God spoke this word not directly to Israel but to Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Surely, the word your here includes the addressee.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that God regarded Jeremiah the prophet as being one with Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Israel's wealth and treasures were also Jeremiah's wealth and treasures.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that God considered the entire nation of Israel as one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because Jeremiah was a part of this entity, when the wealth and treasures of Israel were given to their enemies, Jeremiah also became poor.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The wealth and treasures of Israel, and also of Jeremiah, would be brought to a land which they did not know.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God had kindled a fire in His anger, which would burn against them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this matter also, Jeremiah was included.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here we have not only three parties Jeremiah, his mother, and Jehovah but also a fourth party Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's word was addressed to Jeremiah, but in speaking to Jeremiah He included the children of Israel together with Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In speaking to Jeremiah and to Israel, God spoke as if He were a human being talking to other human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He spoke as one of the four parties participating in this conversation.</S>
