<h2 class="head2">The Intensification of the Triune God<br />for the Church Life</h2><p>In the first section of the New Testament, the four Gospels, we have the embodiment of the Triune God, and in the second section we have the consummation of the Triune God. What we have in the third section, in the book of Revelation, is the intensification of the Triune God. This means that the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God is intensified to become the seven Spirits.</p><p>Do we not have the seven Spirits in the book of Revelation? Yes, Revelation emphasizes the seven Spirits. Do you prefer to stay with the Spirit in the book of Acts, or do you prefer the seven Spirits in the book of Revelation? Where are you today, in Acts or in Revelation? We all should be able to testify that we are in the book of Revelation. Since we are in the book of Revelation, all the churches should realize that now is not a time of discouragement or disappointment. Rather, today is a day of intensification, a day full of hope and encouragement.</p><p>In Revelation we have the sevenfold intensification of the Triune God for the church life. Nevertheless, if we set our eyes on the condition of the churches, we shall be disappointed. But if we turn our eyes to the sevenfold intensification of the Triune God, we shall be filled with praise to the Lord.</p><p>Do you believe in the condition of the church or in the sevenfold intensification of the Triune God? The condition of the church is not our salvation. Instead, the church&rsquo;s condition may be a discouragement to us. Therefore, we should look at the sevenfold intensification of the Triune God, for this intensification is our salvation.</p><p>In the book of Revelation the sevenfold Spirit is emphasized again and again. In 1:4 we read of the seven Spirits who are before the throne of God. Then in chapters two and three the Spirit is stressed repeatedly. Seven times the following word is spoken: &ldquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches&rdquo; (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). Revelation 4:5 says, &ldquo;And seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.&rdquo; Revelation 5:6 speaks of a &ldquo;Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.&rdquo; Here we see that the Spirit is intensified to be the seven Spirits who are the seven eyes of the Lamb, the Redeemer. In Revelation 14:13 we have this word: &ldquo;Yes, says the Spirit.&rdquo; Finally, in 22:17 the Spirit and the bride are mentioned together: &ldquo;And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!&rdquo; Here we see that at the very end of the book of Revelation, the bride, which is the church, becomes one with the Spirit.</p><p>In the book of Revelation the titles &ldquo;the Spirit of God&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Holy Spirit&rdquo; are not used. Instead, we have the Spirit and the seven Spirits. We need to appreciate the seven Spirits. The sevenfold intensified Spirit is able to transform a hopeless church into a lampstand of pure gold.</p><p>Concerning the church, we should not be discouraged or disappointed. Let us be encouraged with the golden lampstand and the New Jerusalem. The Bible ends with strong encouragement. Look at the golden lampstands shining in this dark age, shining in this perverted generation. In eternity the New Jerusalem will be the consummation of the intensification of the Triune God. This surely indicates that our God cannot be defeated by Satan. Even today God is not defeated, His church is not defeated, and we are not defeated. However, if you think you are defeated, you will be defeated. Instead of thinking like this, we should say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, in Christ I am not defeated! Through the sevenfold intensified Spirit, I shall never be defeated!&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2><h2 class="head2">A Sign of the Aggregate of God&rsquo;s Chosen People</h2><p>The ultimate consummation of the intensification of the Triune God is the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is a sign of the aggregate of God&rsquo;s chosen people both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament. The New Jerusalem, therefore, is a composition of all the Old Testament saints, represented by the names of the twelve tribes of Israel (Rev. 21:12), and of all the New Testament saints, represented by the names of the twelve apostles (Rev. 21:14). Hence, the New Jerusalem is a living composition of God&rsquo;s chosen, redeemed, saved, regenerated, and transformed people. God&rsquo;s people will all be transformed into gold, pearl, and precious stones. These materials all point to the building up of God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
