   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When Christ was living on earth, He was not fully available to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When He was in Galilee, He could not be in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was limited by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He could not be present with all the people all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But after Christ was resurrected, He became a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the Spirit, He can now be with His disciples all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why after His resurrection He could say that He would be with His disciples "all the days until the consummation of the age" Matt 28:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today, our Christ is not limited by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He can dwell within all those who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is nothing more simple than breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A person may not understand many deep mysteries, but as long as he is a human being, he can breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Breathing is the most universal ability; any living creature can breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ has made Himself so available that anyone can receive Him and experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Human beings are like a rubber tire, and the Spirit is like the air.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many people live with "flat tires" in their lives; they are depressed and plod along life's journey in a bumpy way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What we need is the heavenly air the life-giving Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we have Him, our ride will be smooth, and we will be filled with the heavenly pneuma!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Spirit can also be illustrated by electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In modern civilization nearly every home has electricity installed in it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need electricity to drive the fan, the clock, the refrigerator, the telephone, the doorbell, the television, and many other appliances.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Without electricity our lives would nearly come to a standstill.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although electricity is so applicable, the source of electricity is far away from us in the hydroelectric power plant.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is like the awesome power plant up at the head of the river; He is most powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order for that mighty power to be applied to us, there is the need of power lines to convey the current of electricity to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The incarnated Christ as a man with His humanity is like the power line; He came from God the Father to us to bring God to us in our human situation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit is like the electrical current that carries the mighty hydroelectric power from the power plant into our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The electrical current applies the power and turns it into sound, light, heat, and other useful forms in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the same way the Spirit as the current of the heavenly electricity applies all that God is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through the Spirit we have love, light, truth, joy, power, and all the attributes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do not have the Spirit in us, our lives will be full of darkness, weakness, and suffocation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the Spirit applies the Triune God to us and makes our life meaningful and full.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many people think that to be a Christian is merely to improve their behavior or to be religious.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They even build large cathedrals in which to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet the most necessary thing is not to be outwardly good or religious.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is foolish for anyone to clean his lamps or adorn his television set without applying electricity to them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The only thing that matters is to apply electricity to the appliances.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What man needs is not bigger buildings or more religious ceremonies; none of these will give him the inward power.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What man needs is the Spirit, because the Spirit is the application of God Himself to man.</S>
