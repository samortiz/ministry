   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Lesson Nine THE TRIUNE GOD AS REVEALED IN THE EPISTLES 1 Scripture Reading Rom 8:9-11; 2 Cor 13:14.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Outline The Triune God in His believers Romans 8 The enjoyment of the Triune God 2 Corinthians 13:14 Text</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Epistles were letters written by apostles to various people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Fourteen were written by Paul, two by Peter, three by John, and one each by James and Jude.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The main thought of the Epistles is that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is our life and everything necessary for the building up of the church, His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The apostles experienced and enjoyed the Triune God and His full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Triune God was not a doctrine teaching to them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was their life and enjoyment in all their daily situations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What they wrote simply came out of these experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this lesson and the next we will see that what they wrote is not for the study of theology, but to show us how God in His marvelous and mysterious trinity dispenses Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This dispensing has a goal, a result: that we would express the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I. THE TRIUNE GOD IN HIS BELIEVERS ROMANS 8</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 8 tells us that the Triune God is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verses 9 through 11 say "the Spirit of God dwells in you"; "And if Christ is in you"; and "His Spirit Who indwells you."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These verses tell us that the Spirit of God, Christ, and His Spirit dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit of God is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His Spirit, of course, is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit are in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But how many would you say are in you?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You can only say, one!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When you pray, do you sense three in you?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course not.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You pray to only one God and you sense only One Person in you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In word, there are three, but in experience, there is only one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not have confusion inside of us!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have the Triune God as the Spirit dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE ENJOYMENT OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2 CORINTHIANS 13:14</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because God is essentially one, we only sense one in us; but God is economically three because He wants to get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although we have the Triune God inside of us, He is only in a small part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His desire is to fill us completely, spirit and soul and body, and He accomplishes this by His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Day after day we need to experience God's dispensing of Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why in 2 Corinthians 13:14 Paul says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the way the Triune God dispenses Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The grace of the Lord is just the Lord Himself to be enjoyed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we enjoy the Lord, we have grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The love of God is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Love is the source of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Grace is out of love and grace is love expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The fellowship of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Spirit transmits to us the grace with love, we have the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, the grace, love, and fellowship are not three separate matters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They are three aspects of one thing, just as the Lord, God, and the Spirit are not three separate Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we experience one, we experience them all.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The love of God is the source, the grace of the Lord is the course, and the fellowship of the Spirit brings the grace with the love into us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This transmission is for our experience and enjoyment of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
