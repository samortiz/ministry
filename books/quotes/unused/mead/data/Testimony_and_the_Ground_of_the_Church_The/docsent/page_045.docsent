   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Believers All Being Priests to God,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Without an Intermediary Class</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>or Distinctions between Clergy and Laity</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Third, all the believers are priests to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Old Testament, among the people of Israel there was a group who served as priests, and the rest of the Israelites were common people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time there was a so-called intermediary class among the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But in the New Testament, in the church, there is no longer such an intermediary class; rather, all the believers are priests to God, without any distinctions between the so-called clergy and laity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The normal condition is for all the people of God to be priests to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is abnormal if only a small number of the people of God serve as priests, but the majority are merely common people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible shows that originally everyone could offer to God without a need for others to serve as a priest for him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Abel offered sacrifices, did someone act as a priest for him?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Noah offered sacrifices, was there someone acting as his priest?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Abraham offered sacrifices, did someone act as his priest?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Isaac and Jacob offered sacrifices, did they have others serving as priests?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the people of Israel kept the feast of the Passover, every house offered a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Did others serve as priests for them?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>None of them had a priest!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a rule, everyone who received God s grace was a priest before Him, and they could all approach God directly and serve God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They began to have priests after they failed because of worshipping the golden calf at the foot of Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From that time onward, God separated a tribe the Levites out of the children of Israel; furthermore, even out of the Levites, He separated the house of Aaron to be the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From that time on, the children of Israel could no longer approach God directly; instead, they needed priests to handle the service of God in their place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the children of Israel wanted to offer sacrifices, they could not do it themselves; they needed to find a priest to do it for them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When they wanted to inquire of God, they could not do it themselves; instead, they needed to ask the priests to do it on their behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, among the children of Israel, there were two separate groups of people: a class of priests and a class of common people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The priestly class became the intermediary between the children of Israel and God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This situation was abnormal; it was a deviation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the New Testament age, God wants all His chosen and saved people to be His priests 1 Pet 2:5, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord bought us with His own blood to be priests to God Rev 1:5-6; 5:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the saved ones are priests to God, and as such, we can all draw near to God directly, serve God directly, and offer spiritual sacrifices to God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was the situation involving service to God in the original church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All were brothers, all were members one of another, and all were priests.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A saved person was a member and a priest, fulfilling his function and serving.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, the original church was living and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was the first characteristic of the original church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>COMPLETELY SEPARATED FROM THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>IN THE WORLD YET NOT OF THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Another marked feature of the early church was that it was completely separated from the world; it was in the world but not of the world, just as the Lord said in John 17:14-17 and 18:36.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This separation from the world was not merely a matter of not loving the things of the world; even more, it was a matter of not being mixed with the world and thereby being completely separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>COMPLETELY FORSAKING IDOLS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The original church also completely forsook idols.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whereas idols are adversaries of God, the church is the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the church has idols, the nature of the church has been changed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a certain fact.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From Acts 15:29 we can see that the original church forsook idols in a very thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>COMPLETELY ALLOWING GOD TO SPEAK</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Completely allowing God to speak was another important characteristic of the early church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the original church there was no human opinion and no human system; instead, the believers completely allowed the Spirit to speak through the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They allowed the Holy Scriptures of God to have their position, and they also allowed the Holy Spirit of God to have His position.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because at that time the New Testament books were not yet completed, they frequently read the Old Testament Acts 17:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever they faced important issues, they would make decisions according to the Old Testament 15:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the same time, the Holy Spirit was present with them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, their original condition involved their completely allowing God to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The church as the expression of Christ is the place where God expresses Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the church does not allow Christ to speak, the church is no longer the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The early church was not like this; rather, it completely allowed God to express His mind.</S>
