   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Jesus said, "The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve" Mark 10:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In other words, the Lord never asked for anything from men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should be interested in men, and we should find men lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moreover, we should not take advantage of men or be served by men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not embarrass them or hurt them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not even accept service from them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brothers and sisters, years of instruction have accustomed us to address all men as our "fellow men"; however, this is not a matter of words but a matter of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, we have a certain feeling for our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We feel that certain ones are our brothers and that we are "fellow brothers" to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But may I ask if we have the feeling with all men that we are their "fellow men"?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do we have a feeling that they are our fellows?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we do not have such a feeling, we cannot serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All servants of the Lord should have a broad heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their heart should be so broad that they can include and embrace all men.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They should be able to embrace the whole human race into their bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The biggest problem among many workers is that they lack this love for men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their love for the brothers is already short.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their love for all men is almost nonexistent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Perhaps they can pick out one from among a hundred or even from ten thousand that they can love!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If this is our condition, we do not have a love for all men.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must remember that God is our Creator and we are all fellow creatures; we are fellow human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must enlarge our heart's capacity to love every person created by God, every fellow human being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not allow them to suffer, we should not take advantage of them, and we should not seek for any service from them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brothers and sisters, we should not take advantage of others in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A Christian should realize that it is shameful for him to take advantage of his fellow men while on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is wrong to take advantage of the brothers, but it is equally wrong to take advantage of anyone at all.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As far as receiving from others is concerned, our Lord's basic attitude is that He would never allow Himself to be served by men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He did not have the slightest intention of receiving anything from anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must remember that we should never selfishly receive the services and ministration of others at the expense of their sacrifice and loss.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's children should not take advantage of others, not only because the Lord has forbidden it, but because we are fellow human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not seek for profit from our fellow men.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must realize that all men are lovable in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we have no interest in man, our work will be of very limited value in the sight of God, no matter how great it may be outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God wants to see His servants increased in their capacity and interested in all man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the only way to become a gracious person; this is the only way to serve the Lord.</S>
