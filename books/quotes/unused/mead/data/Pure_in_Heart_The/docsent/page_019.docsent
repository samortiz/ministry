   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING THE SPECIAL GRACE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN DEALING WITH SINS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In my personal Christian life, I once had an unforgettable experience related to dealing with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This experience testifies how great the grace of God is, because it was the grace of God from within which supported my entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only when I dealt with my sins did I see how immense the grace of God really is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For my whole life I will not forget this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The experience came six or seven years after my salvation, and it was the first time I truly dealt with my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time the Lord worked in me and revived me, causing me to pray all the time, to serve zealously, and to have a feeling to deal with sins thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One day the Lord enlightened me and reminded me of an incident that took place in my youth when I was working for a particular organization.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The building of this organization had caught on fire, and everyone tried his best to steal things from the company.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I also took two small things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first thing was a very pretty ink box, made of porcelain, for writing Chinese calligraphy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I put it into my pocket when I was helping to pack the things of the company.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The other item was a clothes brush, a Western product, which looked very nice.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I put the ink box in my study, and all of my friends would admire it when they saw it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition, being able to use the Western brush to brush my clothes when I was getting dressed was very convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After I was saved, I did not notice any problem right away; I had only a small feeling that these two things were of a questionable origin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then six or seven years later the Lord s grace reached me, and I realized that I had to thoroughly deal with the sin of stealing the ink box and the small brush.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I could not read the Bible while looking at the stolen ink box.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In addition, the bristles on the small brush were gone after being used for six or seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The need to deal with stealing these two items gave me two problems.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first problem was that the son of my former boss had been my classmate, and I knew him very well.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How could I go and confess to him?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I found this really hard to do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Another problem was that the bristles on the brush were already gone, so how could I return it to him?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For several days and nights I could hardly sleep because I felt that I could not go.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I struggled for one or two weeks, and the more I struggled, the harder it became.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then I asked God to give me the courage.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that time my boss had already died, so I thought I should pay for the two items instead of returning them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After I planned everything out, I went to my classmate s home one Lord s Day afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I had everything prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was at the end of the year, and he happened to be at home.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When he saw me, he said, I have not seen you for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that moment my face turned red, and I said to him, I have come to ask for your forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That year when your company caught fire, I took advantage of the situation and stole this ink box from the office.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He said, That is nothing!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This kind of small thing does not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I continued, And a small brush too!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But it has already worn out, so I want to pay you back this amount of money.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He replied, Do not worry about it!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are just small things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I asked him to understand me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Seeing how sincere I was, he really had no way to reject me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then he asked me, What do you have in your hand?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At that time the government did not allow the general public to print any calendars that included both the lunar and solar years, but there was a Catholic organization which published many calendars like this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This organization was established by Westerners, and the government did not interfere with their activities.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every year this organization would send some calendars to the company where I worked.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All the employees in the company who were of comparatively higher positions would be given one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When my boss s son asked me what I had in my hand, I told him that I had a calendar with both the lunar and solar years in it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then he said, That is good!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Give me the calendar and keep your money.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The calendar will be the replacement for the items you stole.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Of course, on the one hand, I was joyful, but on the other hand, I was sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although I had dealt with the sin, he had been unwilling to receive the money, and this troubled me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On my way home, I prayed, O Lord, what should I do with the money?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then inwardly I had an idea: I should give this money to a beggar, not to a common beggar but to a special one someone who was affected by the war going on in the suburbs.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When I got home, it was already evening.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Someone knocked at the door, and I went to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The person at the door said, Sir, please have mercy on me!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I looked at him and saw that he was a beggar.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He continued, I have not eaten anything all day.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I immediately asked him to come in and gave him Chinese buns, some water, and some small dishes of food.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After he finished eating, I gave him some more buns.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He said in an embarrassed way, You are a kind-hearted man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I told him, No, I am not kind.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Jesus has prepared some money for you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Just take it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then I saw him off, and when we reached the crossroad, he bowed to me sincerely and left.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On my way home, I met an elderly brother.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He insisted on giving me a calendar.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When I got home and looked at the calendar, I found that it contained both the lunar and solar years.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I said to the Lord, O Lord, how fearful and awesome You are!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You have prepared both a beggar and such a calendar for me.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Surely I have received special grace from You.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When we are dealing with our sins, we have the presence of the Lord, and after we have dealt with our sins, we know more of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>To deal with our sins and our conscience in such a way is not something of law but of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The more we know and experience grace, the more we will deal with our sins, and the more we receive grace, the more we will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I hope that all of us would become matured Christians, not half-cooked ones.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is something done not under the law but with the supply of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The more dealings we have, the more we are sanctified.</S>
