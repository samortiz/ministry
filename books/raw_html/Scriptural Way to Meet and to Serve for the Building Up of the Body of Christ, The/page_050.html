 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE EXERCISE OF THE REGENERATED SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 3:5-6; Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 1:7; Eph. 6:18; Acts 6:10; Rom. 8:4</h1>
<p>The exercise of our regenerated spirit is a crucial matter in our experience. God is triune to reach us, not as the Father or as the Son, but as the Spirit. In order to reach us, He has passed through many processes so that He could be ultimately consummated as the Spirit. The Spirit today is the very consummation of the Triune God; He is the consummated Triune God. It is by, through, and in this Spirit that God reaches us. To receive the Son and the Father requires that we touch the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the consummation and completion of the Son and of the Father, that is, the consummation of the Triune God. Although there may not be such terms as the completion of God or the consummation of God in today&rsquo;s Christian theology, there is such a reality according to the divine revelation. Our God has been completed, consummated, and this consummating work results in a Person, the all-inclusive Spirit. This Spirit as the very consummation of the Triune God reaches us. God is with us as the Spirit. In this Spirit is all that God is. When you have the Spirit, you have the Son and the Father. Both the Father and the Son are in the Spirit. Therefore, the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God for us to touch Him.</p>
<p>God is triune, and we are tripartite (1 Thes. 5:23). We consist of three parts: the outermost part, the body; the middle part, the soul; and the inner part, the human spirit. When demons come to possess man, they always come upon his body, but when God comes to us, He comes into our spirit. On God&rsquo;s side, the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, and on our side, our human spirit is the very center of our being. The very center, the most intrinsic part, of our being is our spirit. Initially, God does not come into our body or our soul but into our very center, our spirit, the most intrinsic part of our entire person. When the consummation of the Triune God, the Spirit, comes to touch us, He touches our most intrinsic part.</p>
<p>This truth has been neglected in Christian theology. Many real Christians do not know that they have a human spirit. When they hear the word <em>spirit,</em> they think of the Spirit of God. Some theologians do not even admit that we have a spirit. They say that what the Bible refers to as the spirit is actually the soul and the heart. Some translators of the Bible also have confused the spirit with the soul, the heart, and even the mind. Many Christians today do not pay any attention to the human spirit. However, if you do not know how to differentiate between the human spirit and the soul, you cannot have the proper spiritual experiences. To have the proper spiritual experiences requires that we realize that we have a human spirit in which the Spirit dwells.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE SPIRIT AND THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In both the Old and New Testaments, there are two spirits. One is capitalized and the other is not; the <em>Spirit</em> refers to God, and the <em>spirit</em> is our human spirit. John 3:6, John 4:24, and Romans 8:16 are three crucial verses in the New Testament which refer to the two spirits. John 3:6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; The divine Spirit regenerates our human spirit. When we believe in the Lord Jesus, the ultimate consummation of the Triune God touches, reaches, and even enters our very inner being to regenerate our human spirit with the divine life. After this, the Holy Spirit remains and even dwells in our spirit. This produces a union, or mingling. Regeneration is the coming of the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God into our human spirit to mingle Himself with our inner being. The Spirit mingles Himself with our spirit to be one spirit (Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17). This is what transpires when we call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Within our spirit we have a union of the ultimate consummation of the Triune God with our inner being. What a miracle this is!</p>
<p>The New Testament stresses the two spirits very much. John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality.&rdquo; Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.&rdquo; The Spirit regenerates our spirit, our spirit worships the Spirit, and the Spirit is now working together with our spirit. By the begetting, worshipping, and witnessing, God and man are joined, united, combined, and mingled together.</p>
<p>Not too long after I was saved, I read some books by Jessie Penn-Lewis concerning our human spirit, including one which dealt with the difference between our spirit and our soul. We received much help from her related to the human spirit. Later, Watchman Nee published <em>The Spiritual Man,</em> in which he also differentiated between our human spirit and our soul.</p>
<p>When I came to the United States, I began my ministry with the two spirits. In the summer of 1969 we had a conference in which we spoke of the seven Spirits (published in <em>The Stream</em> magazine&mdash;Vol. 7, No. 4 and Vol. 8, No. 1 and No. 2) and a training in which we spoke concerning the human spirit. These messages are contained in the book <em>Our Human Spirit</em> (chapters one through six). We have also published a small booklet entitled <em>The Key to Experiencing Christ&mdash;the Human Spirit.</em> In the summer training of 1969, we also studied how much our human spirit is related to the divine life (the messages concerning the divine life from this training are contained in the book <em>The Crucial Revelation of Life in the Scriptures</em>). Without a proper knowledge of our human spirit, we could never have the adequate experiences of Christ as our life.</p>
