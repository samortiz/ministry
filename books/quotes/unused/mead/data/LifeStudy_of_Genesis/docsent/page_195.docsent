   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I have been condemned for saying that the Lord Jesus is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although I do not like to argue or to answer, I would like to ask those dear brothers who condemn me how they interpret 2 Corinthians 3:17 which says, "And the Lord is the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not ask, "Then are the Lord and the Spirit one?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We do not have the skill nor the means to explain this adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although we cannot explain it adequately, we do have a verse in the Bible which says, "And the Lord is the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Where do you put this verse?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Will you cut it out of your Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I would also present to those brothers Isaiah 9:6 which says, "Unto us a son is given..and his name shall be called..The everlasting Father..."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Is He the Son or the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Again, although we cannot explain this adequately, we do have this verse that says that the Son shall be called the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says that the Lord is now the Spirit, and Isaiah 9:6 says that the Son is called the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the mystery of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do have the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; yet the Son is called the Father, and the Son is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They three are still one God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all know John 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is quite clear that the Word and God are distinct.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, the following clause of John 1:1 says, "and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This clause creates a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the beginning was the Word of God, the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Are they one or two?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a mystery, the mystery of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ephesians 4:6 says that the Father is in us, Colossians 1:27 says that Christ, the Son, is in us, and John 14:17 says that the Holy Spirit is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are all in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once I presented these verses to a certain person, asking him if he was clear about them and if he believed what they said.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I asked him, "Do you believe all these facts that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are in you?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When he said that he did, I asked him, "Tell me, how many are in you now?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He said, "One."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then I said, "Haven't you admitted that the Bible tells us that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit all are in you?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How can you say that only one is in you?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He could not answer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Bible does say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, all three are in us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But, according to our experience, we have only one in us, whom we call either the Spirit or the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the mystery of the Trinity of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is the only one God, yet He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Trinity of God is for Him to be dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No food can get into us without being cooked or processed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a food is not cooked, at least it must pass through the process of being masticated, swallowed, digested, and assimilated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without this process, nothing can get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Triune God is the very God who is dispensing Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Matthew 28:19 says, "Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For what purpose do we baptize people into the Father, Son, and Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For the purpose of processing them into God and for processing God into them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Triune God, the Trinity, is not a theory or a theological teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is God's dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The number three signifies God in His dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The number three denotes the dispensing God, the very God who is dispensing Himself into people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever the Bible speaks of God mingling with man, of God entering into man, or of God being dispensed into man, it always uses the matter of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Consider, for example, 2 Corinthians 13:14.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is not a doctrine of three gods; it is the Triune God in the process of dispensing, of getting Himself into us, and of bringing us into all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the significance of the number three.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What does the number five signify?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is quite easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The ten commandments were divided into two tablets each containing five commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Matthew 25, we have ten virgins divided into two groups of five.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you look at yourself, you will see that you have ten fingers and ten toes, all arranged in groups of five.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The five fingers on each of your hands are composed of four plus one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you had two thumbs and three fingers, it would be awkward for you to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But with one thumb and four fingers we can easily do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The thumb is number one, representing the one God as the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Four is the number of God's creature, like the four living creatures Rev 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thus, four plus one means man, God's creature, plus God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The thought here, as signified by the numbers three and five, is that of the mingling of the Triune God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What is God's building?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God's building is simply to build Himself into us, and us into Him, making Him one with us and making us one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>So, in the ark, the basic numbers of three and five signify that this building is the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Why was the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth fifty cubits, and the height thirty cubits?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is clear that the number three hundred is a hundred times of three, that the number fifty is ten times of five, and that the number thirty is ten times of three.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The basic numbers are three and five, and the numbers three hundred, fifty, and thirty are the multiples of these basic numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The number one hundred denotes fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord Jesus said that the best way to bear fruit is to bear it a hundredfold Matt 13:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Thus, the number one hundred in the Bible is the number of fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The number ten means completeness Dan 1:12, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you are lacking a thumb, you are incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Since ten signifies completeness and a hundred indicates fullness, the ark is the mingling of the Triune God with man in completeness and in fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you read Exodus 27, you will find that the numbers three and five are also the basic numbers of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The court of the tabernacle was a hundred cubits long on both the south side and the north side Exo 27:9, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The breadth of the court on both the west side and the east side was fifty cubits Exo 27:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The fence or curtains of the court were five cubits high Exo 27:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The hangings on either side of the gate were fifteen cubits in length Exo 27:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>These hangings were supported by three pillars on each side, giving three sections of five cubits each.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Nothing in the Bible is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The measurements of the entire court of the tabernacle are composed of the basic numbers of three and five.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Furthermore, the whole tabernacle itself was of three sections: the outer court, the holy place, and the holiest of all.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the holy place there were three items: the showbread table, the lampstand, and the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is all very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The numbers three and five are the basic numbers of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I hope that you take this word into your being and realize that whatever you share in building the church must be of three and five; it must be the Triune God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Whatever you do for the building of the church must be in the mingling of the Triune God with you and others.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This thought is deep.</S>
