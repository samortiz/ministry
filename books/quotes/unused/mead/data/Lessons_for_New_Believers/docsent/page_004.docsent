   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECONCILED TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once a person is justified, he is reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past we were God s enemies because of sin, but now by the blood we are forgiven, washed, separated unto God, in harmony with God, and justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Consequently, we are reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This reconciliation includes acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As soon as we are reconciled to God, God accepts our very person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Colossians 1:20-22 shows that we, God s enemies, have been reconciled to God by the blood the Lord Jesus shed on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 5:9-11 says that since we have been justified because of the Lord Jesus, we are also reconciled to God because of Him, or through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we no longer have any problems before God and are accepted by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since all enmity between God and us has been removed, we have been completely reconciled to God and are in harmony with Him; we are acceptable and pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>REGENERATED</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are now thoroughly cleansed outwardly and have no more problems with God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, this is not enough, because our life within is still natural and of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, we need another life; we need regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God s salvation has two aspects: inward and outward.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The outward aspect can be compared to putting on clothes, and the inward aspect, to eating.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For a person to exist, he needs to put on clothes in order to look proper and he needs to eat in order to survive.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He needs to take care of both these inward and outward aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Likewise, God s salvation also takes care of both our inward and outward needs.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Luke 15 there are two aspects to what the prodigal son obtained from the father when he returned home.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first thing the father did was outward; he gave his son a robe, a ring, and sandals to wear.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the son returned, he was like a beggar, exceedingly ragged and filthy in his appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There was no way for him to enter into the father s house in such a condition because the father s house was grand and beautiful, and his beggar-like appearance did not match the father s house.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, while he was still outside the house, the father changed his clothes and put a robe, ring, and sandals on him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He now looked proper, matching the condition of the father s house; consequently, he could enter the father s house.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This, however, is merely outward redemption, not inward salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, after he entered the father s house, the father said, Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry v. 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This parable is a type of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It shows that the Lord Jesus in His redemption has become our outward robe of righteousness in order that we may be redeemed and accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It also shows that He is like a slaughtered calf, giving us His life so that we can take Him in as our life supply, satisfying us within and making us merry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, everything that God does in the first ten items is outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He chose us, predestinated us, called us, sprinkled us with His blood, redeemed us, forgave us, washed us, sanctified us, justified us, and reconciled us to Himself, accepted us; all of these items are outward.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These items are very precious, and there is no doubt that we are saved persons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have no more problems before God, before the law, and before His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have the basis, the proof, and the assurance that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, God s salvation does not stop here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God s salvation must go one step further so that we can receive His life within, so that we can be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Regeneration means to be born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is to be begotten of God, to have God Himself enter into us as life, and to be born of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to realize that if man had not fallen, he would have only needed to receive life within him; this is the story of the garden of Eden in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There, man did not have the problem of needing clothing; he had no need of being redeemed outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was not until the fall of man in Genesis 3 that clothing became a necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As soon as man fell, he felt ashamed and sewed leaves to make an apron to cover his body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, God made a coat of lamb s skin to clothe him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The coat of skin refers to Christ being our righteousness that we may be accepted by God outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the outward aspect of redemption, which is due to man s fall.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If man had not fallen, the story between man and God would only have an inward aspect related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, we are all under the effects of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Like prodigal sons, we have returned to God s presence; hence, we must first be dealt with outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must be justified and accepted by God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only then can God come into us to enliven us, causing us to be regenerated to have God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First Peter 1:3 says that God has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>First Peter 1:23 says that we have been regenerated through the living word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First John 5:1 says that we have been begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, John 1:12-13 says that we, who have received the Lord, were all begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There are also two additional verses concerning regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>John 3:3 says, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God, and verse 5 says, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Regeneration is having God enter into us as life having the life of God in addition to our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the second life, the second birth; hence, it is called regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In man s first birth he is born of his parents, thereby receiving Adam s life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In his second birth he is born of the Spirit and of God, thereby obtaining God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Regeneration is to be born of God.</S>
