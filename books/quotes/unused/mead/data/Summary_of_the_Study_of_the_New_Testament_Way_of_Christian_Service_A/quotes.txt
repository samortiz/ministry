[4]  Over the past four and a half years, I was led by the Lord to study the New Testament way of Christian service.
[5]  In this four and a half year study, the Lord has shown us four major points: the practice of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God, the practice of the raising up of the new believers, the practice of the perfecting of the saints, and the practice of prophesying speaking for God and Christ, speaking forth God and Christ to impart dispense God and Christ into others, to minister Christ as life and life supply to people.
[6]  In the advance of the Lord's recovery today, we need to be brought into the practice of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God Rom 15:16 .
[7]  The gospel of God 1:1 does not merely comprise Christ's salvation of sinners.
[8]  This is just a small part of the entire gospel of God.
[9]  THE PRACTICE OF THE RAISING UP OF THE NEW BELIEVERS
[10]  After new ones are begotten through our preaching of the gospel, we need to raise them up.
[11]  We need to go weekly to have home meetings with them in their homes Acts 5:42 .
[12]  COOPERATING WITH THE LORD AND COORDINATING WITH THE CHURCH
[13]  To have these four practices of the Lord's recovery in a church is not so simple.
[14]  Our burden in this book is to fellowship concerning the practice of the Lord's advanced recovery today.
[15]  We needed to see how to serve God, how to meet together, how to function, how to carry out the work, and how to preach the gospel.
[16]  As a remedy to these problems, the Lord showed me three major items which are all new to me.
[17]  He showed me the perfecting of the saints in Ephesians 4, the church meeting in mutuality in 1 Corinthians 14, and the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God.
[18]  It says that all of these gifted persons were given by the Head to the Body for the perfecting of the saints, so that the saints, after being perfected, can do the work of the New Testament ministry to build up the Body of Christ.
[19]  In giving us the revelation of the priesthood of the gospel of God, the raising up of the new believers, the perfecting of the saints, and prophesying, the Lord has given us a conclusion to our four and a half year study.
[20]  I considered whether I could find any more verses in the New Testament concerning how to serve, how to meet, how to function, how to preach the gospel, etc. I believe that we have exhausted the revelation in the New Testament concerning the Christian way of service.
[21]  As the leading ones, we need to ask ourselves what we will do as we function in the churches.
[22]  Shall we preach the gospel by inviting people to our meetings and meet on the Lord's Day morning with a big congregation and a good speaker while the rest sit and listen?
[23]  In this chapter, I want us to be impressed that we should not function, serve, or meet in a natural way.
[24]  We may think that serving God, preaching the gospel, or functioning to give a testimony are things that we can do easily and naturally.
[25]  God is Spirit, so those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth v. 24 . Today by His mercy and under His enlightenment, we can say that we are clear what it means to worship God in our spirit.
[26]  PREACHING THE GOSPEL AS PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD
[27]  Thus far, after about nineteen centuries of church history, the Lord has not gained His heart's desire.
[28]  We know that He wants to have a group of people to be His organic members.
[29]  This means we have to meet organically, serve organically, function organically, and preach the gospel organically.
[30]  As priests, we are in God and God is in us, so we are one with God.
[31]  When we go to preach the gospel to people, we must exercise our priesthood.
[32]  BEING FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD TO BE ECSTATIC
[33]  In principle, every New Testament believer must be "crazy," ecstatic.
[34]  Following this fellowship and interceding, questions will be asked.
[35]  No one should be assigned to answer these questions.
[36]  I would like to say a word to the elders.
[37]  In our locality we should not do anything in haste.
[38]  At the present time, some of the saints may not feel good about changing our way of meeting from one person speaking to a meeting of mutuality with all prophesying.
