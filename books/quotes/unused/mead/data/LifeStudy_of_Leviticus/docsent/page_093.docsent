   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE TRESPASS OFFERING BEING MOST HOLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"This is the law of the trespass offering; it is most holy" Lev 7:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Like the meal offering and the sin offering, the trespass offering is most holy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This signifies that Christ as our trespass offering is most holy in dealing with the sins in our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we apply Christ as our trespass offering, we must do this in a holy way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should never apply this offering in a loose or careless way, much less in a sinful way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Concerning the trespass offering, we need to remember that God uses this offering to refer us to the sin offering, reminding us that sin is in our flesh and that sin includes Satan, who is the father of lies John 8:44 , the world 1 John 5:19 , and the power struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The trespass offering also refers us to the burnt offering, reminding us that we commit sins because we are not fully and wholly for God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reason we lose our temper or strive with certain saints is that we are not wholly for God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since the trespass offering refers us to the sin offering and the burnt offering, we should not take the trespass offering in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, nearly the entire Christian life is involved with the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we should have the proper realization of this offering and apply it according to its law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE TRESPASS OFFERING BEING SLAUGHTERED IN THE PLACE WHERE THE BURNT OFFERING IS SLAUGHTERED</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"In the place where they slaughter the burnt offering they shall slaughter the trespass offering" Lev 7:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This signifies that Christ as our trespass offering in dealing with the sins in our conduct is based upon His being the burnt offering to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Both the sin offering and the trespass offering are based on the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because Christ is the burnt offering, He is qualified to be the sin offering and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If Christ were not absolute for God, Christ would not be qualified to be our sin offering and trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, He Himself would have needed someone to be His sin offering and trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Being absolute for God is the foundation, the base, for our Savior's being our sin offering and trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This reminds us and strengthens us when we take Him as our trespass offering to take Him also as our burnt offering so that in Him, with Him, and through Him we may be absolute for God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>EVERY MALE OF THE PRIESTS EATING OF THE TRESPASS OFFERING IN A HOLY PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Every male among the priests may eat of it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It shall be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy" v. 6 . Every male of the priests eating of the trespass offering in a holy place signifies that all the stronger ones can enjoy Christ as the trespass offering in ministering Christ to others in dealing with the sins in their conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To minister Christ as the trespass offering to a brother who has committed sins requires that you be a stronger one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This enjoyment of Christ must be in a holy place, in a separated, sanctified realm.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we would help others to take Christ as their trespass offering for their sins, we must be strong, and we must do this in a realm that is not common or worldly but that is holy and sanctified, separated from all other places.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>AS THE SIN OFFERING, SO IS THE TRESPASS OFFERING ONE LAW FOR BOTH</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"As the sin offering, so is the trespass offering; there is one law for them" v. 7a . This signifies that sin and trespasses sins are of the same category.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All are sin in its totality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the reason the word sin in John 1:29 includes sin and sins; that is, it includes the totality of the category of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>V. THE PRIEST WHO MAKES PROPITIATION WITH THE TRESPASS OFFERING HAVING IT</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"The priest who makes propitiation with it shall have it" v. 7b . This signifies that the one who ministers with Christ as the trespass offering shares such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we minister Christ as the trespass offering to others, we share in Him as this offering.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This encourages us to minister Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE PRIEST WHO OFFERS ANY MAN'S BURNT OFFERING HAVING THE HIDE OF THE BURNT OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"The priest who offers any man's burnt offering, that priest shall have for himself the hide of the burnt offering which he has offered" v. 8 . This signifies that the one who ministers with Christ as the burnt offering shares and enjoys Christ in His enveloping power.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we serve others with Christ, we share a particular part of Christ His "hide," which signifies His enveloping power.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To envelop something is to wrap it with some kind of covering, and this covering serves as a protection to that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ's enveloping power is His covering, protecting, and preserving power.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a cow had no hide, the cow would not be protected and preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today Christ is our covering.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He not only covers us but also protects and preserves us and everything related to our being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We experience Christ as our covering, protecting, and preserving power when we minister Him as the burnt offering to others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because we have a thick hide covering and preserving us, we are protected in every way, and nothing will hurt us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>EVERY MEAL OFFERING BAKED IN THE OVEN OR PREPARED IN A PAN OR ON A GRIDDLE BEING FOR THE PRIEST WHO OFFERS IT</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"Every meal offering which is baked in the oven, and any that is prepared in a pan or on a griddle, shall be for the priest himself who offers it" v. 9 . Here we see that these meal offerings with which the priest served eventually became his to enjoy for the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This signifies that the one who ministers Christ as the suffering One partakes of and enjoys such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As long as we serve Christ to others, we will have as our enjoyment the very Christ whom we serve.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>EVERY MEAL OFFERING MINGLED WITH OIL OR DRY BEING FOR ALL THE PRIESTS</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"But every other meal offering, whether mingled with oil or dry, shall be for all of Aaron's sons, to all alike" v. 10 . This signifies that all those who minister Christ mingled with the Spirit or in Himself alike partake of and enjoy such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What we have in these verses is the law of the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we minister Christ to others, we will enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is a law, a regulation, made by God.</S>
