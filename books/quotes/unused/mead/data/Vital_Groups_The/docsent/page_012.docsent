   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In message one we pointed out that to live the church life, we have to pursue with those who call on the name of the Lord out of a pure heart 2 Tim 2:22 .</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may be able to say that we need to live the divine life by denying our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may be eloquent speakers, but do we live such a life?</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The members of Christ constitute His Body for His spreading by His multiplication.</S>
