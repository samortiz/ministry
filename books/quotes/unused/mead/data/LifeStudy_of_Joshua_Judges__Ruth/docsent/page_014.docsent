   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JOSHUA MESSAGE SEVEN THE DESTRUCTION OF JERICHO Scripture Reading: Josh 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Joshua 6 is a record of the first warfare and destruction by Israel in the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order for the children of Israel to gain the good land, they had to defeat the enemy and drive out the evil forces.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nevertheless, the children of Israel actually did not need to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When they crossed the Jordan, God did everything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the same principle, God s people did not need to do anything to destroy Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They only needed to believe and trust in God, to listen to the instruction from the Captain of the army of Israel, and to exalt Christ by bearing the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From this we see that in the spiritual warfare the first thing we should do is exalt Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jericho was strongly fortified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But when the king heard what Jehovah had done for His people, his heart melted and he lost his spirit, his boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not knowing what to do, he shut the gates of the city and used the walls to protect himself and his people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There was no traffic, no coming in or going out.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that the powers of darkness were bound, that there was a real binding of the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The king trusted in the wall, knowing that the Israelites did not have any weapons to breach the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even though the Israelites had crossed the Jordan, he did not think that they would be able to cross the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He did not have any thought concerning what God would do.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was an easy matter for God to destroy the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 2 Jehovah told Joshua that He had given Jericho, its king, and the mighty men of war into Joshua s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then God instructed Joshua to have the men of war with the priests bearing the ark circle the city, going around it one time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This they were to do for six days.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Seven other priests were charged to carry seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The priests did not blow their trumpets according to their own will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, they waited for the captain to give the command.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They needed instructions and leading, just as we today need the leading and guiding of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For the first six days, the army of Israel just walked around the city with the ark, which typified Christ as the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I believe that many of the people of Jericho were on the wall watching, wondering what the people of Israel were doing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the seventh day, the Sabbath day, the situation was different.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Israel actually did not have to fight but enjoyed the Sabbath, that is, enjoyed the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They walked around the city seven times, and then the visible captain gave the command: Shout!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The priests trumpeted, the people shouted, and the wall fell down.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The city was utterly destroyed, and a curse was placed on anyone who would rise up and build it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The way that Israel conquered Jericho was a strong testimony that Israel s God, Jehovah, is a true and living God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may apply this account of the destruction of Jericho to the matter of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we take up the burden to visit sinners, we need to realize that every sinner is a fortified city that has been cursed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In dealing with such a fortified city, we must exercise patience, considering when we should be silent and when we should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that we should follow the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the right time, the proper declaration will be very effective, and there will be a Sabbath day in which we can shout, Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jesus is Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is Victor!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The wall will fall, and we will be able to defeat all the demons and possess that sinner for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let us now look at the various matters involved in the destruction of Jericho as described in Joshua 6.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jericho was shut up tight because of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No one went out and no one went in. The people of Jericho were limited, unable to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This indicates that even before Israel went up to take the city, Jericho was already defeated.</S>

   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the seventh day all the men of war were to circle the city seven times, and all the priests were to blow the trumpets v. 4b . This signifies the declaring, the proclaiming, of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>and the People Going Up</S>
