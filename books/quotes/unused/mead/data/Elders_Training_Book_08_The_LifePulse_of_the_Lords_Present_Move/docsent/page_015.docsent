   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXHORTING ONE ANOTHER, INCLUDING SHEPHERDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the book of Hebrews Paul speaks concerning many high things regarding the superiority of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 10:25 he says, Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul told the saints that they needed to come together to exhort one another.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1 Corinthians 14:3 there are three points: building up, encouraging, and consolation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Exhortation is the fourth point.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul s word to exhort one another shows the mutuality in a meeting and also implies the proper shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not think that only others need your shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have to realize that you need others to shepherd you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord knows that although I am an old, experienced brother, I still need your shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A shepherd is one who takes care of other s needs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You need me to take care of your need, and I need you to take care of my need.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God never created people to live in isolation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A human being was not meant to live alone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A man was not meant to live without his neighborhood or without society.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man needs community and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need the shepherding of one another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The elders should not think that they are so experienced that they do not need the young ones to shepherd them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The elders need the shepherding of the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The grandfather needs the children s shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Recently, a light bulb went out in one of our rooms.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am over eighty and my wife is close to seventy years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I was trying to climb up to change the light bulb, my wife begged me not to do it because I might fall and hurt myself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We had to suffer the darkness until the next morning when my grandson came to shepherd us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His putting in of a new light bulb shepherded us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Also, our door had a crack in it and we did not know what to do with it; nor did we know where to get a carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We suffered for a week until one day a brother came in and saw the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He said, Brother Lee, why didn t you tell me earlier about this?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let me fix the door for you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His care for me made me happy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I gave him something to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, he shepherded me and I shepherded him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He took care of the crack in my door and I took care of his drink.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That made us both happy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is what we call shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church in Taipei has eleven thousand members.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How many shepherds would one have to hire to do the shepherding there?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But when you have small gatherings of ten or twelve, all coming together at least once a week, they shepherd one another.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And their shepherding is more practical in details, in small things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Quite often a saint who has just come to the city and has only been there a short time gets sick.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They do not even know where to get a proper doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this matter they need your help, your shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we would do all these things in the home gatherings, all the attendants would feel very much benefited in different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The home gatherings are not just for hearing a message, a good speech.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the home gatherings the saints should get the building up, the consolation, the exhortation, and the encouragement resulting in the shepherding in all aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the real building up.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Without the home gatherings, there is no way to build the saints up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The real building up has to be accomplished in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>TAKING CARE OF THE NEW ONES</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>AND THE UNBELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Another aspect of our meetings should be the taking care of the new ones and the unbelievers 1 Cor 14:23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>First Corinthians 14:23 refers to the unlearned entering into a church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a newcomer, a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This one could be a professor in a seminary with a doctor s degree, yet he does not know anything concerning what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When he comes to our meeting, he surely is a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He may know the Bible, but he does not know what we are doing in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To us he is a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>According to our experience, this happens quite often.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>First Corinthians 14:23 also refers to unbelievers coming to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the home meetings we should take care of these kinds of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is why the saints need some training concerning how to be flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do not get the meeting fixed in cement.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The meeting should not be fixed, settled, with no possibility of any change.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should not have the attitude that a certain meeting is not for the unbelievers, so we do not preach the gospel in this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should not have the attitude that in a certain meeting we would not say anything for the outsiders and that this meeting is for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is altogether wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our meeting hall should be like the New Jerusalem with three gates on four sides.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Let everybody come in.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We all have to take care of the four points listed at the beginning of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The saints in each locality should be trained to exercise their spirit, to prophesy, to assemble to exhort one another, and to take care of the new ones and the unbelievers in our meetings, whether they are big meetings or small ones.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If there are some unbelievers, we must say at least a short word concerning salvation, concerning the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Spend five minutes to take care of the unbelievers in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Let them hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>THE NEED OF THE LEADING ONES TO LABOR</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>AND BE ON FIRE</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All the saints need to learn these things, so the burden of the elders is really great and heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I hope that for the Lord s sake all the elders would pick up the burden to labor properly.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We should not function in the eldership in the way we did in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We need to have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Since I realized the poor situation among us both in the West and the East, in October of 1984 I began to realize that we needed a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The center for this new start must be the home gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Lord s leading us to take the way of home gatherings is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is a recovery back to the God-ordained way to have the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The brothers who are the elders, the leading ones, in all the churches are the keys.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I do not have the time to go to every locality, and I do not need to go.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But I do have the burden to fellowship all these matters to the leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I want to infuse you, to put the fire into you.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If you all would be on fire, that would be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If all the elders will be burning, all the churches will be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Do not expect the rest of the saints to necessarily be on fire unless the elders, the leading ones, and the leading sisters are on fire.</S>
