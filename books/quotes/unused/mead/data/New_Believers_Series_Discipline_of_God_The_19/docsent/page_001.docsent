   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DISCIPLINE OF GOD Scripture Reading: Heb 12:4-13 I. THE PROPER ATTITUDE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THOSE UNDER DISCIPLINE A. Struggling against Sin,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Having Not Yet Resisted unto Blood</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us consider Hebrews 12:4-13, point by point.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 4 says, "You have not yet resisted unto blood, struggling against sin."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this verse the apostle said that the Hebrew believers had struggled against sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But even though they had suffered much, gone through great trials, encountered various problems, and met with much persecution, they had not yet resisted unto blood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we compare these sufferings with that of our Lord, they are quite light!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 2 tells us that the Lord Jesus despised the shame and endured the suffering of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What a believer goes through is far less severe than what the Lord went through!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus despised the shame and endured the suffering of the cross unto the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although the Hebrew believers also suffered some shame and endured the cross, they had not yet resisted unto blood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. Finding the Reasons for Our Sufferings</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What should a person expect after he becomes a Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should never put a false hope before the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should show them that we will encounter many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, God's purpose and meaning are behind all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can expect many trials and tribulations, but what is the purpose and meaning behind all these trials and tribulations?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Unless the Lord grants us the privilege of becoming martyrs, we will probably not have the chance to resist and struggle against sin "unto blood."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But even though it is not a resistance unto blood, we are nevertheless resisting!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why do these things happen to us?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>C. Not Fainting nor Regarding Lightly</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verses 5 and 6 say, "You have completely forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with sons, My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when reproved by Him; for whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives.'"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The apostle quoted Proverbs in the Old Testament in this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He said that if the Lord disciplines us, we must not regard it lightly; and if the Lord reproves us, we must not faint.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A believer should adopt these two attitudes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some regard difficulties, sufferings, and God's discipline as insignificant matters.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They do not think much of them and easily allow God's discipline to slip by.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are also some who faint when they go through the Lord's reproach and fall into His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As Christians they feel that they have suffered too much hardship in their environment and that it is too hard to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They expect their way to be smooth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Their thought is on entering the pearly gates and walking on a golden street wearing fine, white linen garments.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It never occurred to them that Christians would experience all kinds of difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are not prepared to be Christians under such circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They faint and waver at the difficulties along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Proverbs shows us that both of these attitudes are wrong.</S>
