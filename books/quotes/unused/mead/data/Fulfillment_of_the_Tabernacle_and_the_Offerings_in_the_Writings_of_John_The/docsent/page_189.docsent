   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONTINUATION OF THE DIVINE GLORIFICATION IN THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The divine glorification continues today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This glorification began with the Lord's resurrection, and it is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to our viewpoint, we may say that the delivery that brought forth the Firstborn and the many brothers covers a long span of time, thus far, more than nineteen hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the sight of God, this delivery, although lengthy in time, is a matter of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through this span of delivery in resurrection, we all have been brought forth to constitute the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, there are yet others being brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is by this continuing delivery that the Lord's prophecy in John 2 concerning the raising up of the temple is being fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord said to the Jews, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This raising up of the temple, which is the bringing forth of the new man, has not yet been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because this delivery, this bringing forth, is still taking place, the divine glorification is also continuing today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe that what the Lord has shown us concerning the divine glorification will help us to know what the church life is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church life is actually the multiplication, the propagation, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of church life is the divine glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church has been produced in this glorification, and it continues to grow in the divine glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whatever the church does in the matter of fruit-bearing is a continuation of the divine glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the church spreads, this spreading is the fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, fifteen years ago there were only a small number of saints in the Lord's recovery in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But now this number has increased.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This increase is a matter of fruit-bearing, and fruit-bearing is the divine glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke we have a clear word concerning gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In these Gospels the Lord commands the disciples to go forth and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in the Gospel of John the Lord does not tell the disciples to go out to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, in this Gospel the Lord indicates that we are branches of the vine to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the Gospel of John, the bearing of fruit is actually the proper way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may say that Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the synoptic Gospels, are on the human side, whereas the Gospel of John is on the divine side.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the human side, we have gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But on the divine side, instead of gospel preaching we have a divine living, a living of fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Consider the branches of a vine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These branches do not preach; they simply grow in order to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As branches of Christ, the true vine, we bear fruit that is the multiplication of the glorified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This glorification is continuous.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This continuous glorification is also the continuing delivery of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this fruit-bearing, in this delivery, Christ is glorified, and in His glorification the Father is glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suppose on earth today there were only a few Christians and these Christians were scattered throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What kind of glorification would this be?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If this were the situation, there would be hardly any glory at all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the multiplication of the Lord Jesus has spread throughout the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This continuous spreading of Christ is His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE CONSUMMATION OF THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Father's house, the vine, and the new man are all related to the divine glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As we have seen, the house, the vine, and the new man are all one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord's glorification began in 12:24 with the producing of many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These grains are constituents of the Body of Christ, the church, which is the house of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the book of Ephesians, the church is the Body of Christ in Ephesians 1 and the house of God the Father in Ephesians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In keeping with a basic principle in the New Testament, the Body is also a house.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, the house is a family.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even in the Old Testament we have the thought that children are the glory of their father because they are his multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Children may be compared to the many grains that are the multiplication of one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A father is the one grain, and his children are the many grains produced out of him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, as the many grains are the glory of the one grain, so the many children are the glory of the father.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This clearly illustrates the concept in this section of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord revealed the Father to His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Father gave Him authority over all flesh so that He might give eternal life to His chosen ones and thereby cause them to become God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The children of God are also the many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All this is a matter of divine glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is far off the mark to say that John 14 speaks of the building of a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This thought cannot be found anywhere in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What the New Testament reveals is the church life consummating in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What some claim is the heavenly mansion in John 14 is actually what we mean by the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Eventually, according to the book of Revelation, the New Jerusalem will come down from the heavens Rev 21:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, in eternity there will be no such thing as a mansion in the heavens, but the New Jerusalem will be the consummation of the church life on earth.</S>
