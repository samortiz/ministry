<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Revelation 2:10</H2><P>"Do not fear the things that you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life."</P><P>"The things that you are about to suffer" were the things which they had not yet suffered. These were in addition to the three things just mentioned. This is really suffering upon suffering! But here the Lord tells us beforehand, "Do not fear," because (1) fear is the source of failure—if you do not fear, you will not fail; and (2) the Lord has already won the victory—although we may suffer, eventually we will triumph.</P><P>"The devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried." At the beginning it was merely opposition and slandering, but now it has intensified to the point of imprisonment. The purpose of this imprisonment is: (1) to stop the believers from testifying publicly, so as to bind the Lord's truth; (2) to cause them to be separated from one another, thus, reducing their strength; and 3) to cause those who are imprisoned to suffer. On the one hand, this would make the devil happy, and on the other hand, this would cause the believers to lose heart. Oh, how evil are the tactics of the devil!</P><P>"The devil is about to cast some of you." No person is mentioned here, but the devil is particularly mentioned. This is so that (1) we will not blame people but will hate the devil, and so that (2) we may accurately recognize the enemy in order to resist him.</P><P>"You will have tribulation for ten days." "Ten days" does not mean ten days and ten nights. It means that our suffering is for a specified period of time. Some say that these ten days are the ten periods of great persecution by the Romans.</P><P>"Be faithful unto death." "Unto death" implies killing. When the devil sees that imprisonment is not effective, he will take a further step, to kill them. "Be," here, is in the imperative mood. "Faithful unto death" means that even though they face death, they still do not love their soul-lives (Rev. 12:11). Oh, but Satan's attacks can reach only up to this point. If we are faithful, he cannot do anything more.</P><P>"I will give you the crown of life." Oh, how wonderful this promise is. What a blessed hope! (James 1:12). Revelation 1:10 does not say that He will give life, but that He will give a crown of life. Life is obtained by believing, but the crown of life can only be obtained by being faithful. "Crown" indicates glory; it refers to being one of the co-kings with Christ and reigning in the millennium.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Revelation 2:11</H2><P>"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death."</P><P>"He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death." Here the promise to the overcomers is spoken of very clearly. On the positive side, it is to obtain the crown of life; on the negative side, it is to be spared from being hurt of the second death. "He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death." In other words, he who fails will suffer being hurt of the second death. This is what we believe. Before we speak about being "hurt of the second death," let us first talk about the overcoming and the failing mentioned here. Since the overcoming mentioned here is to be faithful to the truth, even unto death, the failing must be the failure of being unwilling to be martyred. Therefore, one who fears death and is not willing to be martyred will have to suffer being hurt of the second death.</P><P>Now, let us ask what the second death is. By referring to Revelation 20:14-15, we see that the second death refers to the time after the death and resurrection of the body, when the spirit, soul, and body will be cast into the lake of fire. In other words, it is eternal perdition. Believers will never suffer this (John 10:28).</P><P>To be hurt of the second death is different from the second death. Just as eternal life is in contrast to the second death, in the same way, the crown of life is in contrast to being hurt of the second death. As life is different from the crown of life, so the second death is different from being hurt of the second death. Furthermore, since the crown of life is related to the kingdom, to be hurt of the second death is also related to the kingdom of the heavens. Therefore, to be hurt of the second death could never refer to eternal perdition.</P><P>Now we can speak directly about what it is to be hurt of the second death. What is the second death? The second death refers to what an unbeliever, whose soul has already suffered in Hades after his physical death, will suffer in his spirit, soul, and body eternally, after his resurrection and his judgment at the great white throne in the future. What is it to be hurt of the second death? To be hurt of the second death means that after the backslidden and unfaithful believers are resurrected, they will still have to suffer during the kingdom, though this is not eternal perdition. When speaking concerning this point, I must praise God for His righteousness because, though the overcomers may suffer martyrdom in the world, they will be spared from being hurt of the second death during the kingdom and, instead, will obtain the crown of life. The defeated ones, who are not willing to be martyred, are spared from suffering in this world, but they will be hurt in the kingdom of heaven and will not obtain the crown of life. Who will choose to suffer in this age and obtain glory in the future?</P><P>A type in the Old Testament shows this difference. The people of Sodom were burned to death within the city (Gen. 19:24-25); this can be likened to the second death. Lot's wife was turned into a pillar of salt outside the city (v. 26; Luke 17:32); this can be likened to being hurt of the second death.</P>
