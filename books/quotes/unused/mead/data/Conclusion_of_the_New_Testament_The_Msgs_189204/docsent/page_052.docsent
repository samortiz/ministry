   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that the church's administration is exercised in binding and loosing with the authority of the heavens.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church revealed in Matthew 16:18 is the universal church, the unique Body of Christ, whereas the church revealed in Matthew 18:17 is the local church, the expression of the unique Body of Christ in a certain locality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Matthew 16 concerns the universal building of the church, but Matthew 18 concerns the local practice of the church.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not one was written to the universal church. a. Established Locally in Separate Cities</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whereas the universal church has been formed by Christ once for all, the local churches are established locally in separate cities.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, the believers live in churches that are in their localities respectively.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Acts 8:1, for example, speaks of "the church in Jerusalem."</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As such a local church, it was part of the universal church, which is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The record of the New Testament consistently reveals the establishing of local churches in different cities.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second mention of a particular local church in the New Testament is in Acts 13:1a.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Antioch there was another local church, another expression of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, in Acts 8 and 13 we can see one church with two expressions: one at Jerusalem, the other at Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All local churches Acts 14:21, 23 are the expression of the one universal church.</S>
