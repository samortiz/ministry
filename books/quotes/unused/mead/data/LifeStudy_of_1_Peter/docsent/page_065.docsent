   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE CHRISTIAN LIFE AND ITS SUFFERINGS 3 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:21-25</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous message we considered what it means for Christ to be our model.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We saw that He is the master copy, the original copy, and that through a process of spiritual xeroxing we are becoming a reproduction of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall consider other matters in 2:21-25.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Peter 2:21 and 22 say, For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model that you should follow in His steps; who did no sin, nor was guile found in His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not an easy matter to have no guile in our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Consider how many mistakes you make in one day because of the things you say.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because we in ourselves cannot be without guile, Peter specifically says that no guile was found in the Lord s mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A LIFE UNDER GOD S GOVERNMENT</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 23 Peter goes on to say concerning the Lord, Who being reviled did not revile in return; suffering, He did not threaten, but kept committing all to Him who judges righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the usage of the verb kept committing in Greek, all needs to be inserted here as its object.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This word refers to all the sufferings of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He kept committing all the insults He suffered and all His injuries to Him who judges righteously in His government, to the righteous God, to whom He submitted Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that the Lord recognized God s government while He was living a human life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am somewhat concerned that in your reading of this verse you may not pay attention to the word judges.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are accustomed to saying that we commit things to the Lord who is faithful or merciful or kind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Have you ever said, I commit everything to God who judges righteously ?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I do not think that many of us have had this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The reason we do not pray like this is that our prayer, expression, and utterance are still too traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This keeps us from applying many of the thoughts and utterances in the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, in reading a verse such as 2:23, we may take it for granted and fail to get into the real meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>While the Lord Jesus was on earth suffering, He kept committing all to the One who judges righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This brief word indicates not only that the Lord lived a life that was a model for us, but also that He lived a life absolutely under God s government.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He Himself was always under the government of God, and He committed everything related to Him to God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Peter has already referred to God s judgment in 1:17: And if you call upon as Father the One who without respect of persons judges according to each one s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here Peter is not speaking of the final judgment of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In that sense the Father does not judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son John 5:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The thing spoken of here is the daily judgment of God s government in this world, exercised with regard to His children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Accordingly it says, The time of your sojourning here Darby .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is God s judgment on His own household.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since these two Epistles are concerned with the government of God, the judgment of God and of the Lord is referred to repeatedly 2:23; 4:5-6, 17; 2 Pet 2:3-4, 9; 3:7 , as one of the essential items.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It began from the angels 2 Pet 2:3-4 , and passed through the generations of man in the Old Testament 2 Pet 2:5-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then in the New Testament age it begins from the house of God 1 Pet 1:17; 2:23; 4:6, 17 and continues until the coming of the day of the Lord 2 Pet 3:10 , which will be a day of judgment on the Jews, the believers, and the Gentiles before the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After the millennium, all the dead, including men and demons, will be judged and perish 1 Pet 4:5; 2 Pet 3:7 , and the heavens and the earth will be burned up 2 Pet 3:10, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The results of the varied judgments are not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some judgments result in a disciplinary dealing, some in a dispensational punishment, and some in eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, by all these judgments, the Lord God will clear up and purify the entire universe so that He may have a new heaven and a new earth for a new universe filled with His righteousness 2 Pet 3:13 for His delight.</S>
