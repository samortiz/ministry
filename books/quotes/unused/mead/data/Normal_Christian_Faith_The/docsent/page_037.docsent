   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SATISFACTION VERSUS CONTENTMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Besides regeneration, there is another crucial matter, which we call Christian satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A genuine Christian feels that his hopes are fulfilled, his aspirations attained; he has no want; he is absolutely satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But this satisfaction is very different from the contentment that people commonly talk about.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Contentment is to see things in an optimistic way, to let things come and go by as they are without insisting on anything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There may not be much wealth or position.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There may not be much honor or renown.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But as long as one can live in peace and be left unbothered, that is good enough!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is contentment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But this is not satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a person is satisfied, he feels that he has what he wants and that he has no more desires.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>HE WHO DRINKS OF THIS WATER SHALL THIRST AGAIN</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is an excellent record in John 4.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What did Jesus say to a Samaritan woman there?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again" v. 13 . If you desire worldly glory, renown, wealth, position, etc., you will never be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you have ten thousand dollars, you will want a hundred thousand, and when you have acquired a hundred thousand, you will start dreaming about a million.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There will never be satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He who drinks of this water will thirst again.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How do you quench this thirst?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus said, "But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever" v. 14 . An amazing fact is that neither Confucius nor any other religious leader ever said such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The teachings of Confucius and Mencius only tell you to be content and to abide in your poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The person Confucius or Mencius has nothing to do with your contentment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, the person Jesus has a great deal to do with your thirst-quenching.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Naturally the woman desired to drink of this thirst-quenching water.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When she asked Jesus for this living water, "Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water" v. 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Was Jesus preaching a doctrine?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No. There was no doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The only thing He did was point to Himself, as if to say, "Well, if you know who He is, you will ask of Him at once, and He will give you living water, that you may never thirst again."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The whole question is who Jesus of Nazareth is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Samaritan woman was not a decent woman.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fact that she had had six husbands showed what kind of woman she was.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She must have been dissatisfied with this one and that one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One husband could not make her happy; another could not make her satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result, she changed from one husband to another, and then to a third and a fourth, until she came to the sixth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One day she came out to draw water, a symbol of her being one who drinks and is still thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The remarkable thing is that on that day, her life was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She became satisfied!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What did she do?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She did not do anything!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On that day she realized who Jesus of Nazareth is and she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let us look again at the process through which she came to know Jesus and believe in Him.</S>
