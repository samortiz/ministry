   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A TESTIMONY OF THE REVIVAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE CHURCH IN CHEFOO</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother Lee: Since the end of 1942, I saw clearly that unless the problem with money is solved, there is no way for the gospel of God to go out effectively.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's gospel has been preached in China for over a century.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the gospel cannot spread to the inland regions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For over one hundred years, it has been Western money that has been supporting the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This money has been spent along the coastal regions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many people became rich as a result of becoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These brothers and sisters are no longer able to move, for they have been nailed down by money.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the same time, money was not able to go into the inland regions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We saw that when money was not released by the brothers and sisters, there was no way for genuine revival to occur.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On December 13, 1942, the Lord did a work among us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That afternoon I was preparing to preach a message on life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We had been preaching messages on life for two or three years, but that afternoon my message took a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From that day forward, we saw that God's gospel can never be released as long as the problem with money is not settled.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today God cannot be released because the gospel cannot be released, and the gospel cannot be released because money cannot be released.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I know that in a certain denomination in a certain place, a few rich people put their money together and built a chapel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet the men themselves were still collecting debts and exacting high interest on loans.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Can God be released under such circumstances?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that time some brothers in Chefoo had been without jobs for over a year.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some sisters had even taken up embroidery work, which required fine labor but did not allow them to earn much money.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result, not much was received from the offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For six months we received nothing from the offering box designated for the co-worker sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But on that day there was a great difference in offering; many envelopes were received.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The offering was not a result of my preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the twentieth, which was the following Lord's Day, I went up to the platform again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We sang Hymns, #472, and many were moved to tears.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They realized that the gospel had not been released because they had been holding back their money.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By the next Lord's Day, the twenty-seventh, the Lord's work was even stronger, and we felt that we had to meet every day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Beginning January 1, 1943, which was a holiday, we began to have conferences that lasted from ten o'clock in the morning until six o'clock in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One brother was sick and could not sleep at night.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord touched him and asked him to consecrate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He could not resist the Lord, and in the end he yielded everything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way about six to seven hundred people all consecrated everything to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some consecrated their grant deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Others consecrated their stocks and shares.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many consecrated themselves for the work in northwest China.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This lasted for three and a half months.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We met every day for over one hundred days.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One day I said, "Who is willing to go to northwest China for the gospel's sake?''</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Almost everyone stood up.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many were willing to move their whole family, including all their wealth, for the gospel's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The first group that went were laborers with lowly occupations, farmers, and manual workers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The second group that went had better occupations.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some were nurses, others were doctors or men with capital.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The third group that went out were the preachers and the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the first group moved out, it shocked the whole city of Chefoo, because the outsiders had reckoned that we would never be able to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This kind of revival went on for three months, and we got ourselves into big troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This does not mean that we purposely tried to get ourselves into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the brothers and sisters had consecrated everything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What should we do now?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The brothers and sisters had emptied out their hearts and had offered up all their belongings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some came laughing, while others came weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But all came with their belongings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For two nights we waited on the Lord until after midnight, and we discussed again and again what we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After the bread-breaking meeting on March 14, we told the saints what they should do after they have consecrated themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>During this period everyone became involved in this revival.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many dared not even touch their clothes when they went home.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The minute they touched them, the Lord would ask them to consecrate.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If they kept anything back, they would not have any peace.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But when they offered up everything, they had peace.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I realized that it was not right for the church to go into business, because the church was simply the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, we considered the general condition of the saints and assigned them to various businesses.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We closed down some improper businesses.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The consecrated lands could not come under the name of the church, and they could not be distributed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, we put them temporarily under the names of the original owners with the condition that they would sell the land when the church needed the money.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Nothing of what we did then causes me to have any regret.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The only lack was prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This gave the Japanese a chance to creep in. We did not see that Satan was doing everything he could to frustrate the work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Because the brothers and sisters had offered up everything, including their time and all their possessions, the church had to make some arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It was also at this time that I fell into trials.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I became ill, and I separated myself from the work.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As a consequence, I was able to escape the hands of the Japanese.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After the past five years, I look back and realize that what we did then was indeed the Lord's way.</S>
