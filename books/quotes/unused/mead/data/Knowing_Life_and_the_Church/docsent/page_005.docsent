   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO LIFE BEING GOD HIMSELF ENJOYED BY MAN Scripture Reading: Psa 36:7-9; John 1:4; 8:12; 10:10; 6:63; Rom 8:2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have already seen that God s goal in creation and redemption is life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God created man so that man would obtain life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, the story of the entire universe is related to life in living creatures, with God s life being the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The source of all life in the universe is God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, the story of the universe comes from God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we want to know and understand God s salvation, we must see that God s only goal is life; life is God s only purpose, and everything that happens in the universe is because of life and originates from life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>AN OPENING WORD</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we need to see two crucial points: what does the life that we speak of refer to, and how do we contact and touch this life?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible shows that the source of life is God; God is the origin of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Psalm 36:9 says, For with You is the fountain of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, life is in God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verses 7 through 9, there are some related points that we must consider.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 7 speaks of God s lovingkindness and says that His precious lovingkindness enables the sons of men to take refuge in the shadow of His wings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 8 speaks of the fatness of God s house and of the river of His pleasures for man s enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 9 has two special points: for with You is the fountain of life and in Your light we see light.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let us examine these four points: First, man can take refuge in God s loving-kindness; second, man enjoys God s fatness and the river of His pleasures when he takes refuge in God s lovingkindness; third, man enjoys God s fatness and the river of His pleasures in God s life; and fourth, man can touch God s life in His light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the New Testament we can see more clearly that life is the incarnated Christ John 1:1, 4, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In John 14:6 the Lord Jesus said, I am the way and the reality and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He Himself said that He is life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God s being life means that life is not simply something that comes from God, but life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 1:4 says that life and light are one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John 8:12 connects life and light and speaks of the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 10:10 the Lord Jesus said, I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 6:63 He said, It is the Spirit who gives life...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 63 begins by saying that the Spirit gives life, and it ends by saying that the words the Lord spoke to us are spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Romans 8:2 refers to life, Spirit, and law when it speaks of the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>LIFE BEING GOD HIMSELF FLOWING OUT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>TO BE ENJOYED BY MAN</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Psalm 36 God s lovingkindness, the fatness of His house, and the river of His pleasures all refer to God s riches; all the riches of God are in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When man touches God s life, he touches God s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can enjoy, taste, and touch God s love, sweetness, and riches in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From this psalm, we can see that the riches in God s nature can be touched by us in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Life is God s nature, God s substance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is life, that is, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He came to the earth so that man could obtain God and obtain His life John 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This proves that life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Revelation 22:1-2 shows that the river of water of life and the tree of life proceed and grow out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Life originates with God because life is God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, when God flows out and is enjoyed by man, it is called life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Steamed rice and raw rice are a good illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Steamed rice comes from raw rice; the two are essentially the same.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If raw grains of rice are placed in front of us, they cannot be enjoyed or eaten by us, and they cannot satisfy our hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order for raw grains of rice to be eaten and enjoyed by us and to satisfy our hunger, they need to be steamed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When God is alone in heaven, He has no relationship with us and cannot be enjoyed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In such a condition, He can only be called God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But when He dispenses Himself into us for us to eat and enjoy, then He can be called life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Life comes out of God, and life is God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we understand these words, we will know why the Lord said to the Jews, I am the living bread which came down out of heaven John 6:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is the God who existed from the beginning, and He stepped into time to be obtained and enjoyed by man on the earth and to fill up man s hunger for satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>THE LORD BEING THE BREAD OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord is the bread of life, and He is life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we eat steamed rice, we are not eating rice grains that have been taken directly from a rice bag or a rice bin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Steamed rice is rice grains that have been cooked, prepared, and placed on a table for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The One in heaven is actually the God in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One day He stepped out of eternity, like rice grains being poured out from a rice bag.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then He entered into time and came to the earth to become steamed rice on a table to be enjoyed by man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At this point, He is called life, and He is the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Gospel of Matthew records that a Canaanite woman came to the Lord and cried out, Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! but the Lord did not say a word to answer her.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>She tried again and said, Lord, help me!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord answered, It is not good to take the children s bread and throw it to the little dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although this Canaanite woman was a Gentile, she was quite blessed and knew God, so she replied immediately, Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters table 15:22-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The bread on the table is for the children, but even little dogs eat crumbs that fall from the table.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This means that the Lord came down out of heaven as the bread of life for man to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Jewish land can be compared to the dining table, and the Jews were God s children, but they wasted their bread and threw it under the table.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They drove the Lord away from the land of the Jews toward the land of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Canaanite woman s word indicates that even though she was a dog, the Lord Jesus was not on the table but under the table so that she could eat and enjoy Him as bread.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>She admitted that she was a dog, but a dog also has its portion.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The bread under the table was her portion.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Because of this, the Lord praised her: O woman, great is your faith! v. 28 . Our God is not only the God of heaven; He is also the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Furthermore, He is not only the bread of life; He is also the crumbs that fall from the Jewish land so that He can inwardly satisfy us, the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If God does not have a relationship with man, He would remain high in the heavens where man could not touch Him or contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God would be God, and man would be man.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, God came down from heaven and came to the door of man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Now our God is the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When we open our heart to Him, He becomes our life as soon as He comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is the reason Paul says that Christ is our life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Life is God Himself.</S>
