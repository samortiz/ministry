   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SERPENTINE PEOPLE BECOMING CHRIST'S INCREASE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the early chapters of Genesis we see the serpent and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we read through the Bible in this light, we shall be able to see the story of the serpent and the bride in both the Old Testament and in the New.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Matthew 23:33 the Lord Jesus called the Pharisees "serpents, brood of vipers."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In John 3 the Lord Jesus indicated to Nicodemus, one of the Pharisees, that he also was serpentine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the Lord likened Himself to the brass serpent lifted up on a pole, He seemed to be saying to Nicodemus, "In Genesis 3 you all were bitten by the old serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then do you remember when the children of Israel were bitten by serpents in the wilderness, and they cried out to Moses?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord told Moses to make a brass serpent and lift it up on a pole.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nicodemus, everyone, including you, has been bitten by the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But as the brass serpent was lifted up on a pole, I shall be lifted up on the cross as your Substitute so that eternal life may be imparted into you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This eternal life will regenerate you and make you a new person to become part of the bride as My increase.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way, serpentine people can become My increase."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Adam, the old serpent gained us for himself by biting us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you know what it means for the serpent to bite us?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It means that he imparts the poison of his nature into us to make us his increase.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through the fall, the entire human race has become the increase of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you know what you were before you were saved?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You were a part of Satan's increase.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No matter what kind of person we were before we were saved, we were all part of the increase of that evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the serpent bit Adam in the garden of Eden, he gained the entire human race, and all of mankind became his increase.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No doubt, after he had bitten man in Genesis 3, Satan, the old serpent, was happy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He may have laughed and said to himself, "I have gained man for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The man created by God has now become my increase."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the Lord Jesus came to be the brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that He became sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Second Corinthians 5:21 says, "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sin came from Satan, entered into man Rom 5:12 , and made man not only a sinner but sin itself under God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, when Christ became a man in flesh John 1:14 , He was made sin not sinful on our behalf to be judged by God Rom 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For years I have taught according to the Bible that the sin which dwells in our flesh is the nature of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, some claim that it is heretical to teach this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But this certainly is not heretical, for the New Testament reveals that the sin in our flesh is the nature of Satan, the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to understand this, we need to put together John 3:14, 2 Corinthians 5:21, and Romans 8:3.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Romans 8:3 says that God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just as the brass serpent had the form of a real serpent but not the poisonous nature of a serpent, so Christ was in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God sent His Son in the form, the likeness, of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The brass serpent had the form of a serpent, and Christ had the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Actually, the very sin that dwells in our flesh is the serpent, the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not only the nature of the Devil; it is the Devil himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, as fallen people we all were part of Satan, his increase.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Praise the Lord that He came in the likeness of the flesh of sin and was nailed to the cross in the form of a serpent!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to Hebrews 2:14, through His death on the cross, Christ destroyed the Devil, the one who had the authority of death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This evil one is the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we put all these verses together, we can realize that when the Lord Jesus was lifted up on the cross, He was the brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As a result, the old serpent, the Devil, Satan, was destroyed through the death of Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ's death on the cross opened the way for us sinners to believe in Him and receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now we can receive His life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It was through His redemption that He imparted Himself into us to make us His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way we who were once the increase of Satan have become the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the past we were part of Satan's increase, but we praise the Lord that we have become part of the increase of Christ.</S>
