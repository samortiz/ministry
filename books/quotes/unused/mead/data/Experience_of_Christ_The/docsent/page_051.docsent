   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DOING ALL THINGS BY CHRIST AND IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you love the Lord, you need to practice doing everything in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You need to check whether you are doing things by yourself or by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the way to gain Christ and to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To eat properly we should take in one bite at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that every day, from morning until evening, we should practice living by Christ in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to do everything with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should be able to say, "From today onward, I shall quit doing things by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do not want to live by myself any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From now on I shall live by Him and do everything in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you do this, what a difference there will be in your daily living!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>TO LIVE BEING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The issue of practicing the secret of doing everything in Christ is that for us to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because we do all things in Christ, for us to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more we do things in Christ, the more we gain of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a genuine, absolute enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, not many Christians practice the secret of doing all things in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, they like to attend meetings and hear messages.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the only way to live is to live by doing everything in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the unique way to magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to magnify Christ, we need to live by Christ and do everything in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can do all things in Him who empowers us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, as long as we are in the car, everything is all right, for the car with the driver can take us where we need to go.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we are riding along in the car, we can enjoy a pleasant time of sight-seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Learn to be quiet in Christ, He never makes a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes, it may seem that He has made a mistake, but actually this is so that you may have a longer ride, enjoy more sight-seeing, and learn more lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Christian life surely is a wonderful life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As long as we do things in Christ, we shall experience Him, enjoy Him, and accumulate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the way to become rich in Christ and to have many rich experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we all are rich in Christ, the meetings will be full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For the recovery, we need to have a rich life in Christ to enrich all the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the responsibility not only of the elders, but of all the saints, even the youngest and newest ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all need to practice living by Christ and doing all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the secret that we all need to learn today.</S>
