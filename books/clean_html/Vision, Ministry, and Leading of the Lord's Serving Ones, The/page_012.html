<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE BURDEN<br />
AT ANY TIME AND IN ANY PLACE</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s serving ones must learn to receive a burden at any time and in any place. In Acts Paul often received a burden. Verse 36 of chapter 15 says, &ldquo;Now after some days Paul said to Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brothers in every city in which we announced the word of the Lord, and see how they are doing.&rdquo; Then 17:16 says, &ldquo;While Paul was waiting...in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld that the city was full of idols.&rdquo; Therefore, he wanted to preach the gospel in Athens.</p>
<p>Many of the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones today do not know how to receive a leading or a burden. The Lord&rsquo;s leading may be present, but they do not have a clear sense of it. This is wrong. Every serving one of the Lord must endeavor to exercise to sense even the smallest burden.</p>
<p>Sometimes I see some saints who are in need of help, but the serving ones around them act as though they see nothing and as if the situation of the saints is none of their concern. As serving ones of the Lord, we need to practice heeding the feeling within us so that we can receive a burden when we see a need. If our sense is not keen in this way, we will not have much of a future in serving the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MOVEMENT IN THE WORK<br />
BEING DIRECTED BY SENIOR ONES</h2>
<p>There is a major principle involved in the movement of brothers together in the work: All our movement in the work should be directed by senior brothers. For example, when Paul went out to work, he did not go out by himself but with other co-workers, including Barnabas, Silas, and later Timothy and Titus. Paul had at least four or five co-workers. Nevertheless, Paul did not have a group discussion whenever there was a need to move. Paul&rsquo;s co-workers moved according to Paul&rsquo;s arrangement and determination. Paul took the lead among his co-workers in making various arrangements. When he wanted Luke to stay, Luke stayed (2 Tim. 4:11); when he sent Timothy, Timothy would go (Acts 17:15; 1 Cor. 4:17). This is a major principle in work: God desires that there be one head in the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>When a man and a woman marry, only one head is visible at the wedding; the other is covered. If there is more than one head in a marriage, it will be a dreadful marriage. Whether in the past or in the present, whether here or in other places, women cover their heads when they marry. In a Chinese wedding only the man&rsquo;s head is exposed. A person with one body and two heads would be a monster.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s government there should be only one head in the work&mdash;one head whether twenty co-workers are going out and one head whether two co-workers are going out. Peter took the lead among those working with him, and Paul took the lead among those working with him. God does not allow either a &ldquo;dictatorship&rdquo; or a &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; in the work. God only wants those who belong to Him to live in the Holy Spirit. In the worldly realm there is dictatorship, and there is also democracy, but in the church there is neither dictatorship nor democracy; there is only our learning to live in the Lord. When brothers and sisters are together, one or two must take the lead, but they should not dictate. Instead, they should make decisions based on the feelings that come from the brothers and sisters with them through fellowship.</p>
<p>It would be wrong if the brothers working in Hualien called meetings to vote on everything. The proper way to make a decision is to meet together, pray together, and discuss things together. However, a final decision should be made by the leading brothers based on the feelings of the saints. Once a decision has been made, the other brothers and sisters should learn to obey.</p>
<p>When Paul sent Timothy to Thessalonica (1 Thes. 3:2), Timothy did not say, &ldquo;I have to wait for the Lord&rsquo;s leading myself,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I will pray about it myself and see.&rdquo; Whenever Paul sent Timothy, Timothy would go; whenever Paul sent Luke, Luke would go. A co-worker&rsquo;s move in the work has to be based on submission to the leading ones in the work. God never lets anyone speak, move, or work freely in His work. When co-workers move freely, there is chaos.</p>
<p>If the Lord establishes someone as a leading one in the work, he should learn to know God&rsquo;s leading and God&rsquo;s intention in all the co-workers and then make an accurate judgment. This is a necessary qualification for being a leading one. However, if we are not a leading one according to the Lord&rsquo;s arrangement, we need to learn to obey the leading ones. Otherwise, the work will fall apart and be chaotic.</p>
<p>This requires us to be spiritual. If a co-worker is not spiritual, he cannot lead the work, and if a co-worker has not learned the lessons, accepted the dealings, been subdued or broken, it will be difficult for him to obey others. There is authority and order in God&rsquo;s government; He does not want chaos.</p>
