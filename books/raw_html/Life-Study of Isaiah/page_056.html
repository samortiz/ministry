<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Return of the Restored Remnant of Israel</H2><P>Verses 11 through 16 speak of the return of the restored remnant of Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Lord, by His Hand, Recovering<br>the Remnant of His People Who Remain</H2><P>In that day the Lord, by His hand for the second time again, will recover the remnant of His people who remain, from Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the islands of the sea (v. 11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Lord Lifting Up a Standard to the Nations<br>and Gathering the Outcasts of Israel</H2><P>The Lord will lift up a standard to the nations and will gather the outcasts of Israel. The dispersed of Judah He will assemble from the four corners of the earth (v. 12). This standard which will be lifted up is Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Ephraim's Jealousy Departing,<br>and the Adversaries in Judah Being Cut Off</H2><P>Ephraim's jealousy will depart, and the adversaries in Judah will be cut off. Ephraim (the northern kingdom) will not be jealous of Judah (the southern kingdom), nor will Judah be hostile to Ephraim (v. 13). The Lord will take away the divisive factor, and the two kingdoms will become one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Flying Down upon the Shoulders<br>of the Philistines on the West</H2><P>The restored remnant of Israel will fly down upon the shoulders of the Philistines on the west. Together they will plunder the children of the east. Edom and Moab will come into the grasp of their hand, and the children of Ammon will submit to them (v. 14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Jehovah Utterly Destroying the Tongue of Egypt</H2><P>Jehovah will utterly destroy the tongue of Egypt. Also, He will wave His hand over the Euphrates with the scorching of His wind, and He will strike it into seven streams and march men through it dryshod (v. 15). At present, the Euphrates River is a great separation and frustration to Israel. But for the sake of the return of His scattered people to the Holy Land, the Lord will cause this river to become small streams through which the people will easily be able to walk.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. There Being a Highway from Assyria<br>for the Remnant of Jehovah's People Who Remain</H2><P>According to verse 16, there will be a highway from Assyria for the remnant of Jehovah's people who remain, as there was for Israel in the day that they came up from the land of Egypt. In the restoration, God will do all these things to make it convenient for the children of Israel to be gathered back to the land of their fathers.</P>
