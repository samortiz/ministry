   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HE IS THE WATER OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we come to John 7, we see the last day of a great feast.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jesus spoke some words in front of those who were attending the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"On the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Just imagine: on one of our busy festive holidays, I, Watchman Nee, stand up in the midst of a crowd and shout, "If you are thirsty, come to me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He who believes in me, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You would surely say that I am a senseless fool from Shanghai who is talking nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But that was exactly what Jesus did and said.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There was really no doctrine; there was just the person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On that day when Jesus spoke those words, a dispute arose among the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some said that this truly had to be the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Others reasoned how Christ could come out of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In trying to answer who this man was, an argument arose among the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The argument centered around one thing: who was this Jesus of Nazareth?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A genuine Christian is one who believes that Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>HE IS THE LIGHT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Further on in John 8:12, Jesus told the crowd, "I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You can see that again His words are not doctrinal.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The emphasis here is the "light" and the "I."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not the practice of His teachings that makes a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, it is a relationship with Christ that qualifies us as one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only by believing into Him will we receive the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only by receiving Him will we not walk in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>HE IS FROM ABOVE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 8:21-22 says, "He said therefore again to them, I am going away, and you will seek Me and will die in your sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Where I am going, you cannot come.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Jews then said, He is not going to kill Himself, is He, for He says, Where I am going, you cannot come?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Jews were confused again.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Where is the place He is going that we cannot go?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They thought that perhaps He was going to commit suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually if that place could be reached by committing suicide, the Jews could still get to it by killing themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How could the Lord go to a place to which they could not go?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 23 says, "And He said to them, You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is because of this that where the Lord was going they could not go.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>BELIEVING OR NOT BELIEVING THAT HE IS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, they did not die in their sins because they were murderers and adulterers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 24 is crucial, especially the latter half: "Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The King James Version added the word "he" after "I am."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let us quote the words of the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord said, "You will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The question is whether or not you believe that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It means that of the millions of people in humanity, you can pick out one and say, "This is He!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is God!"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We want to examine Jesus of Nazareth to see if He indeed is!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we believe that He is, we will not die in our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many are believing in a distorted Christianity, but we want to believe according to what Christianity really is.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first question we must ask is whether or not Jesus of Nazareth is.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once again the Jews retorted by asking, "Who are You?" v. 25 . Jesus' answer seemed to say, "This is not the first time that I tell you who I am.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Concerning this matter I have never given in. I told you that I am; I am the One." Time after time He proved to others that He is; He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>THE ESSENCE OF OUR FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is the purpose of Christ's works?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is to bring man to believe that He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In John 9 Christ gave sight to one who was born blind.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Pharisees started another argument about this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They summoned the one who was healed and asked him all kinds of questions.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After getting nothing out of his answers, they drove him out.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Later the Lord met him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He asked the healed person only one question: "Do you believe into the Son of God?" v. 35 . He answered, "Who is He, Lord, that I may believe into Him?" v. 36 . "Jesus said to him, You have both seen Him, and He is the One speaking with you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>And he said, Lord, I believe; and he worshipped Him" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Nothing is clearer than this.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>His work is just to bring men to realize who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He never let go of the fact that He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the essence of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It declares that Jesus is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>ONLY THIS ONE POINT</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we read the Gospel of John through, we will find that every passage concerns this one point: Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In John 10 the Jews surrounded Him and said, "How long will you hold our soul in suspense?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you are the Christ, tell us plainly" v. 24 . The question still hung on this one point.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>How did Jesus answer?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He said, "I told you, and you do not believe...You do not believe, because you are not of My sheep" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>All who do not believe that Jesus is the Son of God, that He is God incarnated as a man, are not Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Those who do not recognize Him as the Son of God do not have the life of Christ in them; they are not His sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Upon this issue stands the whole basis of the Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In John 11 Jesus said again, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live" v. 25 . Can a common mortal utter such words?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>GOD HINGES ON HIM</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In John 12 Jesus cried out aloud, "He who believes into Me does not believe into Me, but into Him who sent Me; and he who beholds Me beholds Him who sent Me. I have come as a light into the world, that every one who believes into Me would not remain in darkness" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>44-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You can see that the One who sent Him hinges on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>To believe into Him is to believe into the One who sent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>To see Him is to see the One who sent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The light also hinges on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>To be in the light is to believe into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Everything hinges on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Then in John 14 the Lord said, "Do not let your heart be troubled; believe into God, believe also into Me" v. 1 . He wants us to believe into Him in the same way that we believe into God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The one thing He always insists upon is the demand to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>John 15 speaks of some who hate the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He said, "He who hates Me hates My Father also" v. 23 . Once again He reveals that He and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>NOT BELIEVING IN HIM IS A SERIOUS SIN</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In John 16, the Lord said that one day the Holy Spirit would come and convict the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Why concerning sin?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The explanation is in verse 9: "Concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me," because they do not believe that He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is a sin, a very serious sin.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When the Holy Spirit comes, He will convict men, and they will realize how serious a sin it is not to believe in Jesus being the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>One further passage in the Gospel of John will suffice.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>17:3: "And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Here we are shown what eternal life is.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The Lord's definition of eternal life is to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Believing in the eternal God and believing in His sent One Jesus Christ is eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Eternal life hinges upon this person.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I hope that we would all realize who Jesus of Nazareth is.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Our faith does not have any empty doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It is based on the fact that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>To receive Jesus Christ is to receive God.</S>
