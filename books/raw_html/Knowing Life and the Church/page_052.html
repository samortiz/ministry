 <h2 class="head2">Noah Serving God according to God&rsquo;s Command</h2>
<p>Noah did not build an ark because he had a dream and then became zealous. Genesis shows that Noah did not have such a thought or idea at any time. Rather, God came to Noah one day and told him to build an ark. This was the origin of the building of the ark (Gen. 6:14&mdash;7:5). The building of the ark was not even in Noah&rsquo;s consideration; neither could he imagine that a flood would come one hundred and twenty years later. Even the measurements and methods of building the ark were not according to Noah&rsquo;s imagination but to God&rsquo;s determination (6:14-16). This shows that Noah&rsquo;s service was of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Abraham Serving God<br />
according to God&rsquo;s Appearing</h2>
<p>Let us continue with Abraham. Did Abraham serve and worship God because his fathers served and worshipped God? Did he serve and worship according to the traditions of his fathers? No, the Bible shows that Abraham was from the land of the Chaldeans, who were involved with idols (11:31; Josh. 24:2). Later he left his country, a land of idolatry. Abraham, however, did not leave voluntarily; neither did he initiate the move. While he was still living on the other side of the river and worshipping idols like the Gentiles, God came to him and called him, saying, &ldquo;Go from your land / And from your relatives / And from your father&rsquo;s house&rdquo; (Gen. 12:1). Abraham had no thought of leaving; rather, he was urged to leave by God who came to call him. All the moves in Abraham&rsquo;s life reveal the particular characteristic of Jehovah&rsquo;s appearing. God&rsquo;s appearing was the motivation for all of Abraham&rsquo;s actions. All his actions were controlled by God&rsquo;s appearing. Except for his going down to Egypt and falling (12:9&mdash;13:4), all his actions were accepted by God because they were of God as a result of His appearing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Moses Serving God according to God&rsquo;s Instruction for the Deliverance of the Children of Israel</h2>
<p>Moses feared and knew God, and he was very zealous for the children of Israel because he was educated by his family. He even struck an Egyptian for the Israelites (Exo. 2:7-12). According to the record in the Bible, however, all these things were useless to God. Moses was dealt with by God in the wilderness for a period of forty years to the extent that all his human capabilities were taken from him. At this point he had no interest in any of man&rsquo;s intentions or in any religious activity. Being nearly eighty years of age, he surely must have wondered whether he could do anything other than shepherd a flock. He no longer thought of worshipping God or of delivering the children of Israel. To him, these things meant nothing.</p>
<p>When he felt that everything was over, however, God came to him and called him, saying, &ldquo;I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt&rdquo; (3:10). God came to send Moses. Moses&rsquo; deliverance of the children of Israel did not originate from himself but from God. Furthermore, all his actions related to the deliverance of the children of Israel were according to God&rsquo;s instruction. The actions of the children of Israel, such as slaughtering the lambs, keeping the passover, and crossing the Red Sea, did not come from Moses&rsquo; imagination or idea but from God&rsquo;s instruction. God personally led the children of Israel through every station they passed.</p>
<p>When Moses came to the foot of Mount Sinai for the building of the tabernacle, he followed the pattern God showed him on the mountain; no deviation was permitted (ch. 40). This shows that genuine service can come only from God, not from us. Anything that comes from us is a religious activity; only that which comes from God is service according to revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">David Fearing God, Cooperating with God,<br />
and Letting God Work</h2>
<p>Now we should consider David who truly believed in God. He overcame all enemies by trusting in God&rsquo;s grace, and he was made king and lived a peaceful life in the palace. Looking at his situation, he felt that he owed something to God because he lived in such a good palace while God dwelt only in the tabernacle. He felt that this was unfair to God, so he was zealous to build a temple for God (2 Sam. 7:1-3). Did God accept David&rsquo;s idea? His desire to care for God and love God was accepted by God, but his intention and determination to build a house were rejected by God, who immediately sent Nathan the prophet to David to ask, &ldquo;Is it you who will build Me a house for Me to dwell in?&rdquo; (v. 5). God rejected David&rsquo;s good intention.</p>
<p>No matter related to our service to God should be determined by us. It is right for us to love God, but God does not want us to think about doing something for Him. Our heart to serve Him is acceptable, but our decision to do something for Him is not acceptable. God said, &ldquo;Is it you...?&rdquo; God does not want us to decide anything on His behalf. It was not up to David to decide whether or not to build the temple. Nothing should be initiated by us; only God can initiate something. God replied to David, &ldquo;Jehovah declares to you that Jehovah will make you a house&rdquo; (v. 11), as if to say, &ldquo;David, you do not know what you are saying when you speak of building Me a house. It is I who will build you a house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David was one who truly feared God. He was not like some Christians today who build a &ldquo;church&rdquo; whenever they please. Such people think that as long as they have money and a heart, they can do what they want when they want. In David, however, we see one who feared God. Although he had the opportunity, saw the need, and had the ability to build the temple for God, he stopped. The building of the temple seemed necessary, just as preaching the gospel seems good. However, if something is initiated by man, God will say, &ldquo;Slow down.&rdquo; When man&rsquo;s initiation ceases, God initiates and gives a command.</p>
<p>When we read the Bible, we must see the light in these examples. In the matter of service, no one can initiate anything for God. There is no limit to how much we should love God or turn our heart toward Him. What God demands of us is our love and our heart, but we cannot overstep the boundaries. We can love Him and consider Him but not decide what to do next. God is the One who decides, and we must wait. When He gives a command, we can work. We should love God and wait for His command; we should seek His will and wait for His revelation. Just as the slaves in the Old Testament loved their masters and allowed their ears to be bored through with an awl to a doorpost, we must focus on waiting for our Master&rsquo;s command (Exo. 21:6).</p>
<p>Many Christians not only love God but also love people, the world, and their family. When they become zealous for God, they immediately desire to do things for God. This is the situation in today&rsquo;s Christianity. The confusion in Christianity is not caused by lukewarm ones but by zealous ones. Out of their zeal for God, they build one chapel after another; out of their love for God, they establish one school after another. The confusion in Christianity would be less if fewer Christians loved God; the confusion in Christianity increases as more Christians love God. It is right to love God, but in spite of a proper love for God, many Christians are walking on the wrong way. We should only love God; we should not initiate anything for God.</p>
<p>I truly admire David&rsquo;s condition before God. If David did not fear God, after listening to Nathan&rsquo;s word, he might have thought, &ldquo;What are you talking about? I am in the palace; I have both money and authority. There is a need, and I want to cooperate by taking action. Is this not God&rsquo;s will?&rdquo; He might have said to Nathan, &ldquo;I know that you are a prophet, but does only your speaking count? Does no other speaking count?&rdquo; Because David feared God, however, he did not react to Nathan; rather, he stopped. It is not a small thing to stop. The act of stopping the building of the temple is a great matter.</p>
<p>Sister M. E. Barber said, &ldquo;Whoever cannot stop working for the sake of God cannot work for the sake of God.&rdquo; This is a good word of experience. David knew that God needed a temple, but when God&rsquo;s word came to him, he immediately stopped his work. His stopping was not related to need or ability; rather, he stopped because God did not want him to work. The ability of David not to work for God shows his spirituality. If we were David, could we have stopped? Opportunities will come, but God&rsquo;s word may also come, saying, &ldquo;Do not do anything. Slow down. Change your plan. Only My decision counts.&rdquo; Many who are zealous for God cannot hear such a word. This is the reason many workers of God cannot work for God. May God open our eyes.</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s stopping established a twofold testimony in the universe. First, all the work in the universe should come from God, not from man. Second, all that matters is what God does for man, not what man does for God. David wanted to build a temple for God, but God said that He would build a house for David from which a kingdom would come forth. Even after God spoke this word to David, he fell twice. First, he murdered Uriah and usurped his wife Bath-sheba (2 Sam. 11:2-17, 26-27). Second, he numbered the children of Israel (24:1-10). It is amazing that after the murder of Uriah, Bath-sheba bore David a son, Solomon, and after David was chastised by God for numbering the people, he offered sacrifices on a piece of land, as instructed by God, which later became the site for the building of the temple (vv. 18-25; 1 Chron. 21:1; 2 Chron. 3:1).</p>
<p>The son and the site for the building of the temple both came out of David&rsquo;s being forgiven of his sins. Those who can see this will bow their head and worship God, saying, &ldquo;It is not we who can do something for You, but You who does something for man.&rdquo; We must learn deep within that God wants only our cooperation; He does not need us to do anything for Him. Even if we could do something for God, He does not need it; He needs only our cooperation. We must stop all our opinions, decisions, and ideas; we need to let Him speak, let Him come in, and let Him command. All we need to do is cooperate with Him.</p>
