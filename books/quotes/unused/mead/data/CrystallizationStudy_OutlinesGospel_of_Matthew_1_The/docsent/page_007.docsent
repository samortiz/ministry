   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The requirements of the highest standard of morality can be met only by the Father s life, not by our natural life Matt 5:48: The kingdom of the heavens is the highest demand, and the life of the Father is the highest supply to meet this demand.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As God s species, we should not only love others; we should be love because God is love 1 John 4:8.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only one kind of love is genuine, and that is the love which comes out of God s dispensing Rom 8:39, 35; 15:30; 5:5: When love as the nature of God s essence is dispensed into us, we become love in the sense of being constituted with God, who is love 1 John 4:16.</S>
