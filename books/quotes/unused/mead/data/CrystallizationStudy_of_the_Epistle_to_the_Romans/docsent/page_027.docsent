   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>H. The Household of Faith</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The believers are the believing ones in Christ, who are the household of faith Gal 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the universe there are many houses with many households.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But there is one particular house with millions of members.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That is the house of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We belong to this house.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a big family, and the family name is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the home of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may say that a certain home is the Smith home or the Lee home.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we are all members of the faith home.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are believers, who do not believe nonsensical things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We believe in the word, and the word has three stages: the written word, the living word, and the applied word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Over two thousand years ago, there was only the written word, not the living word, because Christ was not here yet.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today we have the living word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without Christ as the living word, it was very hard for God s word to become the applied word as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is because before Christ came, the Spirit was mostly objective; He was not yet within God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before Christ, the Spirit of God was upon God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But today we have the Triune God embodied in Christ and realized as the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit indwelling us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, when we touch the Bible, right away the Bible can become living and applied.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are the members of the family, the household, of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This faith house is a house that believes in God through His word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hebrews 1 says that God has spoken v. 2 . This word becomes the living word, Christ, and this living word is applied by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we have the Triune God as the word in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I. The Believers Faith in Christ Bringing Them</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>into the Life Union with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The believers faith in Christ brings them into the life union with Christ John 3:15, 36 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is my point in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In just thirty-three and a half years, from Christ s incarnation to His resurrection, great things were accomplished in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The worldly people do not see these things, but thank God for His mercy to mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whatever took place in these thirty-three and a half years as great things has been written in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today when we read the New Testament, we have to see all these great things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The New Testament begins with a genealogy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Matthew 1:1 says, The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is Christ s incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first great thing that was accomplished in the whole universe was God s incarnation, God s becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then there was His living for thirty-three and a half years, recorded in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How great this was!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then He entered into death, passed through death, came out of death, and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Lord s recovery, we have published thousands of messages on these things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Three results came out of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First, He, the only begotten Son of God, became the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29 , indicating many sons of God are following.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>So the second thing is that millions of us, the believers, were born with Him 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was born as the firstborn Son of God, and we were born as the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are His twins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Third, this One, who was the Only Begotten becoming the Firstborn with many twins, became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , and this life-giving Spirit is the consummation and aggregate of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Out of this consummation of the Triune God, the church came into being, and the church as the house of God is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God which consummates in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The New Jerusalem will remain in the new heaven and new earth as a city expressing God for eternity in divinity mingled with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is our New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we read the New Testament, we read these things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more we read, the more we contact the written word of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then we have Christ as the living word and the Spirit as the applied word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The word of God is embodied in Christ and realized in the Spirit to be our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This faith brings us into the life union with Christ, who is the embodiment of God realized as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Faith links us with the Triune God.</S>
