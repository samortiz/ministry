   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 The God of Abraham the Father</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's calling to Abraham was the work of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Abraham's original name was Abram which means "an exalted father," and the name Abraham, that replaced this name, means "the father of a great multitude."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Both of these names have the basic thought of the father.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first in the Triune God is the Father, and Abraham was the first of the called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Abraham was the father of the called ones, and the first of the Triune God is also the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Father is the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is also the source of plan and purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God the Father had a plan, a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because He had a purpose, He selected and predestinated in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, in time, the Father came in to call, justify, accept, and care for the called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God the Father's work is to select, predestinate, call, justify, accept, and take care of the called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both selection and pre-destination precede the matter of calling.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you read Romans 9:11, you will see that these two items are found with Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, in Abraham we see nearly all of the experiences that are related to God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>2 The God of Isaac the Son</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Isaac was the son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is very interesting to see that the second of the Triune God is also the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is a son?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A son is one who comes out of the father, who inherits all that the father is and has, and who accomplishes all that the father desires.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you look at Isaac's history, you will find that he was just like this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was out of the father, he inherited everything of the father, and he worked to accomplish his father's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the experience of Isaac, the experience which fits the second of the Triune God, God the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus, as the Son of God, came out of the Father John 16:28 , inherited all that the Father is and has John 16:15 , and accomplished all the Father's will John 6:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Isaac's life corresponds to His.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>3 The God of Jacob the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we come to Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jacob, a subtle supplanter, needed more than just the experience of the calling and the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He mainly needed the dealings to transform him from a man in the flesh to a man in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So, it is very meaningful that the third of the Triune God is the Spirit who worked upon the subtle, supplanting Jacob to discipline and transform him into a prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here, in Jacob, we see regeneration, discipline, transformation, and the growth and maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All of this is the work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So the God of Jacob should be God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Respective Experiences of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob Being Three Aspects of a Complete One</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the transfer of race began with Abraham, passed through Isaac, and was completed with Jacob, so their experiences should be considered as one complete experience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is implied that the three were one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Triune God considered them as members of a corporate man for His dealings and for Him to be their God in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The last thirty-nine and a half chapters of Genesis are a biography of a corporate person composed of three plus one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we add together all the different aspects of the experiences of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob including Joseph, we see a clear picture of the complete experience of the called ones.</S>
