<h1 class="title">Becoming a Garden to Christ</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S.S. 4:12-5:1; 6:2-3</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Through her living in Christ&rsquo;s ascension as the new creation in resurrection, the lover of Christ becomes mature in the riches of the life of Christ so that she becomes a garden to Christ&mdash;4:12-15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Enclosed with a spring shut up and a fountain sealed for Christ&rsquo;s private enjoyment&mdash;v. 12.</li>
	<li>Full of the choicest fruit and the chief spices with their beauty and fragrance&mdash;vv. 13-14.</li>
	<li>Having a fountain and a well of living water, which are streams from the resurrection and ascension life&mdash;v. 15.</li>
	<li>She expects the cold north wind to awake and the hot south wind to come blowing upon her garden that her spices may flow forth&mdash;v. 16a.</li>
	<li>She wants her Beloved to come into His garden and eat His choicest fruit&mdash;v. 16b.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Beloved has come into His garden, which is His sister and bride&mdash;5:1; 6:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>He has gathered His myrrh with His spice&mdash;5:1a.</li>
	<li>He has eaten His honeycomb with His honey and drunk His wine with His milk&mdash;5:1b.</li>
	<li>He invites His beloved friends, the Triune God, to eat and drink deeply with Him&mdash;5:1c.</li>
	<li>He has gone down to the beds of spices to feed in the gardens (referring to the lover and other lovers of Christ) and gather lilies&mdash;6:2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>She realizes:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>That she is Christ&rsquo;s and that Christ is hers.</li>
	<li>That Christ pastures His churches among His seekers as lilies&mdash;6:3.</li>
	</ol></li>
