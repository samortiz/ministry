   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MARRIAGE AND THE GRACE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Peter 3:1-13 is still in the section concerned with a life in an excellent manner toward all men in all concerns 2:11 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this section we have already covered the living of the believers as pilgrims among the nations 2:11-12 , the believers being subject to every human institution 2:13-17 , the subjection of household servants to their masters 2:18-20 , and the model of Christ 2:21-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 3:1-7 Peter is concerned with marriage life, and in 3:8-13, with common life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Ephesians 5 Paul gives a word concerning married life that is familiar to every reader of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But Peter s writing concerning married life in 3:1-7 also has some very good points, even the topmost point.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The most outstanding point is what Peter says about a husband and wife being joint-heirs of the grace of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul does not say anything about the grace of life, much less about a married couple being joint-heirs, or co-heirs, of the grace of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 3:7 Peter says, The husbands, in like manner, dwelling together with them according to knowledge, assigning honor as to the weaker, female vessel, as also joint-heirs of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Peter wanted the husbands and wives to realize that they are heirs together, not of property or material possessions, but of the grace of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Perhaps you have been a Christian for many years and yet do not have any understanding of what Peter means by the grace of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some may not even know that there is such an expression in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christians are familiar with the grace of salvation or the grace of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, it is not even necessary for us to read the Bible in order to have the concept of the grace of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the term, the grace of life, is a uniquely biblical expression.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The problem is that, when we read about this, our mind may be veiled, or we may not pay adequate attention to this term.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By the Lord s mercy, we would place a proper emphasis on this matter so that we may all appreciate it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I hope that we all shall see the wonderful matter of the grace of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The grace of life is something real and substantial that we can inherit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not merely unmerited favor; it is solid, substantial, spiritual property that can be inherited by a husband and wife.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hallelujah for the grace of life!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have pointed out that in this Epistle Peter has much to say about grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 1:2 he says, Grace to you and peace be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Peter desired not only that grace be with the saints, but that grace be multiplied to them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>With the thought of multiplied grace as the base, Peter goes on in 4:10 to speak of varied grace: Each one according as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all should be good stewards of this varied grace in different aspects and of different categories.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then in 5:10 Peter speaks of the God of all grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, in 1 Peter we have four unique expressions concerning grace: multiplied grace, grace of life, varied grace, and all grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although Paul has a great deal to say concerning grace, he does not use the unique expressions Peter uses in his first Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I deeply appreciate what Peter says in this book concerning grace, in particular his word regarding the grace of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>WIVES TO BE SUBJECT TO THEIR HUSBANDS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us now go on to consider 3:1-7 verse by verse.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 1 says, In like manner, wives, subject yourselves to your own husbands, that even if any disobey the word, they will be gained without a word through the manner of life of their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The phrase in like manner refers to the subjection of the household servants to their masters, as described in 2:18.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, as a household servant submits himself to his master, so the wives should subject themselves to their own husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This kind of word is certainly contrary to the emphasis of the so-called women s liberation movement.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That movement is against the Bible, for it is against God s ordination in His creation with respect to male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Using Peter s expression 3:7 , God created the females weaker vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What country would use women as the main fighting force in the army?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Females are weaker physically and psychologically.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For this reason, it is easy for women to shed tears, which are often a sign of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, it is easy for a female to be troubled in her mind or emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All these are signs that the female is a weaker vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Like Peter, Paul teaches the submission of wives to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, unlike Peter, he does not tell us that females are weaker vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Concerning this matter, once again Peter uses a particular expression in pointing out that the females are weaker vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In verse 1 Peter charges the wives to be subject to their own husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul also did this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some women may find it easier to submit to someone else s husband instead of to their own husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Also, they may appreciate another s husband more than they appreciate their own husband.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even in the church life sisters may find it easier to subject themselves to a brother other than their own husband.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The reason for this is that the wives know all the defects and shortcomings of their husbands, having lived with them in married life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But they do not know so much about the defects and shortcomings of others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the reason they may appreciate other brothers more than their own husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once a sister comes to know the defects and shortcomings of her husband, she may feel cheated.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Having had the concept that her husband was very nearly perfect, she may wonder if she has made a mistake in marrying him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the world, when wives come to this point, the result is often divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But by the Lord s grace Christian wives should subject themselves to their own husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Paul says that the husbands should love their own wives.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, in his word concerning married life, Peter does not tell the husbands to love their own wives.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>First he charges the wives to be subject to their own husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then he charges the husbands to dwell with their wives according to knowledge v. 7 .</S>
