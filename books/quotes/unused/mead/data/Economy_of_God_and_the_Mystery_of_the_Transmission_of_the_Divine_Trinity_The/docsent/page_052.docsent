   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Material Supply</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must learn to exercise faith especially in the matter of material supply.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is true that the church and the saints will follow the Lord's leading to supply us in love; nevertheless, we still have to learn to trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Consider Paul's case.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the one hand, he trusted in God, and God really supplied him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When he was in Thessalonica, the church in Philippi sent people "once and again" to supply his need Phil 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When he was working in Corinth, the brothers who came from Macedonia filled up his lack 2 Cor 11:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet on the other hand, when he was in Corinth, he also worked with his own hands as a tentmaker Acts 18:3; 1 Cor 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, he told the elders in the church in Ephesus, "You yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me" Acts 20:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we see a two-sided principle: on the one hand, Paul trusted in and received God's supply; on the other hand, he worked with his own hands to meet the needs of himself and his companions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He did not refuse the supply from the saints even though he made tents, nor did he give up his occupation even though he trusted in God completely.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is different from the way of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, whether we work by "making tents" to make money for our livelihood, or we serve full-time and receive the supply from the church and the saints, we have to learn to trust in God, believing that everything is planned by Him and trusting absolutely in His sovereign provision.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Second Corinthians 5:7 tells us that we walk not by appearance or sight but by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is to say that everything is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not complain, saying, "Since I have been serving full-time, there has been very little supply."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not have such murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whether we receive much support or little support, we have to trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This does not mean, however, that we simply trust in God and stop relying on the love and care of the church and the saints, even to the extent that when someone sends a monetary gift, we return the whole amount.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If this is the case, God will not supply us any longer, and there will not be any more manna descending.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The saints supply you because they love you, but if you think that they give because they look down on you and therefore you would rather starve than accept their offering, you are too proud.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you are this way, God will let you starve.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since you would not accept anything from others, God would not give you anything either.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is true.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So we have to see this two-sided principle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You should not murmur, saying that since your minimum living expenses require hundreds of dollars and you have received only a few dollars or even less for support only enough to buy something to drink to quench your thirst , you might as well give that money to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you have such an attitude, God sees this clearly and may allow you to continue receiving an amount that is only enough to buy something to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we should learn to have faith and not to murmur, trusting in the Lord's sovereignty and believing that we are in His hands and are living for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Stanza 1 of the Chinese version of Hymns, #473 says, "When one refuses all earthly bribe / And comes to live for God, / The boundless riches he receives / Are indescribable."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is said that the writer of this hymn is Catherine Booth-Clibborn, the daughter of the founder of the Salvation Army.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After singing this hymn, we should not say, "Where are the boundless riches'?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This hymn should say limited riches.'</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What good it is to have one dollar?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not enough even to pay for a bus ticket.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A gift of a thousand dollars would be more acceptable."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I believe that the author of this hymn might have often received a supply of only several British pence, yet she still had such great faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we must learn to have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not be proud and say, "I will not rely on the church or on the saints; I will learn to depend on God."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To depend on God in the matter of material supply is very practical, because God is truly trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, you should act properly and maintain a proper attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This requires much learning.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the Environment</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should exercise faith not only in dealing with our bodily illnesses and for meeting our material needs, but also for dealing with our environment in our service to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our environment is changeable and complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Regardless of whether or not we are Christians, we cannot live alone, apart from human society.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have relatives, neighbors, and friends, who all are a part of our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Suppose that the Lord would exercise His sovereignty and allow our neighbors to be either crazy people or activists, the children in the neighborhood to always quarrel and be very noisy, and the couples to fight continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If this were the case, how could we have peace?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we were to move to another location, the environment might be even worse.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sometimes when we hire a nanny to take care of our children, she turns out to be a poor nanny.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then when we change to another one, the new one turns out to be even worse.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is a Chinese colloquial saying: "A soldier goes and a sentry comes"; this means that when the military man leaves he is replaced by a policeman.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Regardless of how hard you try, you simply cannot find a good nanny.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It seems that all you can find are strange or peculiar ones.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is very interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Actually, in all these situations we have to see the Lord's sovereign authority behind the scene.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead of blaming the environment, we should believe in God and learn to trust in God's arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the one hand, we need to believe in God, while on the other hand, we need to deal with the environment by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not argue or complain.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, when you get on an airplane, do not fight for a good seat.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You need to trust in God and learn to rely on Him in both great things and small things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the lesson that we must learn.</S>
