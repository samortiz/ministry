   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN TRANSFORMATION A SEED IN THE PARABLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE TEN VIRGINS Scripture Reading: Matt 25:1-13; 24:40-42; Prov 20:27; Rom 9:21, 23-24</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we come to the parable of the ten virgins found in Matthew 25:1-13.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Something very basic is found in this parable, but for centuries Christians have not fully apprehended it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of all the parables in the book of Matthew, the parable of the ten virgins is the most mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If it were standing alone apart from the rest of the Bible, it would be impossible for us to understand this parable.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we have seen in a previous chapter, from the time of Matthew 13 the Lord no longer spoke about the kingdom in an open way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He began to speak in parables, in a mysterious way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Matthew 13:10-17 He gave the reason for speaking in parables: the religious people assumed that they were for God and that they knew the Scriptures, but actually they were not for God and did not understand the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, the Lord began to hide the kingdom from them, making it a mystery, and to reveal it to those who meant business with the Lord, to those who were poor in spirit and pure in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only those who are poor in spirit and pure in heart can apprehend the mysteries of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever the Lord speaks about the kingdom from Matthew 13 to the end of the book, He speaks in the way of a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We praise the Lord that today, by the revelation of the whole Scriptures, it is not difficult for us to understand this parable of the ten virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can have a proper, exact, and accurate interpretation of each point of this parable.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The parable of the ten virgins is actually like a jigsaw puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This jigsaw puzzle has been cut into many mysterious pieces, and we must find a way to collect all the pieces and put them together.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All of the pieces to this puzzle are hidden in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we know the way to find them and how to put them together, they will show us a clear picture of the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No other picture in the entire Bible shows us the economy of God as clearly as the parable of the ten virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>TEN IN NUMBER</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First we must discover why the Lord Jesus used the number ten.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why did He say ten virgins and not fifteen or twelve or eight or two?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps you may be thinking that the number ten signifies completion, such as ten fingers and ten toes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should recall that this parable concerns the kingdom of the heavens, whose number should be twelve and not ten.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The number of the kingdom must be twelve because in the Old Testament the number of the tribes of the people who were representatives of God's kingdom was twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Also, the number of the Apostles in the New Testament representing the whole people of God is twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The representative number of the people of the kingdom is twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the book of Revelation we see the ultimate consummation of God's economy, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the New Jerusalem the number twelve is used almost exclusively: there are twelve foundations, twelve gates, twelve pearls, twelve apostles, twelve tribes, and twelve varieties of fruit from the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is also the number 144, which is composed of twelve times twelve Rev 21:12, 14, 17, 19-21; 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, twelve is the proper number to represent God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the Bible, this number twelve is composed in a unique way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not composed of six plus six, seven plus five, or four plus eight.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is composed of four multiplied by three.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Revelation 21 verifies this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this chapter we see that the city is square, meaning that it has four equal sides 21:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On each side there are three gates, making a total of twelve 21:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The number four in the Bible signifies the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man is the leading creature in God's creation, and the number four represents man, including all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The number three has two meanings: it signifies both the Triune God and also resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, the number three denotes the Triune God in resurrection.</S>
