A Sacrifice as a Burnt Offering</h2><p>In Leviticus 17:8 the burnt offering is mentioned. The burnt offering signifies Christ as our burnt offering to God, by whose life we can live absolutely for God.<h2 class=head3>1. Offering at the Entrance of the Tent of Meeting</h2><p>The burnt offering was to be offered to Jehovah at the entrance of the tent of meeting (v. 9a). This signifies taking Christ as our burnt offering to God at the entrance of God&#8217;s dwelling place (the church).<h2 class=head2>2. The One Not Offering the Burnt Offering at the Entrance of the Tent of Meeting to Be Cut Off from the People</h2><p>Verse 9b tells us that the one who did not offer the burnt offering to Jehovah at the entrance to the tent of meeting was to be cut off from the people. To be cut off from the people signifies to be removed from the fellowship of God&#8217;s people. If we apply Christ as the burnt offering in a denominated place and not in the church, we shall be cut off from the proper fellowship of God&#8217;s people.<h2 class=head1>II. TAKING CARE OF THE BLOOD</h2><p>Leviticus 17:10-16 speaks of taking care of the blood. To take care of the blood is to take care of and to treasure the blood of Christ. Later we shall see that different bloods typify different beliefs. Every kind of blood signifies a belief. We should not take care of any blood other than the blood of Christ. There is only one kind of blood that we can drink (John 6:53-56), that is, receive, and that is the blood of Christ. Exodus 12 indicates this. The children of Israel were to sprinkle the blood of the Passover lamb on their doorposts (vv. 7,13). They were to accept only that blood.<h2 class=head2>A. The Blood, in Which Is the Life of the Flesh, Being Given by God to Make Propitiation on the Altar for the Souls of God&#8217;s People</h2><p>&#8220;For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make propitiation for your souls; for it is the blood which, by the life, makes propitiation&#8221; (Lev. 17:11). This signifies that the blood of the Lord Jesus was shed on the cross for our redemption.<h2 class=head2>B. The Blood of a Hunted Animal or Bird to Be Covered with Earth</h2><p>&#8220;Any man of the sons of Israel, or of the aliens who sojourn among you, who takes in hunting an animal or bird that may be eaten, shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth&#8221; (v. 13). This signifies that all the blood other than the blood of the Lord Jesus that man can obtain cannot redeem us from our sins and should be buried. To bury is to give up, to abandon, to reject. We reject all other bloods; we &#8220;bury&#8221; them. The only blood we accept and treasure is the blood of Jesus shed on the cross as the altar.<h2 class=head2>C. The Blood of That Which Dies of Itself or Which Is Torn by Beasts Not Being Good for Eating</h2><p>Verse 15a speaks of &#8220;that which dies of itself or is torn by beasts.&#8221; As with the other verses in chapter seventeen, we need to understand this typologically.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_165.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_167.html">Next</a> </body></html>
