   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE BOUNDARY OF THE LOCAL ASSEMBLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Tonight we will discuss the mutual relationship between the meeting in Gordon Lane and that in Wen-teh Lane.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In other words, we will speak on the boundary of the local church or the extent of the border of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before we speak on this matter, there are a few things which we need to explain to the brothers from out of town.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our Bible study, at this moment, is designed especially for the local brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, many of the things that are covered are local in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, we welcome the out-of-town brothers to come and listen.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I have mentioned three to five times already that the authority of the elders is for the local assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words, the elders are for the local assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Position is a matter related to the local church, and office is also a matter related to the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One can be an elder in Shanghai, but he cannot automatically be an elder when he goes to Nanking or Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A person who serves as an elder in the assembly in Shanghai cannot go to the assembly in Peking and assume the same eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's gifts are for the whole church, while His offices are for the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, there is no such thing as a super elder who can control an out-of-town church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>An elder can oversee only the church in his own locality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE BOUNDARY OF THE ASSEMBLY</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible study tonight is on the boundary of the assembly, and it is limited to the local assembly only.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We hope that God will show us this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because we are afraid of careless misunderstandings or forgetfulness, we will repeat once again what we have mentioned: gifts are for the whole church, while offices are for the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is the extent of a local church?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How big of an area constitutes the sphere of a local church?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We would draw the brothers' and sisters' attention to the fact that in the Bible, the church is never divided into regions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible never groups a few churches together under a regional organization.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although there were seven churches in Asia, we do not see the Bible appointing Ephesus or Philadelphia to rule over the other six churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We only see seven churches, with seven lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These seven lampstands represent the seven churches Rev 1:12, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Old Testament, one lampstand was divided into seven branches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the New Testament, there are seven lampstands, not one lampstand with seven branches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that the seven different churches are shining by themselves and each one is responsible to Christ by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every church is governed by Christ alone and is not under the control of any other church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In administration, every lampstand is independent and not under the control of any other lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every one of them is responsible to the Son of Man alone, who walks in the midst of the seven lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They are responsible only to their High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No church is responsible to another church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although they are seven churches, they have not joined themselves to become one united church, and they are not responsible to some higher synod or convention.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Each one of them is a so-called congregation, an assembly whose boundary is the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible takes the city or the smallest administrative unit as the boundary of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A local church is the basic unit of the church in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No local church is joined to another church or regards another bigger church as the central church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words, in God's eyes, Rome has never been appointed to be the central church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has never acknowledged one place as the center of all churches, with that place ruling over and controlling all the other assemblies.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to God's organization, there is no center on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Jerusalem was not the central church at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This does not mean that there are no regions in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some places have similar conditions and needs, and they are treated according to the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Acts 19 Paul "passed through the upper districts" v.1 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Romans 15 Paul said that he traveled "from Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum" v.19 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These places belong to one region.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Galatia was not an individual city but a province.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is why the Bible mentions "the churches of Galatia" Gal 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Revelation mentions "the seven churches which are in Asia" 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea were all in the region of Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Asia was a region, and Galatia was a province.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to be clear that even though the needs and testimony of these local assemblies are peculiarly similar, no church possessed a higher organization or authority over the other local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Bible never shows us that any local assembly possesses a higher authority than another assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some have thought that Jerusalem was a mother church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Actually, there is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every local assembly is local in its administration and responsible to Christ alone; it is not responsible to any other institution or assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Putting it another way, a local church is the only organization in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To put it still another way, a local church is the highest organization and institution on earth; nothing is lower than it on earth, and nothing is higher.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is no court above the local church to which one can appeal.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The highest organization is the local assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The smallest unit is also the local assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Bible does not tell us of a center like Rome, which controlled everything of the churches, because Christ wants to retain His headship in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Every local church should maintain the testimony of the Body and express the Body of Christ in a miniature way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, every local church should be directly responsible to Christ and not to other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This means every local church should only be regulated by Christ and not be controlled by any other institutions or churches.</S>
