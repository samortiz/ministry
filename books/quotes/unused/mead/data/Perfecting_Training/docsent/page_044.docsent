   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S DESIRE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We know that the entire desire of the Triune God is to work Himself into you that you may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s desire is that you live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God created you in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we can understand Genesis 1:26.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God created us in His image and after His likeness because His desire was just to put Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have repeated this kind of word for many, many years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1950 I went to the Philippines, and right after my arrival, I began to speak concerning the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today I am much clearer concerning the mingling of God with man than I was thirty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God created us in His image and after His likeness because He wants to work Himself into us to be our life and to be our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He even wants to work Himself into us to be our disposition, our character, our living.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First He becomes your life, then your nature, then your disposition, eventually even your character and your living.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>So you live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the central thought of the divine revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the life pulse of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The situation among Christians today is altogether too poor.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not only do they not know that God wants to put Himself into them to be their living, their character, their disposition, and their nature, they don t even know He wants to be their life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What they have is simply an objective religious God in a remote place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Most of them just have God as an object of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They just have a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But this is not the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible says abide in Me and I in you John 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If anyone loves Me, My Father and I will go to him, not just to have a visit, but to make our abode with him John 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then it says Christ lives in me Gal 2:20 , and even the more Christ will make His home in me Eph 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is Spirit John 4:24 , and we are one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have a clear picture in the Bible that we are a vessel made in God s shape, God s image, in God s likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And through Christ passing through so many processes, He has entered into our being and made us one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For what purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That we may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He comes into us to be our life, our nature, our disposition, our character, and our living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to remember these five things: life, nature, disposition, character, and living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He first becomes our life, and He wants to travel through three things our nature, our disposition, and our character to become our living.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He needs to become our disposition, our nature, our character, and eventually our living.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Life is different from nature, and nature is different from disposition, and disposition is different from character.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Disposition is something within, and character is something expressed with your disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The life implies the nature, and the nature implies the disposition, and the disposition expresses the character.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All this added together is just your daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the Bible I can say strongly that the Triune God today should be not only our life but also our nature, our disposition, our character, and eventually and ultimately, our living.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>So we have to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How could this objective God become our life subjectively?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And how could He become our nature not only subjectively but very intrinsically?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He becomes our nature, and then He becomes our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I like to see your disposition changing year after year because God is being subjectively and intrinsically added to your disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>FOUR STRONG CHARACTERS</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the New Testament we have four strong pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have Paul, Peter, John, and James.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These are four big characters.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the four Gospels you could see Peter s old disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was not Peter, it was Simon.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But when Peter wrote First and Second Peter you could see a kind of Petrine disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is quite different from Paul s, but both are quite divine.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The third is the old apostle John.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When he wrote the Gospel of John and the book of Revelation you can hardly find any trace of the old disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You just see a kind of disposition that is transformed and becoming very divine.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>James also has his kind of disposition which may not be as shiny as John s. They are all precious but in different degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It was Paul who said: To me to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God s desire is to be our life, our nature, our disposition, our character, and our living.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At least God could succeed in these few persons.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Not even the angels could deny that God succeeded in Paul, Peter, John, and James.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There are four people with such a history that God became man s life, man s nature, man s disposition, man s character, and man s daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How could this be?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You must realize all four of these assimilated God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They absorbed God all their life by two things: by the divine Word and the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Actually the very subjective God becomes our portion by these two things: the Word and the Spirit.</S>
