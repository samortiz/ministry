We desire to touch Yourself as the life-giving Spirit, as the transforming Spirit, as the glorifying Spirit, as the Lord Spirit
We thank You and worship You for these two spirits, the divine Spirit and the human spirit mingled together as one spirit
The God-men, as the regenerated children of God, constitute the new man, as the new creation of God, with the divine life
The God-men, as the spiritual household of God, build up the Body of Christ, as the Triune God's organism, with the transforming life
The God-men, as the royal priesthood of God, struggle to be the overcomers, as God's Zion in Jerusalem, with the reigning life
The God-men, as the chosen race of God, consummate the New Jerusalem, as God's eternal expression, with the glorifying life
A God-man who knows the excellent Christ should live a life conformed to the death of Christ by the power of His resurrection
A God-man who has Christ living in him should live Christ and magnify Christ by the bountiful supply of His Spirit
In the same principle, although we cannot find the term the God-men in the Bible, the fact, the reality, of the God-men is in the Bible
He is the model God-man, the prototype for the producing of many God-men , including all the dear saints throughout the world
Regardless of our nationality, and regardless of whether we are male or female, young or old, we all must believe that we are God-men
Although we are of different races and nationalities, by His mercy we have all become the same: we are all God-men
In Christianity there is a theology that tells people that we believers became sons of God not by birth but by adoption
It is a pity that the majority of regenerated people do not know that they have God's life in addition to their own life
In the same principle, we, the believers, have been grafted into Christ and are living in an organic union with Him
In such a union the human life and the divine life are joined as one so that they live together as one mingled life and one living
My burden in the Lord's ministry is not to build you up to be a nice man, a good man, or a gentle man, but to be a God-man
We must learn how to live not by our human life but by God's life mingling with our human life to make us divine
God has become man so that man may become God to produce a corporate God-man for the manifestation of God in the flesh as the new man
The Bible teaches that a man must be born of God to be a God-man, and this God-man must be raised up, must grow up
The God-men know how to build up themselves to be the Body of Christ for the manifestation of God and for the fulfillment of God's economy
On the one hand, the divine element was brought into our being, and on the other hand, Christ terminated our old nature on the cross
According to Ephesians 2:15, Christ used the Jews and the Gentiles as the materials in His creating of the new man
Christ created the new man by imparting the divine nature into the redeemed humanity of the believing Jews and Gentiles
Our becoming the new man was not merely a matter of our repenting and being sorry for our past and thereby becoming new
We usually consider that Christ's work on the cross was related only to negative things, to cross us out, to crucify us
Ephesians 2:15 tells us that on the cross Christ did something positive, to generate us, not to put us to death
In John 1224 the Lord Jesus said Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies it abides alone but if it dies it bears much fruit
The one grain of wheat falls into the earth to die, but this death causes the grain to grow and become a hundred grains of wheat
In the death of the one grain we can see two things: the dying of the grain of wheat and the bringing forth of a new life
Similarly, when we receive Christ into us as our Savior and life, He is always with His death and resurrection
When we receive Him as our life, that life is resurrection , and in that life there is also the element of death
The Bible tells us in Ephesians 2:15 that Christ created the Jews and the Gentiles together on the cross into one new man
It is to raise up the God-men to grow unto maturity, so that these God-men will do the work of building up the Body of Christ
In addition, every day we need to put off the old man and put on the new man through the renewing of the spirit in our mind
By our loving the Lord, by our praying to the Lord, and by our reading the Bible, our mind is filled with the mingled spirit
According to the Bible the new man was created by Christ on the cross and is consummated by the Spirit in our spirit
At the same time He released the divine life from within Him and imparted this divine life into the redeemed humanity
The new man is consummated by the Spirit, who is the reality of Christ's resurrection, which is a continuation of His death
The Bible teaches only five things: the God-men, the new man, the new creation, the Body of Christ, and the New Jerusalem
In these seventy-three years Brother Watchman Nee's ministry occupied the first thirty years, from 1922 to 1952, the year he was imprisoned
From 1952 until today a period of fortythree years we the coworkers of Brother Nee have continued to develop what he laid as a foundation
The intrinsic content of the teaching of the Bible is the God-men, the new man, the new creation, the Body of Christ, and the New Jerusalem
We need to receive a clear impression that we believers are the God-born God-men to grow in order to constitute the new man
There is the need for some of the God-men to be stewards, like Paul, to struggle and strive for the growth of the Body of Christ
As members of the Body of Christ we need to grow, and as the builders of the Body of Christ we need not only growth but also maturity
For us to grow means not only that the members of the Body of Christ are growing; it also means that the Body itself is growing
The Body needs members; the Body needs the builders; and the Body needs some stewards to promote the growth and maturity of the Body itself
To arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is to arrive at the full building up of the Body of Christ
As the organic Body of Christ, the church of God is the continuation of Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh
The Body of Christ is constituted with the regenerated and transformed believers as its outward, visible frame-its members
Christ is the element for the constituting of the Body of Christ; He is the element with which the Body of Christ is constituted
The Body of Christ is a constitution, constituted with the believers as the outward frame and with the Triune God as the inward content
Those who are the particularly gifted members of the Body should not regard themselves as different from all the other members
We all need to grow into the Head, Christ, so that the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God may be consummated
The building up of the Body of Christ is consummated by our growing into Christ and by the Body building up itself in love
They will not admit this or confess it, but deep within them there is an essential factor which tells them that they are divisive
Regarding the unique oneness of the Spirit as the oneness of the Body, there is an essential judgment within the believers
We have been born of God to overcome the first line of the enemy, which consists of two items, sin and the world
Not only so, we are destined by God to conquer all the oppositions and persecutions, the hard environments, and the difficult situations
Many Christians know that they should overcome certain things, but when they are threatened by opposition, they compromise
Concerning the church life, some Christian leaders know that the denominations are wrong, but they dare not say anything
They dare not give up their involvement with their denomination, because they are afraid of losing their position as a pastor or a minister
In addition to these two lines, the enemy has built up a third line to frustrate the lovers of Christ from going on to follow Him
The God-men are born of God to overcome the first line of Satan, and they are destined by God to conquer the second line
Today people consider Judaism a typical religion, but they do not know that in the eyes of God Judaism has become satanic
In the past nineteen centuries millions of Gentiles have turned to Christ, but from the time of the destruction of Jerusalem in A
In preaching the gospel to sinners, it is much more difficult to win a Jew to Christ than to gain a Gentile for the Lord
Because the Catholic Church teaches the deep things of the philosophy of the satanic mysteries it has become demonic related to the demons
In Revelation 2:20 the Lord Jesus referred to the woman Jezebel, a figure signifying the apostate Roman Church
Today's Christmas is another example of leaven added by Catholicism to the fine flour of the teaching concerning Christ
Over the centuries some books have been written, including The Two Babylons by Alexander Hislop, to expose the heresies of Roman Catholicism
The Lord Jesus tells us that the Protestant churches are dead and that the things that remain in them are about to die
In Revelation 3:20 the Lord Jesus was knocking on the door of the church in Laodicea, indicating that He was outside the church in Laodicea
The church in Laodicea, a prefigure of the degraded Brethren assemblies as part of today's Protestantism, is Christless
In Revelation 2:10b the persecuted saints in the church in Smyrna were charged by the Lord to be faithful unto death
We need to overcome the love of the soul-life by sacrificing all the enjoyments, pleasures, and entertainments of the soul
Some of the saints may desire to drive an expensive car, to wear costly clothing, and to live in a magnificent house
Every part, every aspect, and every item of the New Jerusalem is a blessing prepared by God for His chosen and saved ones
Because they are not mature in life, God will have to perfect them by disciplining and punishing them during the thousand years
In the thousand years of the millennium the items of the eternal blessing of God's complete salvation will become a reward to the overcomers
At the earliest appearing of Christ, the overcomers will be given the morning star, signifying the precious Christ in His earliest appearing
They will not be hurt of the second death, to be hurt of the second death probably signifying also a kind of discipline in the kingdom age
They will be pillars in the temple of God and never go out anymore and will also be given a white stone with a new name written upon it
The overcoming God-men will have the name of God and the name of the city of God-the New Jerusalem-and the Lord's new name written upon them
In the millennial kingdom the overcomers will enjoy the salvation of the soul, which is the aggregate of all the above-mentioned items
In the New Jerusalem all the God-men will serve God as priests and reign as kings over the nations forever and ever
The second category of Christians is the false Christians the nominal Christians who are the tares prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 133842
The lights in the building will not shine if a connection is not made at the switch so that the electrical current can flow
He has never experienced a spiritual 'connection' so that the Spirit as the divine electricity can flow into him
The false Christians, the tares, in all kinds of churches will be bound into bundles to be burned up in the lake of fire
They will be judged at the time of the Lord's coming, one thousand years before the rest of the unbelievers are judged
In 1 Corinthians 3:12 their work and conduct are likened to wood, grass, and stubble, which are good only to be burned
In 1 Corinthians 3:12 their work and conduct are likened to gold, silver, and precious stones, which can never be burned
Some good Bible teachers insist that everything in the book of Revelation should be interpreted according to the letter
In the typology in the Old Testament, the Passover lamb signifies Christ as the One offered to God for our redemption
The city itself is a sign, and the various aspects of the city, such as the street, the gates, and the wall, also are signs
The constituents of the New Jerusalem are not lifeless materials but living persons, sons born of God to be the God-men
We are building up something in this age-the Body of Christ-that is for something in the next age-the New Jerusalem
We, the believers in Christ, are redeemed by the blood of Jesus, which washes us and which is the basis for God to forgive us and justify us
We are saved, therefore, not only by the redeeming aspect of God's salvation but also by the life-imparting aspect
John 19:34 tells us that from the pierced side of the crucified Christ two substances came out-blood and water
The blood signifies the redeeming aspect of God's salvation, and the water signifies the life-imparting aspect
We all need to realize clearly that we have been saved by the Lord not only through His redemption but also through His life-imparting
In order for Christ to create the new man, He had to do something more than merely terminate the negative things
The God-men not only build up the Body of Christ but also become the overcomers to consummate the New Jerusalem
The building up of the church as the Body of Christ needs maturity-the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
The New Jerusalem signifies that God as the temple is our dwelling and that God's redeemed as His tabernacle are His dwelling place
The New Jerusalem is also the dwelling place of the processed and consummated Triune God, signified by the tabernacle
Since the New Jerusalem is the wife of the Lamb, it would be ridiculous to say that the New Jerusalem is a material city
The New Jerusalem, as the greatest sign, is the ultimate consummation of the universal woman in Revelation 12:1
For the spreading of the vine, we all must endeavor to help others to be regenerated to become members of Christ
The New Jerusalem is also the reflection and fulfillment of the divine revelation concerning the garden of Eden
The revelation concerning the garden of Eden, as the beginning of the divine revelation in the Holy Scripture, contains four matters
The wife came out of the husband as a part of him taken out of him in his sleep by God, which part God built into a woman -Gen
God brought the woman to the man and made her one flesh with him as her husband to be his counterpart as his increase and expression
The revelation concerning the New Jerusalem, as the ending of the divine revelation in the Holy Scripture, also contains four matters
These materials are built together into a city, the city of New Jerusalem, by the processed and consummated Triune God
Next, we need to see that the New Jerusalem is the unique, divine, and organic building in the entire universe
Let us now go on to consider the different aspects of the holy city as the unique, divine, and organic building
Starting from the throne of God and of the Lamb at the peak , the street spirals downward until it reaches each of the gates
Only by spiraling in this way could the street, which begins at the throne, reach all twelve gates, which are at the bottom
Among us many sisters refrain from using cosmetics not because of instructions but because of the divine nature
Some sisters who formerly used cosmetics spontaneously stopped using them because they were living according to God's nature
Others have changed the way they dress or the way they style their hair also because of the divine nature within them
It is very significant that the street has no turns or corners but is a circling spiral, leading up to and joining with the throne of God
Many in Christianity speak only of the redeeming function of Christ's death but not of the life-releasing function
An oyster lives in the salty water and is wounded by a grain of sand to produce a pearl by secreting its life juice
Through this wound He released His life so that in His resurrection it could be dispensed into us to make us pearls
We need to be impressed with the fact that this entry is composed with the Triune God mingled with the tripartite man
In the next chapter we will see that the wall and the foundations with the precious stones refer to the Gentile believers
In the previous chapter we covered two aspects of the New Jerusalem-its base with its street and its gates with its availability
In Ephesians 2:15 we are told that on the cross Christ created the Jews and the Gentiles in Himself into one new man
The Lord's resurrection continued His death to dispense the divine life released through His death on the cross
The releasing of life through Christ's death and the dispensing of life through Christ's resurrection were a creating work
Some may ask why we say that the Old Testament saints are the gates and the New Testament believers are the walls and the foundations
On the walls twelve foundations the twelve names of the apostles are inscribed the twelve apostles representing the New Testament believers
Through the transforming work of the Spirit those who have entered into Christ through the gates become precious stones to build up the wall
As one entity, they pass through Christ's death and resurrection, and then they go on to pass through the Spirit's transformation
We need to go on to experience the transforming work of the Holy Spirit, through which we become the precious materials
The gates of the New Jerusalem are the initial section of the building, and the wall is the consummated section
God has a nature, and His nature is of many attributes, which include love, light, holiness, righteousness, kindness, etc
If we are saved only according to God's grace or according to God's love, our salvation is not legally justified; it is not judicial
In the New Jerusalem both the street and the base are gold, signifying God's nature in the attribute of righteousness
The street joined to the throne is for the governmental dealings, that is, the administration, in the New Jerusalem
In the middle of the street flows the river of water of life, and on the two sides of the river grows the tree of life
The throne flows out the river, on the two sides of which grows the tree of life, and the river flows in the middle of the street
Three things flow out of the throne: the divine administration, the river of water of life, and the tree of life
If there were no communication, no street, and if there were no administration and no provision of food and water, how could the city live?
In the New Jerusalem the throne flows out the water, and the water grows the tree of life, which produces twelve kinds of fruit as the food
These three things-the administration, the communication, and the life supply-flow out of the God of righteousness to take care of the city
The temple is not only the place where God stays to be worshipped but also the place where those who serve God live
Concerning God and His redeemed in the New Jerusalem, a new hymn says, 'As man yet God, they coinhere/A mutual dwelling place to be'
In this royal divine household the sons as priests the royal priesthood serve the Father and as kings reign over the nations as its subjects
The light is not the created light or the artificial light made by man, but God Himself in the Lamb as the lamp
The glory of God as the light is in the redeeming Lamb as the lamp shining through this organic building as the light's diffuser
The entire eternal kingdom of God will be under the shining of God's glory in the Redeemer through the redeemed as the diffuser
The redeemed who constitute the New Jerusalem are the kings to reign, and the nations around the New Jerusalem are the subjects
The base, therefore, is the ground under the house that has been prepared, strengthened, and reinforced to bear the weight of the building
According to Ephesians 2:15 on the cross Christ created the new man in Himself, that is, with Himself as the element
After the creation of the New Jerusalem, there is the need of consummation, which is related to the wall with its foundations
Now we have the complete building, consisting of the base with its street, the gates, and the wall with its foundations
We need to see that this complete building is built by the Triune God with each of the three of the Trinity being something
Ephesians 2:15 reveals that the materials are 'the two,' the Jews and the Gentiles, whom Christ created 'in Himself into one new man'
How can the materials, from both the Old Testament and the New Testament, be consummated and built to become the New Jerusalem?
In Christ's resurrection the Spirit dispenses the released divine life into the redeemed humanity to regenerate us
For administration this throne is the throne of authority, and for provision this throne is the throne of grace
Hebrews 4:16 tells us that we may come to the throne of grace to 'receive mercy and find grace for timely help'
If there were not such a throne, then in the New Jerusalem there would be no administration, no communication, no food, and no water
To be parts of the New Jerusalem, we need to be created, consummated, and furnished with the Triune God and the redeeming God
No matter how much a natural person is improved, remodeled, or changed, he is still a natural person, not a God-man like Jesus Christ
Christ is the God-man who is now producing many God-men to be created, consummated, and furnished to be the New Jerusalem
The subjects are the sheep, the righteous of the nations, justified by Christ at His throne of glory in His coming back
Whereas the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit form a divine Trinity, Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet will form a demonic trinity
The believers who remain on earth after the rapture of the overcomers will suffer persecution under Antichrist
During that time an angel will preach the eternal gospel, telling the people on earth to fear God and worship Him
The angel who preaches the eternal gospel, therefore, will be telling the people not to persecute God's people
Based upon their good conduct and upon their receiving the eternal gospel, He will justify them and regard them as the sheep
They will not receive eternal life but will go into the environment, the condition, and the situation of the eternal life
These sheep will become the nations as the subjects of the reign of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth
Revelation 21:3 speaks not of the sons of God but of the peoples of God, who will be the nations around the New Jerusalem
For their human affairs they will also live under the light of the sun created by God and the lamp made by man
All these are the blessings to the nations as the subjects, not to the saints as the sons of God , under the reign of the New Jerusalem
Such a righteousness is suitable for God to express Himself in the New Jerusalem, as His royal household, to the nations as His subjects
Revelation 22:21, the last verse of the entire Bible, says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is with us for nothing other than the accomplishing of the eternal economy of God
