   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>c The Sword the Righteousness of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The sword signifies killing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Genesis 3 the killing of the sword indicates God's righteousness cf.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lam 3:42-43; Rom 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If God would kill someone without sin being involved, He could be condemned for acting unjustly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, since sin was involved, there is, according to the righteous God, the need for killing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, the sword for killing signifies the requirements of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, God's glory, holiness, and righteousness closed the way to the tree of life, indicating that man, as long as he was sinful, was not permitted to contact God as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>3 The Examples a God on Mount Sinai</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we need to consider two illustrations of God's closing the way to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On Mount Sinai God came to visit His people Exo 19:10 20:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, He seemed to say to Moses, "Moses, tell the people that I must have a boundary around the mountain and that none of them should cross over the boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am holy, righteous, and full of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>None of you sinful persons are qualified to step over that boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you do, you will die."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Mount Sinai was covered with a cloud in which was the glory of God Exo 24:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That glory was very demanding.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It separated all sinful people from the presence of God and it closed the way to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Also, on the mount was the consuming fire Exo 19:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Israelites were so terrified that they said to Moses, "Oh, don't ask us to go to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You approach Him for us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Look what is on the mountain the devouring fire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We dare not go one step further."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That was the requirement of God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, during His meeting with Moses on Mount Sinai God gave the law, the ten righteous commandments Exo 20:1-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those commandments also were very demanding.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, on Mount Sinai we see a picture of three items: the glory of God, the holiness of God, and the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These divine attributes placed demands and requirements upon sinful man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, man was kept away from God as the tree of life by God's glory, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>b God in the Holiest Place of the Tabernacle</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A second illustration is the tabernacle in the center of which was the Holiest of all Lev 16:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God was in the holiest place, and His shekinah glory continually filled it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, no man could enter the holiest place at any time, because the cherubim which were over the ark Exo 25:18-20 were watching whether or not sinful man could fulfill the righteous requirements of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This meant that the glory of God was there observing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Also, cherubim were embroidered on the separating veil Exo 26:31-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, when the two sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, went into the holy place with strange fire, they were burned to death Lev 10:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Fire, indicating God's holiness, came out of the holiest place to devour them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moreover, in the ark in the Holiest of all was the law of God Exo 40:20-21; Heb 9:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The law signified God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, once again we see that the glory, the holiness, and the righteousness of God made demands upon sinful man and prevented him from contacting God.</S>
