<H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER TWO</H1><P>This chapter may be divided into two sections: verses 1-12 are concerned with Herod's plot to kill, and verses 13-23 describe Jesus' flight.</P><P>Verse 1:"In the days of Herod the king." Herod was an Idumaean (Mark 3:8), an Edomite, a descendant of Esau. He was made king, a tetrarch (Luke 1:5). At Herod's time Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea. This is related to the first census, as recorded in Luke 2:1-2. From the political viewpoint, the census was a decree from the Caesar. From our viewpoint, it was God's fulfillment of biblical prophecy. (At that time Joseph lived in Nazareth.) The king's heart is in the hand of Jehovah (Prov. 21:1). If the census had been taken earlier, Joseph and Mary would have returned to Nazareth immediately after they were registered. If the census had been taken a little later, they might still have been traveling on the way. However, under God's sovereignty, as soon as they arrived in Bethlehem, Mary delivered the child.</P><P>"Magi from the east arrived." According to Greek, the magi were persons of morality or principle, like the Hindu "holy men." The phrase the east does not indicate what place it was east of; it should refer to east of Jerusalem, east of Judea.</P><P>Verse 2:"He who has been born King of the Jews." This seems to indicate that the Lord Jesus was only for the Jews; however, those who first came to seek for the Lord were Gentiles. It was declared from the mouths of Gentiles that the Lord was the King of the Jews. From this verse we can see that the Lord's work was for both the Gentiles and the Jews. "We saw His star at its rising." The Bible does not give us proof of how the magi from the east learned of the Lord's birth, but we have some hint. ("Light"—Isa. 60:3; "He"—Psa. 72:4). The Gentiles also had prophets, Balaam being one of them. He was one of four prophets who prophesied the most concerning the Lord Jesus (Num. 24:17). Perhaps these prophecies had spread in the east. Perhaps the magi from the east read the prophecy in Daniel. In his captivity in Babylon, when Daniel prophesied concerning the seventy weeks, he spoke the things concerning the Lord Jesus (Dan. 9:24-25). "To worship Him" was not to worship as one would worship God but to worship the Lord with the highest honor given to a human being.</P><P>Verse 3:"When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him." For Herod to be troubled was somewhat reasonable, but for all Jerusalem also to be troubled was truly strange. From the time of Malachi to that time was a period of about four hundred and thirty years. During that period the Jews were suffering, and they were expecting the Messiah to come. When they heard this news, they should have rejoiced. Instead, they were troubled. This is for no other reason than that they were not genuinely seeking the Savior. (A Christian who expects the Lord to come or who expects to be raptured should take this as a warning—Prov. 4:23; 25:28.) Verse 3 says that Herod was troubled inwardly (the motive); verse 7 shows us that he took action outwardly (the scheme); and verse 16 is the result of the troubling (the killing).</P><P>Verses 4-6 indicate that biblical prophecy is one thing and revelation is another thing, that teaching is one thing and revelation is another thing. One may have the words of the prophets, but he still needs the heavenly star. One may have the knowledge of the Scriptures, but he still needs the divine revelation. If man is not hungry, God does not give. Perhaps the magi from the east were people who waited on God and were seeking. If one has only dead knowledge, he is merely a Pharisee. Even though he understands the word of the Scriptures, he has never seen the light from heaven. The star appeared in heaven to show the magi that there was a Savior, but it was through the Bible that they could find out the details. On the one hand, they needed the heavenly star; on the other hand, they needed Micah's prophecy (Micah 5:2). By this we can see that there are certain conditions for the receiving of God's revelation: (1) waiting and (2) desiring.</P><P>The second half of Micah 5:2 says, "And His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity." This shows that the One born in Bethlehem is God. When the Lord said, "Before Abraham came into being, I am" (John 8:58), they wanted to stone Him because they did not acknowledge Him as God.</P><P>Verse 7:"Then Herod, secretly calling the magi, determined accurately from them the time that the star appeared." Things done "secretly" are not necessarily wrong, but they usually cannot avoid becoming something of darkness. Christians may have secrets, but they should not have darkness. Herod "determined accurately" the time that the star appeared. By that time probably more than a year had passed, the evidence for which will be given later.</P><P>Verse 8:"And sending them to Bethlehem, he said, Go and find out accurately about the child. And when you find Him, report to me, so that I also may come and worship Him." Herod's intention was not to worship Him, but to kill Him.</P><P>Verse 9:"And after they heard the king, they went their way, and behold, the star which they saw at its rising led them until it came and stood over the place where the child was." There is no mention here that any scribe or Pharisee followed the magi. The magi could come from the east and find Bethlehem, but the scribes and the Pharisees would not go from Jerusalem to Bethlehem. This shows that the Gentiles wanted the Lord, but the Jews rejected Him. We should understand the Bible with our mind. At the same time, we also should seek inwardly to know the power of God. Andrew Murray said that it is a pity for someone to have a great deal of Bible knowledge yet keep it merely in his fleshly mind.</P>
