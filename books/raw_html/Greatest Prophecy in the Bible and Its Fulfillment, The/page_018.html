        <h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE SUPPLY OF GRACE<br />
BY EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT TO CALL ON THE NAME<br />
OF THE LORD AND PRAY-READ HIS WORD</h2>
<p>How can we have this infilling? How can we get the pure milk of the word? In Paul&rsquo;s second Epistle to Timothy, he charged him to be empowered in the grace (2:1). Grace is the enjoyment of Christ, but how can we be in that enjoyment? In the same book Paul told Timothy to flee youthful lusts and to pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart (v. 22). The way to drink the pure milk is to call on the Lord. The way to take the Lord in, to get the infilling of the Lord, is to call on Him. The way to be strong in grace is to call on the Lord.</p>
<p>I can never forget a message I heard in 1935 telling us that the grace of Christ is sufficient. I was very much helped and motivated by that message. But eventually I wondered how I could enjoy the grace. How could I and the grace become one? Today I can tell you that the way for you to get into the grace is by calling, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Suppose a sister&rsquo;s husband is giving her a hard time. She may pray, &ldquo;Lord, be merciful to me. Change the attitude of my husband.&rdquo; But the more she prays like this, the worse her husband may become. That is not the way. The way is seen with the apostle Paul. He had a thorn in his flesh, some kind of suffering, and he asked the Lord three times to remove this thorn (2 Cor. 12:7-8). But the Lord said to Paul, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you&rdquo; (v. 9). The Lord allowed the thorn to remain, and this created an opportunity for Paul to enjoy Christ as his all-sufficient grace. God would not remove the thorn, but He would supply the grace in Paul. We can get the grace by calling on the name of the Lord&mdash;&ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; If a sister is having a difficult time with her husband, she needs to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Eventually, the more difficult her husband becomes, the more she will enjoy Christ as grace. We get into the enjoyment of Christ by calling on the Lord.</p>
<p>Second Timothy 1:7 says that God has given us a strong spirit. Verse 22 of chapter 4 tells us that the Lord is with our spirit. We have a strong spirit, and the Lord is with our spirit. Verse 22 of chapter 2 says that we have to pursue the Lord with the calling ones. This means that we have to exercise our spirit to call on the Lord. Then verse 1 of chapter 2 says that we should be empowered in the grace. This means that we enjoy the Lord Himself as our grace.</p>
<p>In 3:16 Paul says that every word of the Scriptures is breathed by God. This means that we can get into the enjoyment of the Lord not only by calling on the Lord but also by breathing the word of the Bible into us. We all have to come back to these two things: calling on the Lord and pray-reading the Word. These are the ways, the means, for us to take the Lord into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The New Testament also tells us that we have to walk by and according to the spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25; Rom. 8:4). We have a strong spirit, and Christ as the life-giving Spirit is with our spirit. So we have to exercise our spirit to call on the Lord and to pray-read His Word. By this He will get into us more and more. Then our spirit will be more mingled with Him as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).</p>
<p>We have to walk according to this spirit all the time; then Christ will have a free course within our being. This is like the food having a free course within our stomach so that we have a good digestion. Then the nourishment of the food we take into our stomach is assimilated into all the parts of our being. We have to give the Lord a free course from our spirit to get into every part of our being.</p>
<p>Do not ever say no to the Lord. Whenever you have an inner sensation that the Lord is moving in you toward a certain direction with certain things, you have to say, &ldquo;Yes, Lord.&rdquo; Do not say no. Always say, &ldquo;Yes, Amen.&rdquo; Then you give Him the free course to get Himself into your whole being to saturate and permeate every part of your being. This is the way for you to grow. It is by this that the functions will come out, the transformation will be afforded, and spontaneously there will be the building up.</p>
<p>Galatians 6:18 says, &ldquo;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.&rdquo; Not only is the Lord with your spirit, but also the grace of the Lord is with your spirit. The Lord is with your spirit, and the enjoyment of the Lord should also be with your spirit. This tells us that we have to enjoy the Lord in our spirit all the time. Ephesians 6 tells us that we have to take the word of God, which is the Spirit, by means of all prayer, and whenever we pray, we have to do it in our spirit (vv. 17-18).</p>
<p>By putting all these verses together, we can see that the Lord&rsquo;s building is through the exercise of our spirit to eat the Lord, to enjoy the Lord. This has been veiled, covered, and even buried in the Bible for centuries. Christians in the past centuries did not see this. This is something hidden, something deeper, something invisible. This is like the inner life in my body being invisible. My body is visible, but my life is invisible. Yet the life is vital and real. In the Bible there is the vital part, which is hard for people to see. It is easy to see the superficial, shallow part. But we need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to get into the deeper part, that is, to see something deeper, something invisible. This is Christ as the life-giving Spirit for our enjoyment. We eat Him, drink Him, and breathe Him so that we may have the growth for the building up of the church.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
