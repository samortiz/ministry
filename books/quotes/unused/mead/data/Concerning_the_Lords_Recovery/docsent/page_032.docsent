   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE CONTENTS OF GOD'S EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN ITS REALITY 2 Scripture Reading: John 7:38-39; 20:21-22; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rom 8:2, 9-11, 16; 1 Cor 1:30; 3:16-17; 6:17; 2 Cor 13:14; Eph 1:19-23; 3:14-19; 4:4-6, 22-24; Titus 3:5-6; Phil 1:19-21a; 3:7-11; 4:13; Col 2:9; 3:4, 9b-11; 1 Tim 3:15, 16</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's eternal purpose is to express Himself fully in and through man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He created Adam for this purpose, but Adam fell.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Abel was brought back to God by offering the proper sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After those two landmarks, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph followed as individuals to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yet what God wanted was not an expression through individuals only.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He wanted a corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So after Joseph died, in Exodus God gained a collective people to express Him corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This people was eventually built up together to be His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The sign of this was the tabernacle which was God's dwelling place on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First it was a tabernacle, and eventually it became a temple.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you pick up these nine great men plus the tabernacle and temple you cover the entire Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>CHRIST ENLARGED AND INCREASED</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The New Testament began with a person, an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This individual is a marvelous, wonderful, and all-inclusive Person who is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He came to dwell among man as a tabernacle to declare the invisible, unseen God John 1:14, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The unseen, invisible God has been fully expressed in this man, Jesus Christ, as God's tabernacle among men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But again God was not satisfied with just one man as a tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God wanted a collective people to be His tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>So the Lord Jesus told His disciples that He was going to die and be raised up that He might be enlarged and increased John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The way for Him to be enlarged and increased was to change in form.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When He was the tabernacle on this earth among man, He was in the form of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But in the flesh He had no way to enter into His believers so that they could be His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to enter into so many believers, He needed to change His form from the flesh to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In John 1, the One who was the Word of God, which was God Himself, became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is so mysterious!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He became a material flesh, which is visible and touchable.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But after His death and resurrection He came back to His disciples in another form.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You may say that He came back in the form of the Spirit, but He also had a spiritual body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He showed His disciples His hands and His side John 20:20 , indicating clearly that after resurrection He still had a body, but not in the natural form.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was not a natural body, but a spiritual body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:35-38 illustrated such a change in form, such a transformation, by a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A seed has a form, and it may be yellow or brown, and round like a little ball.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you sow this seed into the earth it dies there.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then it rises up, or it grows up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To rise up is to be resurrected from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When this seed grows up, the form changes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It still has a form, but it changes from a little round yellow or brown ball into the form of a sprout, so tender and green and lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is still the same seed, but in another form.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When it gets into this changed form, it grows and also produces.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It increases from one grain to thirty or sixty or a hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a good illustration of the Lord Jesus being crucified, being buried, and rising up.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When He rose up He was no more in the original form.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was no more merely an individual grain.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>John 12:24 says that He was the one grain which fell into the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But after rising up He was no more a single grain.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He rose up to grow and produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Who are the many grains?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are all the members of His Body as His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is mysterious, yet we can see it in nature all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the natural things such as a grain falling into the earth and rising up, we can see such a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before falling into the earth it is one grain, but after falling into the earth and rising up, it becomes many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The many grains are the increase of the original grain.</S>
