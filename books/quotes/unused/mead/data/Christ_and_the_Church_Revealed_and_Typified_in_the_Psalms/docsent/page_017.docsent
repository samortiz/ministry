   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PSALM 22:1-21 CHRIST'S CRUCIFIXION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to Psalm 22.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to understand this Psalm, we must realize that it is one of a group of three Psalms concerning Christ Psalms 22, 23, and 24.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What a tremendous improvement these three Psalms represent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They predict Christ in an excellent and orderly sequence: firstly His death, then His resurrection, then His shepherding after His resurrection, and eventually His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus there are four items in these three Psalms: the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, the shepherding of Christ, and the return of Christ as the King.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, in order to understand these three Psalms, we must keep in mind all the preceding Psalms concerning Christ Psalms 2, 8, and 16.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have seen that Psalm 2 presents a summary concerning Christ in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then Psalm 8 adds something more His incarnation, ascension and enthronement.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Next, Psalm 16 reveals His life on this earth, how He died and was resurrected, and how He was installed at the right hand of God with pleasures forevermore.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How good it is!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But still the account is not so complete and clear.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is given bit by bit, something here and something there; something added, and then something more added.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have Psalm 2, Psalm 8, and then Psalm 16.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we have Psalms 22, 23, and 24.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I especially encourage all the young ones to memorize all these Psalms concerning Christ, not only Psalms 2, 8, and 16, but also Psalms 22, 23, and 24.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The older ones can memorize at least the main points of these Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This will not put you to death; there is resurrection life within these Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Psalm 22 is divided into two sections: verses 1 through 21 compose the first section, while verse 22 to the end of the Psalm is the second.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first part speaks of the crucifixion of Christ, and the second section of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is so clear.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the entire Bible, not another passage relates the crucifixion of Christ in so much detail as the first section of Psalm 22.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Psalm begins, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Matthew 27:46 we hear Christ speaking these words.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These are not only the opening words of this Psalm, but also the first words of Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ spoke seven sentences from the cross, and this one is the first.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 6 says, "But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was fully fulfilled when Christ was put upon the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was there that people despised Him; it was there that He became a reproach to all the people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now verse 7: "All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Matthew 27 and Mark 15 we see the same thing; the fulfillment is there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then verse 8: "He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is exactly what took place at the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The chief priests mocking Him, with the scribes and elders, said, "He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him" Matt 27:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 12: "Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>So many leaders were there around the cross, just like the strong bulls.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 13: "They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 14 we see a vivid picture of the crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At that time Christ cried, "I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While He was on the cross, the very weight of His body caused all His bones to be out of joint.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"My heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why He said, "I thirst" John 19:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 15: "My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was burnt, He was consumed by the holy fire of God on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 16: "For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This was exactly enacted on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now verses 17 and 18: "I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Matthew 27, Mark 15, and John 19 record the fulfillment of all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Finally, verses 20 and 21: "Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Undoubtedly this was the cry of Christ unto the Father; and this cry was answered.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We will see the answer in the next chapter: He was resurrected; He was delivered out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now you may see how Psalms 2, 8, 16 and 22 unfold little by little the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is no other book in the Old Testament which presents the things of Christ in so much detail as the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we have completed the entire book, you will have a full picture of Christ, a picture which is even more clear and complete than the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Oh, how much we need to see Christ in the Psalms!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is just the beginning; later, after the first book, we will see the preciousness, the sweetness, and the enjoyment of the house of God through the real experiences of Christ.</S>
