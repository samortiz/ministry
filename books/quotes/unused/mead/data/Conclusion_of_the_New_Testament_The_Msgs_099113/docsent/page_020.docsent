   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THREE THE BELIEVERS THEIR STATUS 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall cover more aspects of the believers' status after being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Members of Christ as the Head of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that we are brothers of Christ as the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we need to see that we are members of Christ as the Head of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1 Corinthians 6:15 Paul asks, "Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because we are organically united with Christ and because Christ dwells in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 and makes His home in our heart Eph 3:17 , our entire being, including our purified body, becomes a member of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To practice such membership we need to offer our body to Him Rom 12:1, 4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First Corinthians 6:17 indicates that we are organically united with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be one spirit with the Lord is to enter into an organic union with Him, to be united with Him organically.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This organic union makes it possible for our bodies to be the members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ indwells our spirit, and from our spirit He spreads throughout our entire being, thereby making His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, according to Romans 8:11, from our inner being He seeks to impart Himself as life into our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, Christ spreads from the spirit to the soul and from the soul to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way our bodies become His members. a. Produced Out of Him to Be His Parts</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As members of Christ, we are produced out of Him to be His parts Eph 5:30-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Ephesians 5:30 Paul says that we are members of Christ's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that we are members of Christ, parts of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to our natural constitution, we cannot be members of Christ's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ Himself is the element, the factor, that makes us parts of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, in order to be parts of Christ as members of His Body, we must have Christ wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Ephesians 5:31 and 32 Paul goes on to say, "For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ and the church being one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 , as typified by the husband and wife being one flesh, are the great mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first couple in the Bible, Adam and Eve, present a picture of this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the book of Genesis, God did not create man and woman at the same time and in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First God formed man's body from the dust of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Later, in order to produce a counterpart for Adam, "the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam" Gen 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>While Adam slept, the Lord took one of Adam's ribs and used it for the building of a woman Gen 2:22, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>. In life, nature, and form the woman was the same as the man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, when God brought the woman to Adam, Adam exclaimed that she was "bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh" Gen 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because there was no counterpart for Christ in the created universe, God caused Christ to die on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As He "slept" there, His side was opened, and blood and water came forth John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because in Genesis 2 the problem of sin had not come in, that chapter mentions only the rib that was taken out of Adam; it says nothing about blood.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But John 19 speaks of blood, which solves the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The water signifies the flowing life of Christ, the eternal life, which produces the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This life is also typified by the rib.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to John 19, not one of the Lord's bones was broken when He was on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was a fulfillment of the Scripture which said, "Not a bone of Him shall be broken" see Psa 34:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The unbroken bone of Christ signifies Christ's unbreakable eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, Adam's rib typifies the unbreakable eternal life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is with this eternal life that we are produced out of Christ to be His parts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The fact that Eve had the same life and nature as Adam signifies that, as members of Christ, we have the same life and nature Christ has.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, together Adam and Eve made a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the same principle, Christ and the church make a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church is Christ's other half.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Adam and Eve became one flesh, but Christ and the church are one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the Body there is no place for our natural life and fallen human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The human life and nature are not adequate to match Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In order to be members of Christ as the Head of the Body, we need to be one with Christ in life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, as portrayed in the type of Adam and Eve, we have been produced out of Christ to be His parts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In ourselves we are not members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is the element of Christ in us that makes us His members.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, a member of Christ is a person produced with the element of Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we see this, we shall realize that only that which comes out of Christ can be recognized by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only that which is produced out of Christ can be part of Him.</S>
