Such people are like the ostrich which tries to hide in the sand, thinking that by not seeing his danger, his danger will leave him
In order for God to judge and then to forgive our sins, there must be the shedding of blood; that is, there is the need of death

Peter 224 says that Christ Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree in order that we having died to sins might live to righteousness
Just as our eyes substantiate color and sights to us, so faith substantiates to us God's redemptive work accomplished two thousand years ago
Faith is not to believe in something that does not exist; rather, it is simply to receive something that is already there and given to you
