<p>The Brethren opposed the truth concerning the discipline of the coming age. But when I was with them, they always warned us to be careful in our Christian conduct; otherwise, God would discipline or chastise us. They taught strongly concerning God&rsquo;s chastisement of the believers in this age. Later I was enlightened to see that God&rsquo;s chastisement is not only in this age but even more in the coming age. The Lord Jesus told us clearly in Matthew 24 and 25 that if the servants are slothful, He will punish them when He returns. Matthew 24:51 tells us that when the Lord comes He shall cut the unfaithful and evil slave asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. To cut asunder does not mean to cut into pieces but to cut off. Because we believers have always been attached to Christ, the anointed One, we are one with Him. If we are unfaithful, at the judgment seat of Christ, the Lord will make the decision to cut us off from this attachment with Him. To cut the evil slave asunder is to cut him off from Christ and to put him into the outer darkness (Matt. 25:30) where he Will suffer the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. This will take place after the Lord&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>The coming age of the millennium is still a period of time of the old creation. Although the millennium will be a time of restoration, it will still be in the old creation since the new heaven and the new earth will have not yet been realized. God&rsquo;s dealing with His people and with mankind will not be completely finished in this age of grace. His dealing with His believers will continue in the next age. This age and the coming age are both parts of the age of the old creation. God needs another age, the age of the kingdom, to discipline the immature believers and to prepare the Israelites who are saved at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. Since their being saved was after the age of grace, they still need a period of time for God to perfect them. Furthermore, God needs to perfect some of the nations to be transferred into the new earth to be the people on the new earth for eternity. Through the time of the millennium, God will prepare or perfect these three kinds of people for His new universe. This is a clear view concerning the matter of the dispensations. The Brethren are famous as dispensational teachers, yet they did not see clearly the details concerning the age of grace and the age of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A WISE MASTER BUILDER</h2>
<p>On the one hand, we are an army, and with the army there should be a commander in chief. In the New Testament you cannot find the term &ldquo;commander in chief.&rdquo; We can realize this matter, though, by inference from Paul&rsquo;s mentioning of the uncertain sound of the trumpet for the battle (1 Cor. 14:8). Surely the battle implies an army, and in an army there is the need of a general to command the army, to direct the army to fight. On the other hand, in 1 Corinthians 3:10 Paul says that he is a &ldquo;master builder.&rdquo; In Greek the word for master builder is <em>architekton.</em> The English word &ldquo;architect&rdquo; is the anglicized form of this word. An architect is one who designs the building and superintends its construction. In chapter five we saw who the apostles are, but not all the apostles are master builders. With a building, there cannot be two master builders. That would bring in confusion. A master builder may have a helper, though. Likewise, in an army there cannot be two commanders in chief. A commander in chief may have someone who is second in command, but he is the one in charge of all the troops. Not all the apostles are wise master builders. Paul said that according to the grace of God given to him, he was a wise master builder (3:10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Planter</h2>
<p>On the one hand, Paul was very bold toward the Corinthians in dealing with divisions in the first four chapters. On the other hand, he was very humble in his speaking. He did not show or give the impression that he was superior to Cephas and to Apollos. Rather, he ranked himself among them. But regardless of how humble he was in writing this portion of the Word, when he came to chapter three he admitted that he was the planter (v. 6). The planter is much more crucial than the waterer (Apollos). A plant may not need a waterer for a certain length of time, but without a planter there is no plant. Paul was humble, but he would not give up the real facts and he had to speak them. Between Paul and Apollos who was more crucial? Apollos could have been spared. To have Apollos is good, but not to have Apollos is not a great loss. Apollos was not a planter but just a waterer. He did not have the stuff of life, the substance of life. He had some knowledge of the Bible to water the saints, but the planter was Paul.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Father</h2>
<p>The shallow, superficial, and even blind Corinthians appreciated the Bible teachings of Apollos and puffed themselves up on behalf of Apollos against Paul (4:6). This shows the stupidity of the Corinthians. They forgot through whom they were born. Paul told them, &ldquo;For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:15). This verse implies that Apollos was one of these ten thousand guides or teachers. I would like to say the same thing to all the churches that have been raised up by this ministry&mdash;you may have ten thousand guides or teachers, but not one is your father. All the teachers are expendable, but not your father. Although Paul was humble, he was also frank and bold. He would never ignore the facts. It was a fact that he begat all the Corinthian believers. He was the father and the planter, not Apollos nor even Peter. Based upon these facts, Paul declared that by the Lord&rsquo;s grace he was a wise master builder, a wise architect. An architect does not control the workers or manage the work. First, he designs. Second, he superintends the construction. This was exactly what Paul did.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> </body></html>
