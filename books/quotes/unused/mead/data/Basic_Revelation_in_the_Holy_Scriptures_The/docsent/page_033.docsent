   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The church today should be such an expression, issuing out of the rich enjoyment of the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We are burdened for the situation among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Where is there an expression of God?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I hope that among us there will be such an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We all need to pray for ourselves as Paul did for us in Ephesians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should bow our knees to the Father that He may strengthen us into our inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts, fully settling down in every avenue, every part, of our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then we may enjoy His love, and we may touch and possess His dimensions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We will be filled with Him unto the fullness of God, the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is not just an assembly or a called-out congregation of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a group of people fully possessed by Christ and enjoying Christ to the uttermost, being saturated by Him and filled with Him to such an extent that they become an expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whatever we eat we express.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I was young, I would sometimes visit my grandparents who lived at the seashore.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They often ate fish, whereas our family hardly ever ate fish.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever I went to my grandparents' home, I smelled nothing but fish.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day I asked my mother why everyone there smelled like fish.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My mother replied, "Do you not know that they eat fish every day?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That is why they smell like fish!"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What we eat we become and we express.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we eat Jesus, we "smell of" Him 2 Cor 2:15 , we express Him, and we become Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church is the expression of the very Christ whom we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the fullness of the Godhead is embodied in this Christ, and this very Christ is our bread of life John 6:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He said, "He who eats Me shall also live because of Me" John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we eat Christ, we live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God; when we eat Christ, we eat the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our Savior, Jesus Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, is our daily manna, our daily food.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We eat Him, so we express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This expression is the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually this is the fullness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can be such an expression by eating Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let Him saturate your entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let Him settle in every room, every avenue, and every corner of your inner being in your mind, your emotion, your will, your conscience. your soul, and your spirit; in your loving, your decisions, your intention, and your motive.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whatever you do must be filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To eat Jesus is simply to take Him in and let Him be assimilated into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To eat means to receive food into our being; to eat Jesus means to receive Him into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The issue of our eating Him is the fullness of the One who fills all in all and also of the very Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This fullness is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church is not only an assembly, nor is it only the house of God, the family of God; it is also the Body, an organism of this living One, which eventually becomes His fullness and the fullness of the Triune God.</S>
