   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ALL WORK IS FOR THE CHURCH GOD'S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All gifts and all gifted persons are for the building up of the Body; they are not for any work in itself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The practice of today's Christianity is absolutely different in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Wherever there is a gifted person, a spiritual "giant" with a certain gift, that person will begin a work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He will build up a Christian organization or ministry, and possibly call it by some worthy name.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are not opposing anyone, but we are against the wrong principles which damage the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Apostle Paul did not form any Christian organization; he did not set up any kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For possibly thirty years he just established local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And he did not keep any work in his own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In reading the New Testament we can only find the churches which were built up by him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the time the Apostle John wrote the book of Revelation he was greatly experienced and matured.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of the twelve Apostles, he was the only one remaining.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet he did not build up anything as his work, his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Consider the local churches in Asia to whom he wrote: most of them were exceedingly weak; yet those churches were the lampstands, not the ministry of the Apostle John.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John's ministry was far more spiritual than the condition of those churches; yet he did not set up his ministry as a lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In fact, he did not set up his ministry as anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All he did was to further the building up of those local churches as the lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Oh, we all must learn this!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must be aware of the dangerous tendency for any local church to become a work, kept in the hands of some gifted person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If such is the case, that is a real degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However much the Lord may use a gifted person, however great his ministry may be, the local church must not become his work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's intention is not to build up the ministry of any person, but to build up His church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the New Testament there are the titles, the "church of God" Acts 20:28 , the "church of Christ" Rom 16:16 , and the "church of the saints" 1 Cor 14:33; 1 Thes 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is never any "church of the apostles."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church belongs to God, to Christ, and to the saints, not to any apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The greater our gift is, the greater is the danger that we will take over the church and keep it in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This will greatly damage the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must learn not only how to minister in the local church, but also how to keep our hands off the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The local church is not our personal enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The local church is the property of the local saints, not some worker's business.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some gifted persons put a local church in their pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They feel that this is the church they built, that this is their church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Oh, this is a real problem!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the local saints must realize that the local church is their church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the local saints are not clear concerning this, they will allow a gifted person to take the church into his own hands and treat it as his personal property.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then the entire church life will be finished.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The local churches belong to the local saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The gifted persons are just the means to perfect the saints to function; they are only the instruments used by the Lord to build up the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Consider the situation in Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Look at the situation even from the time of the Reformation: four or five hundred years have passed, and it is still basically the same.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever a gifted person is raised up, a certain kind of work is established.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I establish my work, you establish your work, and he establishes his work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then the church is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the source of all the divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, if one gifted brother comes to build a local church, and a second gifted brother comes to build up the same church, there will be no division.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All the work must be for the church, not for the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The ministry should be for the church; the church should never be for the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must be exceedingly clear concerning this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must drop all wrong practices.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A gifted brother should keep his hands off the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although a gifted brother may sometimes not speak openly in a way of ministry, yet he still may quietly maneuver behind the scenes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Any such maneuvering damages the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All gifts and gifted persons must be entirely for the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a tremendously vital matter.</S>
