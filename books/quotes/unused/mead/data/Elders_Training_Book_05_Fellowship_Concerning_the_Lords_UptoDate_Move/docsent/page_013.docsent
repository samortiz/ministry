   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE WORD OF GOD AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the verses listed on page 37, the Word is revealed in many different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One of the ways to study the Bible is to count the occurrences of certain things, and then to arrange them in a good sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, there is the word of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Following this there is the word of truth, based upon John 1:14 and 17.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These verses tell us that the Word became flesh, that the Lord came through incarnation, full of grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How could this grace and truth come to us?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Electricity comes into a building by means of a wire.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The wire by which grace comes to us is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, the Word is more than a wire; it is the embodiment of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The divine grace is embodied in the Word, just as God is embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Outside of Christ you cannot find God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the same principle, outside of the divine Word it is hard for you to find grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Grace is embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The truth is also embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Following this the Bible reveals the word of life Phil 2:16; 1 John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then there is the word of the gospel Acts 15:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The three main constituents of the gospel are grace, truth, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we refer to the word of grace Acts 20:32 , the word of truth Eph 1:13 , and the word of life, we are speaking of the word of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Besides this there is the word of the faith Rom 10:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The faith is the very contents of God s New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The New Testament is a will, and a will is a bequest, something given to us as an inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A will always has as its contents the many items contained in it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From God s side it is a will; from our side it is the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Besides the word of grace, the word of truth, the word of life, the word of the gospel, and the word of the faith, there are many more aspects of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>BUILDING ON THE GROUND OF THE DIVINE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have been serving the Lord in the line of His New Testament economy for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During this time we have studied and investigated the different practices of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Especially since the Reformation, many different practices have been raised up, such as the practice of baptism and of the presbytery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we were young, we were the modern young people of China.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During our youth there was a great turn among the conservative Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our fathers were very conservative, but we were raised up as young people in a new era.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all became quite modern, and we decided to learn the real situation in the world and in history.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Almost sixty years ago, I came to know the world situation quite well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the unequal treaties made by the foreign powers with China were so familiar to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The leaders of the two main political parties in China today, the nationalist party and the communist party, are my age.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We were taught in the same schools as they were.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At that time there was a great tide sweeping over all of China to catch the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Either one was caught by the nationalist party, or later on he would be caught by the communist party.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But we were caught by the Jesus party.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I was glad that I was born in that period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I graduated from the English speaking college established by the American Presbyterians, my graduation paper was on imperialism, a subject selected by me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In it I gave a history of the world s inventions and how modern science produces modern industry.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Modern industry caused overproduction which forced the western powers to gain the world markets with the help of their gun boats.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They went out to invade other countries and forced them to sign treaties for their markets.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I gave quite an account of those matters.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is what is called imperialism.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I mention this to you so that you could see that we were not foolish, old fashioned young people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We were not raised up by the Lord in a blind way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We scientifically studied Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We investigated the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since the first year I was saved, I studied the Bible and made a resolution to know the Bible word by word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I read a number of articles by Watchman Nee, and those articles really caught me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I admired his writing and had the highest regard for the truth he presented.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I wrote to him and asked him to tell me the best book to help me to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He responded saying that, according to his knowledge, the best book to help me to know the Bible was John Nelson Darby s Synopsis of the Books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Eventually he gave me a set as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I tell you this to give you an indication of where we were and from where we came.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We two young people in China, considered as natives by the missionaries, were seeking to know the Bible by means of Darby s synopsis.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have not only studied the Bible, but we have studied the history of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have studied how the different denominations were founded.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>According to our study, the most vain practice is Pentecostalism.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Most of the practices of Pentecostalism are not built upon the divine Word.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They build nearly everything upon their feelings and experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In our writings we stress experience very much.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, when we speak of or stress experiences, we do so with a strong scriptural base.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Perhaps no other writings use quotations from the Scriptures as much as ours do.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Almost no one would give a message with as many verses as we have in our Scripture readings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Before you get into the message, you must study all the verses given with it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We stress experiences very much, but we do not do it without a base, without a ground in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We would not take anything that is not grounded on the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Without this ground, we would not even care for our very deep, intimate experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There must be a ground with the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But the practice of Pentecostalism is almost entirely not grounded on the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Those who practice Pentecostalism often use the Bible simply to justify their way.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Most of those who practice this way are drugged.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>No logical person would believe some of the things spoken about in this movement.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is so strange that in the twentieth century, in this top scientific country with so much education, people would believe these things.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I have studied Pentecostalism for more than fifty years and when I talked to a number of persons who spoke in tongues, they were all convinced that what they were speaking was false.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They could not argue with me and admitted that I had the ground in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Yet even though they admitted that what they were practicing was false, they still continued to practice it, insisting that they liked it and that it made them feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This proves that many of those who practice in this way are drugged.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must come back to the divine way.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The divine way is to use the Word to the uttermost.</S>
