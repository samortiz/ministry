   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Believers Being Transformed into the Image of the Lord by Turning to the Lord and Beholding Him with an Unveiled Face</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we desire to have this kind of transformation, we must first remove the various kinds of veils of our old concepts by turning to the Lord 2 Cor 3:16 and by beholding Him with an unveiled face and reflecting His glory like a mirror v. 18 . The problem with the Jews was that they had a thick veil on their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we are veiled, we cannot be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, whenever our heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we can behold the Lord with an unveiled face like a mirror.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Consequently, what is expressed through us as a mirror is the glorious image of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this way we are being transformed into the same image as the Lord from one level of glory to another level of glory for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Believers Being Thus Transformed into the Same Image as the Lord from the Lord Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is from the Lord Spirit, that is, from Christ as the life-giving Spirit, that the believers are being transformed into the same image as the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This Spirit contains the bountiful supply to be our new element.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul said that he lived Christ and magnified Christ by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19-21a .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we live by our natural life, we cannot be transformed and we cannot magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ is an element in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When this bountiful supply comes into us, it begins the inner process of metabolism and issues in an outward manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>People will see that what is manifested through us is not ourselves but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and allow Him to work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose you and another brother live together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every day that brother has morning revival, prays, reads the Bible, and meditates on the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After a period of time, you will surely notice some transformation in him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am usually awake early in the morning at four or five o'clock, and I just muse on the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then the Holy Spirit comes, and the light comes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I touch Christ as the Spirit, His element comes into me and it issues in a metabolic function in me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is similar to the metabolism in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After we eat some proper food and receive some proper element into us, the elements of the food become our element through digestion and assimilation so that we look so radiant and so energetic.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you touch the Lord day by day and allow His element to come into you, metabolism will spontaneously transpire in you that you may be transformed and eventually be like the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we have problems in our daily life, we do not have to seek advice from others, because we have a spirit in us and the Lord as the Spirit dwelling in our spirit is very near to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can ask Him about everything, without any need to use the telephone or the fax machine, for He can talk with us right within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You can talk with Him and confer with Him in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord's Word says, "In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God" Phil 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, if you have some problem, you just need to tell Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is right within you, and He is with you face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is in us not to trouble us but to be our Paraclete, Comforter, Supporter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I always pray, "O Lord, now I am going to take a walk.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Support me, sustain me, and strengthen me."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is to drink the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way I have no anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When anxiety comes, you should say, "O Lord, this anxiety is Yours, not mine; I give it to You because You bear it for me."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, you receive the Lord's element into you and metabolism will work constantly in you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Consequently, what is expressed through you outwardly is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who do not know this secret consider to live Christ a difficult thing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Actually, you just need to practice speaking with the Lord constantly; then spontaneously you will live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Transformation Requiring the Believers' Outer Man to Be Decaying That Their Inner Man May Be Renewed Day by Day</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, transformation requires the believers' outer man to be decaying consumed that their inner man may be renewed day by day 2 Cor 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This does not require us to do it ourselves; instead, the Lord is working in our environment to consume our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the outer man is being consumed, decaying, the inner man is renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God always gives us the most suitable spouse for our marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When a young person begins to choose a spouse, he puts forth much effort and follows many principles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After a great deal of consideration, eventually he chooses someone.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although the people around him do not agree with his choice, little do they know that it is God's arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After the two are married, they begin to deal with each other even from the very first night.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One cannot sleep without the windows open, whereas the other catches a cold whenever the windows are open.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the discussion yields no solution, the two begin to quarrel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the mutual consuming between husband and wife.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The more the husband is consumed by the wife, the more spiritual he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The same is true in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When several people serve in coordination, there is always someone who has a tough personality that is unbearable.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even so, you should not lose your temper, so you have to endure, sometimes even to the point of becoming ill.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord arranges this kind of situation that our outer man may be decaying so that our inner man may be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this way we are transformed.</S>
