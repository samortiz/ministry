   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BRINGING GOD INTO MAN AND MAN INTO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The main principle of the building of God is that God is brought into us and we are being brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have seen, the Lord is the Son of Man as the heavenly ladder bringing God down to man and man up to God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By His incarnation He brought God to man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When He became flesh, He brought God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before that time, God had never been in the flesh, but by the incarnation of the Lord, God came into man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Following this, there is a "U-turn."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After coming down with God, the Lord goes up with man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He brought God into man by incarnation, and then He brought man back into God by death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Gospel of John, there is the Lord's coming and the Lord's going.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His coming was His incarnation, and His going was His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By His coming, He brought God into man, and by His going, He brought man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 7:33-34 the Lord told the people that He was going to a place where at that time they could not go, but after a while, in 14:2-6, He told His disciples that He would bring them to the place where He was.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The place where He was is not heaven but God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is as if He was saying, "I am in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Father is the place where I am.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have brought God to you by My incarnation, but there is now the need for Me to die and resurrect.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By My death and resurrection I will bring you into God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then at that time you will be where I am."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is the way through which man can come not to the place of the Father but to the Father Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 20 says, "In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These perplexing "ins" tell us that because Christ is in the Father and we are in Christ, we are in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, where He is, we also are v. 3 . Before His death and resurrection, however, He had only brought God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Bringing man into God was accomplished by His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Read the Gospel of John again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then you will see the Lord's coming and the Lord's going.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord's coming and going are the process of the divine building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The coming of the Lord brings God into us, and the going of the Lord brings us into God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By His coming and His going He mingles God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord did not speak in vain of the heavenly ladder in 1:51.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The principle of the heavenly ladder is found throughout the entire book of John.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a full picture of eternity to come.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we have the spiritual insight today, we will say, "O Lord, You are the heavenly ladder.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Day by day the angels of God ascend and descend upon You.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Day by day You bring something heavenly to earth and something of earth to heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the day we repented and believed in the Lord, He as the heavenly ladder brought something heavenly into us, and He brought something of earth into God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The moment we received the Lord Jesus, He was the real heavenly ladder.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At that time there was the opening of heaven, and there was a Bethel on the earth, the house of God as the dwelling place of God and the resting place of man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord as the heavenly ladder brought God into us and brought us into God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is the heavenly ladder to join heaven with earth and unite earth with heaven, that is, to mingle God and us, us and God, with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This mingling is the divine building, the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Throughout all the generations and unto the end of this age what God has been doing and what He still will do is to accomplish this divine building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God continually brings Himself through Christ to man, and brings man through Christ to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some time after the naughty Jacob had his dream, he became the father of a great house.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Old Testament speaks not of the house of Abraham or the house of Isaac but of the house of Jacob, the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The house of Israel is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How could the house of a naughty young man become the house of God?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was by God coming to the people of his house and bringing them to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the story of the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God came to the people of Israel, and God brought the people of Israel to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Exodus, God told the people of Israel to build a tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Throughout the tabernacle there is the mingling of two materials, gold and acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Gold signifies the divine nature, and acacia wood signifies the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The building of God is the mingling of the divine nature with the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We stress this matter so much because we need to realize that the building of the church is nothing other than the mingling of these two natures.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must have God mingled with us day by day by means of the heavenly ladder with an open heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This produces Bethel.</S>
