   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PRESERVING JUSTICE AND DOING RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR PROSPERITY AND JEHOVAH'S ACCEPTANCE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 56:1-8 we have the matter of preserving justice and doing righteousness for prosperity and Jehovah's acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. Justice Being the Verdict of God's Judgment</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"Thus says Jehovah,/Preserve justice and do righteousness, /For My salvation is about to come/And My righteousness is about to be revealed./Blessed is the man who does this,/And the son of man who takes hold of it,/Who keeps from profaning the Sabbath/And keeps his hand from doing any evil" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In its Old Testament usage, the word justice means the verdict of God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This justice enables one to be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If Christ had not died on the cross for us, we would have been condemned in the heavenly court.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But because Christ died a vicarious death for us, God reckons that we also have died, and then He pronounces the verdict that, instead of being condemned, we are released.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a matter of justice, and through it we are justified, that is, made righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 1a speaks of preserving justice and doing righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From this we see that we first have justice and then righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 1b goes on to speak of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Justice plus righteousness equals salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the result of Christ's death on the cross for us, God's verdict concerning us is the justice which causes us to be justified, to be made righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is God's salvation coming to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>B. The Real Meaning of Keeping the Sabbath</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verses 2, 4, and 6, Isaiah speaks of keeping the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The real meaning of keeping the Sabbath is to cease from our work, to stop our doing, to get ourselves "fired," in order to enjoy what God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To believe in the Lord Jesus is to keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the day we were saved, we were fired and replaced with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, that day was a real Sabbath, a day of rest, to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the keeping of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our whole Christian life should be such a Sabbath rest.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This extended Sabbath becomes a feast in which we cease from our doing and are replaced with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>C. The Declaration of the Lord Jehovah,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Who Gathers the Outcasts of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Isaiah 56:8 we have the declaration of the Lord Jehovah, who gathers the outcasts of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He declares, "Yet will I gather others to Him besides those gathered to Him already."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This reveals that God will gather more people to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First, He gathered the Jews, and then He began to gather the Gentiles from such places as Asia Minor and Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today He continues to gather people to Christ from throughout the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE REBUKING OF THE BLIND WATCHMEN</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>AND THE SELF-SEEKING SHEPHERDS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Chapter fifty-six concludes with Jehovah's rebuking of the blind watchmen and the self-seeking shepherds vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>9-12 .</S>
