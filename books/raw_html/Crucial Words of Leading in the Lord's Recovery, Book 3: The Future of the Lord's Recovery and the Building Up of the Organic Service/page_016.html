	 <h2 class="head2">Perfecting the Saints<br />
in All Areas of Church Service</h2>
<p>In relation to church service, we should make a list of the needs of the church. For example, the chart should list cleaning, ushering, and other church services. After we pray about the services, we should assign responsible saints to different services according to the need. Then we should hold trainings for the different areas of service to perfect the saints. We have been preaching the gospel in Taipei for nearly thirty years, and now there are approximately five thousand saints who attend the meetings. All the saints who are in the meetings have received some perfecting, but we must study how we can meet their need. We must continually endeavor; it may be that we will not be immediately successful. Nevertheless, we must put our heart, our strength, and our entire being into perfecting the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUTTING ASIDE OUR PERSONAL VIEWS<br />
TO BE IN HARMONY<br />
WITH THE CORPORATE LEADING</h2>
<p>I have a heavy burden concerning the leading in the church in Taipei. The co-workers and the elders are all faithful, they are willing to give themselves, and they are of the same mind. However, they have not put aside their personal views to receive a corporate view for the corporate need. The brothers need to labor according to a corporate view and to function according to their measure. They should cooperate with one other and strive together for the same goal.</p>
<p>We need to set aside our personal views and receive a corporate view. The brothers need to come together to pray until there is no more pride and no self-exaltation. This is the way we will succeed. If we would do this, the Lord will lead us step by step in our prayer and fellowship so that all the needs of the church are met. Otherwise, even though the co-workers are not in division, they will not be in harmony regarding the corporate leading, nor will they be focused in their work. A personal view, no matter how good it is, cannot accomplish anything in the work. When the elders and co-workers are in harmony and have one burden but do not have personal views, the practical needs will be met.</p>
<p>In addition to finding out why so few saints come to the meetings, we also need to consider different kinds of meetings. It is not good to have too many kinds of meetings, but too few meetings may not meet the need. It is best to have only one joint meeting every week when the whole church meets together for a corporate leading. The other meetings during the week do not have to be corporate. During the joint meeting, the different kinds of meetings can be announced and a printed schedule can be passed out to the brothers and sisters. We must allow the brothers and sisters to choose meetings for themselves based on their personal situation and need. We should not force them to go to a particular meeting. If we have a meeting only for new believers, the saints who have met with us for twenty to thirty years will not be interested.</p>
<p>We are soldiers, and we can be useful regardless of our age. If we have ten thousand children meeting with us every week, we will need five hundred teachers. The brothers and sisters in high school and college can be the teachers. In addition, we can train the saints in college to also preach gospel truths. In this way everyone will have the opportunity to be useful. This is the way a country builds up its infrastructure, and it is the only way for a country to be prosperous.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DROPPING OUR OPINIONS<br />
TO CONSIDER THE CONDITION OF THE CHURCH<br />
AND NOT REMAINING IN OUR OLD WAYS</h2>
<p>We must beseech the Lord&rsquo;s mercy in order to see that opinions are worthless. When I was working with Brother Nee, I never expressed my opinion. I entered into the work in 1932, which was ten years after some of the other co-workers entered the work. However, only eight years later in 1940, when we were in Shanghai, Brother Nee was already giving me important assignments. I never casually expressed my opinion. Brother Nee always asked me to go to difficult areas; I never chose where to go. I never said that I approved of this or disapproved of that; I never said we should do this or do that.</p>
<p>When I was playing soccer in my junior college, I never expressed my opinion. I told my teammates that I would play whatever position they put me in without any preference. There are many things that we can accomplish when we do not express our opinions. We could have gained at least twenty-six thousand children, junior high students, high school students, and college students. We must be able to pick up this burden.</p>
<p>I have no intention of being a leader in the Lord&rsquo;s work; I merely work diligently without opinions. If someone else has a better way of doing things, I will not argue with him; however, other people always argue with me. We must realize that the blessing depends on the one accord, not on our opinions. We must not express our opinions in the elders&rsquo; and co-workers&rsquo; meetings. We must be practical in our leading, and we must study our situation so that we can meet the need. This can be compared to using the resources, capital, and labor in a factory to manufacture products that meet a need in the market. This is our pressing need, and we must spend time on it.</p>
<p>In our history we have never had a local church with more than three thousand five hundred saints regularly in the meetings. We must learn how to lead the saints, to stir them up, and to motivate them so that the saints can spread. We cannot depend on the corporate meetings to meet this need. To have only three meetings a week&mdash;the prayer meeting, the mid-week ministry meeting, and the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting&mdash;is inadequate. Some of the saints who are not in the meetings may be open to receive a burden for the gospel; hence, we must study and find a way to contact these saints and develop their function in preaching the gospel. This requires much effort.</p>
<p>People are complicated and therefore have many needs. A person has needs in his body, in his soul, and in his spirit. He cannot take care of only one aspect; he must care for all three aspects. If we can speak only of spiritual things and tell people to be spiritual, but we do not care for anything else, then we will have no way to get through. We must remember to be practical in our care.</p>
<p>In our coordination we need saints to preach the gospel, and we also need saints to preach the gospel truths. We cannot merely preach the gospel without speaking the gospel truths; otherwise, the newly saved ones will not be in the meetings after they are baptized. We baptize people every year, but our numbers have not increased because we are unable to keep them. The leading brothers must study how to keep the newly saved ones after they have been baptized. Merely preaching the gospel and baptizing people is inadequate; we must edify the new believers. Hence, the co-workers and elders must come before the Lord and study how they can meet this need. We must be like the widow in the Gospel of Luke who kept bothering the unrighteous judge, asking him to avenge her, until he finally avenged her (18:2-7).</p>
<p>The responsible brothers love one another; but they lack one accord. If the leading brothers are not in one accord, how can the entire church be in one accord? The situation of the church in Taipei depends on the responsible brothers. Taiwan has been blessed by the Lord; the churches are stable because they are kept by Him. But we should not remain in this condition; we must change our practice.</p>
<p>We must bring our situation before the Lord to seek His leading. There are more than twenty thousand brothers and sisters in the church in Taipei. The elders should pray and seek a way to lead and perfect the saints so that all the saints function. When I gave the Life-study training on the Gospel of Luke, I did not merely preach concerning the Gospel of Luke in the meetings. Even while I was resting, I was thinking about the Gospel of Luke. Therefore, I was able to receive light. The responsible brothers in Taipei should not pray and ask the Lord for light on the one hand and sleep peacefully on the other; if they do this, they will not receive light. They should even dream about the church in Taipei. They must continually consider the way to perfect all twenty thousand saints and how to bring the ten thousand children into the church life.</p>
<p>We must dream about the children, the junior high students, the high school students, and the college students. In this way the saints in every meeting hall in the church in Taipei will carry out their function to the highest degree. Some of the elders must receive the burden to dive into these things and to labor on them diligently. If I had returned twenty years ago, this would be our practice in the church in Taipei.</p>
<p>We cannot continue to do things according to the old way. We need to change. If the business community in Taiwan operated according to old ways, Taiwan would have no economy. People in the business world know how to work and make profit. We should be the same. If the elders express their opinions in the church without working, this is a great shame. Opinions nullify our ability to make profit. The Lord&rsquo;s work needs us to work; it does not need us to express our opinions. For example, when others are driving, we do not need to tell them how fast or how slow they should drive. When we drive, we should pay more attention to arriving at our destination with no accidents rather than pay attention to driving at only one speed.</p>
