<p>Now we come to the law of sin and of death. What is this law of sin and of death? I know what my commission is, and I fully admit that my teachings are different from traditional Christian teachings. I don&rsquo;t like to teach anything that is merely traditional. What is the law of sin and of death? The Bible is very logical. The law of sin and of death is the law that the law of the Spirit of life frees us from. We have seen that the first law, the law of the Spirit of life, is God triune, processed, becoming the indwelling Spirit. Surely the other law must be the enemy of God. It must be an opposite law, but not opposite in a simple way. It is also in a very complicated way. How did Satan get into your flesh? Did he simply come in last night while you were dreaming? You have to realize that he came in not in such a simple way. How did Satan get into our flesh? The Bible doesn&rsquo;t tell us so clearly how Satan could become such an evil law. Concerning how the Triune God could become the law of the Spirit of life, the Bible is more than clear, especially in Romans 8. There we have a full definition of how the Triune God has become such a law, the law of the Spirit of life. But the Bible doesn&rsquo;t tell us much about how Satan has become such an evil law, the law of sin and of death. However, in the Bible there is a principle, that with nearly everything God wanted to do, Satan did ahead of God. For example, in creating man, God had an intention to build a city. We know this because the ultimate consummation of the entire Bible is a city, New Jerusalem. But God didn&rsquo;t build His city right away. Even in the Old Testament God desired a city, Jerusalem, among His people. That city was not built so quickly either. Hundreds of years before the people of Israel built Jerusalem in the good land, Babel was built as an expression of Satan. Eventually, Babylon was built, and later in the New Testament the Great Babylon was built. This means that many times Satan&rsquo;s way is to do things ahead of God. God&rsquo;s intention is to enter into man and become man&rsquo;s life and nature. But before God could enter into man, Satan entered into man in Genesis 3. Before God could become man&rsquo;s nature, Satan became man&rsquo;s nature. He did something ahead of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Children of the Devil</h2>
<p>How pitiful that many Christians today make God absolutely objective, and in the same way, they also make Satan objective. For many years people have tried to argue with me and condemn me because I have taught that Satan is in our nature, that we fallen people are one with Satan, and that we are children of the Devil. They consider this to be a heresy. Even today the objective theologians don&rsquo;t believe that Satan is within them. They only believe that Satan is the evil spirit who sometimes comes to you to cause you to do something. Occasionally, this spirit may take over someone in a way of demon possession. They don&rsquo;t believe that Satan is in human nature. Why then does the Bible say that the Lord Jesus called Peter Satan (Matt. 16:23)? Furthermore, how could John in his First Epistle indicate that sinners are children of the Devil (1 John 3:10)? If children do not have the nature of the father, what kind of children are they? They must be children picked up off the street. They must not be born of the father. If any children are born of you, they will surely have your nature. Fallen people were born of Satan; they are Satan&rsquo;s children. So they are one with Satan, with Satan&rsquo;s nature in them.</p>
<p>Some Christians today don&rsquo;t even believe that we have God&rsquo;s nature (2 Pet. 1:4). They don&rsquo;t believe that God is one with us and that we are one with God, that we are God&rsquo;s children. They say this is to deify man, to make man God. They have made everything objective.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_100.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_102.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Perfecting Training &nbsp; pg 101</div><br></body></html>
