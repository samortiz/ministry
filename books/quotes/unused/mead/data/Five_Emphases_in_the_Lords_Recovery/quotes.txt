[1]  CONTENTS The Oneness of the Body of Christ Christ The Spirit The Church The God-ordained Way
[2]  My burden in these messages concerns five important emphases in the Lord's recovery: the oneness of the Body of Christ, Christ, the Spirit, the church, and the God-ordained way.
[3]  In this chapter we want to see the oneness of the Body of Christ.
[4]  It is neither natural nor human, but something of God and something that even is God.
[5]  Ephesians 4:4-6 says, "One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."
[6]  These verses reveal that there is one God and Father, one Lord, one Spirit, and one organism the Body of Christ as the church of the Triune God.
[7]  The issue of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is the organic Body of Christ, which is the living church of the living God.
[8]  Paul speaks of the Triune God in Ephesians 4:4-6 by saying that there is one God and Father, one Lord, and one Spirit.
[9]  We all have to keep the oneness of the Spirit because there is one God and Father as the source with His nature and life; one Lord, the Son, as the very element of the divine life with the divine nature; and one Spirit as the essence of the element of the divine nature and divine life.
[10]  The Uniqueness of His Organism the Body of Christ as the Church of God
[11]  The Lord sowed the seed of life into His disciples and gave them the Father's name.
[12]  The word of God sanctifies the believers, separating them from all things other than God v. 17 . The things of the world within us are a replacement of God.
[13]  We have the Triune God within us, and the Lord is answering His prayer to keep us and make us one.
[14]  CHAPTER TWO CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 1:19; 2:9; 1:18b; Eph 1:22b; 5:23b; 1:23a; Col 1:18a; 3:4a; Eph 3:8, 10; 1:11a; Col 3:11; Eph 1:23; Col 1:27
[15]  The second emphasis in the Lord's recovery is a wonderful person Christ.
[16]  Christ is the central subject of the Bible, and His riches are unsearchable Eph 3:8 .
[17]  The first point in the biography of Christ is in John 1:1: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
[18]  Genesis tells us that man did not take the tree of life.
[19]  The God-ordained name given to this God-man was Jesus.
[20]  Christ lived as a God-man on this earth for thirty years in Nazareth.
[21]  When we listen to His speaking, we see God; when we accept His speaking, we accept God.
[22]  LIVING CHRIST BY GOING ALONG WITH HIM AS OUR INNER PERSON
[23]  One day we heard the gospel, and we repented and confessed our sins.
[24]  Such a church is the issue, the coming out, of the organic Triune God.
[25]  CHAPTER THREE THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19; 2 Cor 13:14; John 7:38-39; Rev 22:1; Rom 8:2; 2 Cor 3:6b; 1 John 5:6b; John 14:16-20; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:18; John 17:17; Eph 4:3; Rev 22:17; Gal 5:16, 25; Rom 8:4; Acts 13:52b; 2:4a; 4:31b THE BIOGRAPHY OF CHRIST
[26]  In this chapter we would like to continue our fellowship concerning the second emphasis in the Lord's recovery Christ.
[27]  According to what is revealed in the Scriptures, Christ is the centrality and universality of God in His move, especially for the completion of His redemption to produce the church.
[28]  After Jesus passed through human living for thirty years, He ministered for three and a half years.
[29]  Before His resurrection He was the only begotten Son of God John 3:16 , the unique Son of God, but His humanity had not been brought into the divine sonship.
[30]  On the evening of the day of His resurrection, He came back to His disciples.
[31]  When He comes again, He will also bring God's kingdom to the earth.
[32]  The Spirit Being the Flow of the Triune God
[33]  The Bible says that God is the living water John 4:10, 14 .
[34]  Second Corinthians 13:14 speaks of the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.
[35]  In this verse we see three persons God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit.
[36]  God, man, the death of Jesus, and the resurrection of Christ are compounded together to be a compound Spirit.
[37]  Today the Spirit of Jesus Christ is not merely the Spirit of divinity but also the compound Spirit of divinity, of humanity, of Jesus' human death, and of Christ's human resurrection compounded together.
[38]  Calling Upon the Name of the Lord to Receive the Spirit
[39]  The Spirit we have today is the consummated Spirit, not the "raw" Spirit.
[40]  CHAPTER FOUR THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 3:9-10; 1:9, 4-5, 10-11, 13, 19-23; 1 Cor 10:32; Rom 16:16b; 1 Cor 14:33b; Acts 8:1; 13:1; 1 Cor 1:2; Rev 1:4, 11; 1 Cor 14:5, 12
[41]  We have seen the oneness of the Body of Christ, Christ, and the Spirit.
[42]  The Spirit is the reality the reality of God, the reality of Christ, the reality of the word, and the reality of the resurrection of Christ.
[43]  In a meeting of the church, we may have the boldness to declare that we are humanly divine.
[44]  THE CHURCH BEING OF GOD'S ECONOMY AND OF GOD'S GOOD PLEASURE
[45]  THE CHURCH BEING THE ISSUE OF THE TRIUNE GOD TO BE THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST
[46]  Eventually, the sealing Spirit makes us the issue of the Triune God to be the organic Body of Christ Eph 1:19-23 .
[47]  We are the issue of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, which is the "inking" of the Triune God into us.
[48]  We, the church as the issue of the Triune God, are the same as He is in the sense that we have His life, His nature, His element, and His essence.
[49]  The organically divine church is the church of God 1 Cor 10:32 , the church of Christ Rom 16:16b , and the church of the saints 1 Cor 14:33b .
[50]  CHAPTER FIVE THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY Scripture Reading: Rom 15:16; 1 Pet 2:5, 9; John 21:15; 1 Thes 2:7; 1 Pet 2:2; Heb 10:24-25; Eph 4:12; 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 12, 23-26, 31, 39a; Acts 6:4; 4:31
[51]  In the previous chapter, we saw that the church is divine in life, nature, element, and essence.
[52]  First Timothy 3:15 says, "But if I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth."
[53]  First Corinthians 12:12 reveals that the church is the corporate Christ.
[54]  This verse says, "For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ."
[55]  All the believers of Christ are organically united with Him, are constituted with His life and element, and have thus become His Body, an organism, to express Him.
[56]  For the Believers to Preach the Gospel, to Serve and Worship God, to Meet, and to Build Up the Church, God Has Ordained in His Holy Word the Following Items as the Proper Way: Practicing the New Testament Priesthood for the Saving of Sinners That They May Become the Members of the Body of Christ
[57]  To preach the gospel is to practice the New Testament priesthood for the saving of sinners that they may become the members of the Body of Christ Rom 15:16; 1 Pet 2:5, 9 .
[58]  We all are priests, but we may not be clear that the New Testament priesthood is to offer sinners to God.
[59]  Feeding the Young Believers as a Nursing Mother That They May Grow in the Spiritual Life
[60]  After someone gets saved through us, we should consider that he is our spiritual child.
