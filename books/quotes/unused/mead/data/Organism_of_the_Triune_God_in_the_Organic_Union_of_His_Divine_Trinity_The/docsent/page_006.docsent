   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO IN THE ORGANIC UNION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY 1 Scripture Reading: Rom 6:8a, 6; Eph 2:5-6a; 4:4; John 4:24a; 1 John 5:6b; John 16:13; Eph 2:18; Phil 1:19; Matt 28:19b; Rom 8:2; 2 Cor 3:6b; 1 Cor 15:45b; Rev 1:4b; 4:5b; 5:6b</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The title of this small book is The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The organism of the Triune God is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The organism is of a divine person the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This organism is in the organic union of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The divine Trinity, strictly speaking, does not refer to the person but to something of the person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The divine Trinity is of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The organism refers to a corporate person, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the organic union refers to something of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The divine Trinity and the organic union are two matters that are abstract, mysterious, wonderful, profound, excellent, and therefore, difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The organic union is a union of life, by life, and with life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the divine Trinity, there is such an organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The very salvation which we have received and which is being experienced by us day by day is in the organic union of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may also say that our salvation is in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But where is Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some may think that Jesus is far away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But Romans 10 tells us that He is near us, even in our mouth v. 8 . The unbelievers need to realize that the Savior, Jesus, is in our mouth just like the air.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The air that we breathe is always in our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How can we breathe the Lord in?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By calling O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we heard the gospel, repented of our sins, and believed in the Lord Jesus, we called upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we called Lord Jesus, something happened within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We received the Lord as our peace, joy, rest, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we try to call on other names, nothing happens within us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we call O George Washington, O Plato, save me, or O Confucius, nothing will happen within us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is only one name that we can call upon with a guarantee that something will happen within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to call O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, we have a sweet feeling within us because something transpires within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Any other name in the universe that we call upon will not give us such an inward feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever we mention the name of Jesus, we have an inner feeling of sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His name is a dear name, a sweet name, a precious name, an excellent name, an uplifting name, a comforting name, an enlightening name, a life-giving name, and a saving name.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can use many wonderful adjectives to describe the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this name is the organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we call upon the name of Jesus, an organic union transpires within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are organically united to the Lord, and He is organically united to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is a union in life, an organic union, between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may not have been aware that we had such an inward organic union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were just ourselves apart from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we were saved, however, something wonderful transpired within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I can still remember the day that I received the Lord in my hometown in mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I was born into Christianity, and I attended denominational meetings for many years without being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I was nineteen years old, a young lady came to our city to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I went to hear her preach one afternoon, and while I was listening to her speaking, I was caught by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I believed in the Lord, but no one taught me how to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>While I was walking back home from the meeting, I stopped on the street, looked up at the heavens, and prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I told the Lord that I loved Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I told Him that even if the whole world could be given to me, I did not want it; I just wanted Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After that prayer, I had the deep sensation that Someone was always with me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Another One is with us regenerated Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have an organic union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As a young man, I was fond of playing soccer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After I was saved, I continued to play soccer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On one occasion I attempted to kick the soccer ball, and I could not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then I went back home, and that was the end of my soccer playing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Why did I quit playing?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It was because of my inward organic union with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are united with the Lord Jesus organically.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This organic union is accomplished and transpires within us when we believe in our hearts and when we call on His name with our mouths Rom 10:9 .</S>
