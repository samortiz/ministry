   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was the only begotten Son of God from eternity John 1:18; 3:16 , but He needed to be begotten again in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29 .</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Another speaking came out according to the divine concept.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many preachers have spoken on Psalm 1, exalting this psalm.</S>
