   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY MESSAGE EIGHT A GOOD MINISTER OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 4:6-16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 4:6 Paul uses the expression "a good minister of Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A minister of Christ is one who serves others with Christ, ministering Christ as Savior, life, life supply, and every positive thing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He differs from a teacher of the law and of other things 1:7, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. LAYING THESE THINGS BEFORE THE BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A minister of Christ does not mainly denote a minister who belongs to Christ, but a person who ministers Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is one who serves people with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, if we say that a man is a serving one of a particular meal, we do not mean, of course, that he belongs to the meal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We mean that he serves others with that meal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In like manner, although it is true that a minister of Christ belongs to Christ, the main thought here is that he serves others with Christ, ministering Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not only does he belong to Christ, but he serves Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In today's Christianity there are a great many ministers who belong to Christ, but very few of them minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To be a minister of Christ does not primarily mean to preach Christ, teach Christ, or tell others about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The main significance of this term is ministering Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 6 confirms this understanding of the expression "a good minister of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here Paul says, "Laying these things before the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, being nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which you have closely followed."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By "these things" Paul means all he has covered thus far in this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Just as a steward lays different courses of food before guests at a dinner, so a good minister of Christ should lay "these things" before the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, Paul's use of the term "being nourished" indicates that his concept is that of supplying life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is significant that here Paul does not say "being taught," but "being nourished" with the words of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we would minister Christ to others, we ourselves must first be nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Being nourished with Christ, we shall have Christ as food, as life supply, to minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The words "being nourished" give us the ground to say that a good minister of Christ does not merely teach others about Christ, but ministers Christ into others as food.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Others should be able to testify of us that we have nourished them with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Throughout the years, my aim in the ministry has been to nourish the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No doubt I have passed on a good deal of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But I can testify that in every message, I exercise my spirit not just to pass on knowledge, but, while I am giving forth a certain kind of knowledge, to supply something nourishing to the Lord's people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>My desire is to minister the riches of Christ as food that the saints may be nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Recently, many have written me letters telling how they have been richly fed with Christ through the messages.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you have a heart to care for others in the Lord's recovery, you should not give them mere teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever you fellowship with others concerning Christ, you may give them some knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But while you are teaching them, you need to exercise your spirit to minister spiritual food that they may be nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you do this, you will be a good minister of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With Paul and Timothy we see an excellent pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we have pointed out, Paul told Timothy to lay "these things before the brothers," referring to the things which he was writing in this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, before Timothy could lay these things before others, he first had to feed on them himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He had to digest them, assimilate them, and allow them to saturate his inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then he would be able to lay them before the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today we should follow Timothy's example and lay before the saints the things with which we have been nourished by the Lord through the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How wonderful the church life would be if we all did this!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, if we turn from the ministry and seek to produce something different, we may give place to differing teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was not Timothy's intention to teach anything different from what Paul taught.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Rather, he would lay before the brothers what he had received from Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At this point, I would like to say a word concerning my burden in putting out the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The aim of these messages is to produce groceries for the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>My burden is not mainly to "cook" these spiritual groceries; it is to produce them and supply them to the churches that every local church may be a well-stocked supermarket, filled with a variety of nourishing foods.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the leading ones in a local church lay before the saints the riches contained in the Life-studies, the saints will be abundantly nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have received many letters testifying that this has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is a fact of history in the Lord's recovery that any church which follows the ministry is strong and blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But those churches which neglect the ministry and try instead to do something on their own have become a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, in saying these things, I wish to make it very clear that I by no means insist that the churches or the saints read the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To repeat, my burden is to produce groceries.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The churches and the saints are free either to use them or to disregard them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But if the saints cast away the nourishment found in these messages, I wonder what they will feed on.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we eat the "groceries" produced in today's religion, we shall be part of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let me say in frankness and honesty that the leading ones need to take "these things" and lay them before the saints that they may be nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Paul's expression "laying these things before the brothers" is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to be impressed with the fact that this also is part of the Bible, the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I do not charge anyone to lay my words before the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is not my practice to charge the churches to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Representatives of hundreds of churches can testify that I do not charge them to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I do not even know many of the things that take place in the church in Anaheim, where I live.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am very glad that the elders take action regarding many things without letting me know.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is a strong proof that I am not a pope.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Very much to the contrary, I am a little servant of the Lord, a farmer burdened to produce groceries for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Far from charging the churches to do anything, I simply long that they feed on the spiritual riches the Lord has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do not lay Witness Lee's teaching before the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Instead, present them the riches, the groceries, the Lord has shown us from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I am deeply burdened by the fact that many who love the Lord Jesus and seek Him have been deceived and frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must find a way to share with them the spiritual riches the Lord has provided us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Many who truly love the Lord are starving.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must take up the burden to supply them with food.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We all need to be good ministers of Christ, serving others with His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Let us first be nourished ourselves and then minister this nourishment to all the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We would emphasize that being nourished is for the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is a matter of life and it differs from merely being taught, which is a matter of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To minister Christ to others requires that we ourselves first be nourished with the words of life concerning Christ.</S>
