   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Vision of the Work</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The work in every place today has not been carried out well.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is in the initial stages.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, the vision is before you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From now on you need to work in this way every day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only after we reverse the direction will we be right.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If all the brothers and sisters have not yet risen up, you must continue working until they all rise up to work and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It should always be the church that serves and preaches the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This way is right, and this is the New Testament church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Need to Rise Up to Build the Temple</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Please remember that Catholicism is the church in captivity in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many Bible readers admit this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the children of Israel were taken captive to Babylon, the church was also taken captive to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Protestantism came back from Babylon, but they did not build the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even though many came back from Babylon, the temple was not there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today you and I must be those in church history who rise up to build the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are a people like Nehemiah, building the temple and learning to raise up God s church again in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many have come out of Babylon but still have a Babylonian appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even today they still do not look like the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Catholicism is very structured.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Protestantism is less structured, but being less structured is still not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order for there to be a local church, the church must preach the gospel and the church must serve.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Within the next few years, I hope to repeat these two phrases ten thousand times: The church needs to preach the gospel and the church needs to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only then is it the church; otherwise, it is an incomprehensible gathering, very much unlike the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers, in the beginning it will indeed be hard.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But you need to see the vision accurately and clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Being the church requires that we preach the gospel as the church; being the church requires that we serve as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, responsible brothers and sisters, you need to gather together often to discuss and to pray: O Lord, how can we cause all of the brothers and sisters to rise up?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our way is not that we ourselves always put our hands to the work, but that we cause others to work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is wrong for us to take care of everything while the brothers and sisters do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It should be that we work with the purpose of leading them to work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we work in order to induce them to come out and work, this is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They must be busy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should place each one of them, making arrangements so that everyone is preaching the gospel and serving.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At that time we will realize that this way is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Church Always Needing to Be</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>in the Freedom of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I think that in the local churches the service in the word is already adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These few points are sufficient to meet the local need.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Concerning the mutual edifying in 1 Corinthians 14, if the local brothers are strong, the Saturday night meetings will be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the local brothers are not strong, the Saturday night meetings will not be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I think every child of God must admit that the strongest supply of the word was that which was among the Brethren a century ago.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is something amazing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why was the supply of the word so strong and so abundant in the last century?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was because they were working according to the principle of 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Holy Spirit had freedom there.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even though they had much insignificant speaking, they also had much substantial speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Without this principle they could not have had what they had at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, during the Saturday night meetings, even though many who should not speak will rise up, there will also be the opportunity for those who should speak to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once the Holy Spirit has the freedom, you can expect the Holy Spirit to speak in the church and operate in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church must always be in the freedom of the Holy Spirit.</S>
