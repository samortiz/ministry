   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT CHRISTIAN LIFE AND ITS SUFFERINGS 10 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 4:12-19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to 4:12-19.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This section of 1 Peter speaks of rejoicing in sharing the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>PURIFIED THROUGH FIERY ORDEALS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 12 Peter says, Beloved, do not think the fiery ordeal among you is strange, which is coming to you for a trial, as a strange thing happening to you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek, for fiery ordeal, purosei, means burning, signifying the burning of a smelting furnace for the purification of gold and silver Prov 27:21; Psa 66:10 , like the metaphor used in 1:7.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Peter considered the persecution the believers suffered as such a burning furnace used by God to purify their life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is God s way to deal with the believers in the judgment of His governmental administration, which begins from His own household 4:17-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Greek word for strange in verse 12 is xenizo, the same as the word used in verse 4.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Fiery persecution is common to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They should not think it is strange or alien to them and be surprised and astonished by it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This persecution is a trial, a testing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Peter s use of the metaphor of a burning furnace in verse 12 indicates that today the Lord is using persecutions and trials as a furnace to serve a positive purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The positive purpose served by persecution and trial is the purification of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can be compared to gold and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, we still have some amount of dross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we need purification.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As gold and silver are purified through burning, we also need to be purified in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 12 Peter tells the believers not to regard the fiery ordeal as strange.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As Christians, we should realize that fiery ordeals are common.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Persecutions and trials are the common experience of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such things are not strange, alien, foreign, to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the contrary, they are common, for we have been appointed to them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is our destiny to suffer in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of course, this is not our eternal destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has not destined us to suffer in eternity, but He surely has destined us to suffer in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>SHARING THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 13 Peter continues, But according as you share the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, that at the unveiling of His glory you may also rejoice exultingly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although persecution is a trial that purifies us through burning, eventually Peter says that by experiencing such a fiery ordeal we share, participate in, the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here Peter is saying that it is possible for the sufferings a Christian undergoes to be the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How can the persecutions suffered by us be the sufferings of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we were not Christians, we certainly would not suffer the kind of persecution described in verses 12 and 13.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such persecutions are due to the fact that we are Christians, men of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because we believe in Christ, love Christ, live Christ, bear testimony to Christ, witnessing of Him in this age, the world rises up against us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This age is under the hand of the evil one, and for this reason unbelieving ones persecute those who believe in Christ and witness of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the sight of God this kind of suffering is regarded as the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, a certain brother may have had the opportunity to become rich.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But because he believes in Christ, loves Christ, and follows Christ, his business may suffer, and he may lose the opportunity to become wealthy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, he may even be in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This kind of poverty is the suffering of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those sufferings that are for Christ are counted by God as the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ lived a life of suffering, a suffering life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we are His partners living the same kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to the book of Hebrews, we are not only partakers of Christ but are also His partners Heb 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We cooperate with Him in living a life of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We follow Him along the way of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that what Christ suffered, we also suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, when we suffer for Christ in this way, our sufferings are counted by God as the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not be discouraged because we must suffer as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These sufferings are positive and very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What a privilege it is to experience the sufferings of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul could even say that he made up what was lacking of the sufferings of Christ for the sake of His Body, the church Col 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He also speaks in Philippians 3:10 concerning the fellowship of Christ s sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today we should be Christians, followers of Christ, who undergo the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to participate not only in the riches of Christ, but also in the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we take this point of view, we shall be encouraged whenever we suffer for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We may even welcome this kind of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yes, we may face fiery ordeals, but these are the sufferings of Christ in which we have the privilege to participate.</S>
