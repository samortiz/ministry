   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE WAY TO HAVE THE GROWTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF CHRIST WITHIN US Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:6-7; Mark 4:14-20; Eph 4:15, 13m; 2:21; 1 Pet 2:2-3, 5; Col 2:19; 2 Pet 1:1, 3-4; 3:18; 2 Cor 3:17-18</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that God, Christ, the Spirit, and the Word are all life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, we have seen that the way to take in God is by contacting the Spirit and the Word through calling on the Lord in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the spiritual breathing, drinking, and eating.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We eat by drinking, drink by breathing, and breathe by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever we call on the Lord by praying and reading the Word, we take the Lord into us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord today is in the Spirit and in the Word, and He even is the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both the Spirit and the Word are the breath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Spirit is the pneuma, the breath, and the Word is God's divine breath.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So the way for us to take in the Word and the Spirit is to breathe, and the way to breathe is to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is so clear and simple, yet so real and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE GROWTH OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this chapter we want to go on to see that life grows.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Anything living always grows, and growth is the issue of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is always some issue that comes out of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first issue of life is growth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All forms of life the human life, animal life, and vegetable life exhibit growth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The divine life is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The divine life is the highest life, the life on the highest plane.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because the divine life is the highest life, it has the highest growth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul said, "I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth" 1 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I wish to say a word to all the dear ones who are serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to listen to the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He said, "I planted."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He did not say, "I taught."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With mere teaching nothing grows.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But anything planted is something of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With life there is growth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So we Christian workers have to learn not to merely teach, but to plant.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul also said that Apollos watered.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today among the Christians teaching and edification are spoken about.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But how many speak about our need to be watered?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to water the brothers, not merely edify them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The brothers need the watering.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The dry plants need the watering.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to change our terminology from edifying to watering.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brothers, I need your watering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you always come to a plant to edify and correct it, the plant will die.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, you should water it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the same way, we should not try to correct the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead, we should water them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In a sense, we should let them be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Just water them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not say, "Brother, you shouldn't be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You are too much in your anger.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You need some correction."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you do this, you will kill him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What he needs is not correction but watering.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A brother's anger is like a germ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sometimes the germ has to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the germ is kept in, it kills.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This brother needs to be watered.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ is life, and life needs the planting and the watering.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christianity today has become a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A religion needs teaching and correcting, but Christ is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul said that he planted and Apollos watered.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Following this, God came in to give the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I am happy to see that many young ones among us are growing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some came to me with a concern about the young men with long hair and beards who have come to our meetings, but we just need to water them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The more Christ grows within them, the more the long hair and beards will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is not by teaching but by growth, and the growth needs the watering.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Just water people and be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do not correct others in a quick way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>That really kills.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Water them so that they may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In a sense, growth is not so fast.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The mothers with children know this.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today is about the same as yesterday, and tomorrow will be about the same as today as far as the growth of their children is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we look at our children day by day, every day they seem to be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But praise the Lord, after one year and another year, they are not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After a certain period of time, the growth can be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Life grows.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It seems quite slow, but actually it is really fast.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>A mother mainly feeds her children, and this is what causes the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>First Corinthians 3:9 says that the church is God's farm, God's cultivated land.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The farm, the church, grows Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Over the years we have seen the growth of Christ in many dear ones.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They have been transformed, not by teaching but by growing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We have to check with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When we say that we take in Christ as life, what is the issue?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Of course, we cannot expect to be full-grown in a quick way, but after a period of time, we should be able to see some difference.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You have been calling on the Lord for a while, but has there been any growth?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If you are still the same as you were six weeks ago, I am concerned for you.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If you remain the same, that means there is the shortage of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If you eat properly, without any illness, be sure that after six weeks you will show forth your growth.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We all need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we do mean business in calling on the name of the Lord, I am sure that there will be growth.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If there is no growth, something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is impossible for there to be no issue of growth if we are taking in Christ day by day.</S>
