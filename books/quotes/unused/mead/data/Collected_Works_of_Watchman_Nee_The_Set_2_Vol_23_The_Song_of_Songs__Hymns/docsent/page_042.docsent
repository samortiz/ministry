   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 11 says, "Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before the believers are raptured, the Holy Spirit wants them to pay attention to one thing the reward of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Solomon has his vineyards; they are his fields, and he leases them out to the keepers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord's work is not ours; our position is forever that of a steward.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are merely keeping watch over His business.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When He comes, what He entrusted to us will return to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Baalhamon" means "the lord of all."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This shows us that the Lord, like Solomon, is the lord of everything; He is also our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Solomon's charge was that the keepers would have the fruits; but for the fruits that they harvested, they would have to give Solomon a thousand pieces of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord will also give us the fruit of what we keep, tend, and raise for Him today; that will be our reward.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nothing that we do for the Lord is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even a cup of water that we give away will be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Solomon will have his share as well.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The one thousand pieces of silver are the account that we have to give to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is different from what is recorded in Luke 19 and Matthew 25.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There we see a difference based on our gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here the one thousand pieces of silver are what each keeper should give to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we stand before the judgment seat, the Lord has a minimum requirement for each one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This requirement is the one thousand pieces of silver here.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 12 says, "My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The maiden now separates herself from the other keepers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She is not an ordinary keeper of the vineyards of Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Solomon gave her a vineyard once; therefore, she has her own vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This vineyard is now "before me," which means that the vineyard is hers Gen 13:9 and that it is under her direction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to righteousness, the keepers should pay Solomon a thousand pieces of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to love, should she do less than what the law requires?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Of course not!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She should give Solomon a thousand pieces of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here we see two kinds of services.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some serve according to the law, whereas others serve according to love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some serve out of fear, whereas others serve out of gratitude.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some serve as a duty, whereas others serve as a joy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although she stands on a higher ground, and although she has a love relationship with the Lord and is different from others who serve Him out of a sense of duty, nevertheless, she does not give less than what the Lord's duty requires.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not only does Solomon receive something; those who keep watch over the fruits also receive something.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She renders rightful glory and praise to all those helping her in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She does not take over their rightful portion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>May God's children not usurp the glory of their co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord rewards His workers, she will be included among those keeping the fruits; she will receive the two hundred pieces of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to righteousness, she should only receive the fruits and not the silver S.S. 8:11 . However, all those who serve the Lord in love will find that when they do not take the Lord's work as a commercial enterprise, the Lord will not reward them on a commercial basis.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In addition to receiving her fruits, the Lord bestows glory on her.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The judgment seat should be something along the line of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, the emphasis here is not on responsibility but on love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The question of work and reward should not have been brought up.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, the Holy Spirit mentions it from the standpoint of love, not from the standpoint of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is mentioned because it matches the principle of the whole book.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 13 says, "Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"Thou" refers to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"The gardens" are plural in number.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is not only dwelling in the garden of the maiden 6:2 but dwelling in many other gardens as well.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is the Lord who dwells in the hearts of men.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is not only dwelling in the heart of one who follows Him absolutely, but He is dwelling in the hearts of all those whom He delights in. The maiden addresses Him according to this relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>She says to Him, "The companions hearken to thy voice."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The word "hearken" means that everyone is listening.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All those who are seeking the Lord together with her adopt the same attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They have been dealt with, and they know the futility of speaking and the profit of hearkening.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They know that they have to be slow to speak in order to be quick to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Both she and they are no longer as talkative as they once were; they no longer babble about their condition before the Lord as soon as they acquire some experience.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That conduct is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They no longer insist on speaking like others do, and they no longer speak for the sake of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who cannot stop talking about trivial things still have the earthly life reigning within them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But these are listening; they adopt the attitude of a hearer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They know that their lives depend on the Lord's words and their work depends on the Lord's commands.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They will only listen, because they cannot and will not move by themselves any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Without the Lord's words, they will not have any revelation, light, or knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The life of the believers hinges totally upon the Lord's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>"O Lord, while we are waiting to hearken, make us hear.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If those who seek find, and if those who knock have the door opened to them, make us hear, and make us able to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If Jehovah will not speak to us, we will be like those who are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What use is there in hearing something if it is not heard in a real way?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, please allow us to hear Your voice, because only this can guide us until Your return."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>She has learned her lessons by now; therefore, she offers up such a profound prayer toward the end.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Verse 14 says, "Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>These words are the same as in 2:17.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is the same prayer, but the things that are referred to are not the same in both cases.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This book mentions the wilderness two times, and in the same way, it mentions the Lord's coming as "a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices" two times.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The first time on the mountains refers to His fellowship with the believers; it shows His longing for an absolute fellowship with the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But then the shadows had not fled and the day had not yet broken, that is, the Lord had not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The emphasis was fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Therefore, we saw Him upon the mountains of Bether; He was clearing away everything that was causing "separation."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But the second refers to the Lord's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This coming is in the future, and though it may be very near, no one knows when it will be.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Unlike the case in chapter two, it does not have a time limit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The matter is not fellowship; therefore, this verse does not speak of the mountains of Bether, but of the mountains of spices.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It describes the condition of the Lord's coming and His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>At that time, it will be a marvelous world, one like the mountains of spices.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then the maiden's experience will be like a drop of water that has disappeared into the ocean; there will no more room for advancement, though the tide can always go deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>All that is left in the world is just her body.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Everything else has gone to another world.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Therefore, she cannot help but cry, "Make haste, my beloved."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>"Come as quickly as the roe or a young hart.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Just as a roe or a young hart appears on the mountains of spices, may You come in Your kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Although the love is perfect, something is still lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When He comes, faith will be turned to facts, and praise will replace prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Love will consummate in a shadowless perfection, and we will serve Him in the sinless domain.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>What a day that will be!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Lord Jesus, come quickly!</S>
