   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All Things Accomplished</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After He had set up this pattern, Christ went through death and resurrection to become the Spirit in order that He might enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is only as the Spirit that He can be received into us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After resurrection He ascended into the heavens to assume His position.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There as a man He was enthroned, crowned, and made Lord and Head of all.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This very One came down on the day of Pentecost and is still with us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All God's intention has already been realized.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is nothing which has not been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When were we reborn?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was when Jesus was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When were we crucified?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was when Jesus was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When were the local churches brought forth?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was not when we began to meet around the Lord's table, but when Jesus was resurrected from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In His resurrection and ascension the church has been produced, and we have been brought to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not only has this One accomplished all God's purpose; He Himself includes His accomplishments.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The incarnation is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The human living as a pattern is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Death, resurrection, and ascension are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The life-giving Spirit is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is a composition of whatever He has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His accomplishments are components of Him,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we receive this Christ into us, we receive creation, incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension into us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is an all-inclusive drink.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To drink of Him as the life-giving Spirit is to drink of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such is the scope of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It extends from eternity past to eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE FOCUS OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All things have been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our need is to experience this, not to try to accomplish things ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The focus of the gospel is that God comes into us to be everything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to experience what He has become, all that He has done, and all that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose as your father I prepare everything you need.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I grow fruits and vegetables for you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I raise cows, lambs, and chickens so you will have meat.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You do not need to produce the crops nor raise the animals.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Your job is simply to enjoy all the things I have prepared for you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I can prepare them, but I cannot enjoy them for you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That you must do.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is an inadequate illustration of what the Triune God in the Son and as the Spirit has done.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He has accomplished everything needful, and it is now available to us in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our part is to receive, enjoy, and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the focus of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>John 1:11-12 says, "He came to His own, and those who were His own did not receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The earlier verses tell us how this One came.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He came as God, as life, and as light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 14 adds that He came in the flesh and as a tabernacle and that He was full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He came!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He came with an expectation that His people would receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But they did not.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On His side it was a matter of coming; on our side it is a matter of receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He has not only come, but has also accomplished all things by His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now it is up to us to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Have you received Him?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To what extent?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In what way?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"Of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace" 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How much have you received of His fullness?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is vaster than an ocean, but you may have received only four ounces!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Paul mentions these limitless dimensions of Christ in Ephesians 3:18-19.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His fullness is eternally wide.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The concept of the hymnwriter is too small:</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>And to an ocean fulness, His mercy doth expand.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hymns, #206</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His fullness far exceeds any global measurement.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>An ocean is a poor comparison!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Who can measure the breadth and length and height and depth of the fullness we received?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>And we received grace upon grace.</S>
