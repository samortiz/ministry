<h1 class="title">THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TRUTH<br />
IN EPHESIANS</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to see the crucial points in Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the Ephesians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS TO THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:3 says, &ldquo;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.&rdquo; This particular, crucial point comprises verses 3 through 14 of chapter one. In this portion of the Word are the Father&rsquo;s selection and predestination, speaking forth God&rsquo;s eternal purpose (vv. 3-6), the Son&rsquo;s redemption, speaking forth the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose (vv. 7-12), and the Spirit&rsquo;s sealing and pledging, speaking forth the application of God&rsquo;s accomplished purpose (vv. 13-14). God&rsquo;s blessings to the church are comprised of the Father&rsquo;s being and doing, the Son&rsquo;s being and doing, and the Spirit&rsquo;s being and doing. The main thing that issues from this threefold blessing is the sonship. Ephesians 1:5 tells us that the Father has predestinated us unto sonship. The Father&rsquo;s selection and predestination are for sonship, are unto sonship. Sonship is the goal of His selection and predestination. The Son&rsquo;s redemption is also to bring forth the sonship, and the Spirit&rsquo;s sealing and pledging are for the purpose of sonship. Thus, the threefold blessing of the Triune God is for sonship, to produce the sonship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLE&rsquo;S PRAYER FOR THE CHURCH<br />
REGARDING REVELATION</h2>
<p>The Apostle Paul&rsquo;s prayer in Ephesians 1:15-23 is magnificent. Paul prays that we might have &ldquo;a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him&rdquo; (v. 17). Such a spirit is given to us by God that we may have wisdom and revelation to know Him and His economy. Verses 18 through 23 tell us that the eyes of our heart need to be enlightened that we may know three marvelous things: the hope of His calling, the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe (vv. 18-19). This magnificent prayer as a crucial point of the truth in Ephesians has been more than adequately covered in the footnotes of the Recovery Version and the Life-study Messages of Ephesians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEAD IN OFFENSES AND SINS</h2>
<p>Before we were saved, we were dead. &ldquo;Being dead&rdquo; (2:1) refers to the death of our spirit that pervades our entire being. Being dead in our offenses and sins, we &ldquo;once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit who now is operating in the sons of disobedience; among whom also we all behaved ourselves once in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest&rdquo; (2:2-3). &ldquo;This world&rdquo; refers to the satanic system composed of many ages. Hence, &ldquo;the age&rdquo; here refers to a part, a section, an aspect, the present and modern appearance of the system of Satan, which is used by him to usurp and occupy people and keep them away from God and His purpose. When we were dead in offenses and sins, we walked according to the age, the modern appearance, the present course of the world, the satanic system.</p>
<p>When we were dead in offenses and sins, we also behaved according to the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires not only of the flesh but also of the thoughts. Three evil things&mdash;the age of this world outside of us, the ruler of the aerial authority above and within us, and the lusts of our flesh in our fallen nature&mdash;dominated our life. From these evil things we have been saved to be the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING MADE ALIVE</h2>
<p>This crucial point is covered in 2:4-10. To make us alive is the initial step of God&rsquo;s salvation in life. Following this, God raised us up from the death position. From our standpoint we have been raised up from our death position one by one. But in God&rsquo;s view we were all raised up together, just as all the Israelites were raised up together from the death waters of the Red Sea (Exo. 14). The third step of God&rsquo;s salvation in life is to seat us together in the heavenlies. He not only raised us up from the death position, but He also seated us in the highest place in the universe. When we were dead, we were &ldquo;in the tomb.&rdquo; Now we are not in the tomb, but in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus. The heavenlies not only indicates the heavenly place, but also the heavenly nature, state, characteristic, and atmosphere. The sphere, atmosphere, condition, and reality which we are in now are heavenly.</p>
<p>Eventually, we become the masterpiece of God (2:10). Paul tells us in 2:10 that we are His workmanship. The Greek word for workmanship can also be translated into masterpiece. This Greek word is <em>poiema</em>, which means something which has been made, a handiwork, or something which has been written or composed as a poem. This is not only poetic writing, but also any work of art that expresses the maker&rsquo;s wisdom and design. We, the church, the masterpiece of God&rsquo;s work, are also a poem, expressing God&rsquo;s infinite wisdom and divine design. We, the church, as the masterpiece of God&rsquo;s work, are an absolutely new item in the universe, a new invention by God. We have been created by God in Christ through regeneration to be His new creation (2 Cor. 5:17). Our being made alive is so that we might become God&rsquo;s new creation, His masterpiece.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
