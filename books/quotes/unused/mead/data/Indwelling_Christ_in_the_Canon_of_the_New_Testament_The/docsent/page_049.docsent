   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A WARNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, this book also has a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It does not warn us to beware of sinful things, but rather of philosophy and the rudiments of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ Col 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This refers to the thought, the science, and the philosophy of human culture.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Philosophy may be considered as one of the best elements of human culture.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Among human inventions, it is considered the best, yet we must realize that it is the most subtle instrument of the enemy to distract people from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once philosophy enters man s mind, it is exceedingly difficult for that person to come to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some real Christians today have been distracted from Christ by a kind of Christian philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But any kind of philosophy is the subtle work of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All philosophies are satanic and demonic.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why this book tells us to beware of philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Of course, the outward appearance is always attractive, but it is subtly attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through philosophy, many minds have been fully saturated with demonic thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is why we must beware of it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even theology becomes a kind of philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We will take theos, but we don t want the -ology.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Beware of any kind of -ology.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>WALK IN A LIVING PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason we must learn to walk in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have received Him, so now we must walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even in the matter of the church life, we must be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the church life our fellowship is not of any kind of -ology.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our fellowship is of a living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is as we walk in this Person that He becomes our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is not only our Person, but also our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And He is God s mystery, containing all the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As such, He must have first place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then He will become our life and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>CHRIST IS ALL IN ALL</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, Colossians shows us the new man, where Christ is all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be in the new man means to be in the practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this life, there is nothing of the old nature, but Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>So many Christians believe that this is not possible today on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They say that we must wait until the future; then Christ will be all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We agree that Christ will be all and in all in the future, but here it does not say that Christ will be all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It says that in the new man, Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Right now in the church life, Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE CONSUMMATION OF THE INDWELLING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is only possible by the indwelling of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This book is the consummation of the indwelling of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Otherwise, how could Christ be our portion?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And how could He have first place in our life?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is only by His indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By His indwelling we enjoy Him as the mystery of God, the fulness of the Godhead, our life, and our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, we must beware of anything that distracts us from this indwelling Christ, especially any kind of -ology.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead, as we have received Christ, we must simply walk in Him, taking Him as our Person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then eventually, in the church life, there will be nothing of the old nature.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ will be all and in all through His indwelling of all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I do pray that all the churches, by God s grace, will practice the indwelling of Christ.</S>
