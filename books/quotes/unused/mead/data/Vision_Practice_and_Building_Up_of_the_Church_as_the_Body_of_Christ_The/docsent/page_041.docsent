   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BUILDING BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TEST OF OUR SPIRITUALITY Genuine Spirituality Being for God s Building</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In addition to seeing the vision of God s building, we also need to see what the building is in practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The building is the test of every kind of spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We ourselves are not the standard by which our spirituality is tested for its genuineness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, we must put our spirituality on the doorstep of the building to be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You may be very spiritual, but you may be too individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The individualistic spirituality is not the genuine one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The genuine, real spirituality must be for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If someone considers that he is spiritual, yet he is independent, individualistic, and isolated from the Body, his spirituality is a deception.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Someone may be very humble, but whether this humility is genuine and spiritual or false and natural can be tested only by the building.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are many humble persons, but they are too independent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are not related to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are individualistically humble, humble in an isolated way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may have nice, good, and humble brothers of this kind among us, and we may all appreciate such persons.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, if we have a vision from a mountaintop, we can look down and see the actual situation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let us tear down this kind of natural humility.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is too individualistic and isolated, and it even damages.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no relatedness with this kind of humility.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>True and genuine spirituality is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we can have the building up, then to be proud or humble does not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not want to be praised by others for our humility yet damage the building with it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In God s concern, what matters is not our spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Strictly speaking, God is concerned not for spirituality but for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regardless of how good, humble, and spiritual we consider ourselves to be, let us be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How much are we in the building?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How much are we built up and related with others?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God s aim is not to have a group of nice Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His aim is to build us up together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He does not want precious stones in a museum for an exhibition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He wants to have a house built up with the precious materials.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You may be precious, but you are still not built up with others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If this is the case, you are good only for an exhibition; you are not good for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God made the precious materials for the building, not for an individualistic display.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In a certain place some saints recommended a sister, saying, She is so spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She is quiet and always so nice to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In actuality, this sister was nice to everyone, but she was not nice for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She had been in that city for many years without being related to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She was considered very spiritual, but she was not connected.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She was nice in an isolated, individualistically spiritual way that was not for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must not appreciate this kind of spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The test of our spirituality is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Applying the Test of the Building</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>to Solve All the Problems</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>and Answer All the Questions</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In a certain place there were two parties of brothers who were dissenting and fighting with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually both parties came to me, wanting to see which side was right and which was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After I listened to both groups for a long time, they said, We know that you will not take sides, but we still wish to know how you feel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you say we are right, we will receive your word, and if you say we are wrong, we will receive that also.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At that time I did not check to see who was right and who was wrong, as if by using the law of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, I applied the test of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I checked with them, saying, Brothers, please consider how much you are in the building.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Is what you are doing here good for the building?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Is it a gain for the building, or is it a loss?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Does it help the building, or does it frustrate it?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You may be entirely right, but you are still a hindrance, a frustration, to the building.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then some of them prayed with tears: O Lord, forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We felt that what we were doing was right, even according to the Word, but we have been damaging the building.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then the other brothers said, We are clear now.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We too have been damaging the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On that day many brothers became clear, not by checking with the law of Moses but by the test of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They wept, prayed, and repented to the Lord, asking Him to forgive and deliver them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>From that time onward, no one among those brothers spoke of who was right and who was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They realized that it is not a matter of right and wrong but of whether or not we are built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Today is not the day of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today is the day of the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What God is seeking after today is not that we keep the requirements of the law but that we fulfill the requirements of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the real test of our spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Even if we feel that we have not seen the vision, we should still put ourselves and specific things about us on the test of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we do this, we will see the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is difficult for someone to be truly related with others if, for example, he has secret, unconfessed sins and inner, hidden things.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As long as we have something that condemns our conscience, we cannot be built up with others.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In order to see things properly and rightly, we need to have the right standing, the right angle.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Without the test of the building we may have a certain angle, but if we apply the test of the building to many matters, our point of view will be completely turned around.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We will see things from a different viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then as long as our point of view is changed, our problems will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Today is not the day of the law or of spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is the age for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The building of God is our standard and test.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We need to test ourselves not concerning right or wrong but by how much we have been built up.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is the test, and it is also the solution for all of our problems and the answer to all of our questions.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>How much have we been related to our dear brothers and sisters?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>How much are we one with them in the spirit in love, life, and reality?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Satan hates this oneness and harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He endeavors to do whatever he can to damage the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Once we lose this oneness, we lose our impact.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Our impact is in the oneness of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When we are truly one, in harmony, and built up together as one Body, we have a real impact.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We need to see the vision of God s building, and we need to test our life, work, move, motive, intention, desire, and point of view by the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If we apply the building as the test, we will be fully and thoroughly revolutionized, and we will have a real turn.</S>
