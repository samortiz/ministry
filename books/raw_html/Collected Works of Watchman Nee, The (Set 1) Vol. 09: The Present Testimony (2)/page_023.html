<H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN OPEN LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 22</H2><P>Many readers have long awaited the publication of this twenty-second issue of The Present Testimony. After the publication of the twenty-first issue, we were busy preparing for the conference in October, and after the conference we were busy with the Bible study. By the time we finished the Bible study, I was quite exhausted. Therefore, the publication of the twenty-second issue was delayed until now. In order to meet the need of many readers, we have enlarged this issue. In the first section of this issue, we discuss the kind of attitude and experience we should have concerning the coming of the kingdom of Christ. In the last article, we emphasize the most important principle in our work.</P><P>Concerning the recent conference, which was our second, we have to confess that God blessed us. Nevertheless, we deeply feel that we did not fully obtain what we should have attained. Perhaps I should be responsible for this myself. As to the expense of this conference, although the amount was quite large, the offerings of the brothers and sisters locally and abroad have left us with even a few dollars over.</P><P>In our conferences our intention is only to speak forth the message of the victory of Christ, not to speak of other matters. The preaching of this message is our particular responsibility. If there had not been some outside brothers raising some questions, perhaps we would have seen more spiritual accomplishments in this conference. In reality, unless a person knows God in the aspects of trusting and obeying Him, it is of little use to speak to him concerning other matters. We can mention many other matters to those who are faithful, but if we share them with those who are yet unwilling to serve God faithfully, it will only give rise to disputes. It is our desire that anyone's commitment concerning issues of the church or issues of prophecy would result from a spiritual background acquired in the presence of God. We do not want any person to have an outward commitment in his stand concerning the church just because he has listened to our exhortation. Our Bible study meetings, on the other hand, are of a different nature: they are conducted for those who are willing to serve God faithfully and are seeking to have a clearer understanding of Bible truths. For this reason, we are free in these meetings to bring up those things which we would be reluctant to bring up in conferences. We hope that in our future conferences, neither the speaker nor the listeners will bring up, either publicly or privately, any matters outside the victory of Christ, in order that we might have God's full blessing. In other words, the content of our preaching in the October conference was the same as what we have preached all these years in The Present Testimony. I deeply believe that those who have been taught in the presence of God know that The Present Testimony preaches a special message. Just as we have not mentioned other matters in The Present Testimony, we have tried to avoid these same matters in our past as well as future conferences. This does not mean that other matters are not important; but it does mean that when men sincerely desire to receive the victory of Christ and to believe and obey the Lord, He will spontaneously direct their attention to these other external matters, and they will automatically obey. There will not be the need for much exhortation from others, and there will not be many disputes. At this stage, if certain things are not clear to some, we would be most willing to help them in the Bible study meetings. We deeply sense that what the church of God urgently needs and what she absolutely must experience today is the victory of Christâ€”the facts and principles which He declared through His death and resurrection. In this matter we need to be faithful and steadfast, and we need to preach it wholeheartedly. May the Lord bless every one of my dear readers!</P><P>A household slave of Christ,<br>Watchman Nee<br>December 1931</P>
