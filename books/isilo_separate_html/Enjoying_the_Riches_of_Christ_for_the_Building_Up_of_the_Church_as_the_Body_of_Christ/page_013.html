A watermelon is first cut into slices. Then the slices may be pressed into juice, which is so easy to drink. Melon, slices, and juice are the steps of the dispensing of the watermelon into us. God&#8217;s intention is to dispense Himself into us, and the last step of His dispensing is the Spirit. John 6:63 says, &#8220;It is the Spirit who gives life.&#8221; As the Spirit of reality He comes into us to bring us into all reality, but the main thing we must realize is that the Spirit imparts life into us. Who is this life-giving Spirit? John 6:63 must be connected to 1 Corinthians 15:45, which says, &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&#8221; It is the Spirit who gives life, and this life-giving Spirit is the last Adam, Jesus. Jesus, as the last Adam, was made a life-giving Spirit. Do not care for the distracting teachings of Christianity. Forget about those teachings and come back to the pure word. &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&#8221; &#8220;The Lord is the Spirit&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:17a), the Spirit who gives life. This is not my word; it is the pure word of the Bible.<p>In Darby&#8217;s New Translation, 2 Corinthians 3:7 through 16 is parenthetical; verse 17 is a continuation of verse 6. In verses 6 and 17 Paul said, &#8220;Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life....And the Lord is the Spirit.&#8221; God was God in Genesis, and He was the Father in the Old Testament. Then He became the Son in the four Gospels, and He became a life-giving Spirit in the Acts and in the Epistles. Then in the last book of the Bible, Revelation, He became the seven Spirits. Strictly speaking, today we are in the dispensing not of God the Father or even of the Son alone but of the Spirit. Today we are not even in Acts. I fully believe that today we are in the book of Revelation, the book of the sevenfold intensified Spirit. We must spend much time coming back to the Spirit because in the Lord&#8217;s recovery nothing else is as important as this.<h2 class=head1>BEING FREED FROM THE BONDAGE OF THE LETTER</h2><p>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &#8220;And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&#8221; According to the context of this chapter, freedom is the freedom from the bondage of the old teachings. In the ancient times many Christians were influenced by the teachings of Judaism. They were under a bondage, but Paul told them that they had the Spirit within them and were freed from the bondage of the Old Testament, the bondage of the letter of the Scriptures, the teachings of Judaism.<p>I am afraid that many Christians today are still under the bondage of the teachings of Christianity. We need a liberation. I was under this same bondage. It took me more than fifteen years to be liberated from all the old concepts I had received from the old teachings. Before I was liberated, I had many layers of veils, but where the Spirit of the Lord is, the veils are taken away. This is the real liberation. Many are still under the veils. They may pray-read the verses about which we are speaking, and they may attend the meetings, but they still may not be able to see. To be veiled is to be under a bondage. We need to be liberated, and to be liberated, according to 2 Corinthians 3, is to have all our veils removed.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
