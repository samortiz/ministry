   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Deepest Layer of the Divine Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible is the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hence, it is not a simple book.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is a profound book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After I got saved, as a young Christian I began to love the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more I read it, the more I realized that I could not fully understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After many years of studying it, I have discovered that the Bible has at least three layers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first layer is that God loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because He loves us, God gives us blessing, happiness, peace, and especially His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In response to His love, we love God and His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This causes us to touch the second layer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The second layer is morality, proper behavior, good character, and spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Most Christians stop here, but this is not the intrinsic or deepest part of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is still another layer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's dispensation is the deepest layer within the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may read a verse such as Ephesians 1:10, but have very little understanding of the word dispensation in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verses such as John 3:16 are easily understood by many Christians, but only in a superficial and shallow way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many appreciate the first part of John 3:16 which says that "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But when asked what eternal life is in the latter part of this verse, few have a very accurate understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some would say that eternal life is going to heaven, living in a heavenly mansion, and walking on a golden street within pearly gates to enjoy peace and blessings for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is mostly a wrong concept of what eternal life is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The salvation of God preached in Christianity is true but very shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's salvation also has layers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These layers include the forgiveness of sins, washing from sin, being redeemed by the blood, being justified through Jesus Christ, and being regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the deepest layer of God's salvation is God's plan to work Himself into His created, chosen, redeemed, and regenerated people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's eternal plan is to work Himself into His chosen people so that He becomes their very constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eating, Digesting, and Assimilating Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>as Our Spiritual Food</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God not only desires that man be His vessel to contain Him Rom 9:21, 23; 2 Cor 4:7 , but also wants man to eat, digest, and assimilate Him John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we eat, digest, and assimilate physical food, we are energized and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The food that we eat is dispensed into our blood, and through the blood into every part of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, the food that we have eaten becomes the fiber, tissue, and cells of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same way, God's eternal plan is to dispense Himself into us so that He becomes every fiber of our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He wants to be digested and assimilated by us so that He can become the constituent of our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God created man in His image so that man could contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A container is always in the image or shape of the content it is destined to contain.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the content is round, the container must also be round.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The creation of man in God's image is for the dispensing of God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After man was created, God placed him in front of the tree of life Gen 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then immediately, God warned man about his eating vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If man ate of the tree of life, he would live; but if he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he would die.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The tree of life signifies God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today, God is our food; He is edible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In John 6 Jesus said that He was the bread of life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>35, 48 , and in verse 57 He said, "As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to eat Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be a Christian is more than just repenting of our sins, receiving the forgiveness of sins, being washed by the blood, being justified, and being regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Christian life also includes growth and maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to go on from regeneration to maturity, we must eat.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Regeneration is the beginning of our spiritual life, but we need to eat after our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No one can grow without eating.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must eat, digest, and assimilate food daily.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Assimilation is the final step of food being dispensed into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to eat, digest, and assimilate Jesus as our spiritual food day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to God's economy, God is not only our Savior objectively but also our food subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is shown by the type of the Passover in Exodus 12.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The blood of the Passover lamb was sprinkled on the side posts and the upper doorpost of the houses of the Israelites v. 7 . This signifies the redemption of Christ in its objective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God also charged the children of Israel to eat the meat of the lamb which they had killed v. 8 . Under the covering of the blood of the Passover lamb, they were to eat the flesh of the Passover lamb, not leaving anything for the next day v. 10 . This was one of God's ordinances concerning their eating.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In nearly every culture, there are so-called "table manners" which govern the way of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to Exodus 12, one of God's "table manners" was to finish the entire lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God would be insulted if there was anything left over until the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If there was more lamb than one household could eat, the Israelites were to share the lamb with their neighbor next door vv.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This signifies the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should lead our neighboring families to share in God's rich and boundless salvation, which our family cannot exhaust.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After the Israelites were filled with the lamb through eating, they were strengthened in order to make their exodus out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Israelites marched out of Egypt, and while they were marching, they were digesting and assimilating the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This digestion and assimilation was the dispensing of the lamb into their being.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Through their digestion and assimilation of the Passover lamb, the dispensing of the Passover lamb took place.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This dispensed lamb became their strength.</S>
