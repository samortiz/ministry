But after the eunuch was baptized, the Holy Spirit immediately caught Philip away without giving the eunuch the slightest chance to receive any edification. In the end, the eunuch returned to Ethiopia, which is a Gentile nation even today. This life pulse of the church has continued without break until this present day. Therefore, I exhort the elderly brothers and sisters to give up the old methods and learn this new way. It is like a military academy; the military teaching and training of forty or fifty years ago are useless today because everything has changed. This is why we say, &#8220;The new way gains new ones, and the new ones walk in the new way.&#8221; We must be a new man-new both inwardly and outwardly-in order to be able to walk in the new way. We should not begin to walk in the new way and yet inwardly still be filled with the old things.<p>I want especially to mention the booklet called The Mystery of Human Life. When we go out door-knocking, we must take this booklet in addition to the Bible. After two years of use, it has been translated into all the languages spoken in the countries where there are churches in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. This booklet speaks of the four keys for opening up the mystery of human life. We only need to learn how to speak according to this booklet, and we will obtain the secret. Whoever has the experience of going out door-knocking can testify that the more they speak according to the words in this booklet, the easier it is to bring people to be saved.<p>It used to be that baptizing people was not to be done carelessly; rather, baptism had to be carried out by the elders. However, sometimes when a person had to wait, he would wait so long that he disappeared. In the northern Chinese dialect we have a very interesting expression called huo ho, which means &#8220;optimum cooking temperature.&#8221; This Chinese expression means that when we do something, we must seize the best opportunity. We may compare this to a housewife who heats the oil in the wok to just the right temperature and prepares to stir-fry some vegetables, but delays for three minutes in order to answer the phone; as a result, the vegetables do not taste as good as they should. In the same way, we should lead a person to baptism once he believes in the Lord. If there is a waiting period, then his baptism may be frustrated. The Bible says to believe and be baptized (Mark 16:16). It is a spontaneous matter to baptize someone immediately after he has believed.<p>I was the one who designed and taught our previous way of practice, including the interview for baptism and the procedure for baptism, so I am the one best qualified to overthrow it, and I should overthrow it. In the past we rode in ox carts, so I certainly had to teach you how to ride in an ox cart. Now we have changed our mode of transportation to the automobile, so we should not do things in the same way as when we used carts. Rather, we should learn the new way; we should learn to drive an automobile. We should not think of driving oxen while riding in an automobile even though we are accustomed to driving oxen. In the past when the women sewed or embroidered, they did it all stitch by stitch. Now they have sewing machines, but they may think that the clothes they make do not look nice enough. Actually, the problem is that they are not attentive enough when using the sewing machine. If we are really willing to humble ourselves and diligently learn anew, rejecting our old habits and customs, then we will certainly do things faster and better.<p>It is very hard to change one&#8217;s concept. I myself have been making the turn for five years. From 1980 to 1984 I was constantly studying why in the Lord&#8217;s recovery we would preach the gospel and labor hard every year, but our numbers would not increase. It was not only like this in Taiwan; it was also the same in the United States. This question pressed me until I had no other way but to return to the Bible and spend time studying it diligently. In the end the Lord showed me the concept of the &#8220;home.&#8221; According to the revelation of the Bible, God Himself came down from heaven to be incarnated and at His own discretion went from one home to another to seek sinners. The Lord Himself went to the home of Zaccheus. He also made a special trip to seek the sinful woman by the well in Samaria. The New Testament clearly shows us that the home is the center and that the gospel is a matter of being delivered to the home and not a matter of inviting people to come and listen. If today God were to invite us to where He sits in the heavens, we would never find a way to get there. Instead, He came down and brought the gospel to us, making it so available for us. Because we have acted against this principle, we have not had the Lord&#8217;s blessing for a long time.<p>When I saw this clearly, I made a thorough repentance to the Lord. Thirty years ago when I was still living in Taiwan, I saw people riding bicycles with a sign that said, &#8220;Delivering Shots to Your Home.&#8221; This meant that a person did not have to go to the doctor&#8217;s clinic, but the doctor would come to the person&#8217;s home and give him the shot. Now America has home delivery services for food which make it very helpful for business. If you make it convenient for people, they will welcome you. In the same way, if our hope is that the Lord&#8217;s recovery will increase and spread, then we must change our concept. Instead of inviting people to come and hear the gospel, we should deliver the gospel to their homes. This will help us to increase.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Furtherance of the New Way for the Lord's Recovery &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
