   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JOSHUA MESSAGE EIGHT THE DESTRUCTION OF AI Scripture Reading: Josh 7 8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will consider Joshua 7 and 8.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These chapters give the account of the destruction of Ai.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first time the children of Israel went up to destroy Ai they suffered a defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There were four reasons for this defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, Israel sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s people were to be holy, sanctified, especially during the time of war.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But one of the men of war from the tribe of Judah sinned by stealing something that was devoted to destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second, they lost the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Third, they trusted in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Fourth, they lost their oneness with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God can do everything without man, but according to the record of the book of Joshua He wants man to be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In keeping with the principle of incarnation, God wants to do everything through man, with man, and even in man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At Jericho Israel marched around the city with the ark, a type of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, on the shoulders of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The spiritual significance of this scene is that it is a picture of a corporate God-man, God and man, man and God, walking together as one person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was the way the children of Israel crossed the river Jordan, and this was the way they destroyed the city of Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God and Israel were fighting together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually, however, God did the fighting, and Israel simply shouted, proclaimed, and testified and then occupied the city.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This scene should have continued through all the taking of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But after the destruction of Jericho, Israel sinned by taking something from Jericho that was devoted to destruction 6:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although this sin was committed by an individual, Achan, it affected the entire body of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this reason God said to Joshua, Israel has sinned 7:11a .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because of this sin God stayed away from them, withdrawing His presence from them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was the reason that Joshua and all the children of Israel became foolish, proud, and blind in attacking Ai.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At Jericho, according to God s economy, Joshua sent out spies, not for fighting but to gain Rahab.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the destruction of Jericho, no fighting was needed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But at Ai, because they lost the presence of the Lord, Joshua sent out spies for fighting v. 2 . The spies returned to Joshua and said that because the enemies were few, not all the people needed go up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They suggested that about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because of their foolishness, pride, and blindness, they despised their enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nevertheless, Joshua received the report from the spies and sent three thousand men of war against Ai.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But when Israel was defeated by the people of Ai and thirty-six men were slaughtered, Joshua realized that something was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He then fell to the ground upon his face before the ark of Jehovah until evening vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God spoke to Joshua, telling him that unless they judged the sin, He would not be with them anymore v. 12 . Joshua called the people together, and through the Urim and Thummim he found the tribe Judah , the family Zerah , and the person Achan who had sinned vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The children of Israel then stoned and burned Achan and all that he had.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way Israel was cleared up and brought back to God to be one with God again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all need to learn a lesson from this account.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We, the people of God, should always be one with our God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today, especially in the New Testament, our God is not only among us but also within each one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, every one of us is not a solitary individual, a person alone.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the contrary, we are men with God, God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do you realize that, as a believer in Christ, you are a God-man, that God is a part of your being and that you are a part of God s being?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We come from many different countries, but we all are the same kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all are God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this reason, we must realize that whatever we do, wherever we go, and whatever we are should not be by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not act, behave, or do things by ourselves but with God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The report of the spies to Joshua indicates that Israel had set God aside.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They forgot God and knew only themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At that time they were not one with God but cared only for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, God stayed away from them, and He said to Joshua, I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy that which was devoted to destruction from among you v. 12c . It is a very serious matter for God no longer to be with us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nothing can replace Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I can testify that without God I cannot live.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Apart from Him I cannot have any being.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Israel was separated from God because of their sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This sin caused them to become foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Israel should have asked God what He wanted them to do against Ai.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This was the secret for their victory.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Joshua should have said to the people, Do not forget what we experienced at Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We did not fight, but instead we walked with God as one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Let us do the same thing at Ai, walking around the city with the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If Joshua had said this, he would have been a wise man, and the children of Israel would have followed his wise counsel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The secret of Israel s defeat at Ai was that they lost God s presence and were no longer one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After this defeat, Joshua learned the lesson of staying with the Lord before the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Eventually, the Lord came in to speak to him and to tell him what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The principle is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we have God s presence, we have wisdom, insight, foresight, and the inner knowledge concerning things.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As we study the intrinsic significance of this part of Israel s history, we need to learn the secret of walking with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today we should not merely follow the Lord but walk with Him, living with Him and having our being with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the way to walk as a Christian, to fight as a child of God, and to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We need to remember that we are God-men and to practice being one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Concerning this, the Lord Jesus said, In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you John 14:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This word reveals that we are a people of ins : we are in Christ and He is in us 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, whatever we do should not be done by ourselves but should be done with and by another One.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In my youth I was taught various ways to overcome, to be victorious, to be holy, and to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, not any of these ways worked.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Eventually, through more than sixty-eight years of experience, I have found out that nothing works but the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>His being with us is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Let us now consider Joshua 7 and 8 in a more particular way.</S>
