   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE SAVED BY GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE THE MASTERPIECE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to 2:4-10, a portion of Ephesians which reveals that we have been saved by grace to be the masterpiece of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. GOD BEING RICH IN MERCY</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 4, which tells us that God is rich in mercy, begins with the words But God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This was the turning factor in our position.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We were in a miserable situation, but God came in with His rich mercy to make us suitable for His love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>GOD S GREAT LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>WITH WHICH HE LOVED US</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is rich in mercy because of His great love with which He loved us v. 4 . The object of love should be in a condition deserving love, but the object of mercy is always in a pitiful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, God s mercy reaches further than His love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God loves us because we are the object of His selection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But we became pitiful by our fall, even dead in our offenses and sins; therefore, we need God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because of His great love, God is rich in mercy to save us from our wretched position to a condition which is suitable for His love.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>EVEN WHEN WE WERE DEAD IN OFFENSES</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God s mercy reached us even when we were dead in offenses v. 5 . We did not deserve anything from God, but God had mercy upon us in our miserable situation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>MAKING US ALIVE TOGETHER WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 5 says that we have been made alive together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The book of Ephesians does not consider us sinners as does the book of Romans; it considers us dead persons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As sinners we need God s forgiveness and justification, as revealed in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But as dead persons we need to be made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Forgiveness and justification bring us back to God s presence to enjoy His grace and participate in His life, whereas making us alive enables us, as the living members of the Body of Christ, to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God made us alive by imparting His eternal life, which is Christ Himself Col 3:4 , into our deadened spirit through His Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He has enlivened us with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God enlivened us together when He enlivened the crucified Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, He made us alive with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a parenthesis in verse 5, Paul says, By grace you have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Grace is free.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here it denotes not only God freely dispensed into us for our enjoyment, but also God s action in freely saving us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By such grace we have been saved from our wretched position of death into the marvelous realm of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>V. HAVING RAISED US UP TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>AND SEATED US TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 6 says, And raised us up together and seated us together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To make us alive is the initial step of God s salvation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Following this, God raised us up from the position of death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be made alive is one thing, and to be raised up is another.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Consider the story of the raising of Lazarus as an illustration John 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord firstly made him alive and then raised him up out of the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the same principle, God s mercy firstly made us alive and then raised us up from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 6 says that we have been raised up together and seated together.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From our standpoint we have been raised up from our position of death one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But in God s view we were all raised up together, just as all the Israelites were raised up together from the death waters of the Red Sea Exo 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the book of Exodus, the entire congregation of the children of Israel was saved at the same time, for they passed through the Red Sea together.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a clear type showing that we were all saved together; we were all made alive and raised up at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Again I wish to point out that the salvation in Ephesians is different from the salvation in Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Romans salvation is by God s righteousness, but in Ephesians salvation is by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The salvation unfolded in Ephesians is not that which satisfies God s righteous requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, it is the salvation that imparts life into us to make us members of the Body of Christ so that God s eternal purpose to have a living Body for the expression of Christ may be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This purpose is fulfilled not by righteousness, but by life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, Ephesians 2 emphasizes that we have been made alive together with Christ.</S>
