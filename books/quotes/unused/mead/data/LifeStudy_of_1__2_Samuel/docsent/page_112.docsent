   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR NEED FOR GOD TO WORK HIMSELF IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTO US AS OUR LIFE, NATURE, AND CONSTITUTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Just as the photograph of a person does not have the life and nature of that person, so David, a photograph of God's heart, did not have the life and nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even though he was a man whose heart was according to God, he did not have anything related to God organically.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What David needed is what we need today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need God to build Himself in Christ into our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that we need God to work Himself in Christ into us as our life, our nature, and our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a result, we are not simply a man according to God's heart we are God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We today are not outwardly as high as David was, but we can declare that we have God's life, nature, and constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to accomplish this, God in Christ became a man and went through some processes that this man could be designated something divine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In resurrection He was designated the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In and through resurrection Christ, the firstborn Son of God, became the life-giving Spirit, who now enters into us to impart, to dispense, Himself as life into our being to be our inner constitution, to make us a God-man just like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was God becoming man, and we are man becoming God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>GOD'S DESIRE TO BUILD HIMSELF IN CHRIST INTO US</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>IN ORDER TO HAVE A MUTUAL ABODE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many Christians are still trying merely to have a behaving, a living, and a being that are according to God's heart, but they do not have the concept that God desires to build Himself in Christ into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What He is building into us will be His abode, which will be our abode also.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, it becomes a mutual abode.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The New Jerusalem is this mutual abode.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the one hand, the New Jerusalem is the dwelling place of God; on the other hand, it is also our eternal dwelling place Rev 21:3, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For eternity the New Jerusalem will be the fulfillment of the Lord's brief word in John 15:4: "Abide in Me and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ephesians 3:17 tells us that Christ is now within us doing the work of building Himself into us to produce this mutual abode.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We often say that Christ is living in us and working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we need to ask this question: What is Christ wanting to accomplish by His working in us?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The answer is that Christ is working in us to build up God's habitation by building Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>David wanted to build God a house of cedar, but God wanted to build Himself in Christ into David.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What God would build into David would be both God's house and David's house.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This mutual abode is also unveiled in John 14:23: "If anyone loves Me,..My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This abode will be not only for the Triune God but also for us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What God builds up in us is both God's habitation and our habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to realize that God will have a habitation not by our doing or working but by His building.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ builds the church Matt 16:18 by coming into our spirit and spreading Himself from our spirit into our mind, emotion, and will to occupy our entire soul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This church will become His habitation and our habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is what we need, and our burden is to emphasize this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE TRIUNE GOD BECOMING</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>OUR INTRINSIC CONSTITUTION</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no need for us to build anything for God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, God needs to build Himself in Christ into us as our life, nature, and essence.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually, the Triune God will become our intrinsic constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We will be constituted with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That will be the seed of David and the Son of God something divine and human satisfying God's need and our need for a mutual abode.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The New Jerusalem is the consummation of this mutual abode, and we will all be there.</S>
