   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Basic Requirement Being Spirituality</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The words in the Bible concerning the requirements for an elder are quite clear.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are two things which I wish to point out to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The basic requirement of an elder is that he should be one who has understanding in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>An elder should be a person who has spiritual value, who knows spiritual things, who has spiritual understanding, who knows the way in spiritual things, and whose spiritual course is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>An elder needs to have considerable experience concerning spiritual things and to know before God what the spiritual condition of other children of God is; then he can take care of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the spiritual side the elders must have this spiritual foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In addition, they need God-given abilities and gifts so that they can take care of the affairs of the church and administrate them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such a person can be an elder of the church before God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I hope that you will not select an elder for the church who only knows how to handle practical affairs and how to direct things and yet has no spiritual understanding before God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I know that many localities have problems, and the failure is altogether related to selecting those who are famous in the world, who have position, who know how to handle practical affairs, who have ability, and who are experienced in the ways of the world to be elders in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Please remember that a person who is capable of handling practical affairs, managing a social organization, and taking care of a family may not necessarily be able to take care of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is because the basic requirement in the church is to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Administrative Experiences Being Useless</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is a brother who has twenty years of administrative experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many brothers have come and asked me, Why not ask that brother to be an elder?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I said, His twenty years of administrative experience do not count as even one year in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even though he is a good Christian, he does not have enough understanding concerning spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church is spiritual, and a person must have spiritual weight before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He must have spiritual ways and a condition of being spiritual in order to be an elder; otherwise, if this brother were to come in, he would produce problems immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We would rather select one who has spiritual weight, even if he has no ability in handling practical affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, it is best for him to have both aspects: to know the spiritual things and also to be able to handle practical affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a person does not know how to manage his own household, how can he take care of the church of God?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But this is only half of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Does this mean that a person who can manage his own household can take care of the house of God?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No, it does not!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Being spiritual is the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not everyone who can manage his own household can take care of the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many people can manage their household well, but they are not even saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Can we then invite them to take care of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only one who has a way in spiritual things and who can also manage his household can be an elder and administrate the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, when you select a responsible brother, always select one who has spiritual weight, who has spiritual ways, and who does not easily become proud, overly excited, or puffed up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The life of this person before God needs to be reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Select one whose life is reliable, but do not select anyone who is proud.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Select one who is stable, but not the so-called genius.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the spiritual side this person should be stable and firm, having spiritual insight, spiritual knowledge, and spiritual understanding before God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only such a person can be selected.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Able to Manage His Own Household</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After you have three, five, seven, or eight such people, you still have to examine them in the aspect of managing practical affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The one who can manage and administrate can be an overseer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If a person cannot manage his own household, he cannot take care of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the church were like a worldly organization, we would need to select only those who have ability.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the church is a spiritual organization; therefore, you must first take care of the question of spirituality and then look at the ability, at whether or not a particular one can take care of practical affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If he cannot manage practical affairs, neither can he be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only one who has knowledge in spiritual things and possesses ability in handling practical affairs will have very little problem in the church, and his condition will be quite reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Otherwise, he will be able to handle practical affairs, but he will cause damage on the spiritual side.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That would not be right.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>An Example</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A brother, who has passed away, was an elder of a Christian group.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>During our early days in Shanghai, he often came to my place to talk.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was a good brother and really capable in handling practical affairs, and he was also zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But he had very little understanding in spiritual things, if any, and he was even more lacking in spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One day he came to talk with me and said, A sister among us sinned and cried loudly in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Mr. Nee, don t you think that is funny? After he finished speaking, he sat there and began to laugh loudly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>An elder in a church considered it a laughable matter to see a sister confess her sins and cry.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You can realize then his spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Of course, he was the best in his group, but he could not bear responsibility in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He himself had never confessed his sins or wept to such an extent, so naturally he considered it funny when he saw someone weeping one day.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am only citing an example.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There may be several hundred cases like this in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To weep for your sins is an elementary matter in spiritual life, but this brother did not understand this at all.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What shall we do if he also laughs at many other spiritual actions related to us?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Such a one feels that all the spiritual things are strange and laughable and cannot comprehend one spiritual thing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If he becomes an elder, the church is finished with regard to its spiritual path.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, as to the requirements for an elder, the first relates to spiritual things, to spiritual understanding, and to spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To be an elder, a person also needs to be reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do not consider someone who behaves like a drunkard, wandering around doing nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Sometimes his condition is good and at other times it is bad.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Such a person cannot manage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The one who manages the church must be quite stable and quite reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At the same time, he should also be able to manage his own household.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Without this, he is not qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, do not reverse the foundation and the building.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Do not select a person who can handle only practical affairs well.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Such a person can be a deacon at the most, but never an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>At the most he can be one who only receives instructions in the church; he cannot give instructions.</S>
