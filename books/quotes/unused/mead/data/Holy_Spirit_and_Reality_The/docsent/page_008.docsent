   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONDUCT AND REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must remember that in God's eyes, there is something called reality.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The problem with many Christians is that they try to do something to make things real.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, what is expressed is, in fact, not reality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many Christians try to manufacture a kind of "reality" before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They try to imitate and copy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But God does not require us to imitate; He only wants the reality, the real thing, to be manifested through us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What we generate by ourselves is artificial and fabricated; it is not the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must see the vanity of acting according to doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the most, a man who does this has outward conduct; he does not have the real thing, and what he has is not the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, we have to learn to live before the Lord in what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must ask God to help us so that we would touch the reality behind all spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many times, we are very close to falsehood because we know too much doctrine; we walk according to doctrines instead of walking according to the leading of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Anytime we walk according to doctrines, we cannot touch reality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A brother said the following when relating his experience: "Once a brother offended me very much.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He came to me and said something to me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I responded, Brother, it does not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is all right.'</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But within me I said, This is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He does this kind of thing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He does it not only to me, but to many people as well.'</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I had the thought of saying something harsh to him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if I said something harsh, he would think that I was an unforgiving person, and he might be hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of course, if I shook his hand and invited him for a meal, I would be seen as practicing brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While I was thinking about this, a strong urge within me said, You have to tell him the truth today, and you have to show him that he is wrong.'</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I struggled for a quarter of an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the end I spoke the truth to him."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes rebukes are more valuable than handshakes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can have an outward gentleness and win the praises of others, but this kind of thing has no spiritual value at all before God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The question is whether our conduct issues from dead doctrines or from the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our brother truly loved his brother from his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the question is not merely one of the heart, but whether or not there is the spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A Christian once argued with his family.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One member in the family was very fierce and slapped him on the face.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that instant, he remembered the words of Matthew 5, which say, "Whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also" v. 39 . He thought that since he was a Christian, he should behave like a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, he turned his other cheek.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After he did this, he could not sleep well for two nights.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As far as his conduct was concerned, he had acted according to the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But he was so furious that he could not sleep well for two nights.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that he had not touched the spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His conduct was not life; it was not the real thing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many Christians feel that they have one shortcoming: they cannot differentiate between the real thing and the false thing; they cannot tell what is of God and what is not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As far as their spiritual experience is concerned, they cannot tell the difference because they have not touched the spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If they have touched reality, their eyes will discern what is not reality right away.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The power of discernment comes from what one sees.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you have touched the spiritual reality in one matter, no one will be able to deceive you in that matter anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A genuinely saved Christian has touched spiritual reality at least in the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not that easy for anyone to deceive him in the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the same way, if he has touched the reality in any other matter, he will spontaneously feel the difference whenever there is the absence of reality in that particular matter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once he touches something unreal, an inexplicable power within will repel the unreal thing; something within will tell him immediately that this is not the real thing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are easily deceived because we often deceive ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those who deceive themselves are easily deceived by others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If one is blind about himself, he will be blind about others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever we know ourselves, we know others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We cannot know others if we do not know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we have passed through God's dealings and if we know ourselves, we will spontaneously know others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Once we are touched and dealt with by God in a certain matter, once we touch something real, and once we know the way God's Spirit moves within, we will know immediately when we touch a person whether he acts by himself or by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Spiritual discernment comes only after one has touched spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Those who have not touched reality can only deceive two kinds of people themselves and those whose spiritual condition is the same as theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They cannot deceive those who know what is of the Spirit and what living in the Spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even more, they cannot deceive the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They may think that they are spiritual, but the strange thing is that the church will never say amen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must realize that whenever the church cannot say amen, we have to confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If the brothers and sisters cannot respond with an amen, it means that there is falsehood and the absence of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many brothers and sisters are vexing and burdening the church not only by their sins, but by their "good" conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Sin can easily be detected, but it is not that easy to detect the many kinds of "good" conduct that originate from man himself; it is not that easy to detect that they are far from God and far from spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many Christians have not touched any spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What they do has nothing to do with reality.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Yet they still think that they have the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is truly a vexation and a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We believe that whenever one touches reality, the result is life, and whenever one does not touch reality, the result is death.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some people do certain things, touch life, and cause others to touch life also.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Some people do certain things and feel quite happy about what they have done, yet others do not touch life, and they are not edified.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Those who touch life do not appreciate these kinds of works; rather, they dislike them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>These works originate from the self and do not bring in life; rather, they bring in death.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must learn to live in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Otherwise, we may accomplish many "good" works without touching any spiritual reality at all.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What does it mean to live in the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It means that we do not do things by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Doing things by ourselves is being of the flesh, and being of the flesh is surely far from spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Spiritual reality is something spiritual; it is not fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Simply put, spiritual reality is what one touches through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Only what we touch through the Holy Spirit is living and real.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Any work that a Christian has apart from the Holy Spirit is not real.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>His work can never replace the real thing in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>His work cannot help others and cannot edify himself.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>May the Lord be merciful to us and may He show us that those who live in the Spirit are the only ones who live in spiritual reality.</S>
