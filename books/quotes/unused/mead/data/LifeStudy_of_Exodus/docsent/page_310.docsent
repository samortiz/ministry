   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Knobs, the Calyxes, the External Green</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Leafy Parts of the Flowers,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Containing the Blossoming Buds</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The knobs, the calyxes, the external green leafy parts of the flowers, containing the blossoming buds, signify the sustaining and supporting power of the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We can comprehend this only through our experience with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To shine the divine light is to blossom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But this blossoming requires a container to support and sustain it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From our experience we know that in order to shine with the divine light, we must have resurrection life to be a knob, a calyx, as a container to sustain and support our shining.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do not have resurrection life as such a container, our blossom will collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that the shining of the divine light in us will cease.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without the knobs, the calyxes, the flowering buds would fall.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In like manner, without the resurrection life, we have nothing to uphold, support, and sustain our shining of the divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suppose in your daily life with your family you are shining with the divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suddenly, however, you revert to your natural life and begin to speak and behave in a natural way, especially in your relationships with the members of your family.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Immediately, your blossoming buds collapse and you stop shining.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because you have lost the calyxes as the support of the blossoming buds, there is no more shining.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you remain in resurrection, you are blossoming, shining.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when you leave resurrection and return to your natural life, you immediately stop shining.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may have been shining a few minutes ago, but now, having lost the support of resurrection life, you are no longer shining.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whenever the calyx, the support of the blossoming bud, is removed, the flower collapses and falls.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, because there is no blossoming, there is no shining.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The shining of the divine light is held by the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>C. The Blossoming Buds</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The blossoming buds, the petals, signify the expression of the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Resurrection life is both the container and the blossom, both the support and the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THREE BRANCHES ON EACH OF THE TWO SIDES</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Exodus 25:32 says, And there shall be six branches going out from its sides, three branches of the lampstand from its one side, and three branches of the lampstand from its other side.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On each side of the lampstand there are three branches arranged in layers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here the number three denotes both resurrection and the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually resurrection is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to 1 Corinthians 15, the life-giving Spirit is the ultimate expression of the Triune God and the ultimate reaching of the Triune God to man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, the life-giving Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through resurrection, in resurrection, and with resurrection, Christ, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This life-giving Spirit is the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Resurrection is nothing less than the processed Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Resurrection is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This understanding of resurrection corresponds to the Lord s word: I am the resurrection John 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the one hand, in the Bible the number three refers to the Triune God; on the other hand, it refers to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Resurrection is the very Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the lampstand resurrection is signified not only by the almond blossoms, but also by the three branches on each side of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, the branches signify the branching out of Christ s resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The six branches in two groups of three signify the testimony of the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Two is the number of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this reason, the Lord Jesus sent out the disciples two by two.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the same principle, the two groups of branches on the two sides of the lampstand signify the testimony of the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>X. THREE CUPS SHAPED LIKE ALMOND BLOSSOMS</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>ON EACH BRANCH WITH KNOB</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>AND BLOSSOMING BUD</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The three cups shaped like almond blossoms on each branch with knob and blossoming bud signify the resurrection life blossoming in and with the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have pointed out that there were three blossoms on each branch.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This indicates resurrection with resurrection, and resurrection in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The lampstand is filled with almond blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This reveals that the divine thought here is focused on resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We truly need a spirit of wisdom and revelation Eph 1:17 to understand the significance of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the golden lampstand we have divinity, resurrection, and the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The shining is the expression of the divine life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although we are human and natural, through regeneration we have received the divine life with the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This means that as believers in Christ, we have the divine substance, the divine element, that is, divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now we need to live Christ, to live divinity, by practicing to be one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The vast majority of Christians neglect this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Instead, they simply teach others to improve their natural humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But in our natural humanity there is no divinity, no resurrection, and no light.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must not remain in our natural life, but enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For this, we must pass through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then we shall be in resurrection, and with the divine element in resurrection there will be the blossoming, the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Once again I would emphasize the fact that the blossoming is the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we blossom, we shine.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>With the lampstand we have divinity and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Now this resurrection needs to blossom.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Whenever it blossoms, it shines; that is, it expresses the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This expression, this blossoming, is the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I encourage all the saints to consider the picture of the golden lampstand and pray about it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This will help us to see how Christ today is shining over us and how we can be a shining member of Christ through the divine nature and by blossoming in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is to shine the divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The more we shine in this way, the more we shall be the church with the seven Spirits.</S>
