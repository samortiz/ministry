   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE PRINCIPLES OF THE KINGDOM 1 Scripture Reading: Matt 8:1-3, 5-13; 9:9-17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew is the New Testament book that deals specifically with the matter of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In nearly every chapter the central point is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Gospel of John, on the other hand, emphasizes life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By comparing these two Gospels, we can see that the cases selected and presented in each of them are absolutely different because John stresses life and Matthew stresses the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Neither Gospel tells us everything that the Lord Jesus did while He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This would have been impossible John 21:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John tells us that the Lord Jesus did many things which are not recorded in his Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The cases he recorded illustrate that Christ is life to people, and that He can meet every human need by life 20:30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Matthew, however, the cases do not illustrate life; they illustrate the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Matthew does not mention Nicodemus, the Samaritan woman, or the resurrection of Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These are found in John because they are excellent illustrations of how Christ is life to needy people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Matthew includes other cases, such as the cleansing of the leper, which John does not include.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, the cases in Matthew illustrate the matter of the kingdom, whereas the cases in John illustrate the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The book of Matthew was not written according to the historical sequence of events.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Another Gospel, Mark, presents an historical record of the sequence of events in the life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Matthew on the other hand assembles various materials together in order to present a particular picture or revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Matthew's purpose is not to present a chronological sequence of events.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some incidents which occurred later in the Lord's life, Matthew mentions earlier, and some events which occurred earlier, he mentions later.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He does this to show us a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The whole book is a picture of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first aspect of the kingdom that Matthew shows is the seed of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Chapter one presents not only the King of the kingdom, but also the seed of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no doubt that the Lord Jesus is the King; yet this King is also the seed of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To say that the Lord Jesus is only the King is too objective.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must see that the Lord Jesus is not only the King of the kingdom, but also the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This seed is a wonderful Person who has been sown into us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we mentioned previously, Christ is the issue of many human generations mingled with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is Jehovah-plus and God-plus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Chapter two continues by showing who are the proper persons to receive this seed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then chapter three presents the beginning of the preaching of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In chapter four we are told what kind of people the Lord Jesus called into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He did not go to the religious center or to the temple to call the religious people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He did not call scholars, priests, scribes, or lawyers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, He went to the fishing wharf and called some young people who were simple fishermen.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After three and one-half years these young fishermen became the pillars of the first local church on earth, the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then in chapters five through seven, those called by the Lord Jesus followed Him to the mountaintop.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There He gave them a definition of the real kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this discourse, the Lord Jesus described the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Chapter eight, which presents the first case illustrating the kingdom recorded in Matthew, begins after the Lord's descent from the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let us now consider this first case.</S>
