WITH OUR HEART</h2>
<p>God in His wisdom has provided us with the Word and the Spirit. In order for us to receive this provision, on the one hand, we need to contact the Word, but on the other hand, we need to contact the Spirit in fellowship. This means that we must contact the Word and the Spirit.</p>
<p>We contact the Word of God by using our eyes to read, our ears to hear, our mind to understand and comprehend, and our heart to receive. Whether we love God and His Word is related to our heart. If we love God and desire His Word, our heart will receive what our eyes see, our ears hear, and our mind understands. Some saints are able to understand and comprehend what is written in the Bible and spoken in a message because their eyes are bright, their ears are sharp, and their minds are clear. However, they do not love God, nor do they want His Word. Although they can understand, they are not interested. Although they can comprehend, they are not willing to receive. Such a situation requires God&rsquo;s mercy. Every time we come to the meeting, we must have a heart that loves, desires, and seeks God and thus is willing to contact His Word. Then our eyes will see, our ears will hear, and our mind will understand. Furthermore, our heart will receive. This is the way to contact the Word of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONTACTING THE SPIRIT OF GOD<br />
BY PRAYING WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>It is not adequate for us to contact only the Word. We must also use our spirit to contact the Spirit. In contacting the Word, we use our eyes, our ears, our mind, and our heart. The only way to contact the Spirit is by praying with our spirit. Some may say that they do not understand what it means to pray with their spirit. However, they should at least understand what it means to pray. When we begin to pray, we might not use our spirit, but as long as we continue to pray, we will eventually pray in our spirit.</p>
<p>A child who is learning to walk is a good example. Initially, he does not know how to walk, but eventually, he learns how to use his legs to walk. Some believers do not know how to use their spirit in prayer. Even some of the saints who have been serving the Lord for a long time do not touch the Spirit in prayer. Such saints should pray more. If they do not touch the Spirit during the first five minutes, they should pray for eight minutes. If they do not touch the Spirit in eight minutes, they should pray for ten minutes. If they do not touch the Spirit in ten minutes, they should pray for fifteen minutes. There is no need to be impatient or discouraged; they should continue praying, because eventually, they will certainly touch the Spirit. A child practices to walk, and eventually, he is able to walk with his feet in a proper way. Likewise, we need to pray until we are able to pray with our spirit. As long as we continue to pray, we will learn to pray with our spirit to touch the Spirit.</p>
<p>We have a body, a soul, and a spirit; hence, when God fellowships with us, He must take care of each part. He cannot be only the Spirit and not the Word, nor can He be only the Word and not the Spirit. If He were only the Spirit, our spirit might be able to contact Him, but our mind would not understand, and we would be confused, not knowing what is going on. However, if He were only the Word and not the Spirit, we would have the capacity to comprehend and understand Him but not be able to touch Him in our spirit.</p>
<p>Human beings are multifaceted and complex. We have a spirit, and we also have a soul, which includes our mind. Whatever enters our spirit must pass through our mind. If we do not understand a message, it will not pass through our mind, and as a result, we will not receive it into our spirit. If our mind is open, we will understand what is spoken, and the spiritual supply will enter into our spirit through our opened mind. How much we receive in our spirit is determined by how much we understand.</p>
<p>God reaches us first through the Word, through which He unveils us, so that we may understand and know Him. However, He is also the Spirit. God causes us to understand Him, and then He causes us to receive and contact Him in our spirit. As soon as we contact Him, the words that we read will enter into us as spirit and life. The Spirit is the essence of God, His being, and the Word is the means to convey God. In order to receive God, we must first receive the Word of God and then receive the Spirit in the Word. We cannot use only our mind or our heart to receive God. We need to use our spirit. Looking, listening, comprehending, understanding, and receiving with our heart are not sufficient; we must use our spirit in order to contact and receive Him. Prayer is the only way to contact and receive God with our spirit.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Exercise of the Spirit and the Building of God &nbsp; pg 32</div><br></body></html>
