   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT BEING SUPPLIED TO THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE HEARING OF FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit is being supplied to the believers by the hearing of faith Gal 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever we are under the speaking of the New Testament ministry, we are hearing the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The more we hear the faith, the more we receive the supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After we have been under the speaking of the ministry we all can declare, Now I have more Spirit within me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Also, when we review what we have seen when we were under the speaking of the ministry, that review will supply us with more Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit is being supplied to the believers to make what they heard real.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE BELIEVERS BEING BORN OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The believers were born of the Spirit Gal 4:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Galatians reminds us that we were born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are sons born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We were born firstly of Adam, but we were reborn of God, of the Spirit, the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE SPIRIT OF GOD S SON TO MAKE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE BELIEVERS DIVINE SONSHIP REAL</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God, is particularly the Spirit of the Son of God who makes the believers divine sonship real Gal 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today we are sons of God not only in name but also in life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In our practical daily life we are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Who makes us the real sons of God?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The very divine Spirit within us today is the Spirit of the divine Son, so He is the reality of our divine sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we walk and live by Him, we walk and live as a real son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE BELIEVERS LIVING AND WALKING BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The believers should live and walk by the Spirit Gal 5:16-18, 22-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must be deeply impressed that the New Testament does not charge us to keep the letter of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, the New Testament charges us to live and walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now we must ask what the difference is between living and walking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To live means to have life and it also means to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A Christian is a believer in Christ, born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He has the Spirit of sonship in his being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has the life of this Spirit and he exists by this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To live by the Spirit is to have life and to exist by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To walk means to move, to act, to speak, and to do things by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All of our living and walking should be by the Spirit who is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This Spirit is the consummation, the totality of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is living, real, practical, and present in you all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You do not need to seek after Him since He is right in you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You do not need to pray, Lord, be with me the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the past, I liked to pray such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I followed Moses to ask the Lord that His presence would go with me Exo 33:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One day when I prayed this way, however, I became condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I said to myself, Foolish man, the Lord is with you every day, and He says clearly that He will never leave you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But in your daily life, you still ask the Lord to be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I also taught people that the Lord was within them and would never leave them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That day, though, the Spirit within asked me why I prayed that the Lord would be with me when He was with me all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a result, I stopped praying in this kind of way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We do not need to pray in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord is here with us right now.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even if you would go to a movie, He is still within you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, do not be encouraged by this word to go to a movie.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is within you and you need to walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When you are going to a movie, He goes with you, but He goes with you indicating that you should not go further.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You know this, but you may still say, Let me go just for today and I will not go anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Spirit, though, is still within you telling you to turn and walk by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When He indicates within you that you should turn to Him and you respond by saying, Lord Jesus, I will go by You, you will not go to the movie theater, but to the church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we are going with the Lord and by the Lord, our mouth will be full of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to what I have observed, I have never seen a married couple who have never argued with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The real situation of every marriage life is that there is always the tendency and the temptation to exchange words with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I must confess that I wanted to exchange words with my wife many times.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As soon as I began to speak something to her, the Lord was there indicating that I should stop.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At that moment I did not try to stop, but I went with the Lord and I went by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>That practice stopped my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is an example of walking by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we try to stop our bad habits by ourselves, we could never make it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Do not try to walk by the Spirit merely in great things, but walk by the Spirit in small things.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some of the saints may be trying to walk by the Spirit in great things.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They may be praying, Lord, You need a recovery in Athens, Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Should I go there or not?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Lord, I ve been praying for three months.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I surely would like to go by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, do not go by the Spirit in great things first, but go or walk by the Spirit in small things first, such as talking on the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When many saints, especially the sisters, talk on the telephone, it seems as if they do not have the Lord Jesus or the Spirit within them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Quite often their talk on the telephone is vain talk or gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we mean business to walk by the Spirit, we should firstly practice walking by the Spirit in the small things, such as talking on the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you try this, you will find out how rebellious and how stubborn you are.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Maybe during one phone call the Lord Jesus would tell you to stop your talk many times but you would tell Him just one more sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You would not stop your talk on the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We should walk by the Spirit when we receive a phone call or when we make a phone call.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Practice to walk by the Spirit in small things.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Walk by the Spirit when you are going to buy a tie.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You will see that you are not so obedient or so faithful to walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The believers should live and walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>THE BELIEVERS SOWING UNTO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Also, the believers should sow unto the Spirit that they may reap of the Spirit eternal life Gal 6:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Paul says that if you sow unto the flesh you shall reap corruption of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The word unto means with a view to or for.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>To sow unto the flesh is to sow for the flesh, with the purpose of the flesh in view, fulfilling what the flesh covets.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the Spirit, with the aim of the Spirit, accomplishing what the Spirit desires.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We must realize that whatever we do and whatever we say is a kind of sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>With sowing there is always a result, a reaping.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Whatever we say and do is a kind of sowing and some result will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When you do things and say things, you must have a proper view.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Do not sow anything, do anything, say anything, unto the flesh, but unto the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Have this in your view.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This will stop you from doing many things which you should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Sow everything with a view to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Eventually, you will reap of the Spirit eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When I talk to a brother, I should talk in view of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I should not talk in view of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If I sow something unto the flesh, one day corruption will come.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I will reap corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is the last word in this book concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Hallelujah, we do have such a blessing within us!</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>However, we must always live and walk by this living blessing, by this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Then whatever we do and whatever we say will be said and done in view of this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If we sow unto the Spirit, a reaping of eternal life would always be our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The eternal life in Galatians 6:8 does not refer to the eternal life in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If we sow unto the Spirit, we will reap of the Spirit eternal life today.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Otherwise, a result of corruption will be our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This word should encourage us to live and walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>To live and walk by the Spirit is to enjoy the blessing of the gospel.</S>
