<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book contains notes of Brother Witness Lee&rsquo;s fellowship with various brothers and sisters. The first two chapters were spoken in Manila in June 1959, and the third chapter was given in Taipei in October of the same year. All these messages are urgently needed in the churches today. Hence, they have been collected and are now being published for the rich enjoyment of the saints everywhere.</p><br>Home | Prev | <a href="page_002.html">Next</a> </body></html>
