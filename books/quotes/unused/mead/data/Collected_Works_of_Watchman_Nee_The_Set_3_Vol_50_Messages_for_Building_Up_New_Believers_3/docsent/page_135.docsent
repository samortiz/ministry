   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Illustration of Cancer</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have used the illustration of a cancerous tumor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Cancer is one of the most serious illnesses; it is even more menacing than tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When cancer breaks out in certain parts of the body, the cells of that part begin to multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One cell becomes two, two become four, and four become eight.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ordinarily every cell has the ability to grow, but there is a law that regulates its growth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This law tells it when it should grow and when it should not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The cells in my hand do not multiply continuously and indefinitely.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If I cut my hand accidentally, the cells around my cut will start to grow again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Two cells will multiply and become four, and four will become eight.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They will continue to grow until the cut is healed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The cells do this because there is a law which causes the cells to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the wound is closed and the cut healed, the cells will stop growing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What tells the cells to stop growing?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not know how they grow, and we do not know how they stop growing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We know only that it is right for cells to grow when there is a wound, and it is right for them to stop growing when the wound is healed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is an inner law which the cells obey.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They know through the biological law of the body when to grow and when to stop growing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They know submission.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Please bear in mind that the law of our body tells us about the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every cell submits to the body's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When does an ailment become serious?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose my hand is cut by a knife and the cells on both sides of the wound grow around it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the wound is healed, the cells stop growing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I thank God that all the cells stop growing when the wound is healed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What would happen if they continued to grow?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If they did, it would be a cancerous growth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Cancer means that the body has no need of more growth, yet a cell disobeys the regulation which governs this body and continues to grow independently.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This growth becomes a cancer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every cell must be restricted in its growth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With cancer, however, cells do not want to be told when to grow and when to stop growing; they just grow on their own.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They ignore the other cells in the rest of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They grow by themselves continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We call this kind of cell malignant and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Please bear in mind that the whole body is affected by its growth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The cells of the whole body will be affected by malignant cells and will be forced to help them grow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Cancerous cells only cause growth to themselves; they do not bring health to the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the cells of the body should bring health to the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But they all become affected by cancerous cells.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When a person has cancer, the cells of the other parts of body are corrupted by the cancerous cells as soon as they come into contact with them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the while, the cancer continues to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It becomes a separate entity, something no longer under the law of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a person does not submit to authority, if he does not submit to the law of the Body or work according to the principle of oneness but works according to his own will, he is a cancer in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All the nutrients passing through him will be eaten up by him for his own growth, not for the growth of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He will only take care of his own growth, not the growth of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is difficult for a doctor to treat cancer because another principle is operating in the body, a principle that operates on its own.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Being Restricted by the Law of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Body of Christ is a living entity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may say that nothing is more living, more one, and more vital than our body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before believing in the Lord, a brother might have been individualistic, acting on his own.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After he believes in the Lord, he becomes a cell in the Body, a member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every cell is restricted by the law in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is a binding law in the Body, and a man must act according to the law of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He cannot work by his own will.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Once a person acts according to his own will, he becomes a tumor, a cancer in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is not a help but a damage to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are wary of those who act individualistically, those who are not bound by the Body, who act according to their own will, and who have never learned to come under the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After we believe in the Lord, the first spiritual principle we should bear in mind is that the Body is God's ordained authority on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Body is the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God's law is in the Body, and we cannot violate it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We cannot act carelessly according to our own will.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we act according to our own will, we will become unchecked malignant cells in the Body, doing our own things and completely damaging the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We immediately will become a tumor.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We will no longer be one with others and will become independent persons.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We will not be a help to the Body but a damage to it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must learn to accept the judgment and restriction of the Body and submit to the operation of the life of the whole Body.</S>
