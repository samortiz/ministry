Having the proper attitude helps to build up the church. Having the wrong attitude helps the devil to destroy the church life. Some may say that they see the Body, yet their attitude is wrong; having a wrong attitude creates problems in the church. Therefore, the young people must learn to have the proper attitude for the building up of the church.<h2 class=head1>I. BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE BODY</h2><p>We were saved as members of the Body of Christ; therefore, we must be conscious of the Body. Many who do not see this vision, consider themselves as individual Christians, saved by the Lord from going to hell so they can go to heaven. They do not realize that God&#8217;s purpose is the church, nor do they realize that they are members of the Body; therefore, they are not conscious of the Body. They live as individuals separate from the Body. They care only for themselves and their own spirituality. They live independently from other believers, acting as though they are not needed. It is pitiful for a believer to have such an attitude. We must pray and study the Word until we fully see the vision of the Body, and are conscious of the Body of Christ.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_123.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_125.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lesson Book, Level 5: The Church-The Vision and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 124</div><br></body></html>
