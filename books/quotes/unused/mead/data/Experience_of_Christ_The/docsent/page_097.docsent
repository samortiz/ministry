   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OBTAINING THAT FOR WHICH WE HAVE BEEN OBTAINED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 12 Paul says, "Not as that I have already attained, or have already been perfected: but I pursue, if also I may obtain that for which also I have been obtained of Christ Jesus" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>. Here Paul seems to be saying, "I have not reached the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, I am still in the process.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although I may be ahead of all of you, I have not yet attained, nor have I been perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am still on the way."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although the Apostle Paul was very mature when he wrote the Epistle to the Philippians, he still said that he had not yet been perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 12 Paul says that he pursued in order to obtain that for which he had been obtained by Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This word is not easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, he was zealous for the law.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was zealous to such an extent that he even persecuted the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Greek word rendered "pursue" is also the word for persecute.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, when Saul of Tarsus was persecuting the church, he pursued it in a negative sense.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the way to Damascus, he suddenly saw a light from heaven, and he was knocked to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then he heard a voice saying, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Acts 9:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On that day Saul of Tarsus was obtained by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was obtained by Christ so that he might obtain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, in Philippians 3:12 Paul seemed to be saying, "Christ has obtained me for the purpose of my obtaining Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was easy for Him to obtain me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By one action as I was on the road to Damascus, He thoroughly obtained me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But it takes a long time for me to obtain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From the day He obtained me, I have been doing my best to obtain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Throughout all the years since then, I have been obtaining Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the day we were saved we were obtained by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He obtained us in order that we might obtain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How good it is to be obtained by Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you realize that even now He is embracing you so that you may obtain Him?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To repeat, for Him to obtain us is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By one action He obtained us all.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But our obtaining of Him is not once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, it is an ongoing process.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I consider the situation among today's Christians, I am very disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But when I consider the brothers and sisters in the churches, I am quite encouraged, for many of them have been obtaining Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Continually and gradually, daily and even hourly, we need to obtain more of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more we obtain Him, the more we are resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, the more we obtain Christ, the more we are renewed and transformed from the old creation into the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because this is a continuing process, Paul said that he was still on the way to obtain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He had not yet obtained everything of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Philippians 3:13 and 14 say, "Brethren, I count not myself to have obtained: but one thing I do, forgetting those things behind, and stretching forth unto those things before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize of the above calling of God in Christ Jesus" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>. In these verses Paul seemed to be saying, "I have not yet reached the end of the process in God's economy, but I am pursuing toward the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I was Saul of Tarsus, I pursued the church in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But now I am pursuing Christ in a positive way."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul undoubtedly was of a very strong character, both when he was Saul of Tarsus and when he was Paul the Apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Being a strong character, he never did anything halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When he was Saul of Tarsus, he persecuted the church negatively, and after he became the Apostle Paul, he persecuted Christ positively.</S>
