   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONFORMING TO AN OUTWARD STANDARD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Yes, you have changed since you came into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You used to be coarse and vulgar.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Your wife had a fiery temper.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But as you observed the more refined ways of the rest of those in the church, you gradually changed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am sorry to say that you were conformed to the image of the church, not to the image of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Your change was not the result of partaking of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You may seem less rough now and look neater in your appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Your wife has her temper under control.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Your in-laws tell others how much you both have changed since you came into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Others may be impressed with your milder ways, but both your coarseness and your gentleness are from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I look at your faces, I can see that you do not look like the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before you came into the church life, you may have painted your face like the women in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when you noticed that the sisters did not wear makeup, you stopped wearing it too.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now your appearance conforms to what the others look like.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I used to be pleased when I saw how new ones changed after they came into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The long hair would be cut, the beard shaved off.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I thought it was the result of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But I came to see that it was only the outward appearance which changed; the disposition remained the same.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If these new ones had truly been transformed, their whole disposition would have been different.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They were not transformed; only their customs changed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They were being conformed to the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The length of their hair was still being determined by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>PLEASING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is not interested in your changing outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He does not ask you to wear your hair long, or short.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is not trying to make you loving instead of hateful, or humble instead of proud.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's eternal purpose is to have Christ in you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The only thing that pleases Him is that you live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is only one tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the things we do that do not come from life are from that other tree.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To the tree of the knowledge of good and evil belong religion, doctrine, evil, and goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whatever is not of life is of that other tree.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to man's thinking, you should be honest, moral, and humble.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's concern, however, is not with your behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is His intention that moment by moment you live out the Christ within.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not live according to the thoughts in your mind, your knowledge, your doctrine, or your outward circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Live in your spirit, in fellowship with Christ, and according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is what satisfies God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE NEED OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church today lacks this living by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our way is right.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The ground of the church is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On this proper ground, however, we must have the content of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must be filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must not be satisfied to be on the right track and to have the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There must be a practical, real testimony of living out the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must be constantly in fellowship with Him, praying all the time, so that we have the boldness to say, "To me to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE APPLICATION</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You have learned that you must live by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, are you in this reality?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Are you living Christ every day?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this to be your experience, you must pray.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Moreover, your prayers must not be for things or for people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you pray only for things, you cannot pray unceasingly; you will run out of things to pray for!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Your prayer must be a contacting of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To fellowship with Him in unceasing prayer is our spiritual breath, the means by which we breathe Him in.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not enough to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To love the Lord is one thing; to live out Christ is another.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I believe most of you love the Lord; otherwise, you would not be here.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, the question is whether you live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God is not satisfied with your merely loving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Because you love Him, you must not live by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Over the years, young people have often come to me for help with their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I used to be full of answers for them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When someone wanted advice, I would give him point-by-point instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If a brother asked how he should handle his wife, I would give him some commandments to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whatever the problem, I would have an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This kind of advice, I came to realize, is of no real help.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Now, if you come to me with a problem, I have no suggestions.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I have no solutions to propose.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All I can tell you is that moment by moment you must fellowship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>How you should talk with your wife I cannot say.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All I know is that you must be constantly breathing Christ in. While you are with your wife, you must keep communing with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>"Lord, You are my life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I am one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You are in my spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Breathe Him in in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You do not need a method.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Simply fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Keep telling Him that you are one with Him, that He is within you as your life, and that He is one with you.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Wherever you are and whatever you are doing, pray unceasingly to contact Him within.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When this becomes your way of living, you will be out of the realm of religion and doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You will be in spirit living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is what God wants.</S>
