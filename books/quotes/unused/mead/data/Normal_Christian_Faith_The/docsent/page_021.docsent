   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A MAN WHO MEETS ALL FIVE CONDITIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We will set down these five conditions and put the whole of humanity to the test.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us find out if someone meets the five requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such a person would surely be qualified to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first person to put to the test should be yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of course, you are not God, because you have never claimed to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nor have I ever claimed to be.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>So that rules out you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Very well, now we will introduce Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you read his books, you will find that he did conduct a very moral and proper life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But he never claimed to be God either.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, he fails in the first step.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What about Sakya Muni, the founder of Buddhism?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only was there an absence of the claim of divinity, but his philosophy itself is void of deity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He did not believe in the existence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since he had no God, he cannot be God either.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Next, go to Mohammed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He believed in God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But he never claimed to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He called God Allah and himself the prophet of Allah.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you go through every person in history, you will discover that no one ever claimed to be God except One.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That One was Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He claimed to be the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No other person put forward such a claim.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE CLAIM TO BE GOD A SERIOUS MATTER</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How can Jesus of Nazareth claim to be God?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before going on, we have to pause for a moment to seriously consider the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not a light thing to claim to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A person who makes such a claim falls into one of three categories.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He must belong to one of these three categories; he cannot belong to all three.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First, if he claims to be God and yet in fact is not, he has to be a madman or a lunatic.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second, if he is neither God nor a lunatic, he has to be a liar, deceiving others by his lie.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Third, if he is neither of these, he must be God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You can only choose one of the three possibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you do not believe that he is God, you have to consider him a madman.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you cannot take him for either of the two, you have to take him for a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no need for us to prove if Jesus of Nazareth is God or not.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All we have to do is find out if He is a lunatic or a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If He is neither, He must be the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These are our three choices.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no fourth.</S>
