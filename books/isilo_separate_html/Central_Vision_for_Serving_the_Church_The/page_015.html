WANTS TO ENTER INTO OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We need to be burdened and even pray with fasting. We should say, &ldquo;Lord, let me see this vision. Let me see that You, as the mysterious Triune God, have entered into my spirit to be my life. May this vision capture me and control my thoughts, affections, living, walk, and prayers. Lord, I do not want to eat the rind without eating the flesh of the watermelon. I want to eat the flesh and offer people the flesh.&rdquo; Our common problem is that we see the rind but not the flesh; hence, we do not eat the flesh. Therefore, we need to ask the Lord to show us a vision.</p>
<p>Some dissenters called themselves visionaries and spoke of seeing a vision, but in fact they did not see the central vision that the Lord has given to us. They did not see His desire to enter into our spirit and be our life. They did not see this, nor were they willing to follow this. Instead, they said that they had received &ldquo;firsthand goods,&rdquo; not &ldquo;secondhand goods.&rdquo; Such a statement is deceitful. Those who receive light directly from the Bible are not receiving firsthand goods. They can receive only secondhand goods because only the apostles received firsthand goods. Whether we have firsthand goods or secondhand goods, as long as they are &ldquo;gold&rdquo; or &ldquo;diamonds,&rdquo; people will want them. If the firsthand goods are dung, people will not want them even if they are free. We should not be concerned about how many &ldquo;hands&rdquo; the goods have passed through; if the content is genuine &ldquo;gold&rdquo; or &ldquo;diamonds,&rdquo; everyone will treasure them. What the Lord has revealed to us is the best treasure in the universe, whether or not it is firsthand.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO EXPERIENCE<br />
THE WORDS OF THE BIBLE IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We will now spend some time on the &ldquo;diamonds&rdquo; in 1 John. Chapter 1 begins, saying, &ldquo;That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life&rdquo; (v. 1). The Lord is the Word of life that &ldquo;was from the beginning&rdquo; and was manifested to be seen and touched by men. According to verses 27 and 28 of chapter 2, the Lord is in us as the anointing: &ldquo;The anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things...and even as it has taught you, abide in Him...Abide in Him, so that if He is manifested, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming.&rdquo; Verse 27 says that the Lord as the anointing abides in us and we in Him, but verse 28 speaks of His coming, implying that we must await His manifestation and coming. This seems to be a contradiction. If He abides in us, why do we have to await His coming? This shows that we cannot comprehend the Bible with our natural mind; we need experience in our spirit.</p>
<p>Although the Bible contains doctrines, it focuses on life and on the experience of this life. We cannot understand the Bible merely as a matter of doctrine. Even though 1 John 2:27-28 seems to be contradictory, it is a reality in our experience. The Lord is wonderful. On the one hand, He is coming; on the other hand, He has been here for a long time. In other words, He is coming again, yet He is in our spirit. He is truly mysterious. On the one hand, He is abiding in us to be our life and anointing, and we experience His indwelling, but on the other hand, we are abiding in Him until He comes.</p>
<p>In our study of the Bible and in the messages we give, we stress experience. As a result, some who stress doctrines oppose us. I read in a book that Martin Luther emphasized the truth concerning justification by faith to such an extent that he neglected the inner life. He even criticized his contemporaries who emphasized the inner life. Both John Calvin and Kaspar Schwenckfeld were theologians and contemporaries of one another. Schwenckfeld focused on life and wrote about the tree of life, the New Jerusalem, and the spirit, but Calvin considered Schwenckfeld to be demon-possessed. This comforted me and caused me to realize that when we focus on the experience of life, it is easy to be accused of having contradicting doctrines.</p>

OVERCOMING SIN, THE WORLD, AND THE EVIL ONE</h2>
<p>First John 3:6 says, &ldquo;Everyone who abides in Him does not sin.&rdquo; If we abide in the Lord, we do not sin. Sin is an indication that we are not abiding in the Lord. Hence, if we still need the dealing of the cross, we are not abiding in the Lord. If we are abiding in the Lord, we will not need the dealing of the cross. One morning while I was praying with several brothers, we realized that the dealing of the cross is related to the altar, which is in the outer court. If we continually focus on the dealing of the cross, we are going in circles around the altar in the outer court. While we need the experience of the altar in the outer court, we must advance and enter into the Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies is our spirit. When we enter into our spirit, we no longer go in circles in the outer court. In other words, when we sin, we are not living in our spirit, because when we live in our spirit, we do not sin. Everyone who lives in the Holy of Holies does not sin and does not need the dealing of the cross, for he is in his mingled spirit, which transcends all things. First John 3:6 says that everyone who abides in the Lord does not sin. Sinning proves that a person is not abiding in the Lord. Verse 9 says, &ldquo;Everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin, because His seed abides in him.&rdquo; The words <em>His seed</em> refer to God and also to Christ. We do not sin because His seed has been sown into our spirit.</p>
<p>First John 4:13 says, &ldquo;In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit.&rdquo; We know that we abide in the Lord because He has given us the Holy Spirit, who is in us to be one with us. In chapter 5, verse 4 says, &ldquo;Everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world.&rdquo; <em>Everything that has been begotten of God</em> refers to our regenerated spirit. Our spirit has been begotten of God and, therefore, overcomes the world. In the whole universe only our spirit can overcome the world and sin. Verse 18 says, &ldquo;We know that everyone who is begotten of God does not sin.&rdquo; For many years I could not understand this word. On the one hand, I confessed that I had been begotten of God, but on the other hand, my experience seemed to contradict this verse, because I still was sinful. Then I saw 1 John 5:4, which says that &ldquo;everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world.&rdquo; John 3:6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; The human spirit that has been begotten of the Spirit has been begotten of God. Our regenerated spirit can overcome the world and does not sin.</p>
<p>Our flesh likes to sin. First John 2:16 says that the components of the world&mdash;the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life&mdash;are in us. However, we have a regenerated spirit that has been begotten of God. Our regenerated spirit cannot sin, and it overcomes the world. Verse 18 of chapter 5 also says, &ldquo;He who has been begotten of God keeps himself.&rdquo; This means that a believer who has a regenerated spirit, which has been begotten of God, can keep himself from living in sin. The part of our being that has been begotten of God is our spirit. This part is able to keep and protect us.</p>
<p>Verse 19 says, &ldquo;We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the evil one.&rdquo; The whole world, which includes all people and all things, is in the evil one. Only that which has been begotten of God is not in the evil one. Department stores, movie theaters, and dance clubs are in the evil one. Furthermore, our flesh, natural thoughts, religious concepts, and service that comes out of our natural zeal are also in the evil one. There is only one thing in the whole universe that is not under the manipulation of the evil one&mdash;our regenerated spirit. Although we belong to God and we are saints, we are only partially holy, because only our regenerated spirit is holy. Everything else is under the manipulation of Satan. God is in our spirit to be our life so that we may overcome. Verse 20 says, &ldquo;This is the true God and eternal life.&rdquo; This is a matter in our spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
