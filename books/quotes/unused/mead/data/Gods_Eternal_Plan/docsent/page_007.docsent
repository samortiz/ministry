   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE SON OF GOD AND THE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible reveals that the Lord is both the Son of God and the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since the Bible uses both titles when it addresses Him, there must be a distinction between these two titles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today we want to see the meanings of these two titles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE LORD BEING THE SON OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Concerning the Lord as the Son of God, we have the angel in Luke 1:35 who spoke this title to Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Peter received revelation from the Father and knew the Lord as the Son of God in Matthew 16:16.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to Romans 1:4, the Lord was designated the Son of God out of resurrection.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to Acts 2:36, the Lord was made Christ after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to John 20:31, a man is saved through believing that Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can clarify this by the following chart:</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Being the Son of God</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord is the Son of God as well as the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Son and Christ each signify different things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord being the Son of God speaks of His divinity; it indicates that He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His title as the Son also denotes that He is equal with God and shares the same glory as God.</S>

   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The word counsel can also be translated as plan.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In God s plan we have become portions of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, all of us together become the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We become the Christ by being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>First Corinthians 12:12 says, For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This Christ is the corporate Christ, who is composed of the Head and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, we are the Christ in the big corporate Christ, and we have all become a part of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He heads up all things under the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But God does not carry out this work directly; He does it first in the church.</S>

   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then He brings the whole universe under the headship of Christ.</S>
