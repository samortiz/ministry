   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John 12:24 shows us that the Lord Jesus as the divine grain of wheat containing the divine life and glory released the divine life through the breaking of the shell of His body in death to produce many grains to be formed into one loaf, which is the church, the Body of Christ, to be His increase, for the expression of His glory.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He became flesh, passed through human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ultimately, in resurrection became the Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the night of resurrection, the Lord came into the midst of the disciples and breathed into them a breath, saying, "Receive the Holy Spirit" John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Holy Spirit here is actually the resurrected Christ Himself, because the Spirit is simply His breath.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Word which was there in the beginning eventually became the breath, who is the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Father is the source, the Son is the flow, and the Spirit is the realization.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Triune God is realized as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is like the big watermelon becoming the melon juice that has become easy for man to receive.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Old Testament time, God spoke through the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in the New Testament, He speaks to us in the Son Heb 1:1-2a .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Son is simply God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is the expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While He was on earth, whatever He spoke, whether it was teaching, preaching of the gospel, or discourses, and whether it was spoken on the mountain, by the seashore, or in the houses, it was all the Father's words.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the principle of the Bible, the word of God is simply God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To hear God's word is to hear God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To receive God's word is to receive God.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through this dispensing which is without measure, the processed Triune God is injected into us to become our all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit is not merely the Spirit of God before the Lord's incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is the Spirit of God after the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As such, He is the mingling of the Holy Spirit, bearing the divine nature, with the Lord's incarnation His humanity , human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
