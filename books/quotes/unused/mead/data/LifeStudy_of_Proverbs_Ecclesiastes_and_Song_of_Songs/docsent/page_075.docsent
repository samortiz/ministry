   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The wall is down in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Her introspection had built a wall which separated her from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now He calls her to come with Him to a high mountain, which is the top of resurrection ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ died, rose, and then ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First we experience resurrection, then ascension.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no more fighting, for the enemy has been destroyed and the armor has become soft.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, the truth is here.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The truth refers to the reality of the Triune God all that God is, all that Christ is, and all that the Spirit is.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have been resurrected and are now in ascension; the war is over, and victory has been gained.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, all the enemies are still there, and thus we need to be watchful.</S>
