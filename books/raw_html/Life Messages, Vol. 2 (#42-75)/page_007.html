<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>SOME BASIC ITEMS IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h1><h2 class=head1>SOME BASIC ITEMS IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2><p>The Gospel of John occupies a special place in God’s revelation. It is a book much loved by Christians. I myself have been studying it since 1925. In this message I would like us to consider some of the key verses, in order that we might realize the particular characteristic of this book.<p>Notice the simple words with which it opens: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” Even a young child can read these words, yet who can understand them? What was the beginning? Why does it say that the Word, rather than God, was in the beginning?<p>John opens with the Word. Then at the end of the book, there is the breath. “And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit” (20:22). Between the opening verse on the Word and the final item of the breath, many matters are covered.<h2 class=head1>INCARNATION</h2><p>God is here, for “the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” Life is also here, for “In Him was life” (1:4). Flesh is here, for “the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us” (v. 14). Flesh here means man. In fact, as Genesis 6:3 indicates, flesh means fallen man.<p>There are two great events which transpired in the history of the universe. The first was creation. Before creation, there was nothing but God Himself. When the time came, God brought all things into existence. But God was apart from all the things which He created. He was not in the sun or moon, nor was He in the trees or animals. He created them, but He was outside of them.<p>With the second great event, however, the story is different. This was the incarnation, when God became flesh. The incarnation was not to bring the universe into existence out of nothing; rather, it was to bring God into the existing man.<p>There was a man by the name of Jesus with whom was God. From the time this One lived on earth, God was no longer outside His creatures. He had entered into man. Jesus is both God and man. He is a God-man.<h2 class=head1>FULLNESS</h2><p>Another matter covered in John is fullness. “Of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace” (1:16). Fullness means everything that God is. It includes all the divine attributes, all the human virtues, and all the supplies for life. God is rich and full. Out of this fullness we all received. Have you received something of God? It is one thing to learn something of God, but another to receive something of Him. How much have you received? Grace upon grace. Your receiving has not ended yet. Day by day you continue to receive out of His fullness.
