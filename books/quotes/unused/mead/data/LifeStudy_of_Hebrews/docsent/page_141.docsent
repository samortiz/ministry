   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. For the Accomplishment</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of an Eternal Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ s first manifestation was also for the accomplishment of an eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hebrews 9:12 says that through His own blood He entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, having found an eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ accomplished this at the time He put away sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, eternal redemption also is a bequest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>C. For the Consummation</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>of the New Covenant</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first manifestation of Christ was also for the consummation of the new covenant Matt 26:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By putting away sin and accomplishing eternal redemption, Christ consummated the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, the new covenant is also a bequest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>D. For the Bequest</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>of the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, the first manifestation of Christ was for the bequest of the new testament 9:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have seen that when the new covenant was bequeathed, it became the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In His first manifestation, Christ accomplished everything, put all that He had accomplished into a will, and left His will with us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this will we have, as our bequests, everything Christ has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since everything has been accomplished, neither He nor we need to do anything more.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we have this vision, we shall see that within the thirty-three and a half years of His first manifestation, Christ accomplished everything and put it into a will, into the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not think that the New Testament is a book of promise or prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No, the entire New Testament is a will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If your grandfather s will were full of promises and prophecies, it might take eighty years for it to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You might not live long enough for them all to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is exactly the way many Christians take the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today many Christians do not have a will; they have a book of promise and prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are waiting for the promises and prophecies to be fulfilled by and by.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But remember, even Revelation, a book of prophecy, is included in the New Testament which is a will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As I pointed out in the previous message, even in a book of prophecy such as Revelation, many of the verbs are in the past tense, indicating that they have already been fulfilled and accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to have a clear vision and see that Christ has accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we see this, we will not strive for anything, but rest in all that Christ has done.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am happy because Christ has accomplished everything for me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Blessed is he who sees the vision that Christ has accomplished everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is sitting in the heavens because all the work has been done.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is not laboring or striving but restfully sitting there.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Bible, to sit means that the work is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everything needed for the completion of God s eternal plan has already been fulfilled by Christ in His first manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All that He has accomplished has been bequeathed to us in the new testament as our bequests.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>IN THE INTERVAL A. Entering into the Holy of Holies</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>in the Heavens</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After He had accomplished the necessary things through His death and resurrection, Christ ascended to heaven and entered into the Holy of Holies in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 24 says, Christ did not enter into the holy places made by hand, but into heaven itself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The tabernacle in the Old Testament was a figure of the true one in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The earth is the outer court of this true tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After He had finished His work in the outer court, Christ, as the High Priest, entered into the Holy of Holies of the true tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>B. Appearing before God</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ has entered into the Holy of Holies in the heavens so that He might appear before the face of God for us 9:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since He has accomplished everything on earth, He is now restfully sitting in heaven before God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The only time we are told that He stood up was when Stephen was being stoned Acts 7:55-56 .</S>
