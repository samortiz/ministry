<h2 class="head1">SUPPLIED BY THE BOUNTIFUL SPIRIT<br />
OF JESUS CHRIST</h2>
<p>We are also supplied by the bountiful Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19). In Acts 16:7 is the Spirit of Jesus, and in Romans 8:9 is the Spirit of Christ. In Philippians 1:19 is the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The emphasis of &ldquo;the Spirit of Jesus&rdquo; is upon humanity and strength for suffering. But the emphasis of &ldquo;the Spirit of Christ&rdquo; is upon the resurrection and the imparting of life. The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the bountiful Spirit that can support us and sustain us to withstand all kinds of sufferings and to live a transcendent life, a resurrected life. When Paul wrote the book of Philippians, he was under the suffering of imprisonment. Imprisonment was a great suffering to Paul, but he said that through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, he could be sustained to live and magnify Christ (vv. 20-21). By this bountiful Spirit, Paul not only was able to withstand the suffering of imprisonment but also was able to live Christ and magnify Christ through life or through death. To magnify Christ is to live a resurrection life, a transcendent life. Imprisonment could not confine this life. Paul could withstand imprisonment and magnify Christ by living Him because he was fully supplied by the bountiful Spirit of Jesus Christ. By the Spirit of Jesus Christ, we can experience the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ. Then we can live a transcendent life to express Christ in the way of magnification.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RENEWED BY THE REGENERATING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Another organic process in the Spirit experienced by us is that we are being renewed by the regenerating Spirit (Titus 3:5b). In our Christian life, we are undergoing a process of renewing. Sometimes we are up and other times we are down. Whether you feel high or low, up or down, strengthened or disappointed and discouraged, you are undergoing a renewing process. I do not encourage you to be disappointed or down, but the Christian life in our experience is always up and down. If you do not know how to weep or laugh, you are not a proper Christian. You may be like a &ldquo;marble Mary&rdquo; in front of some Catholic cathedrals who never weeps or laughs because she is a statue, not a living Christian. We may say that to be down is bad and that to be up is good, but for the renewing we need to be up and down. Of course, it is not good to be down for too long a time. But if you are down, do not worry. After some time, you will be up. When you are down, you are ready to be up. But when you are up, do not rejoice too much. When you are up, you are ready to be down. This process of being up and down is the process of renewing. I have seen some saints who were down for three months or even one year. You may feel that some of the saints&rsquo; conditions are pitiful and hopeless. But do not say this. As long as a person is a Christian, there is hope. A Christian may be down today, but some day he will be up. At the latest, he will be up when the Lord Jesus comes back. The ups and downs are the process of renewing.</p>
<p>We need to realize that it is easier to stand than it is to fall down. It is normal for a person to stand, but there has to be a strong factor to make him fall down. We should not worry about the saints. It is easy for them to stand, but not so easy for them to fall down. This is the good news. The principle set up by God is that we stand (Rom. 14:4). You may fall down, but do not worry because you will be up. When you recall your falling down, you may feel ashamed, but you will have a deeper sensation that you experienced much renewing. This is because the indwelling Spirit falls down with us when we fall down. He also imparts the divine element into our being to renew us for our transformation into the image of Christ (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SANCTIFIED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>As we are being renewed by the Spirit, we are also being sanctified by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 15:16). To be sanctified means that some element of God&rsquo;s holy nature has been wrought into our nature. Much of the time God&rsquo;s nature is wrought into us when we feel down. When we feel that we are up, not much of God&rsquo;s holy nature can be wrought into us. When we are feeling down and disappointed, that provides an opportunity for the holy nature to be wrought into our nature to make us holy, that is, to sanctify us. Sanctification is an organic process in the Spirit that we need to experience daily.</p>
