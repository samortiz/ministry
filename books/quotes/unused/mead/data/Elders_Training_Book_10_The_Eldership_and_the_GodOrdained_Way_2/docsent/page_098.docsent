   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LABORING IN A PERSONAL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE INCREASE OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I would ask the elders if they are happy about the increase in their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must make a strong decision to labor in a personal way for the increase of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should schedule our time for the weekly preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For the Lord's recovery we all need a turn from barrenness to fruitfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need "new blood," newly saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the local churches must pay attention to this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If our number remains the same year after year, the saints may eventually lose interest in serving.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead of being busy in the church life, they may become busy in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Mothers with young children are consumed with taking care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They do not have much time for other things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The only rescue for us is to change our way so that we can gain the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the only remedy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we cannot gain a thirty percent increase in a year, we should consider that as a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A twenty percent increase is good, but not that good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If twenty out of one hundred saints take this way, they can bring in at least thirty yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not need the whole church to work in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But it is altogether reasonable, logical, and possible that one-fifth of the saints will work in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then we can gain a thirty percent increase yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This increase will stir up the interest of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This burden has been on my heart for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The increase of the local churches is disappointing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many churches have been existing for years with under one hundred saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This has caused me great concern.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the physical realm, the parents are eventually concerned that their children have children.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the parents have five children, and none of them has any children, the parents will be bothered and disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not to beget children is a serious thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The increase of the churches is the key point to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have been in the Lord's interest for about sixty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have no trust in any kind of revival.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We found out by history and through our history that big gospel campaigns do not work for the long run.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord needs some of His saints to practice the priesthood of the gospel according to His ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then the Lord will have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The way of revival with big speakers does not work so well.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What we need today is the proper increase due to our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we labor faithfully, we will see the result.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need at least twenty percent of the saints among us to labor in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These ones can bring a thirty percent increase to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This will lay a foundation for the Lord to start a solid building up of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the local churches, the basic number with the basic, promising members is short.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need solid members for the solid building.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to look to the Lord for His mercy that this work could be started among us.</S>
