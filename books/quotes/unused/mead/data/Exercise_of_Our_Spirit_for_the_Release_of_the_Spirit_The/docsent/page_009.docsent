   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT TO EXPRESS GOD Scripture Reading: Eph 4:6; 5:18b-20 GOD S RELATIONSHIP WITH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 4:6 says, One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although the phrases over all, through all, and in all are very brief and simple, the secret and mystery of God s relationship with man is contained in them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is not only over us but also through us and in us in order to be expressed, manifested, glorified, and exhibited.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must realize that these three phrases are in a particular order.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Everyone who has considered God and believes that there is a God knows that this God is over the people on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is no doubt that God is over all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, not many have considered that God is through us and is doing something through us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, we who are Christians know and experience God being in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To us, God is not only over us and through us, but even more, He is in us and is abiding in us, dwelling in us, and mingling Himself with us for His expression, manifestation, exhibition, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We were made for God and made to fulfill His purpose, which is that we would contain Him and express Him Rom 9:21, 23; Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to read the Scriptures in the light of God s purpose, which is that God would express Himself through humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then we will realize that although God is the invisible and hidden God, a God who always hides Himself 1 Tim 1:17; Isa 45:15 , He also has the desire to manifest and express Himself through man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God can only be seen through humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is proved by John 1:18, which says, No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God does not express Himself through Himself or in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He only expresses Himself through man and in man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although I do not know why God desires this, I do know that this is the desire of His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To illustrate this matter, consider a light bulb.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The sole purpose of a light bulb is to give light.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It has no other purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a light bulb is not attached to an electrical socket so that it can express the light, it is meaningless and good for nothing because it was specifically made for the purpose of receiving and expressing light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, electricity cannot be expressed by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to be expressed, it needs a light bulb that has been made purposely to express electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Similarly, God would never express Himself by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He needs some bulbs, people who were made for the purpose of expressing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must realize that we have been made for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are vessels and containers that are good for nothing but to receive, contain, and express God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As human beings, we must know what we are and what we are good for.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may realize that as Christians we are the saints, the believers, and even the Lord s servants and His children.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, we may have never had the thought that we are containers and vessels of God and that we were made specifically for the purpose of containing and expressing God, just as light bulbs are made specifically to contain and express light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must realize that God is over us, through us, and in us and that He is dwelling in us, abiding in us, and remaining in us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, we must be the containers to contain and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>USING OUR SPIRIT TO SUBSTANTIATE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must also realize that the only way we as containers can express God is by exercising and releasing our spirit, because today God is Spirit, and this divine Spirit is in our human spirit John 4:24; Rom 8:16; 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many Christians who have been saved, redeemed, and regenerated do not realize that they have a human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some believe that the spirit and the soul are synonymous, and others say that the spirit is the same thing as the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, if we are going to realize the spiritual things and understand the secret and mystery of God, we must realize that we have a spirit Job 32:8; Zech 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It would be impossible for us to physically grow if we did not realize that we have a stomach and thus never exercised or used our stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to grow, we must use and exercise our stomach every day to take food in and digest it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God purposely created us with a stomach so that we could take food in for our growth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the same principle, there is an organ within us called the human spirit which God created for the purpose of receiving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our physical body is very complicated and is composed of many different organs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In particular, we have specific organs which give us the five senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These organs are our eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you are in a meeting and try to use your eyes to listen to the message, you will not believe that there is someone speaking because you are using the wrong organ to substantiate the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If someone is showing you different colored objects, and you are trying to hear the colors with your ears, you will not believe in those colors because you are using the wrong organ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If there is an odor in the room, and your nose is not functioning because you have a cold, you will not sense the odor.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You cannot see, touch, or hear the odor; only your nose can sense the odor.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, the principle is that in order to substantiate a certain thing, you need the proper organ with which to substantiate it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You cannot substantiate color using the ear or substantiate sound using the tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the same way, God is Spirit; He is a spiritual substance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is so real, yet if we do not use the right organ to substantiate Him, He will not be real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Since God is a spiritual substance, we must substantiate Him with a spiritual organ our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God created us with ears so that we could substantiate sound, and He created us with eyes so that we could substantiate the visible things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even more, God created us with a spirit Zech 12:1; Prov 20:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, besides the five senses of our physical body, we have a spiritual sense, the sense of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our spirit is not the same as our heart or our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our spirit is the organ by which we sense, receive, contain, and express God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once we realize that we have a human spirit, we can locate God because today God is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the one hand, Christ has ascended and been exalted to the heavens, but on the other hand, Christ the Lord as the Spirit is in our spirit Rom 8:16; 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
