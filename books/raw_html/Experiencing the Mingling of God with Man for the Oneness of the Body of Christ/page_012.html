 <h2 class="head1">THE NEW JERUSALEM BEING<br />
A COMPOSITION OF ALL THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>Now we must say something regarding the oneness as seen in the New Jerusalem. First, we must realize that the holy city, New Jerusalem, is not a place but a person, the bride of the Lamb. The apostle John clearly tells us this in Revelation 21:2. The bride cannot be a place; no one would marry a physical place as his wife. Rather, the bride is a composition of all the redeemed ones of God. In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist said, &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom&rdquo; (3:29a). He mentioned this after his disciples came to him and told him that all the people were following the Lord Jesus. In response, John told his disciples that he was not the Christ and that it was the Lord Jesus who was the bridegroom and who should have the bride. This indicates that the bride is a composition of people. The bridegroom is Christ Himself, and the bride whom He will have is a composition of all the believers. Thus, the holy city, New Jerusalem, is a composition of all the believers.</p>
<p>Revelation also tells us that on the twelve gates of the New Jerusalem are the twelve names of the twelve tribes of Israel (21:12). The twelve tribes represent the redeemed ones in the Old Testament. Furthermore, the twelve foundations of the New Jerusalem bear the names of the twelve apostles, representing all the saved ones in the New Testament age (v. 14). Thus, it is quite clear that the holy city is a composition of all the saved ones throughout the generations.</p>
<p>This corresponds with the apostle Paul&rsquo;s thought and teaching. In the book of Ephesians, Paul indicates that the church is, on the one hand, the wife of Christ and, on the other hand, the habitation of God and that we are like stones that are being built together into the habitation of God (5:31-32; 2:20-22). This is the same as the New Jerusalem&mdash;on the one hand, it is the bride of the Lamb, but on the other hand, it is the tabernacle, which is the habitation of God (Rev. 21:2-3). We as the precious stones are being built together as the holy city. Paul also tells us that the church is built with gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:9-12), and at the end of the Scriptures we are told that the holy city is built with similar materials (Rev. 21:18-21).</p>
<p>We should be renewed from our concept of the New Jerusalem as a physical, heavenly building. The New Jerusalem is a composition of living persons to be the living bride of Christ and the living habitation of God. The holy city is a building in which all the saved ones are built together as one Body. How does this building come into being? It comes into being through the mingling of God with man. The believers are the stones, or materials, of this building, and God is within them. From the throne of God flows a river of living water, and along this river grows the tree of life, whose fruit is the life supply to all those who belong to this city (22:1-2). This picture clearly shows us that God as life and the life supply is being mingled with all the saved ones to produce the holy city. Thus, we can see the mingling and the oneness of the Body in this picture.</p>
<p>This picture as the conclusion of the entire Bible reveals to us that God as life and the life supply wants to be mingled with us in order to produce the Body. This Body, which ultimately is the holy city, is the corporate expression of God. God is the content of the city, and the city is the expression of God, having the appearance of God. In Revelation 4 we are told that the appearance of God on the throne is like jasper (vv. 2-3). Later, Revelation tells us that the appearance of the whole city is like jasper and that the wall of the city is built with jasper stone (21:11, 18). Even the first and top foundation of the wall is jasper (v. 19). This shows us that the appearance of the holy city is the appearance of God Himself. In other words, the city is the expression of God.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John we are told that the Lord came to give us life (10:10), and toward the end of the book the Lord prayed that all those who have His life would be one (17:21-22). In Revelation we see the fulfillment of this prayer in all the saints who are built together as lampstands in each locality (1:11-12). The saints are no longer merely individuals; they are one as lampstands in each locality. Revelation mainly shows us not the individual Christian but a corporate life, a corporate Body. At the beginning of Revelation there are the lampstands, and at the end there is a holy city, in which God as the light is in the Lamb as the lamp (21:23). God is the light, the Lamb is the lamp, and the holy city is the lampstand built of gold (v. 18), like the golden lampstands in Revelation 1. Thus, the lampstands in Revelation 1 are miniatures of the holy city in Revelation 21.</p>
<p>If we take Christ as our life and live Christ, we will be built up together as one. In other words, our oneness is not an issue of our being organized together but of our growing together. We all need to live by Christ. When we are all living by Christ, we will grow up into one in Christ (Eph. 4:15-16). We will constantly be growing and will be built together as one. The oneness is like a thermometer&mdash;it can tell us how much we are in the mingling. If there is no oneness, this proves that there is a lack of mingling. If we are being mingled with God, there will be the oneness of the Body. This is the desire of the Lord&rsquo;s heart. The Lord is seeking after these two matters&mdash;the mingling of life and the oneness of the Body, which are Christ and the church. We need to pray for this and look to Him for the grace that we need to practice taking Christ as our life. Then we will be one, and there will be a real oneness among us. We will be full of life, and we will be the real expression of Christ. This is the golden lampstand today and ultimately the holy city in eternity.</p>
