   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 1 But take care not to do your 2 righteousness before men in order to be gazed at by them; otherwise, you have no reward.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2 Therefore when you give alms, do not 1 sound a trumpet before you as the 2 hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be glorified by men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3 But you, when you give alms, do not let your 1 left hand know what your right hand is doing,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>4 So that your alms may be in 1 secret; and your Father who 2 sees in secret will repay you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>6 But you, when you pray, enter into your private room, and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Portions from Footnotes</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2 1 Surely the heaven-ruled spirit of the kingdom people restricts them from such fleshly boasting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2 2 A stage actor, an impersonator.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was a custom for Greek and Roman actors to wear large masks with mechanical devices that increased the force of their voice.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So in the succeeding verses.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3 1 Indicating that, as much as possible, the righteous deeds of the kingdom people should be kept secret.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Matthew 6:1-18 the Lord uses three illustrations the giving of alms, praying, and fasting to reveal how we are filled with the self and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man's flesh, seeking to glorify itself, always wants to do good deeds before men in order to gain men's praise.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the kingdom people, who live in an emptied and humbled spirit and walk in a pure and single heart under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom must do all things in the spirit to please their heavenly Father.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, the new law of the kingdom is given to them that they should keep it not by their fallen human life but by the Father's eternal, divine life, not to gain man's glory but to receive the Father's reward.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Regarding each of the three illustrations, the Lord uses the word "secret" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>4, 6, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must do our righteous deeds in secret, for our Father is in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The effect of doing our righteous deeds in secret is that the self and the flesh are killed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although the Lord speaks about the matter of reward vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>1, 5 , the important thing here is not the reward, but the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all need some secret growth in life, some secret experiences of Christ because such experiences kill our self and our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No matter what kind of righteous deeds we do giving material things to the saints, praying, fasting, doing something to please God we must try our best to do them in secret.</S>
