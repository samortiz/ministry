<p>God does not want us to do something for Him. God wants us to enjoy Him. The issue of our enjoying Him is His responsibility, not ours. The branches of a tree bear fruit not by their effort; it is the spontaneous issue of their enjoying the tree&rsquo;s sap. Whether a tree bears peaches, apples, oranges, or pears is not the concern of the branches but the responsibility of the sap within the branches. Likewise, the work we should do, the places we should go, and the actions we should take are not our responsibility. Our need is to enjoy everything that is in God. The spontaneous outcome of God becoming our enjoyment is that we will bear fruit.</p>
<p>Hence, we need a change in our concept. It should not be that we first decide to visit some brothers and then kneel before the Lord to pray for them. Rather, it should be that we go before the Lord to enjoy Him, appropriate Him, and breathe Him. We are not considering the brothers but considering God, nor are we considering the work of visitation, but we are eating, drinking, and enjoying God. After we have enjoyed Him in such a way, He will spontaneously bear fruit in us; He will lead us to visit a certain brother or several brothers. Such visitation is fruit borne by God from within us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN LIFE DEPENDING ON<br />
THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD</h2>
<p>To see that God wants us to enjoy Him and that He does not want us to do anything for Him is to see that the Christian life is a matter of enjoyment. Our salvation is for us to enjoy God, and our spiritual growth depends on our enjoyment of God. Even our service and labor depend on our enjoyment of God. God has no intention for us to do something for Him; He only wants us to enjoy Him. Moreover, He is not outside of us. He has entered into us to be our enjoyment as our food and drink.</p>
<p>If we realize that God wants us to enjoy Him and that He does not want us to do anything for Him, we will be able to enjoy, absorb, and appropriate God. If our concept is changed so that we see these two points, it will be easy for us to live a life of enjoying God.</p>
<p>The burden of this chapter is for us to see a vision. God has given Himself to us for us to enjoy so that He may become our content. God does not want us to do something for Him; He wants us only to enjoy Him, absorb Him, and appropriate Him moment by moment. If we will enjoy, absorb, and appropriate Him more, fruit will be manifested through us spontaneously. Our service and worship before the Lord should be the fruit that we bear; our service and worship should not be a work that we do. Our ability to bear fruit depends on our enjoying God, absorbing God, and appropriating God, thus allowing His element to produce fruit within us. Such enjoyment, absorption, and appropriation are what the Bible refers to as fellowship.</p>
<p>Fellowship is not merely communication between man and God; rather, it is the mingling of God and man. Fellowship is our absorbing God, letting Him mingle Himself with us, and letting Him bring us deeper into Himself so that we are mingled with Him. He and we are mingled with one another. This is real fellowship. Fellowship does not depend on our praying for many things, uttering many words, knowing many verses, understanding many teachings, or receiving much instruction. Fellowship depends on how much we breathe God when we pray and how much we absorb God when we read the Bible. It is possible to not understand many portions of the Bible but still absorb God while reading the Bible. This is the true meaning of fellowship between us and God.</p>
<p>We truly need a clear vision and a change of concept. Perhaps after having a change of concept, a brother may no longer &ldquo;know&rdquo; how to pray. Whether we know how to pray is of no consequence; it is not important. What matters is that we realize what God is doing and what God wants so that we know what kind of prayer, Bible reading, and fellowship we should have in order to absorb God and enjoy Him. Without this vision our worship, prayer, and Bible reading will merely be religious activities. May the Lord have mercy on us so that our vision would be clear.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision of the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
