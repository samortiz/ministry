<h2 class="head1">CHRIST IS OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>What then should be our righteousness? This is a very basic lesson for us as Christians. We have to learn this lesson well, and we have to learn it from its very foundation. What is our righteousness? We have to realize that in giving us salvation, God not only solved the problem of sin, but the problem of righteousness as well. God forgave our sins according to righteousness, and at the same time, He has prepared a righteousness for us so that we can come to Him by this righteousness. Forgiveness is like taking a bath, while righteousness is like putting on clothes. We put on clothes in order to live before men. God gave us righteousness in order to live before Him, that is, so that we can see God. Thank the Lord that God has washed away our sins and clothed us with righteousness so that we can live before Him.</p><p>What is our righteousness? God's Word tells us that our righteousness is Christ, that is, the Lord Jesus Himself. First Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption." We will not speak of the other aspects; we will only concentrate on one aspect&mdash;God has made Christ our righteousness.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Being the Righteousness of Christ</h2><p>Before speaking on Christ being our righteousness, we have to mention the difference between the righteousness of Christ and Christ being our righteousness. These are two entirely different things. It is wrong to take Christ's righteousness as our righteousness. Christ's righteousness cannot become our righteousness. It is Christ Himself who becomes our righteousness.</p><p>Second Peter 1:1 says, "The righteousness of our God and Savior." This refers to the righteousness of the Lord Jesus Himself. If the Lord Jesus did not have righteousness, He would not be qualified to be our Savior, and we could not be saved. The righteousness of the Lord Jesus was for Himself alone and is not for us. The Bible does not say that the righteousness of the Lord Jesus saved us. The righteousness of the Lord Jesus only qualified Him to save us. His righteousness belongs to Him alone. His righteousness cannot be counted as our righteousness. The righteousness of the Lord Jesus is the righteousness lived out by Him as a man. This is His personal attribute before God. This righteousness is His own conduct; it cannot be given to us. The righteousness of the Lord Jesus is something He did in Himself. It is absolutely His, and it has absolutely nothing to do with us. This is why the Bible never says that we are "in Jesus." When He was Jesus, He was God's only begotten Son. He was not the firstborn Son, and we were not the many sons. We still had nothing to do with Him. We have to remember that our union with Him did not begin while He was on earth, but while He was on the cross. Before the cross, everything that the Lord had was His alone, and we did not have any part in it. After the grain of wheat fell into the ground and died, it bore many grains. After the Lord Jesus died, we the many grains were produced. Our union with the Lord Jesus began from His death, not from His birth. Golgotha is the starting point of our union with Him. We were not joined to Him at Bethlehem. Before Golgotha, men only saw His righteousness, but could not participate in His righteousness. The Bible shows us from the beginning to the end that in God's eyes, we are not saved by the righteousness of Christ; we do not become a righteous man through Christ's righteousness. We become a righteous man through Christ Himself.</p><p>Some have asked, "Does not the Bible say that God has given us the Lord Jesus' robe of righteousness?" We have to ask, "Does God's Word say that He has given us the Lord Jesus' robe of righteousness, or does it say that God has given the Lord Jesus to us as a robe of righteousness?" In other words, are we putting on the righteousness of the Lord Jesus, or are we putting on the Lord Jesus Himself? If we study God's Word, we will find that it never says that we put on the righteousness of the Lord Jesus; it only says that we put on the Lord Jesus. God has given us the Lord Jesus as a robe of righteousness; we are putting on the Lord Jesus as a person. This is why God's Word says, "Put on the Lord Jesus Christ" (Rom. 13:14). God's Word does not say that we have to put on the righteousness of the Lord Jesus. It says that we have to put on the Lord Jesus Christ. Hence, we see a most interesting and special thing: our righteousness before God is not the conduct of the Lord Jesus on earth; our righteousness before God is the Lord Jesus, a living person. We come to God today because we have put on the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus is our righteousness. This righteousness is not the righteousness that the Lord Jesus had. It is the Lord Jesus Himself. We can have this righteousness all the time before God because the Lord Jesus lives forever. We can be bold before God all the time, because we have the Lord Jesus as our righteousness.</p>
