   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TESTIMONY BORNE IN ITS OWN TIMES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 6 says, "Who gave Himself a ransom on behalf of all, the testimony to be borne in its own times."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ gave Himself a ransom for the accomplishment of redemption for all men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This was necessary in order for Christ to be our Mediator.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek word for ransom means payment in recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is qualified to be the Mediator between God and man, not only in His divine and human Person, but also in His redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both His Person and work are unique.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this verse Paul speaks of "the testimony to be borne in its own times."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is in apposition to the preceding clause; that is, the fact that Christ gave Himself a ransom for all men becomes the testimony to be rendered in its own times.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever this fact is proclaimed, it is a testimony to be rendered to men in its own times.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, when this fact was preached in Africa, that automatically became a testimony rendered to men in Africa in its own times.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The preaching of the fact is always spontaneously a testimony of the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Paul preached in Asia Minor, that was the testimony borne in its own times.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The same was true when he received the Macedonian call and began to preach in eastern Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That was the proper time for the testimony to be declared there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever the facts of Christ's incarnation and death on behalf of all are proclaimed, that is the preaching, the testimony, borne in its own times.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>PAUL'S TRIPLE STATUS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 7 Paul concludes, "For which I was appointed a herald and an apostle I speak the truth, I do not lie , a teacher of the nations in faith and truth."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A herald is a proclaimer of the gospel of Christ, an official reporter of God's New Testament economy; an apostle is one sent by God with a divine commission to set up churches for God, an ambassador from God to the world for the carrying out of His purpose; and a teacher is a tutor who defines, explains, and teaches the contents of God's eternal purpose and His New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul had such a triple status and commission for the nations, the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>FAITH AND TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul had such a status in faith and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Faith here refers to the faith in Christ Gal 3:23-26 , and truth refers to the reality of all the things revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This corresponds to 4:3, those who believe and "have fully known the truth."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is in the sphere and element of this faith and truth, not of the law, types, and prophecies of the Old Testament, that Paul was appointed a herald, an apostle, and a teacher of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE PRINCIPLE OF INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The title of this message is "Prayer to Carry Out God's Desire for Man's Salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although God has such a desire, a heart, to save people, He can fulfill His desire only through the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that He cannot save people directly; He must do it through us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not even the angels have been appointed by God with such a commission for the carrying out of God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This commission has been entrusted only to man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For the carrying out of this commission, we need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to Acts 10, both Peter and Cornelius were praying.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Peter was praying on the housetop, and Cornelius was praying in his house.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From both sides, prayer ascended to the throne of God for the carrying out of God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By means of this prayer, God could accomplish His desire to save the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first Gentile household to be saved was that of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This one example shows that our prayer is crucial for the carrying out of God's desire for man's salvation.</S>
