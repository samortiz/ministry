The universe exists for this purpose, this goal. God created the first creation, which has become the old creation. Now out of the old creation He is producing the new creation. This new creation is something that is mingled with Him.</P><P>In order to produce the new creation out of the old creation, God first came into the old creation as a man. Then He lived in the old creation as a man for thirty-three and a half years. He died in the old creation and then was resurrected. In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) to enter into all His believers, who were the old creation, to make them something new. This means that all His believers have received Him as the divine economy for the new creation.</P><P>Our becoming a new creation in Christ began with our regeneration, and it continues with our being sanctified, renewed, and transformed. Eventually, we will be conformed to the image of Christ and glorified. That will be the consummation of the new creation.</P><P>According to the Bible, the old creation must pass through four ages: the age before the law, the age of the law, the age of grace, and the age of the kingdom. As believers in Christ, we are now in the third age, the age of grace, expecting to enter into the age of the kingdom. God uses these four ages to gain the new creation out of the old creation.</P><P>Today the earth is filled with chaos. Chaos is everywhere. Every part of society is chaotic. However, we should not be discouraged. In addition to the satanic chaos, there is the divine economy. Whereas the satanic chaos will come to an end, the divine economy will reach a consummation. The end of the satanic chaos will be the lake of fire, and the consummation of the divine economy will be the New Jerusalem.</P><P>We need to realize that, both in the Bible and in our experience, the satanic chaos always goes along with the divine economy. It seems that we alternate between economy and chaos, between chaos and economy. Where there is the divine economy, there is the satanic chaos. Where God is, Satan is also. Satan is not behind God, following Him; rather, Satan is at God's side. We may say that God is in the "central lane" and Satan is in the "side lane."</P><P>Let us now go on to consider the record of the divine economy and the satanic chaos from Genesis to Malachi.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. IN THE PREADAMIC AGE</H2><P>There was an age before Adam. In that age, the preadamic age, there were the divine economy and the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Divine Economy</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God's Creation of the Heavens and the Earth</H2><P>In the preadamic age, the creation of the heavens and the earth was a matter of the divine economy (Gen. 1:1; Job 38:4-6). Out of nothing God created the heavens and the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God's Orderly Creation Stirring Up<br>the Angels to Sing and Shout for Joy</H2><P>God's orderly creation stirred up the angels to sing and shout for joy. Job 38:7 indicates that the angels sang and rejoiced when they saw the beautiful universe which God had created.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Satanic Chaos in the Old Creation and the Divine Economy for the New Creation &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
