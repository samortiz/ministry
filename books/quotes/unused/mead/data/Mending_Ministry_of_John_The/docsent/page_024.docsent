   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX LIFE BEING A PERSON FOR US TO LIVE Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:1-3a; 3:14-15; 4:9; 5:4, 11, 12, 13, 16a THE MINISTRIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The twenty-seven books of the New Testament are largely a record of four ministries: Christ's earthly ministry, His heavenly ministry, Paul's completing ministry, and John's mending ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christians for the most part focus their attention mainly on the earthly ministry of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the subject of most Christian messages.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ's earthly ministry is recorded in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It begins with the incarnation and ends with the ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Included in it are His human living and then His death on the cross for the accomplishment of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By His death He took away our sins and released the eternal life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He also terminated the old creation and destroyed God's enemy Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How great were these accomplishments!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yes, Christ's earthly ministry did accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Redemption in itself, however, did not accomplish God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's purpose is not merely to have sinners redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His goal is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Redemption was the procedure for the producing and building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the four Gospels the word church occurs only in Matthew 16:18 and 18:17.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The other twenty-three books of the New Testament, in contrast, use this word again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From Acts and through all the Epistles to the end of the New Testament not only is the term church used; the church is referred to by many other titles as well.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These books reveal the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all; the house or dwelling place of God; the household or family of God; the kingdom of God; the bride of Christ; the new man; the warrior; the lampstand; and, finally, the New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To say that the New Testament, apart from the Gospels, is a revelation of the church in all its varied aspects is to give a proper, inclusive summary.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To see that this is really the case, however, requires our being enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may study these twenty-three books in a detailed, analytical way without ever realizing the point behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It takes a vision for us to see that these books reveal the goal of God's eternal purpose and that Christ's complete redemption is for this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This goal is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How is the church to be produced, built up, and brought to completion?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Three ministries are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first is Christ's heavenly ministry, which began in Acts and will continue right through eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It covers a wide span of time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His earthly ministry, in contrast, lasted only thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The second is Paul's completing ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The third is John's mending ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In my youth I was taught that Christ's work is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is now seated on the throne in the heavens, waiting for His enemies to be made His footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That He is seated is a strong indication that His work is completed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is true, but it is only partially true.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As far as His earthly ministry is concerned, "It is finished" John 19:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we come to His heavenly ministry, however, it is another story.</S>
