   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ENLIGHTENING AND FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past few evenings we have seen how God manifested His grace and accomplished His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have also seen how God through His Son Jesus died for us and for our sins, thus accomplishing the work of redemption Rom 5:8; 1 Cor 15:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His work of redemption justifies us before God through faith in His blood Rom 3:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His resurrection from the dead becomes the assurance of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Through this resurrection we know that God has accepted the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The work of the Lord Jesus has satisfied God's requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His resurrection is a proof to us of this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All who believe in the blood of His Son and who come to Him through His redemption are now justified.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Tonight I will not cover the other aspect of the Lord's work, which is His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since many brothers and sisters already know about this, I will just mention it in brief.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The ascension of the Lord Jesus is His appearing before God on our behalf, that we might be accepted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is ascension?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Bible ascension means only one thing objectively, which is for one to be accepted before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today the Lord Jesus has appeared before God Heb 9:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We also appear before God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this way God accepts us in the same way that He has accepted Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>ENLIGHTENING TO SEEK OUT SINNERS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Tonight we must mention another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The gospel is inadequate if it mentions only the work of the Father and the Son without mentioning the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There must be the mention of the Holy Spirit also.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The work of the gospel is of three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Luke 15 shows us three parables.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, we see the loving Father waiting to receive the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the other hand, we see the good Shepherd coming to the world to seek for the lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One sees the Father waiting at home for the repentant and saved sinner, and one also sees the Son coming to the world to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But after the Lord's work was completed and before the sinner reaches home, there was another parable, which is the woman patiently and carefully seeking the lost coin with a lighted lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, one sees the Lord Jesus coming to earth to seek for the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second, one sees the woman lighting the lamp to enlighten, sweep, and seek for the lost coin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the Holy Spirit is working together with the Father and the Son to seek out the sinner for the accomplishing of the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Son came to die for the sinner; the Father receives the sinner home; and the Holy Spirit works to enlighten man's heart and to show man his real position.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a person does not have the light of the Holy Spirit, it is possible that he can be like Judas, who saw his sin, was suffering and had no peace within, but would not see his own position before God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without the light, he would not see his position of perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man's feeling concerning sin goes only so far as to realize that he has done wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He does not realize that he is a lost one before God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are willing to admit that we are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But without the enlightening of the Holy Spirit, we will not admit that as a result of sin, we became lost persons before God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the eyes of God, we are lost persons.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is the possibility of a fleshly counterfeit even in the matter of sin-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The flesh can replace the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many tears in revival meetings are but results of man's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are not produced through the work of the Holy Spirit in man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is one thing for man to know that he has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is another thing for man to know that his relationship with God is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Holy Spirit patiently and carefully enlightens man and shows him that he is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What the Holy Spirit does is to show man that his position is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, the first feeling of everyone who has experienced the work of the Holy Spirit of God is not something related to sin, but the feeling that he is away from home.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His relationship with God is cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He has developed a problem with God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is a lost man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our problem before God does not lie merely in how much we have wasted ourselves in eating, drinking, fornication, or gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is a problem of being away in a distant country.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the Holy Spirit enlightens man, the first thing He does is show man that he is in a distant country.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When one reads the last parable in Luke 15, he has to take note of what the prodigal said to the father.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He did not say that he had squandered all his father's estate with harlots.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The first thing he realized when he came to himself was that in his father's house there was an abundance of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why then was he living with the hogs in a distant country and not able even to satisfy his hunger with the carob pods which were for the hogs?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the Holy Spirit enlightens a person, he will realize that he has a problem with God, that he has left his Father's house, and that he is away from his Father.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>My friends, when a person in the world has come to the end of himself in his sinful condition, he may, like Judas, become aware of his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But without the light of the Holy Spirit, he will not feel that he has left the Father's house and is in a distant country.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I am not saying that sins are not serious.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Sins are sins.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But the Bible shows us that man's chief sin lies in the fact that he is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is standing on an improper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He may not be in an improper condition.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Of course, all those who are in an improper condition must stand on improper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When the Holy Spirit enlightens us, first He shows us that we are on an improper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then He shows us our improper condition.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the enlightening of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Hence, although there is the love of the Father and the work of the Lord, there is still the need for the Holy Spirit to prepare man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He still has to work in man's heart so that man will receive all that the Lord Jesus has done.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>One can say that the Lord Jesus is our objective Savior from God and that the Holy Spirit is our subjective Savior from God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord Jesus is the Savior who accomplished redemption for us outwardly, and the Holy Spirit is the Savior who accomplishes salvation for us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All of us sitting here have been enlightened by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We all know that we are the lost sheep, that we have all turned to our own ways Isa 53:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We all like sheep were lost.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Our problem was not sickness or lameness, but taking a wrong path.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The path that one takes is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In John 16:8-9, the Lord Jesus told us that when the Holy Spirit comes, "He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What does it mean to be convicted concerning sin?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We are convicted concerning sin "because they do not believe into Me."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have developed a problem with Him, and we have come into conflict with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We are convicted of sin because we have not seen His blood and His authority, because we have not met His demands, and because we now have a problem with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The greatest sin of man is the refusal to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Holy Spirit comes to show us that we have developed a problem with the Lord Jesus and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Our position is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But let me ask a question.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Is it possible that a person in a distant country can be a good son?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Is it possible that he can be frugal and thrifty?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Is it possible that he can be a diligent worker?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Is it possible that he can be discreet in making friends?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We know that this is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If a person has wandered to a distant country and is wrong in his relationship with his father, he must be wrong in all other relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>That is why the prodigal began to live dissolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When the Holy Spirit enlightens a person, not only will He show him that he is in a lost position, but He will also show him that his past conduct has been wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Holy Spirit does not overlook past sins.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>He pays attention to all sins.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>However, He turns one's attention to all the sins only after He has shown such a one his perishing position.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The Holy Spirit first shows you how dangerous a position you are in, then He shows you how many sins you have.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The light of the Holy Spirit enlightens and exposes all the areas in which you have transgressed against others.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>It exposes all unrighteousness and all the hidden sins in our words and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>God's chastisement is for His healing.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The Holy Spirit's rebuking is for His comforting.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>God is not pleased to chastise and punish His children without reason.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The only reason God punishes is that man would obtain peace.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The reason the Holy Spirit shines on man and shows man his shortcomings and his waywardness is that man would accept all the work of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Without the enlightening of the Holy Spirit, we are not able to see even one of our sins.</S>
