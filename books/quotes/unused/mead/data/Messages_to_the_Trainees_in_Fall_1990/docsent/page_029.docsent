   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING DIFFERENT ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Based upon the accumulation of the good deposit of the holy Word, we have to breathe, drink, and eat the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The more we practice this as the root hairs of our experience, the more we will have the dispensing of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To breathe the Lord is to pray in our spirit, and eventually it is to drink the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hymn #73 written by M.E. Barber in Hymns says, "Just to breathe the Name of Jesus, is to drink of Life indeed." Just to mention the name "Lord Jesus" is to drink of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul tells us to pray unceasingly 1 Thes 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot cease breathing for even three minutes without dying.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the same way, we have to pray all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is very basic.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Breathing, drinking, and eating the Lord can only take place in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We breathe, drink, and eat the Lord with, by, and in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must not exercise our mind or emotions too much.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, we should exercise our spirit to control our mind and emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If our mind and emotions are not properly controlled and applied, they can deceive and mislead us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we must not treasure them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, we should learn to hate them, which is to hate our own soul and follow the Lord Luke 14:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we hate our independent mind and emotion, our will also will not rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then we will be persons who always remain in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we remain in our spirit, we will call on the name of the Lord, pray, and praise the Lord, and the divine dispensing will constantly supply us with the riches of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are many aspects to the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eating, drinking, and breathing are all a dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The sealing of the Holy Spirit Eph 1:13 is also a dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The anointing 1 John 2:20, 27 is one of the aspects of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every day we should be under the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The good Samaritan's pouring of the oil and wine upon the wounded man in Luke 10 was a dispensing in type.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 is a bountiful dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should constantly experience all of these aspects of the dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All day long we should experience the anointing, sealing, moving, operating, satisfying, thirst quenching, and watering of the dispensing of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These are the growth of the root hairs.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many of us are short of the "root hair dispensing."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We only take care of the big roots.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, the more root hairs a tree has, the stronger the tree is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to have more and more root hairs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every day we must be under the anointing, sealing, supplying, and watering of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then all the divine attributes become our human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the process of the root hair dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we are under the dispensing of God's love, we have the virtue of loving.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we are enjoying the dispensing of the endurance of the Lord Jesus, we express His patience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need more and more experience like this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many times we are too light, shallow, and rough.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are not fine or grave.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, this dispensing will make us very deep, fine, and weighty Christian brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not merely need messages as lessons on the spiritual truths.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our real and practical situation needs to be touched.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To render help in an outward way does not mean anything if the person being helped does not have root hairs.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need more root hairs for the fine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we have many root hairs and grow by our root hairs, all the small defects in our behavior will be swallowed up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Life really changes us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Spirit today is in our spirit spreading into our mind, and He will even take over our body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we will be persons who are fully joined to the Lord, not only in our spirit but also in our entire being.</S>
