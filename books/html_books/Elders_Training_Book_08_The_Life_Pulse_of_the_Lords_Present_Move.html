<h2 class="head1">FOREWORD</h2>
<p>Approximately four hundred and twenty-five brothers came together in Anaheim, California for an elders&rsquo; training with Brother Witness Lee in February of 1986. Book 7 entitled <em>One Accord for the Lord&rsquo;s Move</em> and Book 8 entitled <em>The Life-pulse of the Lord&rsquo;s Present Move</em> contain Brother Lee&rsquo;s fellowship during those days. As the Lord is bringing all the local churches into His up-to-date move, the fellowship contained in these two books of this set of the elders&rsquo; training series is vital. For the carrying out of the present practice in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, it is crucial that every saint enter into the burden of the word that was spoken in this training.</p>
<p>We trust that the vision of all the points presented in these two volumes would be wrought into us and that we would live according to this revelation. Our prayer is that all the churches with all the saints would be brought into one accord for the Lord&rsquo;s move and that the life-pulse of the Lord&rsquo;s present move, which comprises the home gatherings, the truth lessons, the burden for full-timers, with all being either a job-dropping one or a money-making one, and the spreading of the gospel, would become a living reality in all the churches.</p>

<h2 class="head1">BUILDING AND MEETING<br />
ACCORDING TO THE UNIQUE DESIGN</h2>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s new move we must practice to have four things&mdash;the home gatherings, the truth lessons, the full-time workers, and the spreading of the gospel. These are the life-pulse of the Lord&rsquo;s present move. The first thing we shall fellowship about is how to have the home gatherings. In order to see this matter we must first see the basic principles of meeting.</p>
<p>Every denomination has its own constitution, its by-laws, or creed, in which they declare what they believe, how they practice, how they are organized, how they receive members, and how they meet. These creeds, constitutions, or by-laws of the denominations are their &ldquo;design.&rdquo; A design is a pattern of the building to come. Based upon such a design, they go on to build. From the very beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, Brother Nee declared that we do not have any creed. We only have the Bible. The Bible is our creed. In other words, the Bible is our design. This is why to take the lead in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not a light thing. To do this you must know, not in a shallow way, at least the entire New Testament. You must understand what is in Matthew, especially in chapters five, six, and seven, as well as chapters thirteen, twenty-four, and twenty-five. Then you must know what is in chapters fourteen through seventeen of John. Likewise, you surely must know what are the real contents of the Epistles of Paul and of John as well as the book of Revelation. If you know all these things, then you will know how to produce a design.</p>
<p>A crucial, practical part of this design is the way to meet. Every denomination has its own way to meet. The Greek Orthodox have their Greek Orthodox way. The Catholics, the Presbyterians, the Baptists, and the Pentecostals have their own particular way to meet, but in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we must come back to our creed of the entire Bible and, in particular, the New Testament. We have spent a great amount of effort to study the different ways of meeting in the different Christian groups, but we would only take what is revealed in the unique design. In this chapter we will consider five principles which cover the New Testament way for God&rsquo;s people to meet on this earth.</p>
<p>If we have different ways to meet, the Lord&rsquo;s move will be weakened among us, and this will annul the morale. We will have no impact to carry out God&rsquo;s work and to fight the battle. This is not a small thing. What we do is not up to our concept. It is not up to the American brothers&rsquo; way, nor the Chinese brothers&rsquo; way. All the different races have their own way to gather people. Some Christian groups meet according to the natural, social way which is not according to the design in the Bible. If we take this way, we will cause division, and this will weaken the Lord&rsquo;s move. This will weaken the recovery. In our own history, some among us secretly changed the way to meet. They even changed the nature of meeting. That kind of leadership was not the proper leadership. That leadership led people astray into a wrong way and caused division. Some were corrupted, distracted, and even to some extent ruined through that way. This kind of leadership surely is not the proper leadership, and this is not the design of a wise architect such as the Apostle Paul (1 Cor. 3:10). Therefore, we must come back to the New Testament to pick up the basic principles of meeting. For us to pick up these principles depends upon how much we know the contents of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. According to the revelation of the New Testament economy, there are five basic principles of meeting.</p><h2 class="head1">TO BE GATHERED BY THE LORD INTO HIS NAME</h2>
<p>Matthew 18:20 says that two or three are gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name. The Lord does not say that two or three meet together. The predicate here is not in the active voice, but in the passive voice, saying that two or three are gathered. This indicates that when we come to meet we should not be the ones who take the initiative. Rather, it must be the Lord who takes the initiative. He gathers us. In the world it is the people who initiate a congregation or a gathering. However, sometimes they are gathered. The government, the school, or a club or society initiates the gathering. The initiators gather the people, and all the attendants are gathered. Our meeting is not initiated by anyone except the Lord Jesus. Every time we meet it should be He who initiates, who gathers us, and we are gathered by Him into His name.</p>
<p>The word into has been wrongly translated as in. According to the best use of the English idiom, no one would say &ldquo;into the name&rdquo;; there is no such idiomatic expression. The translators took care of the language idiom, but they damaged and sacrificed the real meaning of the Greek text. Language is always according to culture. Today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we have a high culture; therefore, we must have a higher idiom. We must say that we are &ldquo;gathered into&rdquo; His name.</p>
<p>This means that if we are not gathered by the Lord, we remain in so many other things. We are occupied, detained, kept, and to some extent imprisoned by many things. We are kept in our families, and in our business, and even by our family and by our business. Wives are kept by their husbands, husbands are kept by their wives, and children are kept by their parents. If there were not the gathering of the Lord among us, who would come to the meeting regularly? Many capturing things, many imprisoning and retaining things, such as your tiredness, your office, and your overtime work hours, are the detaining power to keep you from the meetings. Therefore, we need a powerful One to rescue us, to bring us out from all these occupations, and to gather us into His name. In the New Testament &ldquo;His name&rdquo; always denotes His Person. Whenever we meet, we should be gathered out of many different occupations and gathered into the very living Person of the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>The Brethren stress this verse very much. They say that all the denominations meet in their denominational name, such as the Lutherans meeting in Luther&rsquo;s name and the Wesleyans in Wesley&rsquo;s name. They declare and boast that they meet in the name of the Lord Jesus, taking His name. I do not oppose that teaching, yet it does not reveal the depths of the truth. The Lord gathers us <em>into</em> Himself. When we are meeting, we are meeting in Him because we have been gathered out of so many occupations and gathered into this living Person. This is a basic principle of meeting for any kind of meeting&mdash;for prayer, for the Lord&rsquo;s table, for the reading of the Word, or for edification, for building up. Whatever kind of meeting&mdash;small ones, big ones, in the homes, in the halls&mdash;the principle is first that we are gathered out of all kinds of occupations into the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>Quite often even when we are in the meeting we are still not gathered; we still remain in our occupation, in our study of our textbooks, or in our care of our children. We are in the meeting, but we are occupied by things other than the Lord. Therefore, we need this gathering, this rescuing. We need to be rescued by the Lord out of so many occupying things and gathered into His name, that is, into Himself as a living Person. This is a strong point. I hope that the elders from the different churches would have some meetings to show the saints how to take care of these basic principles of meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING IN MUTUALITY AND IN SPEAKING</h2>
<p>In every meeting we should keep the principle of mutuality. The Devil has plotted to annul the mutuality in Christian meetings. All the denominations hold their meetings with one or two speakers plus several assistants helping in music, prayer, and in reading the Bible. This is one-sided. The entire congregation is the audience, keeping silent with hardly any function. There is hardly any mutuality. However, if you would read the New Testament again you could see that the Christian meeting is altogether a meeting in mutuality, a matter of one to another. In 1 Corinthians 14:26 one has a teaching, another has a revelation, another has a psalm, another has a tongue, and another has an interpretation. All these are in mutuality. There is not simply one or a few who function. There is no distinction between laymen and clergy. All are functioning members in mutuality. Hebrews 10:25 encourages us not to stay away from the meetings, but to be &ldquo;exhorting one another.&rdquo; This indicates that the Christian meetings have to be in mutuality. When we all say something, the meeting is altogether mutual, not one-sided.</p>
<p>Speaking is another principle in the Christian meetings. Everyone should speak. In the New Testament even singing is considered as speaking. Ephesians 5:19 says, &ldquo;Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&rdquo; Our singing is a kind of speaking. We speak something by singing. In ancient times the saints spoke the hymns in the meetings. Today Christians in their meetings often use the Psalms. In the ancient times psalms were mainly put to music for singing, but today many Christians use the Psalms not for singing, but simply for reading or speaking. They do not have the habit of speaking from their hymnal. We have been influenced by this tradition. We take psalms by speaking, but we do not use our hymnal by speaking. Whenever we call a hymn, everyone will sing it unless we say otherwise. It is understood that when one calls a hymn, we should sing it. We have to change our habit. When we call a hymn, I now prefer that we speak it first.</p>
<p>I hope that from now on all you brothers who take the lead would try to practice speaking. Quite often when we speak a hymn it means quite much to us. It may be more significant than singing it. Often when people sing a hymn, they pay attention to the music, to the melody, instead of the words. It is somewhat of a distraction to sing it. However, when you speak it, there are no distractions. We take the words in a pure way. If you use the words plus the music, it is hard to conquer the music. The music may conquer the words. To avoid this kind of conquering, it is better to speak.</p>
<p>To speak means more than to sing. Even to read is not so significant as to speak. Speaking the hymns has been nearly killed, annulled, in Christian practice today. We must come back to the practice revealed in the pure Word. Ephesians 5:19 says to speak the hymns to one another. In mutuality, I speak to you and you have to speak back to me. This is quite meaningful. The first time I proposed speaking the hymns was in Jakarta, Indonesia in 1968. That was a wonderful experience of Ephesians 5:19. The major item in our meetings is not the singing but the speaking. The teachers must be speaking, the prophets must be speaking, and all the saints attending the meeting must function by speaking. Your function in the meeting is altogether a matter of speaking. Even to give a testimony is to speak.</p><h2 class="head1">MEETING TO PREACH THE GOSPEL<br />
AND TEACH THE TRUTH<br />
ACCORDING TO THE REVELATION OF<br />
GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>The third principle of meeting is to preach the gospel and to teach the truth. However, our preaching and teaching must not be in an unrestricted way. We must be limited by the realm of the revelation of the New Testament economy of God. Our preaching and teaching must also be uplifted. Simply to be limited in the sphere, in the realm of the New Testament revelation is not adequate. Your preaching and your teaching should be up to the standard. I do not encourage you to preach in a low way. We have to preach in a high way.</p>
<p>In the Bible, you cannot see any kind of loose preaching. On the day of Pentecost the first message that came out of Peter&rsquo;s mouth was quite high, full of mysterious points. Some may point out that this message was given to the Jews, who had much knowledge of the Bible in the Old Testament. But in Acts 14 Paul gave a message to the Gentiles (vv. 15-17), and in Acts 17 he gave a message which was very deep and very high to the Greeks, the philosophical people (Acts 17:22-31). When Paul was speaking on Mars&rsquo; Hill, facing the Greek philosophers, he surely had to give a higher, deeper, philosophical preaching. All the terminology as well as the points Paul covered require much time to study. We should not preach or teach in a shallow way. We have to be restricted within the boundary of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, and be uplifted to the standard of His New Testament economy.</p>
<p>Just before I left my denomination, the preacher gave a sermon in the Sunday morning service on how to kill flies to promote sanitation. This was absolutely outside the boundary of the New Testament economy. In this country some pastors speak about politics and even sex in their meetings. This is terrible. Others speak about biblical prophecy. To talk about prophecy based upon the revelation of the New Testament economy is absolutely all right. But if you talk about prophecy for the sake of prophecy, you are off and you are outside the boundary. To talk about foot washing in relation to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is all right. But if you talk about foot washing for the sake of foot washing, you had better set up a foot washing church. This speaking causes division. If you talk about water baptism, and it is not related to the New Testament economy, that causes division. Even to talk about the baptism in the Spirit with no relation to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy causes division. This is why I speak of meeting to preach the gospel and to teach the truth, not just according to the New Testament but according to the revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Whatever you teach and preach must be restricted by this, and you must uplift your preaching and teaching to the standard of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>An architect would never allow a high tower to be erected in the middle of a building, unrelated to the rest of it. Those who uplift speaking in tongues raise up a high tower unrelated to the building. To those who do this, it seems that the whole body is only a tongue. The best architect surely would &ldquo;cut this tongue down to its proper size.&rdquo; Paul cut in this way in chapter fourteen of 1 Corinthians. He surely was the wise architect who did much cutting in 1 Corinthians.</p>
<p>As a layman architect I designed the meeting hall in Anaheim. I did not make the drawings, but I made the design. In my first design I placed an elevator in the middle of one end of the building. After the concrete was poured, I realized that the design was wrong, and I convinced the brothers to change it. As the unique architect I made many adjustments. I cut off this corner, and I cut off that corner. This was a great cutting to some of the brothers. Although it cost much to take this elevator out, we just could not leave it in. This illustrates that to take the lead is not an easy thing. We must learn to take the lead by looking into the holy Word to see the entire view of God&rsquo;s economy, the plan, the arrangement, the design in His New Testament. We must have a clear view of God&rsquo;s arrangement, God&rsquo;s design. To be an architect is not easy.</p>
<p>The stairway in the meeting hall also was designed by me. Certain brothers who were carpenters considered the design to be strange and built a sample of their own design to show to me. It seemed as if I was one who knew nothing about carpentry, yet I insisted on my design. They had no choice but to build it. Eventually, the fire department awarded us an extra ten percent in seating capacity because the stairways and doors were so good. A &ldquo;layman&rdquo; designed them. Today whoever comes to the meeting feels so happy about the stairway. No one who comes up these stairs has the feeling that he is climbing. An apostle, an architect, a wise master builder, must be one who can give us the proper design.</p>
<p>To see the basic principles of meeting in the Word is not easy, but to use these principles in the meetings will never cause any division. This way to meet will never give rise to any opinions. Perhaps these principles will calm down all the different opinions. Brothers, take care of the way to meet. Do not change the way of meeting in an easy way. Whatever way you take to meet, you must take care of the matter of division. You must take care of the matter of opinion. The issue of the way of meeting may lead to opinions and result in division, as it did among us in years past.</p><h2 class="head1">MEETING TO REMEMBER THE LORD AND WORSHIP GOD</h2>
<p>We must also meet to remember the Lord and worship God. This is a crucial, basic principle which we have to practice. In the church meeting we must do two things&mdash;remember our redeeming Lord and worship our God the Father. We remember the Lord by two means&mdash;by breaking and eating the bread and by drinking the cup (1 Cor. 11:24-25). This should not be something official or formal; it must be real. This eating and drinking indicates our enjoyment of the processed Lord in His death and resurrection. It is not a mass or holy communion. It is altogether an enjoyment through partaking of the processed Christ through His death and in His resurrection. Whenever we remember the Lord, we have to be in His resurrection through His death that we may enjoy Him as a feast. Furthermore, this feast is constituted with His body and blood.</p>
<p>Although we may know this, we still have many newcomers and new ones added among us. This teaching should be carried on all the time. We should train the members in the church to know how to remember the Lord. This is more important than the teaching, the preaching, and the prayer. This is to remember Him by enjoying Him.</p>
<p>At the same time we should worship God the Father. This worship is not in the way of Christianity, the traditional way of worship. Hebrews 2:12 reveals a very particular worship to God. This is the worship to the Father by the Son, not only in the church but through the church and from within the church. He says, &ldquo;I will declare Your name to My brothers.&rdquo; Then He changed brothers to a synonym, saying, &ldquo;In the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise unto You.&rdquo; To sing praises to the Father is the worship to the Father, yet this is a very particular worship. This is the church, constituted with all the believers, worshipping God with Christ in them as the worshipping Person. Have you ever heard that the believers constituting the church worship God with Christ in them as their worshipping Person? The real worship the Father wants today is His Son worshipping Him from within all the believers as the church. This is quite deep. This is not just to have a worship with certain hymns and bowing of the head and kneeling down. The only verse that you can find telling us so particularly how to worship the Father in the church is Hebrews 2:12. Certain verses tell us to worship or serve God in spirit and by the Spirit (John 4:24; Phil. 3:3), but even those verses are not as clear as this verse. The particular way revealed in the New Testament to worship God the Father is in Hebrews 2:12. This is what the Father wants&mdash;a genuine, real worship which is the worship of all the saints of God with the firstborn Son in them as the real worshipping Person.</p>
<p>Hymn 52 in our hymnal is a very good hymn. It indicates that we are worshipping the Father with the Son. Yet that hymn is not up to the highest standard. It does not give any indication that we worship the Father with the Son inside of us. This hymn says that He leads the praise, but there is no indication that the Son is worshipping the Father within us. The Brethren were brought on further, but after over half a century we are now somewhat advanced. Standing on their shoulders, we have been lifted higher. Today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we should not follow the way of worship from the past. We must come back to see what is revealed in the New Testament economy. This is the worship we need to render to God our Father, not less than every Lord&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING TO PRAY<br />
AND TO READ THE WORD OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>Lastly, we meet to pray and read the Word. Colossians 4:16 says, &ldquo;And when this letter is read among you, cause that it may be read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you also read the one from Laodicea.&rdquo; Perhaps many of us did not realize that this reading was a reading in the meeting. It does not refer to reading by passing the letter to each one of the members. Rather, it is in a gathering. To read the Epistle to the Colossians in the meeting is simply to read the Bible, to read the Word of the Lord.</p>
<p>Every church needs some training regarding the meetings. You must set up at least one week to gather all the saints together. You need to spend at least six nights, Monday through Saturday, to train the saints according to the basic principles of meeting, to train them to meet in the way of the New Testament economy, not in the way of Christianity, in the religious, traditional way. We must uplift the standard of our meetings.</p>
<p>Do not forget that to set up any way for meeting which is not according to the revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy always leads to opinion and division. Be careful concerning this. Opinion can result in division. Do not easily propose any way to meet.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOME GATHERING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 2:46; 5:42; Rom. 16:5a; 1 Cor. 16:19b; Col. 4:15; Philem. 2</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we need You in every way. Cleanse us with Your precious blood. We trust in this cleansing. Lord, we do not have any trust in ourselves. Give us the rich anointing. Lord, give us an open heaven that we may see what is on Your heart. Lord, in this matter of home gatherings, we need Your revelation; we need Your enlightening. We do not like to follow the old, traditional way of any meeting. Lord, be with us and give us the instant utterance. Lord, give us the real understanding and real seeing, the inward seeing, that we may have the vision concerning Your way for us to meet regularly. Defeat the enemy. Lord, chase away all the darkness among us. We like to be under a clear sky, seeing the things You like to have us see. Lord, do cover us again with Your prevailing blood. Amen.</p>
<p>In this chapter we come to the very practical matter of the home gatherings. In the New Testament there are not many verses that talk about the way to meet. In today&rsquo;s Christianity the understanding of Christian meetings is almost entirely based upon the natural concept. I would ask you to drop all those concepts. I was greatly frustrated for many years by these concepts. Even after coming into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, that kind of traditional frustration was still with me.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF MEETING IN THE OLD TESTAMENT<br />
AND THE NEW WAY OF HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>There was a certain way for the children of Israel to be gathered in the Old Testament. In Acts 7 they are referred to as &ldquo;the assembly in the wilderness&rdquo; (v. 38). The King James Version uses the word &ldquo;church&rdquo; instead of assembly. There was a certain kind of meeting with the people of God in the Old Testament. They came together three times a year to meet around and within the temple (Deut. 16:16). Then on the day of Pentecost, a new thing began. The one hundred and twenty met in an upper room (Acts 1:13, 15), but they suddenly had three thousand added to them (Acts 2:41). They immediately began to meet in the temple (2:46), but that way of meeting was according to their tradition. Note 46<sup>1</sup> in Acts 2 (Recovery Version) says:</p>
<p class="indent1">In the initiation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, the early believers and even the first group of apostles were not clear that God had forsaken Judaism with its practices and facilities including the temple (Matt. 23:38&mdash;&ldquo;your house,&rdquo; referring to the God-forsaken temple). Hence, they still went, according to their tradition and habit, to the temple for their New Testament meeting.</p>
<p>In referring to the temple in Matthew 23:38 the Lord said, &ldquo;Behold, your house is left to you desolate.&rdquo; The temple was the house of God, but now the Lord called it &ldquo;your house&rdquo; because they had made it a den of robbers (21:13) and God had forsaken it. But the disciples still went to the temple for their New Testament meeting according to their tradition and habit. Although they were still under the influence of their tradition, they were so much under the power of the Spirit that they also met in their homes, even from house to house. The way to meet from house to house was absolutely new.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament in Exodus 12, at the initiation of their exodus from Egypt, the Old Testament saints had the Passover in their homes since there was not a center for their worship by that time. Every home with its household had a little home gathering to observe the Passover. But when they entered into the good land, they had to keep the three annual feasts of the Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles at the worshipping center of Jerusalem. Suddenly on the day of Pentecost under the power and leading of the Holy Spirit, they began to meet from house to house.</p>
<p>The three thousand who were added to the church on the day of Pentecost were all Jewish. They were either local residents or from different countries where they had been dispersed. Many Jews from other countries came back to their fatherland to keep the feast of Pentecost. When they were saved, they were all gathered by the Holy Spirit, so they began to meet in their homes, probably on the same day.</p>
<p>I have also considered how these three thousand were baptized. How could one hundred twenty baptize three thousand? Probably at least one-third of these one hundred twenty were sisters. From the very beginning the Holy Spirit led the new church to do everything by each member. They all did the baptizing. It could not have been a baptism done in a concentrated way with a large gathering and &ldquo;one pastor and an assistant&rdquo; to do the baptizing. They probably did their baptizing in a very &ldquo;scattered way.&rdquo; Peter surely could not control the situation since all three thousand were new ones. These new ones did not have any training, they did not receive any instruction, and they gathered from house to house. We may ask who arranged their meetings, who assigned them, and were some leading ones and helpers appointed? These questions are all our natural thought. On the day of Pentecost there was no time for them to do these things. Suddenly they met, they gathered from house to house.</p>
<p>In October of 1984 I went back to Taiwan and ran a risk to tell people that in all the home meetings there should not be any designated leader. I told them to forget about the leadership. I was so bold to tell them that even a sister or a little girl could be a leader. Then I went further to say that everybody could be a leader. It is superstitious to think that the Holy Spirit assigned a leader to each of the homes, pointing out certain ones to be the leaders. There is no hint in the New Testament concerning this.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEW TESTAMENT WAY<br />
BEING IN THE PRINCIPLE OF INCARNATION</h2>
<p>We must also realize that the New Testament way is in the principle of incarnation. Do you believe that they spoke in tongues in the home meetings in every house, from house to house? Did they speak in tongues only on the big occasions? No doubt, they spoke in tongues before a big congregation. Acts 2 tells us that the many visitors from different countries heard some of the one hundred twenty speaking in tongues on the day of Pentecost (vv. 4, 6, 8). They did speak in tongues before a big congregation, but there is no hint in the Word that they also spoke in tongues in the home meetings. My point is this: in a big congregation, God borrowed the works of power of the coming age (Heb. 6:5) as evidence that what the apostles preached and ministered and how they acted were absolutely of God, not of man (Heb. 2:3-4). God does not have any intention to do that much in a miraculous way. In the New Testament God&rsquo;s doing is always in the principle of incarnation.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years. When He was a carpenter, do you believe He performed miracles? Do you believe that He did not do any carpentry? When Joseph asked Him to make a table, did He miraculously cause a table to appear? We must realize that God lived there in a man. I believe that Jesus did not do anything miraculous in those thirty years. In the three and a half years of His ministry, He occasionally did something miraculously, but I do not believe that He performed a miracle every day and everywhere.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, God&rsquo;s move is always in the principle of incarnation. Incarnation is not only that God mingles Himself with man, but also that God hides Himself within man. During this 1986 elders&rsquo; training, the Lord has done a great deal, but it has all been done in a hidden way. Throughout church history, how much has really been done by the Lord miraculously? If the Bible translators could have translated all the Bibles miraculously, there would have been no need of any labor. When the Lord&rsquo;s move went to a certain country, was there a miracle performed to produce a new translation of the Bible instantaneously? If that were the case, there would be no need for Bible translators. But consider the tremendous amount of labor of the translators of the Bible to collect and train people to learn the foreign languages. The Spanish people could have asked the Bible translators, &ldquo;Where is your God? Isn&rsquo;t your God almighty, omnipotent, and able to do everything? Why wouldn&rsquo;t you fast and pray for three hours to get a version of the Bible in Spanish?&rdquo; This is superstitious. Many educated people become so superstitious in the matter of speaking in tongues. They resort to the human manufacturing of &ldquo;speaking in tongues&rdquo; to fulfill their superstition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PETER&rsquo;S MESSAGE ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST</h2>
<p>On the day of Pentecost three thousand one hundred and twenty believers began to meet from house to house. I must believe that there was no tongue-speaking in those houses. Probably they mainly taught that one message given by Peter on the day of Pentecost. To us Peter&rsquo;s message in Acts 2 may be quite familiar, but it was surely a shock to those three thousand new converts. In Peter&rsquo;s message, God&rsquo;s New Testament economy can be seen. The Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, His living in humanity on this earth, His death and burial, His going into Hades, His resurrection, and His ascension are the points of Peter&rsquo;s message (Acts 2:22-36). Peter quoted Psalm 16 which says, &ldquo;You will not leave my soul in Hades, nor will You permit Your Holy One to see corruption&rdquo; (Acts 2:27; cf. Psa. 16:10). Peter told people that while Jesus was buried, He went to Hades. Then He came out of Hades and His body came out of the tomb. What a description of the Lord&rsquo;s death and burial and what an interpretation of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection! It was prophesied in the Old Testament, but those blinded Jewish teachers never saw this light. But on the day of Pentecost Peter saw this. He also talked about the Lord&rsquo;s ascension when he said that &ldquo;God has made Him both Lord and Christ&mdash; this Jesus whom you crucified&rdquo; (v. 36). Peter told the Jews that God exalted Jesus and uplifted Him to the heavens. In the heavens He received the consummated Spirit and poured Himself out as the Spirit upon the hundred and twenty (v. 33).</p>
<p>Peter was wonderful on the day of Pentecost. He knew how to quote Joel 2, but he quoted too much. In Acts 2:19-20, Peter quoted from the book of Joel that God would show wonders and signs, but none of these wonders happened on the day of Pentecost. Joel 2 needs two fulfillments&mdash;one at the beginning of the New Testament age and another at the end of the New Testament age. The fulfillment of Joel begins and ends the New Testament.</p>
<p>The ending of the New Testament age is also prophesied in Zechariah 12. At that time the Lord Jesus will come down from the air to rescue the Jews from Antichrist&rsquo;s persecution. The Spirit is poured out again and they all repent. Zechariah 12:10 says that God will pour out upon the house of David &ldquo;the spirit of grace and of supplications.&rdquo; That is a fulfillment of the pouring out of the Spirit in Joel the second time.</p>
<p>Peter also did not forget to quote that wonderful verse in Joel that says, &ldquo;And it shall be that everyone, whoever calls on the name of the Lord, shall be saved (Acts 2:21; cf. Joel 2:32). What a message Peter gave on the day of Pentecost! Most Christians take Acts 2 for granted, but I believe that on the day of Pentecost all those new converts, after listening to this message, were talking about it constantly. They probably had no heart to do anything except come together to have a gathering in every house to talk about this message.</p><h2 class="head1">TEACHING AND PREACHING CHRIST AS THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>We need to ask what they did in their home gatherings. Acts 5:42 tells us clearly that they taught and they preached. What did they teach? Do you believe that they taught the Ten Commandments or something concerning God&rsquo;s creation? Did they preach and teach something from the Old Testament? In Peter&rsquo;s first speaking, he did a lot of quoting from the Old Testament. They might have learned from Peter to quote something. Acts 5:42 tells us that they taught and preached Christ as the gospel. Christ Himself, the Person, with all that He had done was the gospel preached by them. That was a real move by the Spirit among all the new converts in the principle of incarnation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN THE HOUSE OF AQUILA AND PRISCILLA</h2>
<h2 class="head2">In Rome</h2>
<p>Following the book of Acts, Romans 16:5 refers to the meeting of the church in Aquila and Priscilla&rsquo;s house. The church in their house was the church in Rome. When I was young, I thought that the church in Rome was very big. The fact that the church in Rome met in Aquila and Priscilla&rsquo;s house, however, indicates that the membership, the size, of the church in Rome was not big but small. Aquila and Priscilla were not wealthy, upper-class people because they were tentmakers. Tentmakers in Rome could not afford a big mansion that could hold one or two hundred people. There are many churches in the United States that have over one hundred saints, but I do not believe the church in Rome was over one hundred. How could one hundred meet in one home? The saints in Rome probably had frequent home meetings in the house of Aquila and Priscilla.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In Ephesus</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 16:19 we again see the church in the house of Aquila and Priscilla. This means that the church in Ephesus also met in their home when they lived there (Acts 18:18-19, 26). When I was young, I considered that the church in Ephesus was big, based upon the record in Acts 19 that many were saved and based upon the fact that the Lord mentioned Ephesus first among the churches in Revelation 2. But I never considered that it was in Aquila&rsquo;s home. The New Testament reveals to us that the way the early believers took for their meetings was the home gathering way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN THE HOUSE OF NYMPHAS</h2>
<p>Colossians 4:15-16 says, &ldquo;Greet the brothers in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house. And when this letter is read among you, cause that it may be read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you also read the one from Laodicea.&rdquo; The church in the house of Nymphas was the local church in Laodicea, meeting in his house. The dissenters argued with us that there were two churches in Laodicea&mdash; one in the home of Nymphas and the church of the Laodiceans elsewhere in the city. But Brother Nee stressed that the very church in the house of Nymphas was the church of the Laodiceans (see <em>Further Talks on the Church Life,</em> pp. 35-36). In these two verses one church is mentioned twice. The church at Laodicea met in the house of Nymphas.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN THE HOUSE OF PHILEMON</h2>
<p>In Philemon 2 Paul refers to the church in the house of Philemon. Philemon lived in Colosse (v. 2 cf. Col. 4:17; v. 10 cf. Col. 1:2; 4:9), and according to history was an elder of the church there. It should be that the church in Colosse met in his house. Hence, it was the church in his house. Therefore, the church in Colosse, the church in Rome, the church in Ephesus, and the church in Laodicea all were meeting in some homes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIC WAY FOR THE BELIEVERS TO MEET</h2>
<p>This should prove to us that meeting in the homes was a custom and became a habit in the early days of the church. Based upon this, we can see that the basic way for the believers to meet is in the homes. The church in Jerusalem had a large number of saints. At first three thousand were added and soon another five thousand were added (Acts 4:4). After this, Acts tells us that in Jerusalem &ldquo;believers were all the more being added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and of women&rdquo; (5:14). Surely the church in Jerusalem could not build a hall, and eventually they were not allowed to meet in the temple. Then where did they meet? In homes, from house to house.</p>
<p>We should spread by the homes and in the homes. If you have the burden to spread the church to another area of the city, start meeting in the homes there. It is better to start the church in homes.</p>
<p>When we were on mainland China, one church started in a cemetery. A group of medical students was saved and they had very little money and no house. They wanted to break bread to remember the Lord, so they went to a Chinese cemetery. In front of each of the tombs was a stone table for offering things to the ancestors of the deceased one. All the brothers and sisters sat around that table before the tomb and had the Lord&rsquo;s table. This is the regular way to have the church life. Nearly all the churches in China were started in some homes, not by renting a place or building a hall.</p>
<p>When you start a church life around a stone table before a tomb, everybody functions. But if you rent a building and set up chairs for a meeting, many are bound. The room always changes the atmosphere of the gathering. If we would meet in a great, crystal cathedral, I am afraid that I would not be able to utter a word. It would also be hard to pray. That kind of &ldquo;crystal cathedral atmosphere&rdquo; kills everything. This kind of atmosphere may be good for a drama or a play, but not good for the church meetings for us to speak for the Lord and for us to open up our mouth to pray. Sometimes a hall may be too big for the church meetings. The best way is to &ldquo;go to a cemetery to have a home meeting started there.&rdquo; Then there would be no need to encourage everyone to function. I assure you that everybody would function.</p><h2 class="head1">TRAINING THE SAINTS TO MEET IN THE NEW WAY<br />
AND TO SUSTAIN THE HOME MEETINGS REGULARLY</h2>
<p>My burden is that all the elders and the co-workers would endeavor to do one thing&mdash;to train our people to take the way of meeting &ldquo;around a table before a tomb.&rdquo; Because the saints are not used to meeting in such a way, we need to train them. When I first came to the United States, I was not used to speaking English, but I was eventually forced to. It is always hard for human beings to have a change, and it is easy for them to do things according to their habit. All the saints are used to meeting in the old way. When they are suddenly put into the homes, they do not know what to do. Just by one meeting, they may have immediately become discouraged. They may not like to have the home meetings and want to go back to the big meetings. Some weaker ones may even think about going back to a denomination for the Sunday service. Therefore, we must endeavor to train the saints to have a change, a transfer. It is not so easy, but this is needed.</p>
<p>We need a lot of practice to do something properly and adequately. I recently composed a Chinese hymn for a big gospel campaign in Taipei. The meeting in which we used that hymn had over fourteen thousand attendants. I made approximately seventeen changes on my original version before it was printed. As a result, it would be hard for anyone to improve this hymn.</p>
<p>Do not expect that we can change the way from big gatherings to home meetings immediately or easily. But we have to do it. We must be transferred from one way to another way. Many children of Chinese parents in the United States have been transferred out of the old Chinese way of speaking into the new English way. We need to have a similar transfer in our meeting life. Otherwise, there is no way for the long run to have the church built up properly. You can never have a proper church life built up by big gatherings. Home gatherings are the only way.</p>
<p>For the long run, to have the proper church life and to get the proper increase and building up in the churches within the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must take this way. Otherwise, we will be practicing Christianity. Whenever we want to have only big meetings, we are practicing Christianity. Big gatherings are only good for some gifted ones to pass on a word as a message to God&rsquo;s children. This is good, but for the building up of the church in a locality, the only way is to have home meetings. There is no other way.</p>
<p>The way of home meetings annuls clergy, swallows up and gives no opening to any ambition, and kills the hierarchy to the uttermost. The home meetings grind the hierarchy into powder. The more big gatherings you would have, the easier it is to build up hierarchy. If there were home meetings in all the Catholic churches, the pope would be brought down and all the bishops, archbishops, and cardinals would be jobless. Some of the elders may be afraid of this. They may wonder how they could control the small groups once the church has been divided into them. They may be afraid that they would lose control.</p>
<p>Some of the elders would consider that the way of home meetings gives them a great and hard job to do. They may wonder how they are going to take care of all the home meetings. These elders are experienced, very spiritual, scriptural, honest, and faithful. They have been faithful to the church life, the church&rsquo;s standing, and they have even sacrificed many things, but suddenly a new way comes in. They may think that with the way of home meetings, the impact is gone. To come together with three hundred and pray together is to them full of impact, and the &ldquo;amens&rdquo; and &ldquo;hallelujahs&rdquo; are like thunder. But in the new way each small group does not have more than ten saints. Five weaker ones may be meeting in one small group. When they come together, what could they do or present? Some of the elders may feel that I am forcing them to quit and that they cannot do their job or fulfill their duty.</p>
<p>After we started the home meetings in Taipei, I went to attend a home meeting. When Sister Lee and I arrived, a brother over eighty greeted us and ushered us in. No one else was there for the home meeting except us and the older brother&rsquo;s granddaughter who was arranging the chairs. At that point, my heart for the home meeting was cooled down. Then the older brother&rsquo;s daughter-in-law came out of the room to play the piano and I was somewhat comforted. But I wondered where everyone else was. The meeting was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. and it was already past that time. Later on, a good number of saints came. They were late because they went out to hunt people. Gradually one came in and then another with new ones. I was encouraged. One brother who had come into the church life about thirty years ago told me that he was once backslidden, but he came back through that home meeting. This brother became the leader in this home meeting. He directed the meeting and started the reading of the Scriptures. There were about twenty people there including a brother from a denomination and some new ones.</p>
<p>I considered that meeting as a gospel preaching meeting, an edifying meeting, and a Bible-teaching meeting. While Sister Lee and I were leaving after the meeting, another new one came to attend the meeting. This was very good. The meeting could not end yet because another new one had just arrived. If you want to have a show or something formal, you cannot have the home meetings. But if you want the reality for the building up and increase of the church, to catch and recover people in all kinds of conditions, you must have the home meetings.</p>
<p>The crucial point is that we must train our brothers and sisters to pay the price, to spend everything, to have the home meetings sustained all the time. Advise them that if they do not have time, it is better to miss some big meetings. But they should never miss the home gatherings. The home gatherings should be held regularly at least once a week. Do not change the time. Have the home meeting on the same day every week in a certain home. Then that home could let all their relatives, friends, neighbors, classmates, and colleagues know that in their home on a certain evening every week there is a Christian gathering. Something will be built up and different people will all come. I say again, we must train the saints to spend everything to sustain such a meeting regularly, all year round.</p><h2 class="head1">A TRAINING OF SINGING</h2>
<p>We also must train the saints how to move in the home meetings. This is a crucial point. Singing is not the main thing, although singing helps a lot. For this purpose I would also propose that every church should have a little training of singing. After the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, you could take fifteen minutes to refer the saints to the hymnal. You could tell the new ones and the other saints something about the hymns and, using the piano, ask them to sing some hymns in a learning way. You cannot do this once for all. You have to do this quite often. This practice will raise up something.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRAINING THE SAINTS TO LEARN HOW TO SPEAK</h2>
<p>The most important thing, however, is to train everyone, old and young, brothers and sisters, new ones or old ones, to learn how to speak. We have found out that up to the present time the best way to speak is to use the messages. But do not use any message as a whole. You have to select good portions from a number of messages and notes to compile a message of about three or four pages. I have pointed out all the crucial points of the messages contained in the fourteen Epistles of Paul, but even that would be a little too much. You still need to drop something to make the word shorter. For every home meeting we need to use speaking material, but we always have to avoid anything official, formal, or ritualistic. We should not read anything formally, officially, or ritualistically. Do not follow the old way where we all take turns reading, and then someone stands up to give a concluding word. You have to forget about this old way. Actually, you should not read the material but speak it in a regular, ordinary, normal conversation.</p>
<p>Note 17<sup>1</sup> in 1 Corinthians 3 (Recovery Version) could be part of your speaking material. In the home gathering one person could say, &ldquo;Brothers, this note shows us that the word destroys means ruins, corrupts, defiles, mars. Here the Bible tells us that if we destroy the temple, we will suffer. And to destroy the temple is to ruin it, to corrupt it, to defile it, and to mar it.&rdquo; This kind of speaking is enough for the first person. Then someone else could speak the next sentence in a living way: &ldquo;To destroy the temple of God means to build with the worthless materials of wood, grass, and stubble. We have to realize that to build the church of God with these natural things is to destroy, to ruin, the temple.&rdquo; We have to practice getting into the material in a very simple way like a speaking. You may explain something as we illustrated above, but you do not need to explain every clause or every sentence. The next person may continue to read (speak), &ldquo;This refers to some Jewish believers who attempted to build the church with the elements of Judaism, and to some Greek believers who endeavored to bring philosophical elements into the building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems that this is a kind of reading. Actually, if you get used to it, your reading will sound like speaking. You will then speak your way through the material spontaneously. There should be no legality. At a certain point you may give a testimony. Do not tell a long story, a &ldquo;sea story.&rdquo; Just share a little bit. You have to believe that this kind of meeting will edify, nourish, enlighten, encourage, comfort, and even reprove people. This is an all-inclusive meeting. The saints will get this kind of help week after week throughout the year. It is not necessary to spend too long a time for this kind of speaking&mdash;just about fifty minutes at the most. You could have a meeting for two hours, so there is plenty of time to do many things in the meeting to cover so many needs. We need to endeavor in this way for the home meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENDEAVORING TO HELP THE SAINTS PRACTICE<br />
THE HOME GATHERINGS</h2>
<p>I know of one particular city in the United States that is endeavoring to help the foreigners, the immigrants, speak the local language. We need to endeavor in the same way to help the saints practice the home gatherings. This new way may cause some of the elders to want to resign. This will kill the ambition. There will be hardly any comfort, leisure time, or rest. There will only be burden and labor. No one will have the ambition to be an elder with this new way because it is too hard. With this new way no elder can be idle.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF ALL THE CHURCHES TO BE THE SAME,<br />
TAKING THE WAY OF HOME GATHERINGS</h2>
<p>The contents of Book 7 in this series were given as a preparation for this fellowship. Now around this globe more than six hundred churches will take the same way. These churches will be like a caravan. If all the cars are driving and you do not drive, your car may be crushed. All the churches on the whole earth will be going on in the same way. The churches in New Zealand, Australia, Ghana, Taiwan, the United States, and everywhere will take the same way as a great local church caravan moving and traveling through this globe.</p>
<p>In the present situation some may be taught and encouraged to be different. To them all the local churches should be different and the teaching and leadership of the Lord&rsquo;s ministry do not fit into their situation. Now you should realize why the eight chapters in Book 7 are a preparation to this fellowship. I am not saying that this kind of church should be dropped. Forget about this thought.</p>
<p>Some United States citizens do not have any idea about fighting, yet they enjoy this country to the uttermost. Somebody, though, is fighting for them. They may be taking advantage of the fighters, but they are still citizens of the United States. We should consider the churches who want to be different as local churches, but we cannot bring them in to fight the battle for the recovery. We need every church to be a fighter.</p>
<p>Suppose the six hundred churches throughout the globe were all different from one another and that each church went its own way. Where then would the impact be? This would be like the age of the Judges in which there was no king and everyone did what was right in his own eyes. When Gideon chose three hundred men to fight the battle for the Lord, they all became the same and they fought the battle for all of Israel (Judg. 7:7, 18). We need such churches today. Wherever we go, it would be wonderful if all the churches were the same.</p>
<p>One particular news publication recently reported that during the past fifty years the Muslims have increased five hundred times, from two hundred million to the present one billion. During the same period Hinduism increased one hundred seventeen percent, Buddhism by sixty-three percent, and Christianity by forty-seven percent. Even Buddhism got more increase than Christianity. The Muslims have such a high increase because they are all unified. Basically speaking, all the Muslims have one way regardless of their nationality or country. Christianity, on the other hand, is weakened by all the divisions.</p>
<p>One brother who is contacting some Jewish people said that some of them have said, &ldquo;If Christianity is true, why do you have so many denominations?&rdquo; This annuls the power. There is no need for others to oppose us. We ourselves are opposing one another. When I came to this country, I taught the truth from the Bible, and I was opposed. In mainland China some of the faithful brothers were judged and arrested. The policemen secretly told these brothers, &ldquo;You did not make any mistake or do anything wrong. We know you are innocent people. The only problem is that your people are fighting one another.&rdquo; That meant that other Christians were fighting against them by contacting the government, so the policemen had to come and arrest them at the order of the government. This is a shame to the Christians.</p>
<p>We Christians have lost our impact by our being different. This is the subtlety of the enemy. If only all the Christians in the United States were the same, what power and impact there would be! This would not only take the entire United States but also the entire globe. But where is such a thing today? Many Christians are fighting. They are not only fighting against us but against each other. The teaching that encourages the believers to be different is erroneous. This is why I studied the New Testament again to find any hint that there should be different churches. The more I studied, the more I realized that all the churches should be identical (see Book 7&mdash;chapter four). Because the Muslims around the world are one, their increase was fivefold in the last fifty years. The churches around the globe do have a certain amount of fellowship; this is our impact. But we must learn to be the same.</p>
<p>Our practice has to be in the sphere of the revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The home gatherings are something in the realm and even at the center of this revelation. This will never cause any trouble to produce divisions. The way of home gatherings is the biblical way, the way ordained by God and initiated by the moving Spirit at the very start of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In the church meetings we first need our spirit exercised. Although the word exercise is not used in 1 Corinthians 14, verse 32 of this chapter indicates very much that we need to exercise our spirit&mdash;&ldquo;the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.&rdquo; This indicates that when the believers in Corinth came together to meet, their spirits were exercised too much, like wild horses without bridles. That forced the apostle to tell them that they had to bridle their spirit. To ride a horse without a bridle means that the horse is not under your control. Today, however, in most Christian meetings there is no &ldquo;horse.&rdquo; I do not think that the Apostle Paul would need to come to tell us that the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. Many Christians do not even know that they have a spirit. They do not know what Paul meant when he used the word &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; in 1 Corinthians 14:32. They have only heard of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>When I was with some Pentecostal groups, I must admit that I saw &ldquo;the wild horses&rdquo; there. I saw people who were jumpers, laughers, rollers, and shouters. To some extent they were all wild horses with no control, no bridle. In a positive sense, the Pentecostal movement has a good point&mdash;the exercise of their spirit. They have such a good point, but they do not realize that what they are doing is the exercise of their own spirit. In order to encourage all of us to exercise our spirit, to some extent we had better adopt the Pentecostal way. The Pentecostal way has a good point in that it forces people to forget about their mind, to forget about their thinking, to forget their consideration, and to really exercise their spirit. On the island of Taiwan there are a group of Christians who are &ldquo;chair shakers.&rdquo; This is their way to get themselves out of their considerations and into their spirit. Both the Pentecostals and the chair shakers have the same principle&mdash;to &ldquo;shake away&rdquo; your considerations and your thinking and to &ldquo;shake up&rdquo; your spirit.</p>
<p>To speak an intelligible language, you have to exercise your mind, but to speak in tongues, you do not need to exercise your mind (1 Cor. 14:14). There is a part of our being created by God&mdash;the human spirit (Zech. 12:1). God, who is Spirit, is not directly related to our body nor to our mind, to our soul. But those who worship God must worship Him in spirit (John 4:24). Therefore, in a positive sense we have to &ldquo;shake the chairs.&rdquo; The playing of sports is an enjoyment in the physical body. To sing may be an enjoyment in the soul. But to shake the chairs and to speak in tongues may be an enjoyment in your spirit.</p>
<p>These chair-shakers and tongue-speakers became addicted to what they were doing. Many of them realized that what they were doing was false, but the effect is that they stir up the main part of their being. Although there is a certain kind of enjoyment, they deceive themselves and deceive others. They do not have the term &ldquo;the spirit&rdquo; nor do they talk about the exercise of the spirit, but they have some enjoyment. We have the term &ldquo;the spirit&rdquo; and we talk about the exercise of the spirit, but mostly we do not have the enjoyment. All the tongue-speakers in Corinth did not have a bridle on their spirit. This is why Paul had to tell them that the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. When they came together, they did not care for each other. Each one cared for his own enjoyment and for his own building up.</p>
<p>The first time I attended a Pentecostal meeting was in July of 1932 with Brother Nee. Brother Nee nearly had no chance to speak. The people in the congregation were shouting, laughing, rolling, and jumping. The pastor had to ring a bell a number of times in order to get them to stop to give Brother Nee a chance to speak. Brother Nee stepped up to the platform and he spoke concerning the prodigal son coming back to the Father in Luke 15. He preached the gospel, talking about how the Father loves the prodigal son. That was a good message from which I learned much. I had never heard many of the wonderful points that Brother Nee shared concerning the Father and concerning the prodigal son. I do not think that Brother Nee&rsquo;s audience had any heart for hearing the truths that he presented to them. They had become addicted to their enjoyment. Some of the ladies there were addicted to jumping and to rolling. The more they rolled, the happier they felt. Sometimes they shouted and yelled while they rolled on the floor. This was their way to release their spirit.</p>
<p>The way of much of today&rsquo;s Christianity suffocates the spirit. They quench the spirit. When you go to many of their meeting places, there is an atmosphere of keeping everything quiet. The congregation sits quietly and listens to music. Some big cathedrals are dark inside. The windows may all be stained glass and the music is played on a great pipe organ. No one can be wild in a place like that. When you walk in, your spirit is killed. Who exercises their spirit in such a worship service? What is needed for the church meetings is for us to exercise our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">PROPHESYING&mdash;SPEAKING FOR GOD<br />
AND SPEAKING FORTH GOD</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 14:32 indicates that we need to exercise our spirit to prophesy. To prophesy is not mainly to predict or to foretell the future. This is something miraculous. The word prophesy mainly means to speak for God and to speak forth God. When God called Moses to go to Pharaoh, Moses told Him that he was not eloquent (Exo. 4:10). The Lord gave Moses his brother Aaron to be his prophet, his spokesman (Exo. 4:16; 7:1). As Moses&rsquo; prophet, Aaron spoke for Moses and even spoke forth Moses. To prophesy is to speak for another and to speak forth another.</p>
<p>When most Christians hear the word prophesy they always think of it in the sense of predicting or foretelling the future. The main meaning, however, of the word prophesy is to speak for God and to speak forth God. We need the spirit to speak for God and to speak forth God. Otherwise, whatever we say will just be an ordinary speaking, not prophesying. I may be a bona fide Christian and an ethical, nice gentleman. If I speak in a church meeting in a meek, mild, and normal way this is not prophesying. Apparently I am speaking for God and speaking forth God, telling something of God to others. But actually I am a gentleman, a mild man, a meek man, speaking with no spirit. We have to exercise our spirit when we speak. In our regenerated spirit dwells the Spirit (Rom. 8:16), so whenever we exercise our spirit the indwelling Spirit moves. If we do not use our spirit, and merely speak or converse in an ordinary way, that is not to prophesy. To prophesy is to speak for God, to speak forth God, from your spirit in which, through which, and with which the Holy Spirit speaks in you. This is the difference between prophesying and the human, ordinary speaking.</p>
<p>Many times in our church meetings, too many of the sharings are just ordinary, human speech. Regardless of how nice this kind of speaking is, it does not edify, it does not build up. Sometimes even the one who gives the message speaks in the way that a typical gentleman converses, with no exercise of the spirit. This kind of speaking kills the audience; it does not give life. Regardless of whether you have a big meeting or a small group meeting, the principle is the same&mdash;to speak without the exercise of the spirit kills the ones to whom you are speaking (2 Cor. 3:6). Many of today&rsquo;s Christian meetings will slaughter or kill your spirit. To some extent we are the same. The elders need to have meetings in their localities continuously for two weeks to train the saints in these things before starting any practice. Otherwise, you will be trying to practice the Lord&rsquo;s present and new move with &ldquo;dead bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can illustrate what the elders are doing by relating something that happened in my home town of Chefoo in 1943. There was a strong sister in the church there who spoke in tongues, and the entire church was captured by her. One sister died whom we all loved. Then the sister who spoke in tongues prophesied and told the husband of the dead sister not to prepare any funeral. She said that the next day at twelve noon, our sister would be resurrected. That stirred up the whole church. The next day before noon, the house was crowded with the saints to see this resurrection. A short time before noon, the tongue-speaking sister came in with two helpers. They all kneeled down and spoke in tongues. After approximately one hour, nothing happened, so she lay down on the dead sister&rsquo;s body, mouth to mouth and arm to arm, and she attempted to breathe life into the dead sister. Nothing happened. Then she and her two helpers picked this dead body up and tried to get the body to walk on the floor. Eventually, one of the leading ones charged the husband to prepare a funeral for our sister. Sometimes the elders try to do the same thing with the saints in their locality. All the attendants are dead bodies. You try to breathe life into them and nothing happens. Then you try to pick them up and even hold them up, hoping that they will be brought to life. Eventually, everyone gets disappointed with the meeting.</p>
<p>Most of the saints like to have a big gathering with a good speaker speaking to them. They feel inspired and edified in this kind of meeting. But mostly they do not appreciate coming together in the way of mutuality with everyone speaking, whether it be in a home gathering or with the whole church coming together. This is the situation because all the attendants are like dead bodies, somewhat like the scattered bones in Ezekiel 37. Ezekiel 37 is a picture of today&rsquo;s Christianity, a picture of scattered bones. In the church meetings what we can see is mostly dead bodies, which is a little bit better than scattered bones.</p>
<p>The elders need to call a conference for two weeks and declare a fast. The whole church needs to fast and pray for our poor, present situation. Let all the saints know and realize the poor situation among us. We have no ground to criticize other Christian bodies. What about ourselves? We are dead, cold, and lukewarm. We need to fast and pray. Then some proper messages need to be given to the saints to edify them, to enliven them, and to tell them that they need to &ldquo;shake the chairs.&rdquo; I am not promoting tongue-speaking, but we need to fellowship with the saints to stir up their spirit in the right way. Chair shaking or tongue-speaking is not the right way. That would get the saints addicted. We need to stir up the saints in seeking such a spirit that is exercised to the uttermost.</p>
<p>Quite often in our meetings the one who is speaking will have to be told by some other saints to speak louder. The reason why this person is speaking in such a way is because his spirit is not exercised. When we exercise our spirit there is a big difference in the way that we speak. The person giving a testimony must be told to speak louder because he is &ldquo;a carcass.&rdquo; A carcass is something dead with no spirit.</p>
<p>For the meeting of the entire church and for the home gatherings we all have to exercise our spirit, so we need to exercise our spirit in our daily life. Especially a half hour before meeting time we should exercise our spirit to get ourselves prepared for the meeting. The members of an athletic team get themselves prepared for the game by warming up. It would be a joke to think that they would come to play a game with a tie and a suit on. But most of the saints come to the church meeting in this way. One brother might ask another who is going to speak in the meeting. When he hears that there will be no speaker but that everybody will speak, he feels that this is too bad. When he hears that Brother Lee is coming to speak, he gets excited and stirred up. This shows how terrible the situation is among us. We say that we are in the recovery, but meeting-wise we still remain in Christianity, we still practice Christianity, and we still repeat Christianity.</p>
<p>The first thing needed is for the leading ones to call a conference and declare a fast. Tell the saints for what purpose we have to fast&mdash;for the deadness, the coldness, the lukewarmness, the indifference, and the spiritless situation. We need to fast and we need to stir ourselves up. We hate to repeat the history of Christianity. We do not promote chair shaking or tongue-speaking, but we like to see what is taught and revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. We like to have the proper prophesying.</p>
<p>Again I want to say that prophesying is speaking for God with our spirit and speaking forth God with our spirit. First Corinthians 14:1 tells us that we need to have an earnest desire to prophesy. Then verse 3 says that prophesying builds up, encourages, and consoles people. Since to prophesy, to speak forth the Lord, ministers Christ to people, it builds up people and gives them encouragement and consolation. Only prophesying can fulfill this three-fold duty to build up, to encourage, and to console the saints. This is what we need, so we have to prophesy.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14:31 says, &ldquo;you can all prophesy...&rdquo; God desires that each of the believers prophesy, that is, speak for and speak forth Him. In Numbers 11:29 Moses exclaimed to his helper Joshua, &ldquo;Would God that all the Lord&rsquo;s people were prophets.&rdquo; Even in Old Testament times, God wanted every one of His people to speak for Him and to speak forth Him. How much more should this matter of prophesying be with all the believers in the New Testament age! I am concerned that even though I have given a message concerning this (see <em>The Divine Speaking</em>&mdash;pp. 14-18), and you may have heard this, you have not promoted it. Everywhere the elders have to promote the prophesying of all the saints, including the sisters.</p>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 11:5 women can prophesy, and the book of Acts gives us illustrations of sisters being prophets (2:17-18; 21:9). The Bible, however, does not allow sisters to teach with authority. Sisters should be silent in the meetings in the sense of teaching with authority (1 Cor. 14:34; 1 Tim. 2:12). Both the sisters and the brothers are all privileged to speak for God and to speak forth God (see note 34<sup>2</sup> in 1 Cor. 14&mdash;Recovery Version). For years I could not understand why in 1 Corinthians 11 a woman was allowed to pray and prophesy with her head covered, but in 1 Corinthians 14 Paul said that in the church meeting the women should be silent. Eventually I realized from the Scriptures that sisters are privileged to prophesy even in big public meetings, but in any meeting sisters are not permitted to speak as a teacher to define certain doctrines with authority as the brothers. The Lord never gave this portion to the sisters. All the sisters, however, are privileged to speak for God, to speak forth God. When they speak, they need some covering. This covering is not merely a piece of cloth, but it means that the sisters have to speak under the covering of the brothers. We all must see that whenever we come together either in a big gathering or in a small group the principle is the same&mdash;we have to exercise our spirit that we may speak for God and that we may speak forth God.</p><h2 class="head2">Training the Saints to Have a New Start</h2>
<p>We must spend a long time to train the saints in every locality. You need to speak on these matters continuously as a kind of training for at least seven days; it is better to take two weeks. Then hopefully we may have a new start. Otherwise, whatever you do according to what you heard was going on in Taiwan and according to what you heard from my messages will just be a mere copying. That will be just like the tongue-speaking sister upholding the dead body to get it to walk. This will not work. Please keep in your good memory the contents of Book 7 regarding the principle of the genuine oneness. Based upon that fellowship, train the saints in your locality for two weeks with much prayer plus fasting. Train them with the fellowship in this book, Book 8. Take more time to demonstrate and to illustrate until all the saints in your locality get a full knowledge of the real way revealed in the New Testament concerning our meetings.</p>
<p>To teach the saints to meet according to the way revealed in the New Testament needs some time. Do not just change the way of your meetings. That does not work. You must stir up every member in your locality to rise up to be profitable persons for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, telling them that we are not here in any way or in any aspect to repeat the poor history of Christianity. We hate to see that repetition. We like to see a real restoration, a real revolutionizing in everything in the recovery. In studying the Bible we do not follow the old way. In prayer we do not follow the old way. In our service we do not like to follow the old way. In our meeting life, even the more, we do not like to follow the old way of Christianity. We refuse to repeat the pitiful, degraded history of Christianity.</p>
 <h2 class="head2">Meeting in Newness of Life</h2>
<p>I am not speaking anything to criticize anybody, but I cannot avoid telling you the truth that we must be renewed! I say again&mdash;we must be renewed! Romans 6 shows us that to be baptized means to be renewed, to have a new life and a new living (v. 4). We need to live, to behave, to act, to work, and to do everything in newness of life. Our meeting has to be in newness of life. We have probably applied Romans 6 to our daily life, but we probably have never applied it to our meeting. We need to meet in the newness of life, not in the oldness of the old history of Christianity.</p>
<p>You need to explain to the saints what it is to be in the oldness of the old history of Christianity. Sometimes we refer to the Lord&rsquo;s Day as Sunday. Sunday is an idolatrous term. We should not use the word Sunday since it is related to idolatry. We have to say &ldquo;the Lord&rsquo;s day&rdquo; (Rev. 1:10). The meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day may be at 10 a.m. We may look at our watch at 9:20 a.m. on the Lord&rsquo;s Day and still consider that it is quite early. One brother may say to another brother, &ldquo;How is your nephew, John? Where is he? Does he have a job? I&rsquo;m very concerned for him.&rdquo; Then these two brothers would proceed to talk about the nephew. After their talk about the nephew, they might begin to talk about the political situation abroad and in the United States. Eventually, one of the brothers realizes that it is five minutes to ten, and he tells the other brother, &ldquo;We have to go. The meeting will start in five minutes. Let&rsquo;s go to the meeting.&rdquo; Then when they come to the meeting, they look around to see what might be the best place for them to sit down. Then they go to that place to sit and listen. This is an example of the oldness to repeat the pitiful history of Christianity.</p>
<p>A brother may sit there, showing his &ldquo;godliness,&rdquo; his &ldquo;piety.&rdquo; He may pray a little bit, waiting for someone to open the meeting. He may be expecting one of the elders to open the meeting. We need to tell the saints that this is the natural act to keep the oldness of the pitiful situation of Christianity. This is to bring the degraded Christianity into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It is a shame! We have to cast out this dead oldness. We should not tolerate the pitiful situation that has invaded the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. In the past ten years the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been somewhat invaded and polluted. This is to destroy, to mar, to ruin, to corrupt the temple of God (1 Cor. 3:17).</p>
<p>Early in the morning on the Lord&rsquo;s Day you should rise up and say, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for a new day, even a day of the Lord. Lord, fill the day with Yourself! Fill me for this day; even fill me with Yourself for the church meeting! Saturate me and soak me! I like to be fully one with You to go to the meeting with You! I believe You are with me and You are in me, and I am going to the meeting a half hour early!&rdquo; If every member of the local church would be like this, what kind of wonderful meeting in the heavens we would have! This is what we mean when we say that we need to have a fresh meeting, full of newness of life. This will put the enemy to shame, and this gives much glory to the resurrected and ascended Christ. This will be very convincing to newcomers and very attractive to the backsliders. I hope that in your locality you will begin to practice what I have been speaking to you.</p>
<p>It is not worthwhile for us to pay attention to tongue-speaking. Let us talk about Christ. Our prophecy must be full of Christ. When many Christians talk about 1 Corinthians 14 they forget what Paul spoke of in the foregoing chapters, especially chapters one through three. They isolate chapter fourteen to fit into their concept. At the beginning of 1 Corinthians Paul stressed that Christ is God&rsquo;s center, that Christ should be our portion, our enjoyment (1:9). We all have been called into the enjoyment of this dear Son of God, and this One has been given as wisdom to us from God to be our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption (1:30). We have to enjoy this One who is the very mystery of God. We have to understand the wisdom concerning this mystery (2:6-7). Then when Paul came to chapter eleven and to chapter fourteen, he charged the saints to practice the meeting life with the very Christ he revealed in the foregoing chapters. I hope that all the elders will be deeply impressed with these things, not to copy anything in your locality but to practice the best thing on the proper standing of the genuine oneness of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">EXHORTING ONE ANOTHER, INCLUDING SHEPHERDING</h2>
<p>In the book of Hebrews Paul speaks concerning many high things regarding the superiority of Christ. In 10:25 he says, &ldquo;Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.&rdquo; Paul told the saints that they needed to come together to exhort one another. In 1 Corinthians 14:3 there are three points: building up, encouraging, and consolation. Exhortation is the fourth point. Paul&rsquo;s word to exhort one another shows the mutuality in a meeting and also implies the proper shepherding.</p>
<p>Do not think that only others need your shepherding. You have to realize that you need others to shepherd you. The Lord knows that although I am an old, experienced brother, I still need your shepherding. A shepherd is one who takes care of other&rsquo;s needs. You need me to take care of your need, and I need you to take care of my need. God never created people to live in isolation. A human being was not meant to live alone. A man was not meant to live without his neighborhood or without society. Man needs community and fellowship. We need the shepherding of one another. The elders should not think that they are so experienced that they do not need the young ones to shepherd them. The elders need the shepherding of the young ones.</p>
<p>The grandfather needs the children&rsquo;s shepherding. Recently, a light bulb went out in one of our rooms. I am over eighty and my wife is close to seventy years of age. When I was trying to climb up to change the light bulb, my wife begged me not to do it because I might fall and hurt myself. We had to suffer the darkness until the next morning when my grandson came to shepherd us. His putting in of a new light bulb shepherded us. Also, our door had a crack in it and we did not know what to do with it; nor did we know where to get a carpenter. We suffered for a week until one day a brother came in and saw the situation. He said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, why didn&rsquo;t you tell me earlier about this? Let me fix the door for you.&rdquo; His care for me made me happy. I gave him something to drink. Therefore, he shepherded me and I shepherded him. He took care of the crack in my door and I took care of his drink. That made us both happy. This is what we call shepherding.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei has eleven thousand members. How many shepherds would one have to hire to do the shepherding there? It is impossible. But when you have small gatherings of ten or twelve, all coming together at least once a week, they shepherd one another. And their shepherding is more practical in details, in small things. Quite often a saint who has just come to the city and has only been there a short time gets sick. They do not even know where to get a proper doctor. In this matter they need your help, your shepherding. If we would do all these things in the home gatherings, all the attendants would feel very much benefited in different ways. The home gatherings are not just for hearing a message, a good speech. In the home gatherings the saints should get the building up, the consolation, the exhortation, and the encouragement resulting in the shepherding in all aspects. This is the real building up. Without the home gatherings, there is no way to build the saints up. The real building up has to be accomplished in the home meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING CARE OF THE NEW ONES<br />
AND THE UNBELIEVERS</h2>
<p>Another aspect of our meetings should be the taking care of the new ones and the unbelievers (1 Cor. 14:23-25). First Corinthians 14:23 refers to &ldquo;the unlearned&rdquo; entering into a church meeting. This is a newcomer, a new one. This one could be a professor in a seminary with a doctor&rsquo;s degree, yet he does not know anything concerning what we are doing. When he comes to our meeting, he surely is a new one. He may know the Bible, but he does not know what we are doing in the meeting. To us he is a new one. According to our experience, this happens quite often.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14:23 also refers to unbelievers coming to the meeting. In the home meetings we should take care of these kinds of persons. This is why the saints need some training concerning how to be flexible. Do not get the meeting fixed in cement. The meeting should not be fixed, settled, with no possibility of any change. We should not have the attitude that a certain meeting is not for the unbelievers, so we do not preach the gospel in this meeting. We should not have the attitude that in a certain meeting we would not say anything for the outsiders and that this meeting is for ourselves. This is altogether wrong. Our meeting hall should be like the New Jerusalem with three gates on four sides. Let everybody come in.</p>
<p>We all have to take care of the four points listed at the beginning of this chapter. The saints in each locality should be trained to exercise their spirit, to prophesy, to assemble to exhort one another, and to take care of the new ones and the unbelievers in our meetings, whether they are big meetings or small ones. If there are some unbelievers, we must say at least a short word concerning salvation, concerning the gospel. Spend five minutes to take care of the unbelievers in this way. Let them hear the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF THE LEADING ONES TO LABOR<br />
AND BE ON FIRE</h2>
<p>All the saints need to learn these things, so the burden of the elders is really great and heavy. I hope that for the Lord&rsquo;s sake all the elders would pick up the burden to labor properly. We should not function in the eldership in the way we did in the past. We need to have a new start.</p>
<p>Since I realized the poor situation among us both in the West and the East, in October of 1984 I began to realize that we needed a new start. The center for this new start must be the home gatherings. The Lord&rsquo;s leading us to take the way of home gatherings is the right way. This is a recovery back to the God-ordained way to have the church meetings.</p>
<p>The brothers who are the elders, the leading ones, in all the churches are the keys. I do not have the time to go to every locality, and I do not need to go. But I do have the burden to fellowship all these matters to the leading ones. I want to infuse you, to put the fire into you. If you all would be on fire, that would be wonderful. If all the elders will be burning, all the churches will be burning. Do not expect the rest of the saints to necessarily be on fire unless the elders, the leading ones, and the leading sisters are on fire.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>

<li>To prepare ourselves for the meeting&mdash;1 Cor. 14:26.</li>
<li>Elders to labor in the Word&mdash;1 Tim. 5:17.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOME MEETINGS AND THE BIG MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Those whom we have observed who have practiced the home meetings may not have had much of the riches in life of Christ and the Spirit, yet they have gained people through the mutual care. Human beings need a community. Even in a small town if there is no home gathering, it would be hard to have the proper communal life. Once you set up the home gatherings, you will attract people. Simply to set up big gatherings for the Christians to come together to listen to messages would not be sufficient to catch people. The home gatherings are centers to catch people for the proper communal life. The church life is the best society because it is the best communal life. We should not consider taking another way besides the way of home gatherings.</p>
<p>We have been distracted for quite a long time. The recovery was raised up by the Lord in the way of the home meetings. Almost all the few hundred churches raised up in mainland China before I left there were raised up in a home. Perhaps the only exception was the one raised up by the saints meeting in a cemetery. The first local church in Southern California was also raised up in a home. Samuel Chang&rsquo;s home on Third Street in Los Angeles was very much used and blessed. However, we gradually forgot and gave up the way by which we were all raised up. This was the reason that since October of 1984, I became so strong to come back to this way.</p>
<p>The churches on the island of Taiwan were also raised up in this way. Even though we had our halls, we still continued to have the small groups in the first six years of the church life there. However by October of 1984 they had nearly lost this. They mostly had the big gatherings. Surely this is a backsliding, a repetition of the poor history of Christianity.</p>
<p>Throughout this long period of time all the churches have been practicing to pay their first attention and give the first love to the big meetings. All the saints were affected and influenced in this way. They lost their taste for the home gatherings because the big gatherings fit in with their natural concept and slothfulness. They did not need to exercise their spirit, but still preferred to talk about the world situation, home affairs, and their relatives, even until ten minutes before the meeting. This was their enjoyment. However, they still came to the meeting. They had not finished their conversation, and even after coming to the meeting, they still continued their talk in their thoughts. Not only their spirit, but even their heart, their soul, and their mind, were altogether not there for the meeting. This is a great backsliding.</p>
<p>I dare not to cut off the big meetings because we still need a big meeting to take care of so many Sunday goers. Today every nation has Sunday as a holiday. Many people consider that if you are going to be a Christian, you must go to church on Sunday morning. This has been a world-wide popular habit. Therefore, it is better to utilize this day and this habit, just as the Lord Jesus and the apostles utilized the way of going to the synagogues on the Sabbath (Luke 4:15-16; Acts 9:20; 13:5, 14, 44; 14:1; 17:10; 18:26; 19:8). The Lord took this convenient opportunity to contact those poor sinners in the synagogues. Therefore, we may need a big meeting, especially on the Lord&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>In every locality, the church may have a big meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day to take care of the Sunday goers and all those who have the popular concept of coming to the church building. This is the way that we can get some people. However, we should not mainly have the big meeting. That would be poor. To not have such a meeting would be a lack, but we should pay our primary attention to the home gatherings. Our slogan should be &ldquo;Home meetings are first&mdash;we give our first love, first attention, and best time to the home meetings.&rdquo; We must give the first of everything to the home meetings.</p>
 <p>We may need a big meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day to take care of the Sunday goers, the backsliding ones, and those with the concept from Christianity. They will have a place at a certain time on Sunday that they could come to get some help. For such a big meeting we need a good and able speaker to give a very sound and attracting message. This is the proper way to practice. Every church needs at least one or two capable speakers. They must have more than mere eloquence. They must be capable in the riches of Christ, capable in the rich word of the Bible, and capable to present Christ in such a living way. Such speakers must be very flexible. They have to continually watch over the attendants in the meeting. You may prepare a Sunday morning meeting with no consideration for the unbelievers and no intent to have the preaching of the gospel. However, when you come to speak and see a number of new ones and unbelievers, you must be flexible in your message. At least ten minutes must be given to speak concerning salvation and the Lord in His redemption. We need such a capable speaker. We need such a person or two persons in every church, especially in a church that has over two hundred people, yet we must still stress the home meetings.</p><h2 class="head1">A SHAMEFUL SITUATION</h2>
<p>The home meetings are the very base for the church to be built up. History proves this, today&rsquo;s situation testifies to this, and our experience over the last ten to sixteen years also confirms this. In Taiwan for over twenty years there has not been much increase. In the matter of the riches in the Word and the riches of Christ, the others who practice the home meetings cannot compare with us. However, they gain quite a number of people. One group in the northwestern United States gained eighteen hundred people in ten years. Within eleven years another group in the eastern United States gained a hundred homes with fifteen meeting in each home. This is a shame to us. We have such riches in the Word and the riches in Christ, yet what have we done? For this reason I was bold to blow away all the oldness. We all should feel shameful that we have wasted the Lord&rsquo;s time and wasted His mercy, His grace, His riches, and all the divine truths He has delivered to us. We all need to repent.</p>
<p>We must take care of the real situation based upon the real one accord among all the churches and upon the revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. You may have only a few hundred persons in your locality. This is not satisfactory. Within only eleven years in a little town of only thirty thousand people, one Christian group grew to fifteen hundred. How many do you have in your locality? You claim that you have the ministry with all the riches, and you use the materials of this ministry. However, you may be in a poor and pitiful situation. Let us all consider our ways. Haggai told the people, &ldquo;Consider your ways. Ye have sown much, and bring in little&rdquo; (Hag. 1:5b-6a). Yet even though this is your situation, you may still be so contented with what you are doing. I would beg you all to reconsider your ways. Not one among us could boast peacefully. The Lord has given us so much, and the riches are here. Yet we have to labor much, to fast, to pray, to wait on the Lord time after time, to have a thorough dealing with the Lord, and to have ourselves fully dealt with by the Lord. We must also labor on how to take care of each home meeting, to tend them, to enrich them, and to give them the proper word that they may use to minister to others.</p>
<p>We must not merely have a routine church in a routine way, where everything is set up with a routine schedule year round, every year the same. We all have been practicing this for over fifteen years. Year after year it is still the same. The routine is the same; the number is the same; everything is the same. This is deadness, coldness, oldness, and lukewarmness. Therefore, wake up! Reconsider the situation. Take the proper way, the living way, the biblical way, the way of life. In Taipei I spoke strongly, reminding them that there were over eleven thousand on the name cards but only about four thousand in the meetings. But thank the Lord, He has honored what I have done. So many dear ones were awakened. They would not remain in that pitiful situation any longer.</p>
 <p>Now I would say nearly the same thing to the dear ones in the United States. Consider for how many years the churches have been in this country. It seems that no one has ever risen up to say that they could not sleep well, that they could not eat well, that they were desperate due to the situation. Come together to fast and pray. If three days are not sufficient, let us pray for seven days or even three weeks. In Acts chapter one the one hundred twenty prayed steadfastly for ten days. Do not merely come together to talk about the way to drive the car. Even if you know the way, you are still short of gasoline. You need to prepare and pray and get your tank filled. Then just drive; there is no need to talk about the way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREPARING OURSELVES FOR THE MEETING</h2>
<p>In speaking of preparing ourselves for the meeting, I would primarily refer this word to the elders. We all need to be prepared for the meeting. Perhaps quite often even you as an elder were not prepared for the meeting. You simply went to the meeting in the routine way. You kept the scheduled time. Even in some localities the elders come to the meeting after the scheduled time. You were not only not prepared, but you even came to the meeting late. For a leading one in a local church to come to the meeting even ten minutes early is a shame. As elders you should be the first ones to come to the meeting. If you would come to the meeting in this way, so many others would come early. They will follow you. You are the head sheep; you take the lead. If as the head sheep you come to the meeting only two minutes before the scheduled time, how could you expect the others to come to the meeting early? If you have already lost interest in the meeting, how could you expect others to have an interest? We must rise up and consider this seriously. Do we mean business to take the lead in the many churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? If we do mean business, we cannot take this way in coming to the meetings. It is a shame for us to enter a meeting five minutes late.</p>
<p>To come early is a small thing. If you would practice this, it would become easy. However, to prepare yourself for the meeting implies very much. You could not do this in only half an hour. You must prepare yourself for the meeting every day. First Corinthians 14:26 says, &ldquo;What is it then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.&rdquo; This verse uses the word has. This does not mean that whenever you come together you should pray and wait on the Lord that you may receive inspiration. It means that you already have something, that something is prepared in you.</p>
<p>It is too late to get something after you come to the meeting. In many of the churches the brothers and sisters used to bring food for a love feast. Each one would bring something different; everyone had something. When each one came with something, there was a rich feast and a rich exhibition. When all the food was put together, you could see the riches. The exhibition became a mutual enjoyment. We could not have practiced to come to the meeting to attend a love feast with no preparation. If everyone came this way, there could be no feast. Even to have bought some groceries on the way to the meeting would have been too late.</p>
<p>This illustrates the situation in our meetings. Perhaps only one brother is charged and burdened to have a message for the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting. If one would become a full-timer in your locality, you may spontaneously assign him to give the message. Only that one will suffer. All the others will take it easy and go according to their routine, according to the schedule. Only one bears the burden to strive and to share a word. As the speaker, you must also be prepared to be criticized. Many eyes will be watching over you. Either all will welcome and praise you, or they will drop their heads before you. This is our way to practice the meetings. All the attendants are like spectators at a football game. When you play well, they will clap, shout, and yell. When you play poorly, they will criticize you. This is not merely my observation; it is according to my scientific investigation of our meetings. You elders should bear the burden and the blame because you did not do your duty to train the flock under your care. You cannot blame the flock. They never received the adequate help from you.</p>
 <p>To get yourself prepared you need to contact the Lord all the time. You need to get into the Word. You need to have something which you have gained, obtained, and even digested from the riches of the Word. For a young man to receive a Ph.D. he has to prepare himself for more than eighteen years. It is not possible to prepare for this merely in a single year. This is why the strong ambition for the eldership among so many bothers me very much. I could not see many who are really faithful to the eldership. They may be strong in ambition, but very poor in the responsibility. If you are faithful to the Lord, you do not need to be anxious and ambitious for the eldership. Spontaneously the eldership will be yours.</p>
<p>The Lord knows I never had the ambition to take the lead in the recovery. Throughout the years I only knew one thing: to work and to labor. You do not need to be ambitious to be a great father. The wise way is simply to produce sons. If you would produce two dozen sons, you will be a great father, even if you do not care to be.</p>
<p>The elders should be produced in this way. The duty fulfilled by you should be much greater and higher than your ambition. Your ambition should be nothing; your duty should be everything. Just as obtaining a Ph.D. is not an easy thing, to be an elder is also not an easy thing. You need to get yourself prepared.</p>
<p>Note 1 of verse 26 in 1 Corinthians 14 says:</p>
<p class=indent1>&ldquo;Has,&rdquo; five times in this verse, is in Greek <em>echo,</em> a word widely used, with many meanings, of which the following three are the main ones: 1) to hold, to possess, to keep (a certain thing); 2) to have (a certain thing) for enjoyment; 3) to have the means or power to do a thing. The first two should be applied to the first three of the five things listed in this verse, and the third to the last two&mdash;a tongue and an interpretation of a tongue. This indicates that when we come to the church meeting, we should have something of the Lord to share with others, whether a psalm to praise the Lord, a teaching (of the teacher) to minister the riches of Christ to edify and nourish others, a revelation (of a prophet, v. 30) to give visions of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose concerning Christ as God&rsquo;s mystery and the church as Christ&rsquo;s mystery, a tongue for a sign to the unbelievers (v. 22) that they may know and accept Christ, or an interpretation to make a tongue concerning Christ and His Body understandable. Before coming to the meeting we should prepare ourselves for the meeting with things like these from the Lord and of the Lord, either through our experience of Him or through our enjoyment of His Word and fellowship with Him in prayer. After coming into the meeting we need not wait, and should not wait, for inspiration; we should exercise our spirit and use our trained mind to function in presenting what we have been prepared with to the Lord for His glory and satisfaction and to the attendants for their benefit&mdash;enlightening, nourishing, and building up.</p>
<p class="indent1">This is just like the feast of tabernacles in ancient times: the children of Israel brought the produce of the good land, which they reaped from their labor on the land, to the feast and offered it to the Lord for His enjoyment and for mutual participation in fellowship with the Lord and with one another. We must labor on Christ, our good land, that we may reap some produce of His riches to bring to the church meeting to offer. Thus, the church meeting will be an exhibition of Christ in His riches and a mutual enjoyment of Christ shared by all the attendants with one another before God and with God for the building up of the saints and the church.</p>
<p class="indent1">According to the stress and emphasis of this Epistle, all five things listed in this verse should be focused on Christ as God&rsquo;s center for our portion and the church as God&rsquo;s goal for our aim. The psalm should be the praise of God for giving Christ as wisdom and power to us for our daily life and church life. The teaching from a teacher and the revelation from a prophet should teach and minister Christ with the church as His Body to people. A tongue and its interpretation should also have Christ with the church as its center and content. Any stress on things other than Christ and the church will confuse and distract the church from the central lane of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, making the church like that in Corinth.</p>
 <p>This is the way to get ourselves prepared that we may have something. To get ourselves prepared with these things in this way requires years to study the Word and to experience Christ according to the divine revelation. Whenever we come to a meeting, just like the Israelites who attended their feasts, we have something on hand. They had some produce of the good land on hand to bring to the feast and offer to God to enjoy with God and with each other before God. This has been our teaching for years. But where is the real practice? We may keep all these teachings in the pages of the ministry on our shelf or at best in our memory. There is little practice of all these riches. This really bothers me.</p>
<p>The elders should bear the blame and responsibility. This is your mistake. I must be honest to the elders. I hope that my word would warn everyone to never have any ambition to be an elder. To be an elder is not an enjoyable position. I only enjoy my labor. My labor day and night is the top enjoyment to me. I have no other enjoyment. Sometimes I am still working after twelve at night. However, if I do not labor in this way, the recovery could not go on. In a sense my laboring nearly every day is my suffering, but to my sensation this is not a suffering to me; it is a joy. I hope that one day I will stand before my Lord at the judgment seat and He will say, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful slave;...enter into the joy of your lord&rdquo; (Matt. 25:23). What I have seen in many of the churches is not like this.</p>
<p>If you elders would be like this, surely the rest of the saints in your locality will follow you. Everyone would contact the Lord diligently. Everyone would spend time in the presence of the Lord. Everyone would get into the Word. Everyone would edify themselves by the enjoyment of the Lord. Everyone would get themselves prepared. Then when they come to the meeting, they will have something. One has a song, one has a teaching, one has a revelation, one has a tongue, and one has an interpretation. Just as we would come to a feast, we would all come with something. When we put all the portions together, that will be a real feast. Our enjoyment becomes a good exhibition of the Lord&rsquo;s riches.</p><h2 class="head1">ELDERS TO LABOR IN THE WORD</h2>
<p>Who among all the elders has been really laboring in the Word? It is not adequate simply to prepare a message for you to share. The church needs home meetings. The church needs a general meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day to take care of the ones who only would come on this day, and the church also needs the preaching of the gospel, the preaching meeting. Likewise, the church needs classes to teach the basic truths to help the saints to get a basic education. The church also needs to feed the saints at the Lord&rsquo;s table; after they come to the table, they still need spiritual food to nourish them. Even at the end of the prayer meeting the saints need some spiritual instruction. All these many needs are very evident.</p>
<p>It is the elders&rsquo; responsibility to prepare all the messages for these meetings. If you are not responsible for these meetings, then who else would be? If you would not be responsible for the meetings, then there is no need for you to be an elder. For this reason I recently told the elders that some among them should be removed from the leadership. For many years you have not done your duty. This word should warn anyone who is ambitious to be an elder. It is hard for anyone to be an elder. Everyone would like to be the President of the United States, but if you would be, you may suffer high blood pressure after three weeks.</p>
<p>You may think it is so easy to be an elder; you think you only need my consent to be an elder, without bearing any responsibility. To be an elder is not merely to make a meeting schedule and give some announcements at the end of the meeting. Even a young boy can do that. You have to prepare the proper word as messages to be given in all the home meetings, in a big general meeting, in the classes teaching the truth, in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, at the prayer meeting, and for the gospel-preaching meeting. The elders must be the ones to do this. Perhaps now many of you would resign, saying that you never realized the eldership was this way. I hope you would not resign. This word should be a help to you for you to realize the responsibility in the eldership in the recovery. It is not as in the denominations. Those in the denominations like to be voted to be an elder, to be a member of the board. When they are elected, they are elders only nominally. They hire people to do things for them. This is not the way in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
 <p>For this reason I felt burdened to call this urgent training. Nearly all the churches in the United States have heard what is happening in Taiwan. After hearing a little and listening to the tapes, you may simply begin to copy. That will not work. You must realize the contents of Book 7 in this series as the basic, unique item. Without this we are not qualified; we have no standing and even no right to copy what is happening in the Far East. Also, I want to make clear to all of you what the home meetings are, what being full-time is, and what the teaching of the truth lessons should be. Every item is a hard thing and not so easy to carry out. Do not copy it lightly. Merely to copy does not work. You will only damage and jeopardize the entire move of the Lord. This is a desperate, life or death situation. It is up to the elders, the helpers, and the co-workers in your locality. Come together to pray and find a way to get one or more persons charged to prepare messages, a living word for each kind of meeting. This would not be a hard thing if you have the heart to do it because we have the groceries in all the messages of the ministry.</p>
<p>However, you cannot simply pull out a message and apply it to a meeting. This does not work. The shoes will not fit the feet. You need to work, to labor. The messages are only the groceries. You cannot put groceries on the dining table for people to eat. You need to do the cooking. I have given you the crucial points of the fourteen Epistles of Paul. In every local church there must be at least one or two brothers to cook these points with some points from other messages as well. Then you may put out a message of two to four pages to use in the home meetings. Before the home meetings, you must train all the saints how to use these pages in a living way, not to read them, explain them, lecture on them, or give a sermon on them, but to speak them. Some of the saints will try to take the opportunity for a long utterance, to pour out all that is on their heart. This will waste the whole meeting and damage it. You have to restrict this, telling them that this message is about three pages, and should only take forty-five minutes. Within these forty-five minutes let all the attendants, perhaps ten or twelve, speak this one message on the three pages. Sometimes you may replace conversing with pray-reading. They may pray-read some crucial points, but it will still be a speaking.</p>
<p>No good minister among us could give a message as good as the one you select. Your selection will produce a living message, much better than a new message that anyone could give. To ask one to give a fresh message will be to depend upon fortune. He may give you a good one, or he may give something else. However, to prepare such a message yourself from all these groceries, will always be good. The rich groceries are here. What you need is the ability to select and cook. This will produce a good meal.</p>
<p>To invite someone to bring a meal to you is to rely upon fortune. It depends upon what he will bring. He may bring barbeque, yet one side may be raw. You yourself must go to the rich groceries, message after message, pick up some good points, and put them together to make a living message, short, brief, yet to the point. You must also train all the attendants to have the ability to use the message. This will be living, this will be enriching, and this will be very attractive. The key is your cooking. This is implied in Paul&rsquo;s word to Timothy, &ldquo;Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching&rdquo; (1 Tim. 5:17).</p>
<p>In 2 Timothy 2:2 Paul says, &ldquo;And the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also.&rdquo; In those ancient times Timothy may have kept a written record of Paul&rsquo;s speaking. To write down what he heard and learned of Paul and to pass it on to others was his cooking. What I am teaching here, I have considered very much, and it is according to the holy Word. I would not speak this if it had no ground in the Word.</p>
 <p>In 2 Timothy 2:15 Paul said, &ldquo;Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth.&rdquo; To cut straight the word of the truth is the cooking. You as an unashamed workman have to cut the word straight as in carpentry. When you pass on the word to others, you should not simply present the word as a whole. You have to cut it, that is, to cook it. If you expect to have a living church in your locality with these prevailing home meetings, it is crucial for you to prepare a living message every week, which will be very applicable, useful, and prevailing. Do not merely pick up a Life-study Message and use the first paragraph on the page. That will not work. You cannot simply buy groceries and place them unprepared on the table. You need the cooking. This must be your labor as elders. Otherwise, you had better all resign and give place to others to let them come in to try. Do not remain there to delay the Lord. See whether others could do it, even if you have to use the young people. I have been considering to bring the young people into this work and let them try. If the first generation could not do it, let the second generation do it. Even my grandchildren could do many things much better than I can. There is such a need to have the prevailing home meetings, but the key, the crucial point, is the preparation of a living message.</p>
<p>In a city in which you have more than twenty homes, it would be hard to find twenty capable speakers to attend all the home meetings to give a living message. It would be impossible to work out. But thank the Lord, because we have so many rich groceries it is easy to cook a meal and distribute this meal to every home. If your church is small and very close to another one, two or three churches could work together to prepare the same living message which will be good for all of you. I would not prepare such messages for all the churches and charge the churches to read the same message. Each of the many churches in this country needs a different kind of spiritual help each Lord&rsquo;s Day. Different churches on different Lord&rsquo;s Days need a different supply. You cannot serve the same kind of meal to everyone in a hospital. To those with stomach trouble you need to serve a certain kind of meal. For those with heart problems you need another kind of meal. You must have different meals to feed different people. Only you as the elders in your locality know what kind of meals your family needs. No one else knows your family&rsquo;s need. I considered this quite much. This must be done by each respective local church. The family cooking must be done by the family, each one respectively. Although in principle all the local churches should be the same, in this aspect all the churches could not be the same.</p>
<p>You must not simply have two weeks of training and immediately begin to practice the home meetings. You must prepare a living, applicable, and very attractive message. You need much prayer, much investigation, and much study in all the messages. The good cooks study their groceries very much. They study which vinegar to use. Different vinegars make different tastes. Cooking is not so easy. You are serving the church as elders. I have no intention to rebuke you, to control you, or to command you. Rather, I am serving you all as an old father serves his family. You should do the same thing to serve the saints.</p>
<p>For a mother to serve the family by cooking is not an easy thing. My wife serves me every day. She has to decide every day what she should serve, what will be nutritious and easy to digest. The elders must pick up this responsibility. Otherwise, you should not expect to have a living church in your locality; it would be impossible. First Timothy 3:1 says, &ldquo;If anyone aspires to oversight, he desires a good work.&rdquo; I encourage you all to aspire, but I condemn any kind of ambition without the sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>You must prepare a good message for the general meeting. To merely charge one person to do it would not be adequate. It is too heavy for one to bear. The best way is for all the elders, the helpers, and the co-workers to work together to prepare a living message and charge a particular one to deliver this message in a living way. The way to deliver or present the message should be discussed and fellowshipped among those who prepare it. Be assured you will have a good message. This will edify you as the elders, the helpers, and the co-workers.</p>
<p>Do not say that you could only do what has been done in the past. For twenty years you may have done things in the same way. However, in today&rsquo;s world everything is improving. Terminate the old way and take a new way. We need to improve. Do something in a fresh way, in the newness of life. Life grows every day, so newness belongs to life. If we remain in one way, this indicates we are not in life. If we are in life, we are being renewed every day.</p>
<p>You need to prepare a message for the end of the Lord&rsquo;s table to nourish the attendants. They will not receive much if they only take the bread, drink the wine, and have some spiritual prayers. You need to feed them something solid with a living message. Simply take half an hour and leave some time for them to share. Without such a solid message there will only be the sharing of the saints. They will tire of doing this week after week. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day at the end of the table we need something solid to feed the attendants. This will attract them to come back. It is the same with the prayer meeting. This is why the prayer meeting is reducing in size. When we met in Elden Hall, from ninety to one hundred percent of the saints were in the prayer meeting. Now less than one fourth attend many of the church prayer meetings. I have attended some meetings and counted the number. If out of two hundred saints forty would be in the prayer meeting, some would be excited. This is the poor situation. You should not blame them for not coming. Their coming is somewhat in vain. They come simply to hear some repeated prayers. Every week they nearly pray the same thing. Although the words may be different, in principle the prayers are always the same. Who would want to attend this meeting?</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DESPERATE ABOUT THE CURRENT SITUATION</h2>
<p>For years the situation has remained the same, but what elders would consider it and spend some time to be desperate, to fellowship, to fast, to pray, and to have a thorough fellowship with all the attendants of the church? Let us fellowship about the prayer meeting, whether we should have it or not. If we should, then let us all come. If we should not have it, dig it out and throw it away. Be serious. We should hate to see this going on, all the time the same, with no change, while no one is caring for the situation. The elders must certainly do a lot. In the meeting one may stand up to speak five times, speaking vanity. This is the right time for you to &ldquo;control,&rdquo; but you would not do it. At the wrong time you control the wrong things, yet at the right time you do not control the right things. You are afraid to offend people. You would like for all the saints to feel good about you, so that you could be the elder. If I am wrong, please forgive me, but how else could you explain the situation? When one stands up speaking in a poor way, the elders would allow this poor situation to go on for fifteen minutes or more. I have seen this, and it greatly bothered me. After such a meeting I walked home, hanging my head. Is this the church meeting? Where are the elders? Where is the Spirit and where are the riches of Christ? There are such incidents that I could speak of.</p>
<p>Have a time to get together, or even separately to reconsider your way. You may sow much, but you reap little. Not much blessing can be seen in the meetings in your church. There must be a reason. The reason is altogether wrapped up with the elders. I do not blame the saints; I blame all you elders. You must bear the burden. You must be held responsible for the situation. If you would be so faithful to what I have fellowshipped with you in these few messages, a big increase will come in, and many backsliders will be brought back. Many who have not come to the meetings for a long time will show up. Even the prayer meeting will be full of people.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TRUTH LESSONS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 2:4; 3:15; 2 Tim. 2:2, 15</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BEING IN ONE ACCORD WITH NO OPINIONS</h2>
<p>The victories we have enjoyed in the past were one hundred percent due to the one accord. I say this as an encouragement to all of us. We all have to be in one accord with no opinions. To carry on the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we do not need to have any opinion. We should have the confidence in the leadership. You may be a little smarter than the ones who are taking the lead or who made the decision. Yet if you express your opinion, that will only delay the time. Your way may take twenty-five minutes, while the way decided upon may take thirty-five minutes. This ten minute difference is not worth your opinion. By discussing your opinion, what we want to do may take half an hour or even two hours longer. It may even create dissension or division. This is what we are suffering from today. If the leadership in the recovery proposes to build an idol temple, I will take the lead to oppose it. I believe that we realize that the leading in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is absolutely according to the entire revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Based upon the fellowship in Book 7 in this series of the Elders&rsquo; Training, we have a clear view, a definite vision, a definite leadership, and a definite way for us to go on.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREPARING MESSAGES FOR THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We saw in the previous chapter that materials should be prepared for all the different meetings of the church. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, He has given us many messages and has opened up the entire New Testament to us. I do not mean that He has opened up the New Testament to us in the fullest way. I still believe that the Lord will show us more and more in the future, but thank Him that He has really opened up His word in the New Testament to us. Many publications are here for you to labor on. It is easy for you to pick up the &ldquo;groceries&rdquo; which you feel fit your present need. You can select some groceries to cook a proper meal for your church at any time according to the condition or situation of the church in your locality. If you would do this and if you know how to do it, you will surely have a success.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Home Meetings</h2>
<p>I am quite concerned for our meetings, especially for the home meetings. I do not have a bit of confidence in someone&rsquo;s speaking in each of the home meetings. Just for one gathering of every local church, the speaking has already been a hard problem. For your church to take care of one gathering with a proper message given has been and still is a problem. If you could not handle the speaking for one group so well, how will you be able to handle the speaking for many groups? This is why I do not have the confidence in this practice. I do have the confidence, however, in your laboring in the Word to learn how to prepare the messages, using all the groceries in our present, existing publications. If you are willing to do this and learn how to do this, you will enjoy a success.</p>
<p>For the small gatherings it is better to prepare some living messages consecutively, week after week. These messages should be according to the present need of your local church. You need to consider what the best word would be to take care of the present need in your locality. Also, the ones who are going to take care of the home meetings should be trained and should learn how to be flexible. We expect that all the home meetings would do their best to bring their neighbors, relatives, friends, colleagues, and schoolmates. The home meetings should be very flexible since we should always expect to have some new ones there and some unbelievers. Even if you have something printed for the whole meeting to read, to speak, you must be flexible to take care of the new ones and the unbelievers. This all depends upon the elders training the saints in these matters. We need to put out a message every week for one home meeting. You could use the crucial points we pointed out from Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles (see Book 6 in this series on the Elders&rsquo; Training). But you still need to work on these points, to cook them, and to shorten them.</p>
<p>You have to train the saints and let them know that there is no need or requirement that in every meeting they must finish the printed matter. Sometimes the situation does not allow them to finish it. You do not need to be that legal. You do not need to rescue that message. You have to rescue the meeting, rescue the need. Suppose that one evening in the home gathering over fifteen new ones come. You have to be flexible enough to forget about the message. Just take care of the fifteen new ones to give them a good message of the gospel. Immediately turn that meeting into a gospel-preaching meeting. This is why the saints need to be trained in these matters. All the attendants of the church in that home meeting have to be on the alert to turn that meeting into a gospel preaching meeting in order to take care of the fifteen new ones. We should not be legal. The message that was prepared can be postponed for next week&rsquo;s home meeting.</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Table</h2>
<p>For the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting it would be good to select some good messages on life and on the life supply according to your study and memory. I call these nourishing messages to bring in a certain amount of nourishment to all the dear saints who come to remember the Lord. After the remembrance rendered to the Lord, a half an hour can be spared in the meeting to speak that short, nourishing message. I believe that everyone will receive the nourishment. I have gone to some Lord&rsquo;s table meetings where this was practiced, and I must testify that I received much nourishment. Therefore, I have the assurance that this can nourish people. I did not speak anything. I sat there and listened to the speaking of those two or three pages and I got fully nourished. I have the assurance that no one who speaks something could render such a good, brief, crucial, and important word to the saints. This message is composed of selected excerpts from our publications. This is the line of nourishment for the Lord&rsquo;s table.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Prayer Meeting</h2>
<p>Then you should also select some spiritual messages from our publications on another line&mdash;the spiritual principles of the Lord&rsquo;s service. At the end of each prayer meeting take half an hour to speak a short article on the spiritual principles of the Lord&rsquo;s service. Do not despise small things. For the long run this will be very profitable. The saints will receive enlightenment through the speaking of some messages on the spiritual principles of the Lord&rsquo;s service every week. Those who attend the Lord&rsquo;s table will also receive some nourishing messages week by week throughout the year.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Feeding the Saints Patiently and Regularly</h2>
<p>To raise up children, you cannot feed them with all the food they need for twenty years. You have to feed them a little bit at a time, meal after meal, day after day. It takes a long time to raise up a child. Therefore, the elders should learn this way with patience. Do not expect to get things done once for all or overnight. We are not the Creator. The Creator can say, &ldquo;Let there be light,&rdquo; but we cannot do that. For us it takes time, especially in the matter of building up the church, which is altogether a matter in life. We need to take time to feed the saints with these messages in a proper way and to do it patiently and regularly year after year, always with some fresh prayer, seeking the Lord&rsquo;s leading. The principles are right and the application may be fresh if you have much prayer. The Lord will lead you to have a fresh way to apply all these principles, and what you do will be quite living. This is what the elders should do. It is not hard because you have a very rich store of groceries.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Writing the Ministry Office for Permission</h2>
<p>We have fellowshipped that for the prayer meeting, the home meeting, and the Lord&rsquo;s table, we need to cook a living message. This can be done by taking excerpts from different books and messages of our publications to make one short message. Everyone who wants to use the materials from Living Stream Ministry in such a way should write to the ministry office for permission. Your application should make it clear that you want to use the material for the purpose of the church meetings. The office will then give you a written answer with directions on how to give the proper credit for the material.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Laboring in the Word</h2>
<p>The elders need to labor in the Word. I cannot eat for you, and there is no shortcut way to get the spiritual food into your being. The elders need to come together with some helpers and some full-timers to get into all the publications and prepare material for the meetings. If you are a teacher, you must spend much time to prepare your own materials. Then you can teach the students in the most effective way because you first got into the material. You must labor. Do not try to save any time in your labor. If you save one minute, you lose one percent. Saving ten minutes is to lose ten percent. The saving of time in your labor is actually a real loss. I spent hours and hours writing the notes for the Recovery Version. I spent approximately one week composing note 6<sup>6</sup> in 1 John 1 concerning the word truth. You cannot put a big piece of salmon on the table for people to eat without cooking it. I digested what Kittel had to say concerning the word truth and then I composed the note on truth with eight items. To take care of the church the elders need to labor in the Word. There is no shortcut way or no convenience you can take. The more you work on something, the better product you get.</p>
<p>You need to get into all the messages and digest all the portions. Out of your digestion you can make a message. This is the best and most prevailing way. Use your time and do your best to labor. You may not have that much time, but use what time you have, trying your best to do something. It is much more prevailing if you digest portions of the written ministry and then put these excerpts together to make a message.</p>
<p>When I say digest, this does not mean that you have to change. Do not recompose. Just put the excerpts together. When I say for you to digest, that means that you really get into the real meaning of that portion. Then you know which portions to choose. I do not mean to digest and recompose. I do not agree with that. I do not have the confidence that you can do something better. I believe that after your recomposing, all the good flavor in my writings will be gone. Note 26<sup>1</sup> in 1 Corinthians 14 tastes so sweet; the color is beautiful and the material is rich. You could not get anything to compare with that, so please do not recompose my writings.</p><h2 class="head1">TEACHING THE SAINTS TO KNOW<br />
THE BASIC TRUTHS IN AN EDUCATIONAL WAY</h2>
<p>At this point, we want to focus our attention on the truth lessons. In 1 Timothy 2:4 Paul tells us that God desires everyone who has been saved to be brought not just to a partial knowledge but to a full knowledge of the truth. Basically speaking in this century, regardless of what country a person lives in, he must have a basic education. The United States practices compulsory education until a person is sixteen years old, and everyone is encouraged to at least have a high school education. Without this education as a base, it would be hard for a person to do anything with his human life. For so many years we missed the way to teach the truths in a lesson way, in a way of education, to let the saints have a basic knowledge of God&rsquo;s revelation. Every person should have a basic knowledge of human education, so he needs to pass through elementary, junior high, high school, and then college.</p>
<p>Throughout the past years what we have been practicing was like the giving of lectures by experts and specialists. We had a college with no classrooms, no classes, no teachers, and no textbook. We would always invite two or three specialists to give lectures. Just consider a university with five thousand students without classrooms, without professors, and without a textbook, only having famous specialists come in to give lectures. Every lecture given is marvelous and wonderful. But after four years what will the students receive? All they will receive is some terms and some principles. They will not have received the proper, basic education. This has been exactly what we have been doing in the past years. Many messages were like lectures, and every church expected the top expert to come to give the lecture.</p>
<p>My present burden is not to go to any place to give lectures. I would rather go somewhere to set up classes. To have a school to educate the young people, we need classes, we need grades, we need lessons, and we need a textbook. If I had not attended any classes in mathematics, and I had just learned from my parents or friends, I may have some fragments of the knowledge of mathematics, but I would not be able to teach others. Whoever composes a textbook for mathematics considers the entire realm of mathematics and picks up some crucial points with some crucial lines. When children study a textbook on mathematics, they should have a clear view of the matter of addition. But we have not done this. Our practice has been to give messages or lectures on topics such as sanctification and redemption.</p>
<p>I know some saints who have been in the church life and under the church&rsquo;s speaking for over thirty-seven years. If they were asked, however, to give a clear word concerning the Lord&rsquo;s redemption or concerning sanctification to a group of newly saved believers, they could not do it. Their feeling is that only I and the co-workers trained by me for years can do such a thing. We heard that Christ is our Person and we also heard something concerning the essential Trinity, the economical Trinity, and God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. But many of the saints cannot tell us what God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is. The saints have heard many messages concerning Christ&rsquo;s death, but who can speak something concerning the seven aspects of Christ&rsquo;s death? Very few can give a proper message on justification in a good sequence and in a full way. It is even harder for many of the saints to speak the deeper truths concerning God&rsquo;s economy, God&rsquo;s dispensation, and God&rsquo;s dispensing. Many messages have been published concerning the divine Trinity, but how many of us can present a full word concerning the divine Trinity according to what we have heard in the past years? This is due to the fact that we had no proper way to acquire a spiritual education. We did not adopt the educational way by classes with a textbook.</p>
<p>The popular educational system in the world today is for a person to pass through elementary school, junior high school, high school, and then college. If we are going to educate the saints, we must take this system. The good point of this educational system is that it gives people the popular, the common, and the normal basic knowledge. I have come to the conclusion that we must practice this educational system in the spiritual lessons. This is why I have been burdened to publish <em>Truth Lessons.</em> The one hundred ninety-two lessons of this series are meant to be covered in four years&mdash;forty-eight lessons per year. With these truth lessons my burden is to upgrade the standard of Christians&rsquo; understanding of the truth.</p>
<p>Many Christians only have a very limited knowledge of the truth. They know that we were once sinners destined to go to the lake of fire. But God loved us and gave His Son for us. His Son came to die on the cross for our sins. If we believe in Him, we will be forgiven of our sins and we will be saved. Then we need to live a good life and when we die we will go to heaven. This is the extent of the truth which many Christians have. But now we will have a series of truth lessons that will cover all the crucial points of the entire Bible.</p>
<p>In the first two volumes there are lessons which give us a key view of the entire Old Testament. If you read or study all these lessons, you can have a general view concerning the Old Testament. The view given in these truth lessons is not in the way of today&rsquo;s seminaries. My burden is not to give people lessons concerning the history, the geography, or the literature of the Old Testament. I care to give people the spiritual significance. The lessons on Adam, Abel, Enosh, and Enoch unveil the spiritual significance seen in these Old Testament saints. Through two lessons we are given a key view of the Old Testament in the entire book of Genesis from Adam to Noah (Lesson Seven) and from Abraham to Joseph (Lesson Eight). After studying these two lessons, you have a clear view of the first book of the Old Testament and all the great men in the book of Genesis are covered. By this fellowship you can realize the purpose of the truth lessons.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO TEACH THE SAINTS BY THE TRUTH LESSONS</h2>
<p>We also need to fellowship how to teach the saints by the truth lessons. We must use the Lord&rsquo;s Day or what is popularly called Sunday since this day is generally a holiday throughout the earth. Most people do not have to work on Sunday, so we must utilize this day to teach the truths to the saints. We must take this way to educate the saints. I would propose that every church spend half of every Lord&rsquo;s Day on the matter of teaching the truth. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning we may have a general meeting to take care of the &ldquo;Sunday goers&rdquo; and general attendants. At the same time and on the same day, if possible in the same building, you must set up classes to teach the truth. The best way is to ask the saints to register for the level they would like to be in based upon their discernment. When they come to the meeting the next week, they should go to the level they have signed up for. If they have some new ones with them, they could bring them to the general meeting, and then they themselves could go to the particular class for which they have registered.</p>
<p>In the same building you could have four classes to teach the truth and a general meeting. If there is a need, you could set up a gospel preaching meeting. Use the entire morning of the Lord&rsquo;s Day to teach the saints the truth. The general meeting also comprises a part of the teaching of the truth in a kind of preaching way. The saints who are the interested seekers of the truth and who are not merely the Sunday goers have to get themselves registered into different levels of the truth lessons. The leading ones should set up classes and arrange to have some teachers for these classes. This is the best way to promote the function of the saints.</p>
<p>In a certain locality there may only be fifty saints. But they could be divided into two or three classes for the truth lessons. Each class needs one teacher with a helper. You may have thirty or more in one class, and the teaching of the lesson should only occupy fifty to sixty minutes. After the teaching of the lesson, the class should be divided into small groups of no more than ten. The less in the small group the better. Two saints are needed to take care of each group. They need to sit down with the members of the group to discuss the lesson which they have all covered. There is no need for a detailed discussion, but these two saints should check with the ones in the group to find out what they understood and to give them time to ask some questions. They need to help the ones in the group to become more impressed with all the points of the lesson.</p>
<p>One truth lesson covers many points, so there is no time to develop a point. One particular teacher of a truth class spent a lot of time in one lesson discussing Cain. After he finished this discussion, much of the time was gone. The Life-study messages are full of the expounding and development of particular points. When we came to the matter of the pillar in Genesis, we spent a number of messages to develop this point. However, the truth lessons are another matter. Every lesson is really a message.</p>
<p>We should teach the students in the class by first asking them to open up their copy of the truth lessons and read. Every member of the class can read a phrase or a sentence of the text in a spontaneous and living way. They should not read the lesson in the same way that they would read a newspaper. While they read the teacher should stress the main points to impress them with the contents of that lesson. You do not need to explain, expound, or develop. If someone asks you who Cain is, it is sufficient to tell them that he was the first son of Adam. Do not go further. If someone would continue to ask you something else, you may need to say, &ldquo;That is not in the lesson.&rdquo; The lesson is quite limited to impress us with all the major points. In the teaching of the truth lessons there is no chance for the one who teaches to show how much he knows. He is only charged to speak this message as a lesson with all the people in the class. I believe that in approximately fifty minutes a teacher can do a good job to impress the ones in his class with the truth of the lesson.</p>
<p>The questions at the end of each truth lesson are for discussion after the lesson is given. They are not for homework. The students need to be impressed with the points covered in that one lesson. Only go as far as the text of the truth lessons with the accompanying questions to impress the saints with the main points. When a math teacher in elementary school is teaching students addition, he does not go beyond his lesson to get into something deeper or higher. Otherwise, he breaks the teaching principle. If the first lesson only requires the students to add the first four numbers, the teacher should just impress them with that much. This is the best way of teaching. Do not talk about anything other than what the lesson teaches. Do not add anything that would cause them to forget what they should be impressed with. Just impress them with the very things that the lesson teaches. Then you are a good teacher.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR NEED OF THE TRUTH LESSONS</h2>
<p>Lesson one is concerning the Bible. If I were to ask you when the books of the Bible were written and when these books were recognized as part of the Scripture, probably not many would be able to tell me. You may treasure this book, yet many thoughtful people would ask you to tell them how this book was written. You believe in the Bible, study it, preach it, and teach it, yet you do not know how it was written. This is the purpose of having the truth lessons. The first lesson is to impress the students with the proper, common, necessary knowledge concerning the Bible&rsquo;s coming into existence.</p>
<p>After the first volume was published, all the saints in Taipei wanted to take the first level. Because they do not know many of the things in the first level, they want to learn from the beginning. In Taipei all the saints began the truth lessons from the first grade. Some of them have been in the church life for over thirty-seven years, but they all attended level one, volume one with some who had just been in the church life for three days. The ones who had been recently saved did not know how the Bible was produced, and the ones who had been with us for over thirty-seven years and many of the leading ones did not know how the Bible was produced either. This shows us the need of the truth lessons.</p>
<p>If anyone continually attends these classes for four years, he will have a full and clear sketch, a full view, concerning the Bible, concerning God, concerning Christ, concerning the Spirit, concerning our salvation, and concerning the church. This will provide a basic education. Then when the saints listen to the &ldquo;lectures by the experts,&rdquo; the big speakers, they will understand more because they have the basic vocabulary, the basic knowledge, of all the basic points concerning the divine, spiritual, and holy things.</p>
<p>The truth lessons give people the basic knowledge, and may be likened to the textbooks in a school. The messages for the small groups, the Lord&rsquo;s table, and the prayer meeting may be likened to newspapers or magazines for people&rsquo;s study and reading. If you had not studied in school, it would be hard to read a newspaper or magazine.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT SETTING UP A SEMINARY<br />
BUT PASSING ON THE TRUTHS TO THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>I do not feel burdened to charge the saints to go home and study beyond what is in the truth lessons, but all the elders should promote the reading of the Recovery Version, the &ldquo;gold bar,&rdquo; in the homes plus all the Life-studies and other publications by the Living Stream Ministry. These will be their library books. Besides attending the meetings to learn the truth, they should read these spiritual publications every day.</p>
<p>We need to realize that actually we are not a school and we do not have graduation. Our intention is solely to pass on the truths to the saints. We should not give the saints any kind of written exams on the truth lessons. Our church school does not have terms or vacations. Most of the saints have to take care of their occupations and families in addition to the church meetings. Just to teach them the truth lessons is good enough. Let them pick up what they can. After four years with four levels of lessons, everybody will be much better. To set up a seminary is too much. We are not burdened to set up any school. Do not go that far. We do not want to set up a real church school to have graduates. To have training meetings to train the saints is okay, but to set up a seminary is wrong. That is going too far. To have the trainings will not cause any opinions or trouble to the churches. But to set up a seminary will cause problems. You would have to decide something such as who the board members would be. Many troubles would then come into the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT USING THE TRUTH LESSONS<br />
FOR THE CAMPUS WORK</h2>
<p>Do not use the truth lessons for the campus work to teach a Bible study. Many people there have not been brought into salvation or into the church life. The truth lessons are only useful for people in the church life. We train them as our students. No one would open a textbook on the street and begin to teach the people there. The textbooks are used only for your enrolled students. You would not go anywhere to teach people with lesson books. We have many messages and good material for you to go to the campus and use.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE HELP FROM THE MINISTRY<br />
TO GO ON BY THE SAME WAY</h2>
<p>I am not narrow and I do not like to dictate, but by His mercy and grace I have gone through the proper process to get into the truth. I am so grateful that the Lord brought me into contact with Brother Nee. I could never forget him and I am still grateful to him. He was surely the unique person, according to my observation, from whom I could get the unique help. By His mercy I did get the help. After that I spent more time to investigate and dig into the holy Word with the help of many reference books. When I came to the United States, I had the boldness and the assurance to pass on what I had received to you. I am not narrow. I do not like to dictate or control, yet I love you all. I do not like to see you waste your time. This is why it seems I am so narrow. I would just ask you to study all the publications that come from the Living Stream Ministry. You may get some help elsewhere, but with the help there may be some poison. I like to see you save your time to concentrate your entire being on the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. You will get the best help within the shortest time, and be assured you will never be poisoned. This is much purified.</p>
<p>What I expect is that all the churches around the globe will take the help from this ministry to go on by the same way that we may have the morale, the impact, to fight the strong battle for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I have the full assurance that this is what the Lord needs in this age to bring Him back. This is why I am so concerned to see anything that is a little different come into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. That will be a real damage. I do not like to hear others uplifting me, but I want to see you get the real help and not be distracted by anything.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY OF LIFE AND THE WAY<br />
TO OPEN UP THE HOLY WORD</h2>
<p>You can assuredly receive two things from the ministry&mdash; the ministry of life and the way to open up the holy Word. This ministry does not lead anyone into the ministry itself. This ministry actually leads and ushers the reader into the real divine revelation of the holy Word. It is the best opener of the holy Bible. Any page of this ministry will lead you into a certain verse, chapter, or book of the Bible. I have the assurance that this ministry would never lead anyone astray. It will always help people into the right way of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy according to His entire revelation. We surely have to thank the Lord for what He has been doing and is still going to do among us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TRUTH LESSONS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 7:6; 2 Cor. 3:6</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE STAGES OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>Since October of 1984 the Lord has started a new way among us for the carrying out of His recovery. The recovery has been on the earth for over sixty years. In the first twenty years or more we have gone through at least two or three stages, so our practice has changed at least two or three times. In Brother Nee&rsquo;s writings, especially <em>The Normal Christian Church Life,</em>there are indications that the practice in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery did change. By 1937 Brother Nee had seen the principle or line of Antioch. Based upon this he gave the messages contained in <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em>He said that up to that time the practice among us was only according to one way. He admitted that before that time he had not seen the line of Antioch. Until then most of the co-workers stayed in one place, not going out to spread the gospel to establish the churches. In those messages he charged us all not to stay permanently in one place, but to go out from one city to another. He called this the line of Antioch. Since 1937 there was a change in the practice of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. From 1937 to 1942 we practiced the line of Antioch.</p>
<p>In 1942 there was a turmoil in Shanghai. This was a real hardship to Brother Nee, and he spontaneously stopped his ministry until 1948. In those six years he did not minister as usual; he only did a small amount in the interior of China during the war time. While Brother Nee was there in the interior caring for his pharmaceutical factory, he gave the messages contained in <em>The Orthodoxy of the Church.</em> That was all that he ministered. Besides this he occasionally gave time to some of the seekers to fellowship with him.</p>
<p>After the war he came back to Shanghai, and I also was invited to stay there. We began to come together, even though he would not come to the meetings. We had much time together to talk about the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. He began to let me know privately that he saw something further, which he called the line of Jerusalem. Due to the revival in Shanghai and other cities, Brother Nee was brought back to his ministry. At that time he gave us at least one message on the line of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Since 1948 we practiced very much according to the second line, the line of Jerusalem, mainly to have the co-workers stay in the major cities to help the building up of the local churches as strong testimonies there. We practiced this way for quite a number of years. This practice was even brought over to Taiwan and somewhat to the United States. By this you could see that in the past years we practiced the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in three stages, the initial stage, the second stage of the Antioch line, and the third stage of the Jerusalem line until 1984.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT SITUATION OF OLDNESS</h2>
<p>In the last years, especially from 1980, I began to realize that we have somewhat become dull, without much sense of the spiritual situation and condition among us. For years we simply went according to what we had seen through Brother Nee. We had no intention to question whether we should still continue in that way or not. We did not realize how old and how cold we were and how much we were retained in our old practice. This practice was new in 1948 but since 1980 has become no longer new. With the practice according to the vision we had received through Brother Nee concerning the line of Jerusalem, we brought the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to this country in 1962. In the first ten years the recovery was new and living. It was not as cold and old as it has been in the last seven or eight years.</p>
<p>This cold and old situation and condition was more serious in Taiwan than in the United States. Taiwan&rsquo;s situation in 1984 was the primary factor that caused me to reconsider our way. In the five years since 1980, whenever the leading ones came to this country to meet with me, I always charged them seriously and thoroughly, even warning them, that the work there could not go on in this way. However, within these five years of charging, warning, and exhorting, there was very little change or advancement.</p>
<p>During those years I had to spend about ninety days to prepare for the summer training and another ninety days to prepare for the winter training, mainly in the writing of the notes. Even while I was so busy, I was considering Taiwan very much because it is the source of the spreading of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery outside of mainland China. Because there was a new start there in 1949, I considered that as a great part of the produce of my ministry. Therefore, I was very much concerned for the situation. I realized that if Taiwan would be like that, they would be a spring full of sulfur. The churches elsewhere would not be able to receive the current from Taiwan without the taste of sulfur.</p>
<p>In order to purify the current of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery around the globe, I had to purify that spring as the source. I made this decision after a long period of consideration. During those five years while I was advising and exhorting the leading ones there to improve the work, I was already considering to go back to do something. I was not able to be spared, however, in order that I could finish the Life-study of the New Testament. After the last word of the notes on the New Testament was written, I felt that this was the time. I had to go back to Taiwan. At the end of September of 1984 I finished the writing, and in October I went back. I indicated that I would stay a longer time there and that I probably would go back quite often.</p>
<p>Something stirred up within my spirit telling me that I had to revolutionize the church life, not leaving a bit of the old practice. The entire practice had to be overturned. It was too old. Perhaps thirty years ago it was good. This can be compared to our means of transportation. In 1947 I flew from Shanghai to Hong Kong on a DC-4, which was called the King in the Air. It seemed so pleasant and comfortable. Again in 1958 I flew from Taiwan to San Francisco on a DC-4. It was marvelous to us that we could cross the entire Pacific and arrive at San Francisco within twenty-four hours. However, today we may travel to Taiwan in twelve hours. It is much more comfortable; I could even walk and exercise on that 747. What an improvement! No one can change the earth created by God, but surely we can improve the transportation around it. Throughout the centuries there have been many improvements in transportation. In previous centuries travel by wagon from the east coast to the west coast may have taken about one hundred days. But today to fly from the west coast to New York takes a little over five hours. This is due to the changes, the improvements in the methods of travel.</p>
<p>Why in working for the Lord would we remain in the oldness? This is the way of the Catholic Church; the ordinances of the Catholic Church have existed for over fourteen centuries since the establishment of the papal system. There has hardly been any change. It is somewhat the same with us. By remaining in the old way we surely have suffered. We suffered firstly in the growth of life. We suffered as well in the matter of the truth, and we suffered the most in the loss of the increase. In the last five years we have not had much increase. It is the same in all the churches. Only a few places are better. We generally remained the same. This is a great loss. However, within the last ten years other groups have risen up in the United States. In the Far East in at least three or more places some Christian groups increased from one thousand to a hundred thousand. In 1958, the same year the church in Taipei began to drop the small group meetings, a church in Seoul, Korea started. It started simply with the pastor, his wife, and two other couples. Now they claim to have a few hundred thousand members in that one city. When I began to study their situation in October of 1984, they claimed they had 300,000. Today they claim they have more. Another little group in Singapore was started by a student who returned from the United States within the last ten years. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day they have several sessions in one rented auditorium. Quite a few thousand rotate to meet there, session after session.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A CHANGE IN PRACTICE</h2>
<p>Such a study confirmed very much to me that there must be a change among us. Otherwise, we would be foolish. We may not take a mule wagon, yet we still may use the DC-4 of about forty years ago. Why would we not change our &ldquo;airplane&rdquo;? Jump out of the oldness and enter into the 747! We cannot change the truth, just as we cannot change the globe. But why would we not change the transportation? What is wrong with changing the transportation? This is not to change the truth. This is not to change the recovery. This is not to change God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This is not to change the great mystery, Christ and the church. But surely we have to change our cold and old situation.</p>
<p>The Chinese young people have good parents who have brought to them ethics and morality with a good education. The young generation has been brought up in this good way. But today in Taiwan all those who do business, establish factories, and produce and export articles do not follow their fathers&rsquo; way. They pick up the American way to compete with the Koreans, with Hong Kong, and even with Japan. Taiwan has now had a great success and has become rich. Financially speaking, in the entire Far East Taiwan ranks second only to Japan. This is due to their improvement in the way of doing things, from the old way to an absolutely new way. They do everything in a new, scientific way, according to the modern standard.</p>
<p>I asked the young trainees why the worldlings would be so wise to change their way in doing things, but we should be so foolish. They all are taking the 747, but we still prefer the old mule wagon. A mule wagon could only travel thirty miles a day. At least three or four groups of Christians around us, some even in Taipei, have made great improvements. They all have attained to a good number. You may say that we do not care for numbers&mdash;we only care for life. However, without quantity could you have quality? Quality comes from quantity. How much life could you have with such a small number?</p>
<p>Twenty years ago the membership in Taipei was over twenty-two thousand. Those who took care of the name cards can testify to this. However, after more than twenty years, the membership had gone down to eleven thousand. The city had nearly doubled in population, but our membership had gone down fifty percent. It is foolish to remain there without any change. For this reason I told the young people to not take the old way. Even now you must respect the old generation in life and in truth. But in the way to practice the church life, to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, to preach the gospel, and to teach the truth, you have to repudiate the old way to the uttermost. We must no longer use the mule wagon, or even the old style of airplane. We must jump into the 747.</p>
<p>In the moral sense, you must respect your father and highly regard him, but in doing business, in teaching classes, in doing everything, even in packing a little package, you must not take his old way. You must go the new way; otherwise, you will lose the market and lose your job. Today all around the earth people are competing. Do not think that in the field of Christian work there is no competition. There is a great amount of competition. Not only in this country but even the more in the Far East, people take my ministry and use it for their own way. Our Gospel Bookroom in Taipei sells books to outsiders by the bundles. They know that what we have as far as the truth is concerned is the best. In Taiwan the others use these materials, but many in the church life just put them on the shelf and are indifferent towards these treasures. They remain in the old, routine way to have the meetings, to take care of the church, to do the work, to preach the gospel, and to preach the truth. Everything is done in a routine way.</p>
<p>If you do things merely according to a routine, even in the most scientific way, there will be no success. In every corporation or big bank, the employees in the office may do things according to routines, but the managers have to &ldquo;fast.&rdquo; Every founder, manager, or top executive &ldquo;fasts.&rdquo; They may not care for breakfast but utilize breakfast to get more business. They eat while they get business, but may not remember what they have eaten. They have no heart to eat. This is their fast. They have no heart to sleep; they work until midnight. A Japanese motorcycle corporation established a large office in Los Angeles and hired many Americans as clerks, who worked at their desk according to a routine, eight hours a day, five days a week. But in the back rooms the Japanese work until midnight. They do not know what Sunday is. They do not know what the weekend is. Their success rests in that, not in the American clerks.</p>
<p>I do not like to see that you co-workers and elders do a routine work, caring for the church in a routine way. Then the church would be reduced to nothing. If all the Japanese managers worked like the clerks in the front office, their corporation would be closed. In America professors in the top universities have a slogan&mdash;&ldquo;publish or perish.&rdquo; The top professors do not have a good stomach. They cannot sleep or eat well. They have to write something and get it published. Without publishing they perish. I encourage all the young ones to pick up such a way.</p>
<p>Especially with the Chinese, to have a change is extremely difficult. When western civilization and culture went to the Far East centuries ago, the Japanese received it. Then Japan became an important power, while China remained in the oldness to be robbed by the major powers. They all went to China to exercise their imperialism, but none of the major powers could carry out their imperialism in Japan. The Japanese picked up the new, scientific, modern, and up-to-date western culture. They were able to compete with the western powers. They changed, but China remained old. To have a change may offend the old generation. I am going to carry out a change according to the Lord&rsquo;s charge. This way is not for myself or not according to my feeling. It is for the Lord&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>A quarter century ago the church in Taipei had twenty-two thousand members. However, the membership went down. There was not much spreading or evangelizing on that island, even though the church there owns properties and has many halls. Because of the number of saints and the flourishing economy, the church also has much money. Recently, one hall had the feeling to spread and set up another hall in a nearby section of the city. Those who were there reported that they needed a large van for transportation. In one meeting without going home to consider, the saints gave five thousand dollars. For the thirty-seven and a half acres of land in Lin-Ko we had to pay eight hundred and fifty thousand American dollars. This amount was raised in almost one day from the halls of the church in Taipei.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 1985 one hundred and thirty young ones have come into full-time service. I visited their training occasionally to give some foundational matters and some principles. In just over two months sixteen teams with six hundred people were sent out for the gospel. The center, the nucleus, of that move was the one hundred and thirty young ones. Within three weeks they baptized one thousand nine hundred and seventy-five people. This came out from the absence of the old tradition. The sixteen teams went out in an absolutely new way.</p>
<p>I still have the burden to bring the Lord&rsquo;s recovery out of the old practice and into the new. This is why I called these urgent trainings. If I would not do this, all the churches in the West would only copy what Taiwan is doing. That would not work. You would merely copy the things of the new way, yet you would not take the new way. This is what the Lord likened to putting the new wine into the old wineskin (Matt. 9:17). The new wine will ferment and burst the old wineskin. If you do not have a change in the way of practice in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, yet you would imitate the points, this will burst your church life. It does not work. I am a little concerned. If you will not change, I would rather propose to you to not pick up any new points. Just go back to your locality and manage your church in the old way. Let me go to Taiwan to do something new in the new way. You are still safe. You will not increase much. You will not improve much, but you will still be quite safe. You will have no trouble. However, if you take the new way without a real change, you will make trouble for yourself.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>The new way is first to build the church in, through, and based upon the home meetings, having the church life in the home meetings. We do not care that much for having the church life in the big meetings. We do not believe that it is possible to do so. According to our experience and observation, the proper, adequate, one hundred percent church life could only be possible in the home meetings.</p>
<p>Second, the new way is to lead every member to get used to functioning without any idea to depend on any giant speaker, thus annulling hierarchy, clergy, position, and ambition. Drop the idea of a special speaker. That is a foreign article put into the Body. Let there be no more giant speakers. Christianity depends on the giant speakers. That is a fallen state, the condition of the book of Judges. In Judges whenever a great man became a judge, he rescued the people, and they had a revival. When the man leaves or dies, the revival also dies. That is not the church life. This way will surely rescue me from my concern for the ambition. This is the way to annul the ambition and to give up control.</p>
<p>Third, the new way is to teach all the saints to know the basic truths in an educational way that they may teach others for the spreading of the truths. This should have been one of the goals for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to carry out, but we had a failure due to our inadequate practice. For this purpose and goal we want to have truth lessons, to teach all the saints to know all the truths in an educational way that they may teach others for the spreading of the truth.</p>
<p>Fourth, the new way is to build up the saints in the growth of life that they may minister life to others, shepherd each other, and take care of the backsliding ones. This is one stone that could kill three birds&mdash;to have growth in life, to have adequate shepherding, and to take care of the backsliding ones. Today there is an accumulation of many backsliding ones. We must practice the new way to take care of every backsliding one. We do not like to have an accumulation of thousands of backsliding ones. It is a shame that no one takes care of them. That is the old way. The saints come to the big meeting to have a giant speaker to speak the truth to them. After that they go back home and leave the responsibility of shepherding to the elders. It is impossible for the elders to care for ten thousand people, and it is not fair to charge them with such a burden. The shepherding should be one to another. Even as a strong member I need a young one to shepherd me, to take care of me, to do some things for me. Of course, you also need me.</p>
<p>It is impossible to carry out this shepherding in the big meetings. It can only be done in the small gatherings with ten or twelve members. Everyone there knows each one. Surely you can take care of each other. This will build up the best communal life. Human beings are communal; we like to have a community. However, it is hard to have the best communal life. Most communal life is rotten, corrupting, and ruins people. Only the church communal life is pure. I hope that even in many cities we will have at least two hundred homes where the proper, pure, communal church life is being carried out. That will surely attract the best people.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters who intend to go full-time, do not think to go the old way. My burden is to impress you with a new way. The home gatherings should be very much helped by the full-timers. All the full-timers should learn to the uttermost how to help the home meetings. You must do a lot in the home meeting, yet nothing you do should replace anyone. This requires the top skill. According to our natural habit, either we do it all ourselves or we do not do it at all. If we do it, we do everything. We keep everybody far away, leaving the job to ourselves. That is replacement. The full-timers have to learn how to go into a small gathering with about eight persons and do much to teach the truth, preach the gospel, and minister life. Everyone will get the help, but no one will have the feeling that you are replacing them. They all feel that they themselves are doing the job. You may wonder how this could be possible. Simply go to do it. Then you will know how it can be done. To play the piano or the violin is a hard job for me. However, my grandchildren play the violin quite well. They learned by practice. After they do their homework, they also practice on the piano. Eventually they could play it. I never practice, so I cannot do it nor do I know anything about it. It depends upon the skill, and the skill depends upon practice.</p>
<p>The main thing needed for the new way is for the full-timers to be trained in two things&mdash;preaching the gospel and helping the small gatherings. You must know how to go out to reach people for the spreading of the gospel. Then every week you have to spare one night to attend the home gathering. In Taipei with about four hundred home meetings, they could have eight hundred full-timers. Two could go to one gathering. In that gathering are at most twelve, and of this number there are two experts to do everything for the attendants, yet without any replacement. Could you do this? Just as a cow could not play a piano, you may not be able to do it. Therefore, you need to be not only changed but revolutionized. You need to have a new start. This is a new way; it is absolutely different. When I first heard of the airplane, I said that it could never be done. This was my old idea, but now I am quite convinced. I would like to convince you that this can be done.</p>
<p>Although it may seem that I am not speaking about the truth lessons, I actually am. I am speaking about something in newness of spirit (Rom. 7:6). In the past we have spoken of being in the oldness of the letter. I would change the word letter to routine. You are keeping yourselves in the oldness of routine. Many young ones in the United States would say they are so glad to have the new training. They would like to change with the new way to spread the glad tidings and to go to the home meetings to do many things for everyone there, yet without any replacement. They will want me to teach them to practice this. I would like to do it, but I still need to go back to Taiwan. If you have the heart and you do mean business, you will hear more about the new way.</p>
<p>Fifth, the new way is to lead all the saints to preach the gospel in every possible way. There are many ways and many objects for our preaching, including our schools and home, the people on the street, our neighbors, and many more.</p>
<p>Sixth, the new way is to avoid leadership as much as possible. We are not going to practice anarchy. We do not intend to have anarchy, but neither do we want monarchy. We need quite a good government but without leaders. We only have one governor, the Head, Jesus Christ. The only way to annul all the position, leadership, and ambition is to have a strong practice of the home gatherings. In any home meeting do not set up a leader and do not try to be a leader. Otherwise, we will have many who consider themselves to be the head. Actually, Christ is the Head not you. Try your best to avoid any kind of leadership. Some may wonder how this could work without any leadership. This will work because of the unique Head. If you and I would not be the Head, this will give Him the best way to exercise His headship. We have been frustrating Him too much.</p>
<p>Lastly, the new way is to have the home gatherings for home nurture. For any human being to be raised up he needs a proper home nurture as well as a school education. The home gatherings are for the home nurture, and the bigger meetings are for the school education. In the human life we need the home to nurture us and the school to educate us. We must use the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning to train our people with the truth, while the small meetings in our homes are for home nurturing.</p>
<p>We have to carry out at least these seven things in a new way. Please fellowship about this matter one with another in your locality. It is worthwhile for even two or three to spend time to fellowship about these points. This will revolutionize your concept. These all are basic points and principles. The new way is to make the home meetings as homes to nurture our children, the saints. Then we will have bigger meetings mainly on the Lord&rsquo;s Day as schools to educate our people. We will have nurture and education, nurture by the home meetings and education by the bigger meetings. We must consider the home meetings as homes and the bigger meetings as schools.</p>
<p>Pray about these seven items very much after you return home. You should have a period of time for training, at least two weeks, to train the saints in your locality with all these points. The points need not be in good sequence as long as you cover every point.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PREPARATION OF THE MESSAGES</h2>
<p>A message needs to be prepared for all the different kinds of meetings. This is your cooking. This does not mean that you pick up the thought, the idea, with the terminology from the Life-study Messages and our other publications and recompose them. If you do this, you will spoil them. You need to get into the Life-studies and the other publications. This could never be done only by one person. There are too many groceries. You need a group of elders, helpers, or co-workers, including some knowledgeable sisters, to help you. Some sisters have a very good knowledge of our publications. Select the portions which you consider are suitable to your church&rsquo;s present situation, and put them together exactly as they are into one message. Train the saints not to simply read it but to use it as a message given by themselves and to themselves. They must take it as a message firstly to themselves and then to others. Furthermore, they should do this in a mutual way by mutual speaking with a little defining. Such a speaking for about thirty to forty minutes will become a rich, living, and uplifting message. Everyone will get the benefit. Also take care of all the points I have fellowshipped with you in this book. Train the saints to exercise their spirit and train them how to speak. This requires time for the elders to labor in the Word to select portions for the messages.</p>
<p>You also must train some promising ones as full-timers. Train them to go into the home meetings to be the basic elements of that meeting. There are no leaders, but you need one or two to be the basic elements, not simply the common members. The eight or ten are common members, but you need one or two basic elements, not leaders. Within a growing tree there are some basic elements by which the tree grows. Likewise, the entire weight of the meeting hall in Anaheim rests on some large steel columns concealed within the stone. Within the red stone is the cement, and under the cement are the steel columns. Neither the stone on the outside or the cement is the basic element. The basic element is the steel. The entire building is very solid and strong because within it is the solid element.</p>
<p>Within every home meeting the elders should put in the basic element. Then every gathering will be strong, but the source of the strength will be a secret. The ones not so knowledgeable may attribute the strength of the column to the red stone. Actually the strength is the steel within. You must train some to be the steel in the home meeting. This requires much labor. It is not sufficient to merely set up some homes and make a schedule and an announcement concerning the home gatherings. This will never work. You need much labor. The new way needs the elders, the co-workers, and the full-timers to labor to the uttermost. Without this you have no way to carry it out.</p>
<p>For the truth lesson classes you do not need to prepare any messages. Still you must learn how to charge the teacher to teach the truth lessons as I have pointed out earlier. For the rest of the meetings, including the general meeting, you should not trust in one person to speak. For the general meeting you must cook a message and charge one among you who is able to present this message in an adequate way. Actually it will not be his own message, but a message prepared by a group of you. This way is altogether new. Then you must prepare some kind of message for the gospel preaching in case you will need it. If there are no new ones present, then forget about it. If there are some new ones, then right away there will be something on hand to use in every home meeting. This is according to the principle of 1 Corinthians 14:26. You do have something. If the need arises, you may use it.</p>
<p>You also need to prepare the messages for all the home meetings. This is a hard job. Every week there must be one good message. Then you need to prepare a message for the Lord&rsquo;s table and another one for the prayer meeting. In principle, for the Lord&rsquo;s table you need a message on life for the nourishment, and for the prayer meeting you need a message on the service, but it is hard for us to separate these two matters. In Matthew 24 and 25 there is the parable of the ten virgins, denoting life, and the parable of the talents, denoting service. These are two aspects. However, in order to encourage people to serve properly you sometimes need life messages. Likewise, to encourage people to grow in life you sometimes need some messages on service. It all depends upon your learning and your discernment.</p>
<p>You should learn, you should labor, and you should practice not only to speak but to prepare some good messages. We have the storage of so many riches. It is doubtful that anyone could give a new message richer or more living than what we have stored up. The wisest way is to use the existing riches and skillfully present them as a prevailing message with which to serve the saints in the meeting. This is the top way. These will be not only my messages, but they will be yours because you will have digested them and put them together as one message to nourish the saints. These are the riches of the Lord&rsquo;s house. We all need to use them. In the parable of Matthew 24:45-51 the servant knew how to serve food to the household at the appointed time. We do have much food. Now we need the diligence, the faithfulness, and the skill to use all these materials as proper meals to serve the Lord&rsquo;s people, including the sinners, at the appointed time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH MEETINGS AND THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>The church meetings are not only the big meetings in the halls. The church meetings are mainly the home gatherings. Only in a little sense are the big meetings the church meetings. The tradition still remains in our unconscious concept. When you speak of the big meetings, you refer to them as the church meeting, indicating that subconsciously you do not consider the home gatherings to be the church meeting. This is our problem. We need to have a purifying change, a purification of our thought and idea which has been with us for so many years.</p>
<p>The new way is constituted with these five things: the home gatherings, the functioning of all the members, the knowledge and spread of the truth, the growth in life, and the preaching of the gospel in every way. Brother Nee in his ministry stressed these five points very strongly. Chapter nine of <em>The Normal Christian Church Life</em> has a long section concerning the home meetings, the small group meetings. He was very much disappointed by the failure to carry this out. He stressed this very much. He even suggested annulling the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting, and asked all the saints to preach the gospel on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. However, that did not work out.</p>
<p>He stressed very much that everyone needs to function. In his writings concerning the parable of the talents he said that the most dangerous one is the one-talented member. He warned us. Of course, he also stressed very much the knowledge of the truth. For this he invented the way of training. He initiated the way of training which I have been carrying out. His way was by training, not by a seminary or a school. He also stressed life very much and planned to evangelize all of China within twenty years by five routes. The new way we are now considering to take is altogether constituted with the same basic points which he stressed. We should not merely say that if Brother Nee were here he would be willing to be one with this new way. Actually, he was stressing this new way years ago. But due to our foolishness and dullness, we did not go along with him. He was very much disappointed. He did not carry it out. He could not have the way.</p>
<p>I knew this quite well. To me this is not something new. We knew of this way years ago, but we were always held back and frustrated. I beg you young ones to take the new way absolutely. I beg the old generation to also take the new way. If you do not feel capable to take the new way, then please keep silent. Do not say anything in a dissenting way. Rather, try your best to encourage the young ones to take the new way and you pray for it. The majority of the old generation there in Taiwan all encouraged the young ones to take this new way. They are all happy to see the young ones take this new way. This is what I expect and what I would beg you all to do. The young ones must take this way and the old generation also must take this way. If not, please do not be dissenting, but encourage the young ones to go on. The new generation are all our children. We are the parents. We would like to see our children take the new way and have a great success.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">FULL-TIME</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1; Acts 20:34; 18:3; 1 Cor. 9:6-15; Phil. 4:13-19; 1 Tim. 5:17</h1>
<p>The matter of being full-time has been very much misunderstood for centuries. The common thought in Christianity is that being a preacher or a pastor is a kind of profession. You have to be hired and people either pay you or they may fire you. According to the New Testament, however, to be a full-timer should not be to take a kind of profession.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRESENTING OUR BODIES</h2>
<p>Romans 12:1 says, &ldquo;I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service.&rdquo; Actually, for one to present his body to God is to go full-time. If you do not go full-time, how could your body be free to be presented to God as a living sacrifice? Our entire being is contained in our body, and our body is confined in our time. Therefore, the body is the center of these two things, the center of our being and the center of our time. The being is what we are, and the time is where we exist. We can change the places where we live, but we cannot move ourselves out of time. You always remain in time. To present your body to God means you give yourself to God. This is to be full-time. We Christians should all be full-timers. We have to give ourselves to Him. We do not give ourselves to anything else, only to our saving God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SCATTERED FULL-TIMERS</h2>
<p>Consider those approximately eight thousand saints in Jerusalem who were scattered. Acts 8:1 says that beside the apostles, all of the disciples were scattered. They went out. Were they not full-timers? They were scattered not to do a job, but Acts tells us they were scattered to spread the glad tidings (8:4). I believe their number was at least eight thousand. One day three thousand were saved (2:41), and another day five thousand (4:4). They all were scattered to preach the gospel. What were they? They all were full-timers. They were scattered throughout all of Judea and they also reached Samaria. That was a fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s word in Acts 1:8: &ldquo;But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria.&rdquo; This was accomplished not through preachers or apostles but through the scattered full-timers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAUL MAKING TENTS TO SUPPORT HIMSELF<br />
AND HIS CO-WORKERS</h2>
<p>Christianity considers that Paul was a preacher, but Acts 18:3 tells us that he was in a trade making tents. Paul went purposely to stay with his co-workers, Priscilla and Aquila, because they were in the same trade. Probably they made tents together. Paul not only made money to support himself, he also made money to support his co-workers (Acts 20:34).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THOSE WHO PREACH THE GOSPEL<br />
LIVING OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 9:14 tells us that those who preach the gospel should live of the gospel. Fifty years ago in Chefoo, we began to have the church life without any hired preacher. A friend of mine who was a generation older than I and highly educated argued. He said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong for a person to be paid as a preacher? The Bible says whoever preaches the gospel lives of the gospel.&rdquo; Apparently his word was right. But Paul does not say that the preacher of the gospel is paid by somebody. He says that he lives of the gospel. Because no one supported Paul, however, he had to make tents. The church in Corinth, whom he served, thought he took advantage of them, that he was a person of guile (2 Cor. 12:16 and note 2). Thus, he did not use his right to live of the gospel with the saints in Corinth. He preached the gospel, yet lived on his tent making.</p>
<p>Paul illustrated his right to live of the gospel in several ways. He likened his apostolic ministry to that of a soldier, a farmer, a shepherd, an ox on a threshing field, and a priest serving God by offering sacrifices for the people (1 Cor. 9:7-15). He illustrated in these many ways to vindicate himself, proving that he did have the right to live of the gospel. But due to the wrong environment in Corinth, he would not use that right.</p><h2 class="head1">DOING ALL THINGS<br />
IN THE ONE WHO EMPOWERS US</h2>
<p>Another aspect of being full-time is shown in Philippians. In Philippians 4:13 Paul says, &ldquo;I can do all things in Him who empowers me.&rdquo; Probably we have never related this verse to being full-time. To be a job-dropping full-timer is not a small thing. In ourselves we cannot do it. Philippians 4:13 is related to Paul&rsquo;s being such a full-timer. No one can do it except those who do it in the One who empowers them. We all need such a Christ. If you are thinking to take the full-time way, you must realize that it is only possible for you to do it in Christ who empowers you. Do not think, &ldquo;Well, it might be all right because in my locality the church has over one hundred fifty people. Surely they can support me.&rdquo; To think this way is wrong. This is the same as being hired by your church. You should not consider in this way. When all those thousands of scattered saints from Jerusalem went to Samaria, how could the Samaritans support them? How could they get a job? Who supported them? They must have lived of the gospel. They did this in the One who empowered them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HIGHEST EXAMPLE OF BEING FULL-TIME</h2>
<p>The highest example of being full-time was the Lord Jesus. Up to the age of thirty, He made a living by being a carpenter. In all those years He had a job, but then He came out at age thirty to serve God with His full time. Nobody paid Him or hired Him.</p>
<p>He was tempted in the wilderness by the Devil concerning His living (Matt. 4:1-4). The Spirit led Him into this temptation. He did not enter into temptation by doing something wrong, like we sometimes have done. Many times we have gotten into temptation because of our mistakes, but the Lord Jesus was brought into that temptation by the Spirit. This temptation was a test to prove that He was qualified to be the King for the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s fasting was also the Spirit&rsquo;s leading, and His fasting led Him into a position to be tested. For forty days He did not eat. Then He became hungry. At this point the Devil tempted Him to perform a miracle to make the stones become loaves of bread (Matt. 4:3) to prove that He was the Son of God, that God was really with Him. But the Lord Jesus would not do it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOLLOWING THE LORD<br />
AND TRUSTING IN HIM FOR OUR LIVING</h2>
<p>When you go full-time, sometimes you also will be led by the Spirit into a hunger, with nothing to eat and nothing to live on. At that time you will be tempted by the Devil who would say to you, &ldquo;You are a servant of God. Surely you can pray that God would do something as a miracle for you.&rdquo; Eating is always a trap used by the Devil to snare man. The Lord Jesus, humanly speaking, was mainly supported by His followers who were the women. These women not only supported Him, but they also supported His other followers (Luke 8:2-3). Peter, James, and John all gave up their fishing occupations and became &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; in following Jesus. They traveled around, going through the villages with no certain place to stay and no assurance of something to eat.</p>
<p>They just liked to be with this Person. The Lord was like a magnet who drew and attracted them to Himself. The Lord said that &ldquo;the foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have roosts, but the Son of Man has nowhere that He may lay His head&rdquo; (Matt. 8:20). Even though He did not have a resting place, the disciples just wanted to be with Him where He was. Their fortune was just to be with Him without any concern for their living.</p>
<p>The job-dropping full-timers should be honest with their parents. Tell them you are not sure where your support will come from. Tell them you feel that the Lord wants you to go full-time, and that you will follow Jesus and serve Him. The husbands who are burdened to be full-time also have to fellowship with their wives honestly. They should not assure them with promises of security. You cannot assure your wife with any security. All you can do is ask her to go the full-time way with you.</p>
<p>Does this kind of talk disappoint you? If so, then you should go back to your job. Thousands of people got helped, healed, and saved by the Lord, but eventually only a hundred and twenty remained with Him. At that time the Jewish people were threatening all the followers of Jesus but these hundred and twenty were not afraid of this kind of threatening. For ten days they did nothing but pray. You may wonder how they lived, but they just lived. The Bible is a wonderful book. It does not tell us how these people were supported, how they survived. Yet they survived. Would you still take this way? There is no promise that anyone will support you. No one would beg you or put you on the payroll. Just do it in Him who empowers you.</p>
<p>When I became a full-timer no one hired me. The church was small and could not support me. Mainly it was only my brother and I who supported the church because only we made good salaries. That was over fifty years ago, when the world&rsquo;s financial situation was very poor. The living standard was very low, and it was hard to make money. A teacher in high school could only make about twelve to fifteen dollars a month, which was only good for two or three persons to live on. It was hard for every family to have any savings. I realized this and others reminded me that it was mainly only my brother and I who supported the church. I was also reminded by some that if I gave up my job, I would need somebody to support me. Some said, &ldquo;You are now supporting the church. When you become one who is supported, who will support you?&rdquo; I did not know, but I made a resolution to live in a very simple way. As long as I could live, I did not care. That was my intention. I was burdened to give up my job just to preach Jesus.</p>
<p>In case you still could not make a living, you can &ldquo;make tents&rdquo;; you have a good example in Paul. We may be strange and peculiar persons whom others cannot understand. They will say, &ldquo;Is this not your job?&rdquo; No, it is not. Paul made tents, and he even had co-workers, Priscilla and Aquila, working in the same trade. The church in Rome (Rom. 16:5) and in Ephesus (1 Cor. 16:19 cf. Acts 18:18-19, 26) met in their house. They were so much for the Lord&rsquo;s interest, yet they still made tents.</p><h2 class="head1">SUPPORT FOR THE FULL-TIME ELDERS</h2>
<p>Another verse concerning full-time is 1 Timothy 5:17: &ldquo;Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching.&rdquo; &ldquo;Double honor&rdquo; means they need double support. You have to support them, but it does not mean you have to pay them. There is no word even as a hint in the New Testament telling us that the church paid somebody to be their preacher or to be their elder. Yet Paul did tell us there were elders who went full-time and needed others to support them.</p>
<p>The last part of this verse says &ldquo;especially those who labor in word and teaching.&rdquo; To prepare the messages for all the meetings surely needs an elder&rsquo;s full time. If you still have a job, you will not be able to labor so well in your leisure time, after office hours, or on weekends. You need to be full-time to labor in the word. Paul says the ones who labor in the word and in teaching are worth even more than double honor. The ones who take the lead well are worthy of double honor, and the ones who are laboring in the word and teaching are worthy of more than double honor. Do not consider being full-time as a profession. Do not consider yourself as a preacher that the church has to pay. Just consider going this way by being led of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THE BELIEVERS NEEDING TO BE FULL-TIME</h2>
<p>In principle, we have to realize that every saved one should be a full-timer. This is why Paul has the ground to charge us to present our bodies to God. Every saved one must be a full-timer, presenting his body to God. To present your body actually means to present yourself. Sometimes you may say that your body is here but your being is somewhere else. Actually, your being always goes with your body. Where your body goes, your being goes also. But you cannot say that where your being goes, your body also comes. Thus, to present your body is just to present yourself to God. As a saved one, you have to present yourself to God. Having presented yourself to God, you will be led by the Lord to either do a job to make money or to preach the gospel without making any money. Whether you do a job or preach the gospel depends upon the Lord&rsquo;s leading.</p>
 <p>Today, however, due to our human concept, we call the full-timers the ones who have given up their jobs to preach the gospel, but we do not consider those who do a job as full-timers. Actually, all those who do a job should also be full-timers. Some brothers doing a job are really not full-timers. They are full-timers for themselves; they are not full-timers for God.</p>
<p>Sometimes when such a one who makes a lot of money is happy with God, with the church, and with the elders, he would decide to write a check. First, he has the thought to write a check for ten thousand dollars. Then he says to himself, &ldquo;Wait a minute. How could the church need ten thousand dollars? It&rsquo;s too much. It&rsquo;s foolish. This is not the way to manage the finances, so I&rsquo;d better write a check for five thousand dollars.&rdquo; When his wife finds out that he is giving the church five thousand dollars, she says, &ldquo;The church doesn&rsquo;t need that much. One thousand is good enough.&rdquo; Then the check is written and they begin to eat their lunch. During lunch they have a further talk. The wife asks how much they have in the checking account. When the husband tells her that they have a lot in savings bonds, she will not agree with his selling the savings bonds. When the husband tells her there is only twelve hundred dollars in the checking account, she says, &ldquo;Could you write a check for one thousand out of twelve hundred? Don&rsquo;t you know that Mark, our second boy, needs five hundred dollars to pay for his tuition tomorrow?&rdquo; Then the husband replies, &ldquo;If that is the case, we&rsquo;d better write a check for five hundred and cancel the other one.&rdquo; Finally, they both agree to give the church five hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Such a money maker surely is not a full-timer for God. Through church history and even among us we have seen some, although not too many, real full-timers who made money for God. They make ten thousand, yet they only spend two thousand for their living and give the rest to the Lord. Thus, they also are full-timers.</p>
<p>Every saint should be a full-timer. Every sister who is a housewife should also be a full-timer. We have a reputation with most Christians that we are people who love the Lord. Many married sisters pretend and even declare that they love the Lord. Eventually it becomes manifest that what they really love is their children. They do not even love their husbands so much as their children. Such a sister who declares that she loves the Lord yet who really loves her children more is not a full-timer. If a sister is really a full-timer, whether her children live or are taken away by the Lord, it is the same. Hence, to be a full-timer is not an easy thing. You need to say, &ldquo;I can do all things in Him who empowers me. Whether I have my husband and my children or I lose everyone, I can bear it in Him who empowers me. I am a full-timer.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">NO SLOPPY OR IDLE ONES<br />
TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>As the one who proposed to have five hundred full-timers per year in Taiwan, I am quite concerned that by this practice a lot will come in who are sloppy ones, idle ones, ones who just know how to eat, but do not know how to work. I have seen some like this already. When you encourage all the saints to go full-time, these ones will take the lead to say, &ldquo;I will be a full-timer; wonderful! I don&rsquo;t need to work. I don&rsquo;t need to go to the office during certain hours. I can sleep as long as I want. No one bothers me and no one fires me, since no one hires me. Once I declare that I am full-time and the church consents, then that is for my whole life.&rdquo; Do not assure these ones that the church will take care of them, otherwise you will spoil them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FULL-TIMER BEING ONE WHO IS<br />
ABSOLUTE FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>To be a full-timer means to be one who is absolute for the Lord. Your income may be five times what you need, yet you would only spend that one-fifth for your living and give the other four-fifths to the Lord. To talk about tithing as the Seventh-Day Adventists practice is a shame. That is something from the Old Testament, something in the law. In the New Testament it is not to present one tenth but to present your body, to present your entire being. This includes everything you are, everything you have, everything you can do, and everything you earn. It is not just one tenth but ten tenths.</p>
<p>We must teach this and promote this to the uttermost. Paul was such a person, and Aquila and Priscilla were such persons. They were for nothing else. They were just for the Lord. Even whatever they had for their living, that was also for the Lord. If they did not take care of their living, they would die. If they died, they could not live for the Lord. Whatever they did, even making a living to keep themselves alive, was also for the Lord. They did nothing for themselves.</p>
<p>We must uplift the standard of the biblical truth concerning the matter of being full-time. I hope that we all would be recovered in the understanding of such a truth. Do not think that this is a small matter. The Bible reveals some truths by plain words and other truths just by cases. None of the verses in the Scripture reading use the word full-time, but all of the cases are there. In all these cases is the truth of all the saved ones needing to be absolute for God, to be full-timers, regardless of what they do.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>

<p>Hymn 473 in our hymnal is wonderful. When I went back to Taiwan in October of 1984, this hymn was so sweet. We could not stop the singing of this hymn, and it stirred up many hearts. I like every line except for the last one, so we can replace &ldquo;Whence doubt and fear are gone&rdquo; with &ldquo;And kingdom yet to come.&rdquo; Verse 3 refers to the holy bargain, the fragment for the whole. When we sacrifice a fragment to the Lord, we gain the whole earth! When we serve Him, everyone and everything serve us&mdash;&ldquo;All men and all events alike must serve the ransomed soul&rdquo; (verse 3). We all need to speak and sing this hymn again and again.</p>
<p>The verses in the Scripture reading can be considered as a cluster of the divine Word, a cluster of grapes, so precious and so sweet. First Corinthians 3:20b-23 indicates that Christ is ours. Since Christ is ours, all things are ours. Even death is ours. Death serves a purpose for us, so death works for us. Verse 23 concludes with the fact that we are Christ&rsquo;s. He is ours and we are His. He belongs to us and we belong to Him (S. S. 2:16). This is marvelous! First Corinthians 7 tells us that we all have been bought by Him to be His slaves. We are His slaves bought by Him with a price, so He is our Master, our Owner. He is our Lord, and we are His slaves.</p>
<p>Romans 14 tells us that &ldquo;we live to the Lord&rdquo; (v. 8). To live for Him is somewhat easy to understand. To live with Him, in Him, by Him, and even to live Him are still not too hard to understand. But to live <em>to</em> Him probably is a matter that we have never considered and do not understand. What is it to live to Him? This is the main point of this chapter.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REAL MEANING OF BEING FULL-TIME</h2>
<p>The real meaning of being full-time is to live to Him. To go full-time does not mean to drop your job and become a preacher. It does not mean that you give up your business and become one who preaches the gospel or who labors in the word all the time. A full-timer is one who lives to the Lord. Who should be such a one? Every believer, without one exception. As long as you are a believer, you have to realize you should be one living to Him. We have to live to Him because He is ours and we are His. To live to Him is based upon the fact that we are His. Not only is He ours, but we also are His.</p>
<p>After the wedding, a man and woman become a couple living together. They are living as one. Verse 3 of <em>Hymns</em> 473 says in two lines, &ldquo;All things are yours when you are His, and He and you are one.&rdquo; As a married couple, the husband and wife are one. They should not only live for one another but to one another. He should live to her and she should live to him.</p>
<p>When a husband tells a wife that he lives for her and does everything for her, he is not up to the standard. Actually, his heart is not one thousand percent for his wife. There is some reservation. If the husband would tell his wife that he lives <em>to</em> her, this makes a great difference. To live to the Lord includes living for, by, with, and in Him. This is one being two and two in one. There is not only no separation between us and the Lord but also no distinction when we are living to Him.</p>
<p>Because the husband is merely living for the wife, she has to get his permission to spend his money. But when the husband lives to the wife, that means he and his wife are one. His money is hers, and her money is his. When she is going to spend money, she does not need to get her husband&rsquo;s permission. Some couples may even argue because one used the money without the other&rsquo;s permission.</p>
<p>When the Lord is going to spend your money, you may say, &ldquo;Lord, this money is for You, but not today.&rdquo; When we feel good and happy, we would give our money to the Lord. We are merely for the Lord. Because we are only for the Lord, the Lord is only for us. Whenever we want something of the Lord, we need to get His permission. You may ask the Lord for something, and the Lord may respond, &ldquo;Everything is for you, but not today. Today I am not happy with you. I will wait for a time when you make Me happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of us claim that we love the Lord and that we and all that we have are for Him. But whatever the Lord would require of you, He needs your permission. You have not gone up to the standard that you are living to Him. If you are living to Him, He does not need to get your permission for whatever He needs of you. Likewise, if the Lord is living to you, you do not need to get His permission for whatever you want of Him. You just use it.</p>
<p>To be full-time means that you live to the Lord. You do not live for Him but to Him. This is a great privilege. A full-timer does not mean what we may think. A full-timer is one who lives to the Lord; every believer, as one bought by the Lord with a price, should be a person living to the Lord. He is yours and you are His. He and you are one. He is to you and you are to Him. There is no distinction in anything. He does not need your permission to use you, nor do you need His permission to use Him. He is ready to be like this to you, but you may not be ready. You may be quite reserving and hesitating. The husband may have the confidence in the wife to be one with her and to be everything to her, but the wife may still be doubting. She may be thinking, &ldquo;If I tell him I am to him, he may take away everything I have. Then what shall I do? Do I have the security?&rdquo; This illustrates the present situation, mostly among us. Most of us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery do love the Lord, and we would say that whatever we are and whatever we have are all for the Lord. We do not realize, however, how subtle it is when we say that we are for the Lord.</p>
<p>Regardless of how much you say that you are for the Lord, the Lord has no right to touch anything of yours because it is yours. It is yours for Him and you for Him&mdash;not to Him. Suppose my wife brought me my lunch and said, &ldquo;I am bringing some food for you.&rdquo; This is not as good as her saying, &ldquo;I am bringing some food to you.&rdquo; Could you differentiate between these two expressions&mdash;&ldquo;I have something for you&rdquo; or &ldquo;I bring something to you&rdquo;? &ldquo;To me&rdquo; means that it immediately becomes my possession with me as the owner. When you say &ldquo;for me,&rdquo; who possesses it? To whom does it belong?</p>
<p>When you say that you are for the Lord and that you live for the Lord, you think that is good. Actually, it may not be so good. It is subtle. There may be a kind of subtle reservation within you. You could say you are for the Lord, but you dare not say you live to the Lord. Many of us have read the portions of the Word in the Scripture reading many times, but we have never paid attention to the difference between living to the Lord and living for the Lord. When you see a vision through your subtlety, you may realize that in the past you have always been living for the Lord and not to the Lord. Perhaps you have never lived to the Lord. I saw marriages in which the husband and the wife both kept things for themselves. When either of them wanted to use something belonging to the other, they had to have a long talk. Actually, they needed a long negotiation. They even negotiated in terms, in conditions. If the husband gave the wife something, he required the wife to give him something in return or in exchange. One particular person got married, but with a condition that his wife had no share of whatever he had gained. He may be living for his wife, but he is not living to her. I hope we are beginning to understand what it means to be for the Lord and what it means to be to the Lord. Are you for the Lord? This is subtle. Many saints throughout the years told me that they were for the Lord.</p>
<p>You are for the Lord at your pleasure. When you feel happy or when you feel it is convenient, you give something for the Lord and do something for the Lord. When you do not feel happy or that it is convenient, you do not do anything for the Lord. We must be enlightened to see that to be for the Lord is not adequate.</p>
<p>Marriage means that the sister is one couple with her husband. The real meaning of marriage life is not one for another but to one another. &ldquo;One for another&rdquo; is still two. &ldquo;To one another&rdquo; means that this couple became one at their wedding. Mary altogether lost her possession to John at their wedding, and John lost his possession, his ownership, altogether to Mary. They became a couple not for one another but to one another. Every believer should be like this to the Lord. You have been bought as slaves with a price. The Lord is yours and you are His. He is to you and you are to Him. Whatever you do, you do to Him. When you go to school to study, you study to Him. If you go to be a banker to make a lot of money, you make money to Him. As a wife who raises children, you raise up children to Him, not to yourself. Paul said &ldquo;none of us lives to himself&rdquo; (Rom. 14:7). We do not live to ourselves but to Him. This is what it means to be full-time. We all should be like this.</p>
<p>We have to recognize that we are Christians. This title or designation implies belonging. It does not only mean that you are a &ldquo;Christ-man&rdquo; but it also means that you are a man belonging to Christ. When the ancient Romans referred to the believers as Christians, they meant that these people belonged to Christ. Because you are His, everything about you must be to Him. The practical meaning of the title Christian is not that we are men for Christ but that we are men belonging to Christ. Because we absolutely belong to Him, we breathe to Him, we sleep to Him, we eat to Him, and we drink to Him. You do not need to say that you are doing something for Him because you belong to Him. Whatever you are, you are to Him; whatever you do, you do to Him; whatever you possess, you possess to Him; whatever you own, you own to Him; the money that you have, you have to Him. If you say that you have something for the Lord, you are still the owner. You still possess and keep it, but you keep it for Him. It is not to Him. To be to Him is much deeper.</p>
<p>When we are living to the Lord, we do not need to talk about consecration. Suppose that after Mary and John had been married for three days, Mary repented to John and said, &ldquo;John, for these three days I didn&rsquo;t do things for you. Now I want to consecrate and offer myself to you.&rdquo; John&rsquo;s response would be: &ldquo;Mary, it&rsquo;s too late. You are already married to me. You don&rsquo;t need to offer yourself to me. You belong to me already. I am your possessor, your owner. Why do you need to offer yourself to me? You are annulling our wedding.&rdquo; In like manner, sometimes your consecration really means a cancellation. It indicates that you have canceled your marriage with Christ. You have to realize that on the day you were saved, you got married to Christ, and He has already bought you. The most you can say is, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me. When I was saved, I didn&rsquo;t realize that I got married to You and that from that day I belonged to You. Now that I realize this, I want to repent and live to You. I want to realize or resume the real marriage life from this hour.&rdquo; The Lord desires that we be to Him since we belong to Him already. Do not say that you are for Him. To say that you are for Him indicates that you still possess something under your ownership.</p>
<p>In our fellowship in this chapter, I believe we have touched the bottom of the significance of what it means to be full-time. The job-dropping full-timers may not have realized that they should be to the Lord. The most they may have realized is that they are for the Lord. They are not to the Lord. To be for the Lord means that you still could be away from the Lord. If you are to the Lord, you could never be away from Him. To be to the Lord means that you are one with Him. It means that we breathe to the Lord, eat to Him, walk to Him, and even exercise to Him. If you are practicing the real ownership of the Lord, you will do everything to Him.</p>
<p>I hope we all can realize the proper denotation of the spiritual term &ldquo;full-time.&rdquo; To be full-time does not mean that you need to give up your job. To be a full-timer means that whatever you do, you do to the Lord; whatever you are, you are to the Lord; and whatever you have, you have to the Lord. If you remain in a job, you remain there to the Lord. If you leave your job, you leave it to the Lord. As long as you are to the Lord you are a full-timer. Whatever you have to do practically all depends upon the One to whom you live. He leads you. Then you know whether you have to remain in a job or leave a job or whether you need to get married or remain single. It does not mean that if you remain single, you are full-time and that if you get married, you are not full-time. To be full-time simply means to live to the Lord.</p>
<p>Every dear saint who really means business with the Lord must be one all the way living to Him. Paul said that even when we die, we die to Him (Rom. 14:8). Thus, there is no problem concerning whether we live a longer life or whether we die today. If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. There is no difference. Whatever I do and whatever happens to me, I am to the Lord because I am one with Him. To think that only those who give up their job to do the Lord&rsquo;s work are full-time is a wrong understanding. This is still the understanding under the influence of degraded Christianity.</p>
<p>The matter of being full-time is implied in the cluster of the divine Word in the Scripture reading of this chapter. You realize that you have been bought by the Lord with His precious blood as the purchasing price. Now He is your Lord and Master, and you belong to Him. He is yours and you are His. Whatever you have, you have to Him. Whatever you do, you do to Him. Whatever you are, you are to Him. Everything is altogether to Him. This surely puts you in a position to take everything He has. You have the privilege. Because you are to Him, He is to you. As long as you are to the Lord every wrong will be adjusted. We cannot abuse the Lord&rsquo;s possessions as long as we are to Him. We have been wrong, wild, and so far from the central lane because we are always for the Lord. It is possible to debate with other brothers for the Lord. But you could not say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I am debating with you to the Lord.&rdquo; If you can say that you are to the Lord, you will immediately be adjusted.</p>
<p>When you say that you are a full-timer, it means that you are to the Lord. If the Lord really wanted you to drop your job and you would not do it, you could still say that you were for the Lord. But deep within, you could not say that you were to the Lord. If you cannot say that you are remaining in your job to the Lord, this indicates you have to give up that job. Whether or not you should leave your job has to be checked. When you leave your job, do you have the feeling deep within that you are leaving your job to the Lord? When you remain in a job, are you remaining there to the Lord? Whether you leave your job or remain in it, depends upon whether you can say that you are to the Lord. Then you have the security. Do not ask someone whether or not you should leave your job. Just check within as to whether you can say you are leaving your job to the Lord or remaining in your job to the Lord. Whichever way you can say that you are to the Lord is where you need to be. If you cannot say &ldquo;to the Lord,&rdquo; you should not do it. This is a very deep test. Everyone among us is a full-timer. Since we are altogether to the Lord, our time and our money are also to Him. Nothing is to ourselves because none of us lives to ourselves but to Him.</p><h2 class="head1">FULFILLING THE LORD&rsquo;S COMMISSION<br />
TO HIS RECOVERY</h2>
<p>Since October of 1984, I fully realized that we had become somewhat stuck in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We held the Lord back very much, so we did not carry out His commission to the recovery. In the preaching of the gospel, we have not had much spread. In the teaching of the truth, we rarely exercised. I began to feel that I should ask the Lord to forgive me since I am considered by many of the saints as the one to take the lead in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I felt that I had not done an adequate job. Therefore, in October of 1984 there was a big revolution, a big change, within me. We must change the situation among us so that we can fulfill the Lord&rsquo;s commission. The Lord&rsquo;s commission is His recovery, and His recovery today is to recover Christ as life, to recover the church as our living, to recover the enjoyment of Christ as everything to us, and to recover all the significances of the church life for the purpose of not only preaching the gospel but also spreading the truth. I believe that this is the unique reason that He has given us nearly all the truths in today&rsquo;s Christianity. He has given us His truths for us to spread them not only to Christians but even to the unbelievers. The entire globe is under darkness. Every human being on the earth needs to hear the truth, but our spreading of the precious truths we have received has been strongly limited. There have been many strong testimonies concerning people getting attracted and caught by the notes in the Recovery Version, but who has the burden to go out and spread these truths?</p>
<p>Some brothers who are with us do not use these truths when they teach and preach. They teach and preach what they feel is good, yet they do not realize how poor their messages are. Some brothers among us continually put out some publications. I was honest to tell them that there was no light and nothing new in what they put out. The points in our publications are full of life and light, but these brothers would not present them as they are. I could not understand why they have to change the messages we publish to present something in their own style and in their own way. There are no new points of life or light in what they publish. Any life or light in their material is altogether adopted from this ministry. I have been observing this situation among us for years. I would like to see whether some younger brothers among us would be raised up by the Lord to speak something. If I could see this, I would praise the Lord. On the other hand, I have seen some who like to build up something around themselves.</p>
<p>I have been in the line of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for many years, and I bear much responsibility for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Thousands around the globe came into the recovery due to the ministry. They sacrificed their future and everything. In these days hundreds of young people in Taiwan gave up their future after their graduation from college. Humanly speaking, they sacrificed everything, so I am somewhat responsible to them. For them to sacrifice their entire future and come into the recovery in such a state is not fair. This is why I cannot allow this to happen.</p>
<p>The Lord has commissioned us with His recovery, and He has surely opened up the New Testament to reveal many dear and precious truths to us. What the Lord needs is for thousands of His dear saints who love Him, who live to Him, and who know nothing but His recovery to take one way. Regardless of whether the saints are from Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, England, Thailand, Indonesia, or the United States, we all bear the same burden, take the same way, and spread the same truths. We dispense the truths embodied in the &ldquo;gold bar,&rdquo; the Recovery Version. We have no other merchandise! If we would be like this, the entire earth will be taken!</p>
<p>It breaks my heart to see some practicing to have another ministry, using the material of the ministry. We all have to pray, &ldquo;Lord, rescue me from my ambition to be somebody in the recovery.&rdquo; We should only know the truths of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. We only use one way by one accord, prayer, the Spirit, and the Word. This is what I believe the Lord is after, and this is what we all expect in the depths of our being. Everyone will feel happy about this.</p>
<p>We all have to realize that we are the full-timers. If we are a banker, we do banking to Him. If we are a teacher, we teach to Him. If we make one dollar or one million dollars, we make it to Him. Then when we go out, the Lord will surely back us. We do not need to worry about our living. The Lord will be backing us. When we go out, we do not go in a dissenting or ambitious way. If you go out with your ambition to build yourself up and I go out with my ambition to build my ministry up, we are finished. The Lord has to go to others. We all need to go out in one way like an army. Then we will have the morale and the impact.</p>
<p>We do not need to do that much. We just need to go out with a pure heart, without anything to ourselves but all things to Him. Just go out with all the truths and the Recovery Version to read to people. I assure you that you will catch someone every week. You do not need to preach your teaching or your kind of doctrine with your terminology. We have to see what the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been commissioned with a big enterprise to spread the Lord&rsquo;s truths. He has given us the truths which we are holding. But we need the faithful, pure-hearted ones, who do not have any intention to live to themselves but to Him, to go out to spread these &ldquo;gold bar&rdquo; truths. There is no need for you to preach or teach in your way. Open up the Recovery Version and read some of the notes with the hungry ones.</p>
<p>If we all would go out in this way, I believe each one of us would get some persons every week. We would begin to have the increase, not just in percentage but in fold. We could even triple our number in one year. If we would all gain one person every three months, we would have a fourfold increase in one year. If you use the &ldquo;gold bar&rdquo; (the Recovery Version), the rainbow booklets, and all the Life-studies, and present them to the believers and unbelievers all the time, within three months you will get one person. I believe that you may even get one person every week. In the Lord&rsquo;s ministry, we are not building something to ourselves but something altogether to Him.</p>
<p>Let us all be full-timers! If we are led to drop our jobs, then we drop them to Him and go out to serve the precious truths in the Recovery Version, the rainbow booklets, and the Life-studies to everybody. We may read them note 14<sup>1</sup> in 2 Corinthians 13 or note 3<sup>4</sup> in Hebrews 1, which tells us what aspects of Christ are revealed in each of the books of the New Testament. If we go out to read the notes of the Recovery Version to people, they will be caught. We will gain much increase. Actually, though, I do not care that much for the increase. I care for the spreading of the truths so that they can get into the needy hearts. If we spread these truths, we will become the faithful servants to serve food to the Lord&rsquo;s people at the appointed time (Matt. 24:45). Then we will fulfill the commission of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This is where my heart is. I will die to this. I told the brothers in the Far East I will not stop until my entire being is exhausted by this ministry. I hope you all will say the same thing.</p>
<p>Let us rise up to go full-time, either by dropping our jobs to go out or by remaining in our jobs to make more money and give every cent to the Lord&rsquo;s move. Then the Lord&rsquo;s move will not be short of men or money. We will be short of nothing. If the Lord can gain ten thousand saints in the United States to go full-time with one kind of teaching, one kind of preaching, one kind of material, one kind of publication, one kind of way, and everything one kind, this will be our morale! The wise way is that we all take the full-time way and speak the same thing, think the same thing, present the same thing, and teach the same thing, having the same essence, appearance and expression. Then we will have the morale, the impact, to defeat the enemy. This is what the Lord needs!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>

<h2 class="head1">PLUNDERING EGYPT OF ITS GOLD</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider more concerning the full-timers who would still remain in their job, their profession or business, to make money. Those full-timers remain there to make a gain of the world&rsquo;s gold. When the Israelites left Egypt, they plundered it of its gold (Exo. 11:2-3; 12:35-36). The material gold mine is in Egypt. We need some full-timers to remain there to dig the gold mine to get the gold. The other full-timers will drop their job, profession, or business for the preaching and teaching of the gospel truth, but they will need something to live on. We would not like to see that they would be forced to make tents as Paul was in Acts 18:1-3. That would be a shame to us. If I were there at Paul&rsquo;s time, I would have gone through all the churches to tell them that it was a shame that they would not have fellowship with the Apostle Paul unto the gospel (Phil. 1:5). It was a shame to force him and his co-workers to go back to &ldquo;Egypt&rdquo; to get some gold. We must stress to the saints that we are all full-timers in different functions. Some have the function to preach the gospel, teach the truth, and minister life to all the seekers. However, these dear ones could not have any time to make a living. They need others to support them. Therefore, a great number of us full-timers should remain in our jobs, professions, or businesses to make money.</p>
<p>It is a great thing to have fellowship unto the gospel. Unto the gospel means for the furtherance of the gospel. All the full-timers who remain in their jobs and businesses need to have this kind of fellowship, a fellowship for the furtherance of the Lord&rsquo;s move through those who do not remain in businesses and jobs, but who are occupied all day with preaching and teaching for the spreading of the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>It is not sufficient to use the Seventh-Day Adventists as an example, reminding the saints how they practice ten percent tithing. This is too poor. The tithing of ten percent to the Lord is altogether an Old Testament thing, belonging to the law. There was no grace, life, or life power in that. We must be different. We are in the age of grace, which provides us with much supply of life. The dynamic salvation was accepted by Zaccheus in Luke 19:1-10. Immediately after being saved, that sinner gave up so much of his worldly possessions. That was not a tithing of ten percent; that was the very issue of the dynamic salvation. Likewise, on the day of Pentecost all those small members had everything in common (Acts 2:44, 45; 4:32-35). This was not one tenth of their possessions but one hundred percent. They put everything at the feet of the apostles, that is, at the Lord&rsquo;s disposal. That was wonderful. We are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery; even this matter has to be recovered.</p>
<p>We have &ldquo;passed beyond all earthly bribe.&rdquo; All the riches could never bribe us. We would not accept any kind of bribe. This is rotten. Any government which receives a bribe is a rotten, ruined government. We would not be ruined; therefore, we have to pass far, far beyond all earthly bribes to God&rsquo;s complete purpose.</p>
<p>In Luke 16:1-13 the Lord Jesus teaches us how to be wise, as the unrighteous steward. The Israelites required gold of the Egyptians. Apparently that was not righteous, but in a sense that was very righteous. The Egyptians had robbed Israel for over two hundred years. The Israelites had no chance to plunder the Egyptians in turn. Now, God&rsquo;s sovereignty subdued Pharaoh, and Pharaoh could do nothing to God&rsquo;s people. God gave His people the chance to plunder them, the more the better, as much as they could. This was altogether righteous because He is a righteous God. Now we are making a gain of the world. Do you think that this is not righteous? This is very righteous because the world has been robbing God our Father for quite a long time. From where did they get their riches? It was from God. Therefore, God sends us back to make a gain of them. Of course, we do not rob them, but we make a gain of the world&rsquo;s riches by our labor, laboring day and night to be very successful. If the people of the world can establish a factory which earns ten million dollars, we had better go today to earn fifty million dollars.</p>
<p>Go back to tell the saints to make a gain of the world in the righteous way, to make more money&mdash;the more the better. However, try your best when you get riches, not to retain one penny. If you would not retain even a penny, you must say to the Devil, &ldquo;I mean business with my Lord. I only use a little part for me and for my family to live on in the proper way.&rdquo; I do not like to see the saints living in a poor way. Neither do I like to see the saints living in a luxurious way. I like to see that the saints have proper homes, and that they put their children in schools, helping them to get the highest degree, if possible, a Ph.D. On occasion I have given money to some of the saints to support their children&rsquo;s education. I like to see as well that all the saints have proper cars, but not too expensive, that they may have a good living. We must save every penny that we can. But we save not for our savings account, but to have something for His spending.</p><h2 class="head1">ENJOYING GOD&rsquo;S BLESSING<br />
BY TAKING CARE OF GOD&rsquo;S NEED</h2>
<p>Train the saints who love the Lord so much. It is regrettable that in the past they did not receive the adequate education or instruction in this matter. The more they would spend for the Lord, the more they have the blessing spoken of in Philippians 4:19. Give this verse to all the dear ones who love the Lord and are full-time to make money and to give. This verse is a great blessing. Quite often when I receive a gift from a dear saint, I quote this verse as a conclusion to my letter of acknowledgment: &ldquo;My God shall fill every need of yours according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Because you are taking care of God&rsquo;s need, God would give you a great blessing in filling every need of yours according to His riches. I have seen in the past that those who did care for God&rsquo;s need all received a bountiful blessing. The saints&rsquo; giving will not be in vain. The more they give, the more they will see the Lord&rsquo;s riches. Due to the good government, the good administration in Taiwan, the people there have become rich. We have to give the credit to our sovereign God. Now all the saints there in Taiwan can share the riches. We have to pray that God would keep blessing the United States for His purpose. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery needs much blessing that comes from God&rsquo;s sovereignty through the government. The recovery needs the United States as its center.</p>
<p>Train the saints in your locality. Do not merely enjoy the physical gains you have received under God&rsquo;s sovereignty. This may offend the Lord. In this case the Lord will take back His blessing. Train the saints to realize that if we are faithful to Him, He will bless us. If we spend every ounce of our gold for His purpose, He will return to us not only by ounces, but by pounds. This is to carry out the fellowship unto the gospel, the fellowship for the furtherance of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING THE UNRIGHTEOUS MAMMON<br />
TO MAKE FRIENDS<br />
FOR THE FURTHERANCE OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus taught us that while we are still in the stewardship, we should be wise to use the unrighteous mammon to make friends for the furtherance and spread of the gospel. Not only will you get back what you have given, but when the time comes when we will all enter into the eternal tabernacles, many will be there to welcome you (Luke 16:9). You will have a great surprise, for you may never have realized that many have been brought to the Lord through your giving of the unrighteous mammon. If you keep this money in your hand, it is all unrighteous. However, if you give it to the Lord, it all becomes useful, and you will make good friends of many. This is to fellowship unto the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FELLOWSHIP UNTO THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>First Timothy 6:17 says, &ldquo;Charge those who are rich in the present age not to be high-minded, nor to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God who affords us all things richly for our enjoyment.&rdquo; If you trust in Him, you will receive more riches and also lay a good foundation for your future (v. 19). You must partake of the furtherance of God&rsquo;s move on this earth. There is a great need of the truth. Many people are starving for the truth and many are under darkness. The light of the truth is among us. Who is going out to spread it? We need some full-timers who will drop their jobs, professions, and businesses to go out. However, they still need a living. Therefore, we must have some faithful full-timers to do business, to make gold, to make money to support these ones who go out for the spreading of the kingdom, of God&rsquo;s economy. Furthermore, when they go out, they take nothing from the Gentiles, the heathen (3 John 5-8). You must help them to go on. They are the travelers for the spreading of the kingdom. They need your support for the travel and for their living. I hope that in your training you may have some time to read and speak all these verses to the saints that their eyes may be opened to have a view, according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, of the world situation, their business, and their making of money. Then they will realize that they must not waste one cent, but save every penny for the giving to further the kingdom in God&rsquo;s economy. This is to fellowship unto the gospel.</p>
<p>Philippians 4:15-16 says, &ldquo;And you yourselves also know, Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I went out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the account of giving and receiving but you only; for even in Thessalonica you sent both once and again to my need.&rdquo; What kind of sweet feeling the apostle expressed here! He said this was &ldquo;a fragrant odor, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God&rdquo; (v. 18). Paul did not seek a gift from them (v. 17), but what they gave became a sweet savor for Paul to put on the altar for them. It was not merely something to support him, but it became something increasing to their account. There is an account in the heavenly bank, in which we may have credit or debit. It is merely a low practice to give ten percent. God is not a beggar; do not treat Him as one. You should honor Him as the very bountiful Giver who affords you all the riches. All your riches come from Him. It was and still is up to Him whether you will be rich or not. It is not according to your plan of what you should do and have. You simply must labor day and night. He then will follow your labor to bless you, not for your enterprise, but for the spreading of His kingdom.</p>
<p>If you keep money for your children, you will corrupt them and cause them to be corrupted by the money. I do not mean that we should not take care of our children. We should simply take care of them within a limit and no more. Every parent should do something for his or her children, just as our Father does to us. If we would do nothing for our children, we are not representing our heavenly Father. He takes care of us, but within a proper limit. We should follow our Father to take care of our children according to a limit. Whether the Lord would give me billions of dollars or hundreds of dollars, I would simply take care of my children within a God-ordained limit. All the balance or remainder has to go to my heavenly account for God&rsquo;s kingdom. All the saints need this kind of training.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICAL WAY TO SUPPORT<br />
THE JOB-DROPPING FULL-TIMERS FOR THE INCREASE<br />
AND SPREAD OF CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>I have been considering quite much the practical way to carry out this burden. I considered the practice of the China Inland Mission which was founded by Hudson Taylor. He was a real man of God, but just according to the portion he had in his time. We must remember that the Lord is moving on. However, it is worthwhile for us to go back to compare the various practices. Twenty-eight years ago I visited the People&rsquo;s Church in Toronto, established by Mr. Oswald Smith. Apparently, I was trying to have a sight-seeing tour of the country, but my real heart was to see this famous church. They were famous in sending out missionaries. If they had twenty members, they would send one out for missionary work. I looked at their furniture and the church building. Everything was so old, but very clean and well maintained. There had been no fresh painting for years. They saved nearly every cent for sending one out of twenty members as a missionary. It was a great burden for them to carry, but they did it. That impressed me very much; I could never forget that.</p>
<p>In October of 1984 when I was considering the fact that there was nearly no increase or spreading among us, I went back to Taiwan. The church called a large gathering in a basketball stadium, which was filled with about twelve thousand people. The messages I gave were concerning the increase and spread of Christ and the church. My burden was for this. For years we did not have much increase or the spreading. We nearly remained the same. This caused me to reconsider our way. I considered our way and the ways of others, and I came to a conclusion. In any church out of twenty there must be one who drops his business or profession to take the full-time way to preach and to teach. The nineteen others should do their best regularly, even weekly, to put aside a certain amount of their monthly income for the supporting of such a one. For nineteen to support one would be, humanly speaking, very easy. Each one simply saves five percent of their income. This would be sufficient to support the one who drops his job. This ninety-five percent is the equivalent of a full-time job for the one who drops his job. This will not burden the church. It will be easy. There is a proverb which says, &ldquo;If all the people will lift, it is easy to lift up anything.&rdquo; When the meeting hall in Anaheim was built, the brothers, climbing up the stairway, carried a steel beam weighing close to one ton from the yard and put it upon two steel posts. We were not able to use a crane. Simply with so many hands it was easy to lift that heavy beam.</p>
<p>Charge the dear saints that besides their regular giving to the Lord through the church, they should give an additional five percent of their income every month. Do not do it once a year. It is better to separate the amount for each month into four equal portions and put one portion every Lord&rsquo;s Day into the offering box.</p>
<p>Whether or not in your locality there are these job-dropping full-timers, you should still practice this. In your place there may not be such, yet in other places there may be. In one hall in Taipei full of college students a number will go full-time. But in that hall there are nearly no businessmen, no brothers who have a better job. Yet in another hall there are many rich men, making much money. Very few are college graduates, and none of them would think to drop their job. They should practice to save five percent of their income to take care of those in the other halls, in other churches, and even in other countries. If we are in one accord on the whole earth, the church must practice this, encouraging and charging all the saints each month to designate five percent of their income specifically for supporting the job-dropping full-timers throughout the whole earth. Go back to charge the church in your locality to practice this five percent giving for the furtherance of the gospel, the fellowship unto the gospel.</p>
<p>Do not say that you do not have any job-dropping full-timers. All the churches on the earth have to do this. Leave to the Lord how much will be accomplished, but you must practice the five percent giving. Train everyone among us to practice the putting aside of an extra five percent, putting it aside uniquely for the fellowship unto the gospel. I believe that the Lord will bless this. This is for His spreading. How much He desires to spread through us! But for this spreading today, there is the need of financial support. We do not need to have a fund raising movement. We do not need to send someone to convince all the churches to contribute money. We simply need a regular, weekly practice of giving in this way, designated for the fellowship unto the gospel.</p>
<p>Any gifts should be designated with these words: &ldquo;Fellowship unto the Gospel.&rdquo; Every church should have such a separate &ldquo;Fellowship unto the Gospel&rdquo; account. This way is easy, unique, and universal. The saints could give one fourth of five percent of their monthly income each week. However, if there is no urgent need, they may practice giving monthly.</p>
<p>This has to be practiced for the long run. We mean business. We are now taking a new way to carry out the five points which were very much stressed by Brother Nee in his ministry&mdash;the home gatherings, the functioning of all the members, the knowledge and spread of the truth, the growth in life, and the preaching of the gospel in every way. The key point of this way is that every believer is a full-timer. Some drop their job to preach and teach, while some remain on their job to make money. We must encourage some to drop their jobs. We must also encourage some to make money and separate five percent monthly, purposely for the account of the fellowship unto the gospel.</p><h2 class="head1">DISCERNING THE FULL-TIMERS</h2>
<p>The full-timers will not be considered or discerned by a center. We have no center. We avoid leadership and any centrality of practice. Let every church examine, discern, and make a decision as to whether one is right and proper to drop his job and go full-time. You must be careful about this. Some are like those spoken of in 2 Thessalonians 3:6-15, idle, working at nothing, but busybodies, eating other&rsquo;s food. We do not accept this kind of job-dropping full-timers. We like to see that the young ones in school are good students, all the time making high scores and having characters so straight and right. There must be no sign of any kind of slothfulness or idleness. They must be discerned, even sifted.</p>
<p>The door is not open in a loose way for the job-dropping full-timers. Some lazy ones may consider this as the opportunity to sit, drink coffee, and talk about spiritual things. They would consider that in the United States they have ten thousand supporters, and that they do not need to labor or worry about anything. Although no one would say this, deep in their beings it might be so. We have no center. All the job-dropping full-timers will be discerned, judged, decided upon and sifted by their own respective churches. Therefore, all the elders have to learn something. You have to do the job and make the recommendation. The work will not accept anyone to drop their job to go full-time without the elders&rsquo; recommendation.</p>
<p>If your account for the fellowship unto the gospel would be adequate to support them, that would be wonderful. If it is not, try to fellowship with other churches. Those churches who have a surplus in this account should fellowship with other churches, letting them know that they have a surplus to take care of the job-dropping full-timers in other churches. Do not say that because a certain full-timer is not working for the church in your locality, you would not care for his support. This is wrong. Whether or not he is the one determined, discerned, examined, judged, sifted, and eventually recommended by you, you must take care of his support. Whether he will be working in your locality or will go abroad to Thailand you must support him. I hope that some day many from Taiwan will go to Thailand. I do not have the time to pour out what is on my heart. I hope that Taiwan will be taken. Then all the saints from Taiwan can go to Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and even to India, Ceylon, Pakistan, and the Arabian countries. This is all on my heart. Do not be narrow. We are taking a new way to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>I advise you all and even I beg you all to practice this. If at the present time you do not have that many job-dropping full-timers, then keep a savings account for the fellowship unto the gospel in the future. Perhaps one day a good number will go out from the United States to the Philippines. If fifty would go to the Philippines under my instruction, they could conquer the entire country for Christ and the church.</p>
<p>We are short of personnel and we are short of financial support. Therefore, we must encourage the lovers of the Lord Jesus in our locality to drop their jobs to go full-time. They do not need to worry. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is here, and so many faithful lovers of the Lord Jesus would give their money. Now we do have a practical practice. Each one would put aside five percent for this purpose. The number one thing is to encourage all the lovers of the Lord to drop their jobs if possible. Secondly, we must encourage all the money-making full-timers doing business to spend every penny for the Lord&rsquo;s spread. If we do these two things, and if we all would take the same way in one accord by prayer, the Spirit, and the Word, the Lord will have a great success through us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOW WORKERS IN THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>Third John 8 says, &ldquo;We therefore ought to support such, that we may become fellow workers in the truth.&rdquo; The ones spoken of here are the travelers for the preaching of the gospel and the teaching of the truth (vv. 5-7). Everyone who is a money-making full-timer may be a fellow worker in the truth. Although it seems that they do not do anything for the preaching of the gospel and the teaching, they still could be fellow workers by giving every penny to support these preachers and teachers who go out.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">SPREADING THE GOSPEL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:18-20; Mark 16:15-20; Luke 24:44-49; Acts 1:8</h1>
<p>To spread the gospel is to preach the gospel. To preach the gospel is a very common, popular term among Christians. Concerning the preaching of the gospel in the Scripture reading in Matthew, Mark, and Luke, I do not quote one verse, but a section. Why? Because many today in Christianity have isolated the so-called preaching of the gospel from its context. They seem to make the preaching of the gospel something different from the proper preaching instructed, revealed, and ordained by the Lord. I want to quote all the context of these three verses regarding the gospel preaching in the first three synoptic Gospels and also fellowship concerning Acts 1:8.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MATTHEW 28:18-20</h2>
<p>Matt. 28:18-19 says, &ldquo;And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying,...Go therefore and disciple all the nations.&rdquo; At this juncture, Jesus came in resurrection. He had spent forty days with the disciples in His resurrection. At the end of those forty days He came and spoke to them saying, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth&rdquo; (v. 18). This simple sentence indicates that the speaker, Jesus our Lord, is not a simple person. All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Him. He is now the Lord of the universe because He has been given the authority in the entire universe. At this time, this One came in His resurrection, not in His flesh, nor in the natural form of a man in the flesh, to declare that all the authority both in heaven and on earth had been given to Him. Based upon this declaration He gave them the commandment, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations.&rdquo; It is not just to preach the gospel to make them believers but to make them disciples. There is a big difference between believers and disciples. The word disciples in the English language is very much related to discipline. A believer may have little to do with any kind of discipline, but only discipline can create a disciple.</p>
<p>By this you can see that many Christians quote this verse in a shallow way, making others &ldquo;heaven-goers,&rdquo; rather than disciples. To disciple the nations means to make them disciples, to make them persons who belong to God in Christ and who are disciplined all the time. This includes a lot. It is not merely to preach the gospel to save people, but to bring in people through the gospel and to make them disciples through much discipline.</p>
<p>Many Christians argue about the matter of baptism in speaking about Matthew 28:19. Is this the baptism with water or the baptism with the Holy Spirit? If this is baptism with the water, should the water be hot water, cold water, salt water, natural water, water in the pool, water in the river, water in the sea, water in the bathtub, or what kind of water? I read only one person that stressed being baptized into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Vincent in his <em>Word Studies of the New Testament</em> gives a marvelous and excellent interpretation when he comes to Matthew 28:19. He says that the name denotes the Person. The name is the sum total of the divine Being, equivalent to His Person. To baptize into the name means to baptize into the Person. To baptize the disciples into the name of the Triune God means to baptize them into the Person of the very Triune God.</p>
<p>Vincent also tells us about the small preposition &ldquo;into,&rdquo; not in. Into indicates a kind of union (see note 19<sup>4</sup> in Matthew 28&mdash;Recovery Version). Vincent gave us these good points, but few readers have ever practiced this. We should charge the full-timers to go out to preach the gospel by &ldquo;discipling the nations, baptizing them into...&rdquo; The Lord Jesus does not say, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations <em>and</em> baptize...&rdquo; There is no conjunction and, so discipling and baptizing are not two separate items. To &ldquo;disciple all the nations, baptizing&rdquo; means that to disciple is to baptize, to baptize is to disciple. Baptizing is a modifier modifying the predicate disciple, telling us how to disciple. By what way do we disciple them? By putting them into the Triune God.</p>
<p>We should train our young full-timers to realize that our way to go out is to disciple all the nations by baptizing them or by putting them into the Triune God. In our gospel preaching we need to tell them who the Triune God is, who the Father is, who the Son is, and who the Spirit is. If we do not tell people about the Triune God, about the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, how could they realize that to be baptized is to be baptized into such a One? Many today make baptism just a ritual for people to enter into another religion. The Chinese regarded baptism as a ritual to take a Western religion. Their thought was that baptism was a kind of initiation for entering a new club. Most of the Chinese who were baptized had no idea about the Triune God.</p>
<p>In Matthew 28:20 there is another participle&mdash;teaching. Baptizing and teaching modify the predicate &ldquo;disciple.&rdquo; It is not so simple to go out to preach the gospel. To preach the gospel is not just to tell people that they are sinners, that Jesus is the Son of God who came to be their Savior, who died on the cross for their sins, and that when they believe in Him they will be forgiven and go to heaven. This is too low.</p>
<p>We have to tell the listeners who the Triune God is, the One into whom we intend to put them. Our preaching must have the intention to put the listeners into the Triune God. We have to tell them who the Triune God is, the substances of the Triune God. This is higher preaching. We have to use teachings as in verse 20, &ldquo;Teaching them to observe all things, whatever I commanded you; and behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age.&rdquo; The last part of the verse is a promise. If we do this kind of preaching, surely He will be with us and we will enjoy His presence. He will be with us until the consummation of the age. This promise for us to enjoy is based upon the foregoing one and one-half verses.</p>
<p>This is a gospel that comprises the entire New Testament economy of God. To disciple the nations as one act needs two things to modify it. First, there is baptizing the people into the Triune God. Second, there is teaching them all the things we have been taught. This is the New Testament economy of God, and the One who was speaking this was the One in resurrection to whom all the authority in heaven and earth had been given. Putting all these things together you could see a clear picture of the entire New Testament economy of God. This is the kind of gospel we have to go out to preach and by which we disciple the nations, putting our listeners into the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head1">MARK 16:15-20</h2>
<p>Translators generally agree that the best manuscripts do not have Mark 16:9-20, but they also agree to leave this portion here. Verse 15 reads, &ldquo;And He said to them, Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all the creation.&rdquo; The Chinese version renders &ldquo;to all the creation&rdquo; as &ldquo;to all the people.&rdquo; Of course, all the creation includes the people, but to all the people does not include all the creation. We have to realize when we go out to preach the gospel of the New Testament economy of God concerning this all-inclusive Person, the heaven and all the demons will be listening. Thus, we are not only preaching to human beings, but we are also preaching to all the creation. Christ&rsquo;s redemption not only comprises human beings but the entire creation. In Colossians 1:20 we are told Christ&rsquo;s redemption comprises everything. Hebrews 2:9 tells us He died to taste death on behalf of everything, not only for everyone but for everything of God&rsquo;s creation because God&rsquo;s entire creation was lost (see note 9<sup>2</sup> in Hebrews 2&mdash;Recovery Version). Therefore, it has to be redeemed, brought back through Christ&rsquo;s redemption. When we preach such a gospel to human beings, we actually preach this gospel to all the creatures.</p>
<p>Verses 16-18 say, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will pick up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it shall by no means harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will be well.&rdquo; Verse 17 says that these signs, the following signs, will accompany those who believe, not those who preach. The one who believes will cast out demons, speak with new tongues, pick up serpents, and if they drink anything deadly, it shall by no means harm them. They will lay hands on the sick, and they will be well.</p>
<p>Of course, the last &ldquo;they&rdquo; refers to the sick&mdash;the sick will be well. This should be a part of our preaching, telling the ones who believe that they can do these few things. In the Lord&rsquo;s name they can cast out demons, in the Lord&rsquo;s name they will speak with new tongues, in the Lord&rsquo;s name they will pick up serpents, and if they drink anything deadly, it shall by no means harm them. In the Lord&rsquo;s name, they will lay hands on the sick, and they will be well. We must exercise our faith. These are small and minor things compared with putting people into the Triune God. Tell them that after they believe signs will follow them. As a new beginner, they need to exercise their faith to lay hands on the sick.</p>
<p>Most Christians think that the preachers, the evangelists, do all these miracles. The Lord does not say this. He says, &ldquo;Those who believe.&rdquo; We have to train the full-timers to go out this way. Tell the new believers that they are given the right to lay hands on the sick. This shows us that we should not take any portion of the Word for granted. You have to read and re-read it, reconsidering it word by word; then you will get something new.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LUKE 24:44-49</h2>
<p>In Luke 24:44, the Lord Jesus, as the One who was in resurrection and who had been given all the authority in heaven and on earth, said to His disciples, &ldquo;These are My words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all the things must be fulfilled which have been written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me.&rdquo; The law, the prophets, and the psalms are the three sections of the entire Old Testament. The Savior&rsquo;s word here unveils that the entire Old Testament was a revelation of Him, the all-inclusive Christ, who is the center of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>Luke 24:45 says, &ldquo;Then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures.&rdquo; This is why I charged those young full-timers to spend a half a day to dwell in the Recovery Version, to study all the Scriptures. When we go out to preach the all-inclusive gospel, we must be equipped and qualified. Otherwise, we will be like many isolated Christian preachers. We need to understand the Scriptures and also we need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, open our understanding. Open our mind that we may be able to understand the Scriptures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke 24:46 says, &ldquo;And He said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day.&rdquo; We have to teach others the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ. This portion of the Word implies all the main things of God&rsquo;s New Testament revelation.</p>
<p>Verse 47 continues the Lord&rsquo;s word to the disciples, &ldquo;And that repentance for forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His name...&rdquo; His name implies a lot. You should tell people whose name this is. The name denotes a Person. Who is the person? This requires you to tell all the aspects concerning Christ. You have to preach the all-inclusive Christ that they may receive the forgiveness of sins. It is not forgiveness of sins alone, but it is the forgiveness of sins in His name. This is like baptizing into the name (Matt. 28:19). The name denotes the Triune God, and this name here denotes the all-inclusive Christ. Get yourself so familiar with all the aspects of the all-inclusive Christ. Otherwise, you can never preach an adequate gospel. Therefore, I insist on training the young full-timers for at least a half year, so they will have an adequate revelation concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and concerning the all-inclusive Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord spoke further, &ldquo;You are witnesses of these things. And behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you, stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high&rdquo; (vv. 48-49). We have to claim the experience of being clothed with power from on high. This being clothed with power from on high transpired on the day of Pentecost. Today we do not need to wait for this because the baptism in the Spirit has transpired. We even do not need to pray for this, however, we surely have to pray for our experience. This is why I stress so much that all the young full-timers going out must experience the baptism in the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">ACTS 1:8</h2>
<p>Acts 1:8, a very brief yet all-inclusive verse, says, &ldquo;But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth.&rdquo; We have to thank the Lord that the Holy Spirit has come upon us already. Now our need is to seek the very experience of this. Verse 8 does not say that &ldquo;you shall be my preachers,&rdquo; but that &ldquo;you shall be my witnesses.&rdquo; You may preach something which you have never seen or experienced, but to witness is to be an eyewitness. You have seen the things, experienced the things, tasted the things, and enjoyed the things. All the full-timers need to be helped to know the Lord Jesus, to experience the all-inclusive Christ. Then they can go out to be His witnesses, not merely the preachers. Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the remotest part of the earth is a good sequence and corresponds to our neighborhood, the surrounding places, the places at a distance, and the farthest places.</p>
<p>We must stress very much that every church must be a gospel-spreading and truth-teaching church. This is our commission. Every church and every saint should be such a one. Every full-timer, including the job-dropping one and the money-making one, must be one who preaches the gospel and teaches the truth in his neighborhood, among his relatives, classmates, schoolmates, friends, and colleagues. Our Jerusalem is in our town, in our city, in our village. Then we go out to the surrounding places; then we go out to places at a distance; then we would even go to other states and other countries, even to the remotest part of the earth. We must have such a spirit!</p>
<p>By seeing this we all could realize we are far behind. Therefore, we have to endeavor to stir up all the churches to be this kind of church and all the saints to be this kind of person. By what way? By being in one accord. All the saints in one locality are in one accord, all the churches in one country are in one accord, and all the churches in all of the countries around the globe should just be in one accord. We should have this one accord. We must claim this, insist this, and require this. We do not agree that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there would be another accord. It should just be in one accord, not by gimmicks but by prayer to receive more power of the Spirit. Our trust is in the Spirit and the Word.</p>
<p>We must stir up every saint, whether job-dropping or money-making, to be such persons who preach the gospel and teach the truth, regardless of how busy they are. Regardless of how busy you might be as perhaps a bank manager, you still have the time to talk to your neighbors, your colleagues, your friends, relatives, in-laws, and cousins. There are a lot of persons in your &ldquo;Jerusalem.&rdquo; We have to train the saints, to remind them again and again, not just once for all. Preaching the gospel and teaching the truth includes the one accord, much prayer, the power of the Spirit, and all the riches of the holy Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE PROPER LEADING<br />
IN THE ONE BIBLICAL WAY</h2>
<p>I hate to see the repetition of Christianity in the recovery. We should drop the different ways and different practices and take one way, the biblical way. This way is the way which is fully revealed and given as a pattern in the New Testament. This is why I have the boldness to tell you that this is the proper leading, because this is the way revealed and illustrated in the New Testament.</p>
<p>In 1950 Brother Nee brought a big revival to Hong Kong, and he asked me to be there. One morning in the conference of all the elders and co-workers during the time of revival he brought me in and gave a word purposely, saying, &ldquo;Witness, according to the authority the Lord has given you, make arrangement for all the services of the elders, the deacons, and the co-workers.&rdquo; After saying this, he stopped. Shortly after this, he left. That was the way he did things. Then one night he came back and he asked me to give a testimony. I said, &ldquo;No. As long as your presence is here, I quit. If you do not say anything, I will not say anything. If you sit there, I will sit there. If you want me to say something, you leave. Your presence is first.&rdquo; I fully realized that in one car there cannot be two drivers. Who should be first? The first should be first. I was not first. I knew where I was and who I was. Today the problem among us is that most do not know where they are and who they are. We must hate that we would repeat the poor history of Christianity.</p><h2 class="head1">RECOGNIZING, RESPECTING,<br />
AND REGARDING A CHURCH EVEN THOUGH IT<br />
MAY NOT ACCEPT THE PRESENT NEW WAY</h2>
<p>Any church which is a genuine local church standing on the ground of oneness and recognizing the other local churches as churches in one fellowship is a church, regardless of whether or not that church accepts the present new way. If a church chooses not to practice the new way, that church does not cease to be a church. To practice this would be sectarian. We do not practice this. We practice the all-inclusive church life.</p>
<p>We realize that if the Lord is to go on to make His recovery prevailing, there is no other way but this present move. However, if a church meeting properly would not take this present new way, then we still respect them as a proper church. We would still keep the fellowship with them, even though they do not feel the need of the new way. Even if they would oppose, we would not reject them. When they say that they are no longer a church in the recovery, then that is their cutting off the fellowship, not us. Do not cut off any church who would not be agreeable to the present new move. If a church opposes a little and yet still recognizes all the other churches on this globe for the fellowship in the Body, we would not only recognize but also respect and regard them as a genuine church among the many local churches. We not only like to, but we also will try our best to maintain proper fellowship with them. Do not be sectarian.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT PROMOTING SPEAKING IN TONGUES</h2>
<p>I do not like the promotion of tongue-speaking, but I do not reject the genuine tongue-speaking. If anyone would still speak in tongues, that is quite all right. However, for the good of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and for the good of so many saints, I would ask them to please not promote it. I have the experience, the right, and the position to say this because I saw and experienced the damage that tongue-speaking causes.</p>
<p>The present tongue-speakers cannot deny that there are false prophesies, as well as a lot of other false things. Therefore, I do not like to see a promotion of tongue-speaking in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. But I do not like to practice sectarianism or be narrow. We will still receive the brothers who speak in tongues, yet we will beg them not to promote it. Not only with tongue-speaking, but with other items, our attitude is the same. As long as something is not sinful or immoral, we do not reject it. Yet if something is not so profitable to the church life, we would beg the saints not to promote it. We do not reject, and we like to exercise restraint. We would use the way of begging and fellowshipping. We would not give anyone a command to stop their promotion. We like to go to them, sit down with them, and in a loving way with a very humble spirit fellowship about these things, hoping that they would realize the real situation. The real profit for everyone concerned may be that they would exercise some restriction to their promotion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT FORMING PARTIES</h2>
<p>We also do not like to form parties. I do not like to hear some say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I stand with you.&rdquo; I do not like anyone to stand with me in order to have a party. I have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for over one half of a century. Many can testify for me that in the Far East, on Mainland China, in Taiwan, and in this country, I never tried to make anyone side with me to make a party. Do not make parties. It may be okay to be &ldquo;the three hundred of Gideon,&rdquo; but do not form a party. The three hundred with Gideon still loved the children of Israel and fought the battle for them. They never considered themselves as a separate party. That would have been a division. We do not agree with division. We must have a proper attitude and a good spirit toward all the brothers and the sisters. Whether they would take this new way or not, we do not change our attitude. Our attitude must be a loving attitude. We simply must be faithful to what we have seen and fight the battle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF A TRAINING CENTER AT LIN-KO</h2>
<p>Regarding the building of a new training center in Taiwan at Lin-ko, I am a little concerned that you may go to an extreme in your zeal, thinking that you all should quit your job, give up your family and the church, and just go to Lin-ko. Please do not do things that way. You still have to take care of your job and your church. We realize that what is going on in Lin-ko is something of the Lord. Securing that property and completing the accompanying project have very much to do with the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It will bring in a lot of benefits not only for Taiwan but also for His move on the whole earth.</p>
<p>It is altogether needed that all the churches around the globe would share in the financial support. This I encourage you to do, but not by forgetting about the local needs. This is not right. We have to be moderate in all things. All of the time we have to be balanced and restricted. We are encouraged and excited in many ways, yet we are moderate and balanced. Exercise your wisdom by observing the situation not only in your own locality, but also for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery on the whole globe. Based upon this kind of view, I believe the Lord, the Spirit, will lead you to participate in the financial support to a certain extent. I cannot give you the extent. Only the Lord would lead you. This financial support is not only needed, but also it is a nice thing, a beauty in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Suppose all the churches in Brazil would send seven hundred dollars to that project. How beautiful it would be! How good it would be that all the churches in Spain would send something. That would be marvelous! It would be a beauty. I would like to see this, but I do not like to see you forgetting everything, and putting everything, even every drop of blood and every penny into Lin-ko. I reject that. I say no to that. Do not go the crazy way.</p>
<p>What we are able to build at Lin-ko depends upon the Lord&rsquo;s leading and how much cooperation all the churches will render to that project. In principle we will hire the experienced contractors to do the foundation work and the framework for us. These two parts we could not do by ourselves due to safety factors. We must have a solid foundation properly laid by the experts. We have to spend a lot of money for this. We will do the rest by ourselves. We need a lot of manpower. By then we may have over five hundred young full-timers, of whom at least half will be brothers. We could use the sisters for painting and other projects. The full-timers will do the rest of the work in order that they may learn how to build meeting halls for the spreading of the church life in different villages. Then after this no hall will be contracted to anybody. All the young workers will go out to build the halls for themselves and by themselves. This is our intention. There is surely the need of a lot of experienced ones from the United States to go to Taiwan. The Chinese young people need some instructions. We need at least fifty foremen to take the lead. I think all the foreman should be from the United States. All the brothers who go will be there to be the foremen taking the lead in every part of the construction process. Do not go to Lin-ko in a rush. Go there by much fellowshipping and much prayer. Your action should not damage your local church at all. However, it may delay and it will delay. This is unavoidable. The delay is worthwhile because we are going to carry out a big project for the move of the Lord today on the earth. Pray for this.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING ONE WITH THE MINISTRY</h2>
<p>I received a long letter of twenty-seven pages on the morning of our final day of fellowship in this elders&rsquo; training. The first page is the contents of the letter and all the rest of the twenty-six pages are signatures. All of the signatures are designated from the different churches. After reading the contents, I am so grateful to the four hundred and nineteen brothers who signed it. The contents of this letter follow along with my letter of response to the brothers who signed it.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BASIC PRINCIPLES IN THE ELDERSHIP<br />
AND THE TRAINING OF THE FULL-TIMERS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">RECONSIDERING THE ELDERSHIP IN EACH LOCALITY</h2>
<p>In this chapter we want to fellowship some principles in the matter of handling the eldership in the churches. The Lord has given us a new start with a new way to practice the church life. A number of churches have been existing in the United States for over twenty years and the eldership has gone through very much. In a good sense, it has been tested quite much. According to the past, the present elders should have some realization of the condition of the eldership in their locality. Has the eldership in your place been prevailing? Some of the elders may have become a little old. You also may have discovered some younger brothers in your locality who are not in the eldership but who may be more useful in taking care of the church&rsquo;s leading. Based upon these facts, the situation of the eldership in your locality should be reconsidered. I do not have the time to go to every place to help the arrangement of the eldership. Almost every church in the United States has been fully established and even founded. Thus, in a sense the elders in each locality are quite capable of helping the eldership there.</p>
<p>You have to consider the eldership in your locality according to these three points: (1) should the present elders resign or not, and is this necessary or profitable? (2) are there some new ones who are younger that might be quite useful in the eldership? (3) if the present elders remain (all or some), do some brothers need to be added who would be helpful and useful in the eldership? Because we are honest and we are for the Lord&rsquo;s business, for the profit of the church, and for the recovery as a whole, we should have a sober consideration and proper evaluation of the need of the eldership in our locality. You as an elder need to consider whether or not you are a real profit in your locality. My feeling and observation regarding the eldership in your place may not be that thorough because I have not been there for some time. I would ask all the elders throughout the United States to consider the eldership in their locality. Some of the present elders may feel honestly, fairly, and rightly that they are not so useful in the eldership. It may be that you would be more useful if you were not in the eldership. If this is the case and this is the feeling, it is better for you to take the initiative to resign. You should know the situation of the church in your locality and the real situation of the eldership. You also should know if it will be profitable for you to remain in the eldership or more profitable for you to stay away from the eldership. If you decide to stay away from the eldership in this light, this is something beautiful.</p>
<p>Any kind of office or post for an organization or other concern usually has a term that goes with it. The President of the United States has a four-year term, a Congressman has a two-year term, and a Senator has a six-year term. But there is no hint in the New Testament which tells us how long a brother should remain in the eldership. The only point we can find is in 1 Timothy 5:19-20 which indicates that the saints could appeal the matter of a sinning elder to the appointing apostles. The apostles do have the standing to deal with a wrongdoing elder. Even in 1 Timothy 5, however, Paul does not tell us what should be done with the wrongdoing elder after he is rebuked and dealt with.</p>
<p>Humanly speaking, some elders who become more experienced will be more useful. But on the other hand, human beings may not be so strong, so healthy, or so capable for a certain post as when they were younger. As elders who love the Lord and who love the recovery, we should consider the situation of the eldership in our local church. Only the elders know the real situation in their locality. The church life is like a family and the elders should be the fathers. At a certain time, a father should know whether it would be better to let his son take care of the family. The emperor of a certain country may be too old to adequately carry out his commission and duty, while his son would be more capable. Whether this should be done or not depends upon the emperor&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>In this matter the elders should neither be polite nor be afraid of anything, but they should be honest. This fellowship should help all the elders to reconsider the eldership in their respective localities. Whether we stay in the eldership or stay away depends upon the real profit of our staying or not staying. What is the best for the profit of the church? I do not think anyone can make this decision on your behalf. Only you can do this.</p>
<p>You may have realized that there are some younger ones in your locality who are really much better. If so, you should give in. This is not a matter of politeness but a matter of whether or not the church will receive more profit. If you feel that it would be more profitable for you to stay, then you have to stay. You all need to forget about your ambition, your politeness, or any other motives. You should only take care of the profit of the church in your locality. We need to do this by really meaning business with the Lord because we like to see that the new start in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will be much blessed. The key and the hinge to this new start is the eldership. Regardless of how much we will be in the one accord, if the eldership is not so proper, that will be a big minus. We realize that we are not that strong, but something better could be worked out. We have to admit that mostly no church is up to the standard, so let us admit our shortage. However, according to what we have and what we are, we need to make a decision concerning what the best way is for the eldership in our locality.</p>
<p>Some of the leading brothers have been in their locality a long time and it might be more profitable for them to go to another locality and let some new ones take the lead in the leadership. They could go to another locality to have a new church started or go to another local church. Then some younger ones can begin to bear the responsibility of the practical leadership. There is also the need for some to take the lead among the Chinese-speaking saints.</p>
<p>In some localities, the eldership really needs some help. A brother who is in the lead may be a &ldquo;floating&rdquo; person. He may not be in his locality that much and yet he may be taking the lead there. It may be more profitable for him to travel and to take care of his burden with the ministry. Thus, the eldership in his locality will need strengthening.</p>
<p>The loss we have suffered in the eldership in some localities has been due to the dissenting. Some brothers may have become good elders, but they were dissenting. Their dissenting was mostly due to their character. They have a dissenting character. It is hard for them to be one in anything. Dissension has eaten up these brothers. We would like to see them perfected, but it seems that there has been no way. As a result, we suffered the loss. These dear brothers were the right persons in their age (in their early forties) and they did have a history in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I say this to warn all of us. We all have to kill our own dissension and condemn it. Dissension is a big eater. It has somewhat eaten up the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>We may need to bring some younger brothers into the eldership, but we also need to take Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Timothy 3:6&mdash;&ldquo;Not a new convert, lest being blinded with pride he fall into the judgment of the Devil.&rdquo; Novices should not bear the eldership. This may open the door for the subtle one to seduce them into human pride. Then it will damage them. Not one among the eighty elders appointed in Taipei is under thirty. To be under thirty is too young. Even the Lord Jesus began to minister when He was thirty (Luke 3:23). In the priesthood an apprentice should be twenty-five (Num. 8:24) and the full priesthood is realized at the age of thirty. Thirty is the full age for God&rsquo;s service (Num. 4:3, 35, 39, 43, 47).</p><h2 class="head1">KEEPING OURSELVES FROM BEING INVOLVED<br />
IN ANY PROBLEM IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>During the eighteen years that I was with the co-workers under Brother Nee&rsquo;s leadership, I never caused any problem nor did I get involved with any problem. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I was a pure person. Brother Nee had two great crises during that time&mdash;one was due to his marriage and the other one was due to his pharmaceutical business. I was the main one to get the situation solved in both of these matters. The last time forced Brother Nee to be away from his ministry for six years. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I went to Shanghai and that brought in a situation which enabled Brother Nee to return to his ministry. A revival was brought in mainly through messages I gave on the tree of life. Nearly all those who did not feel happy with Brother Nee repented. No one proposed or advised this, but they all repented to Brother Nee.</p>
<p>My point is this&mdash;with the elders, the co-workers, and all the brothers, the basic need is to keep yourself from being involved in any problem in the church life. We all must learn to be wise not to create any trouble or to speak a light word concerning anyone in the recovery. We just say something positive.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING RESTRICTED IN ONE PUBLICATION</h2>
<p>One thing that has caused the Lord&rsquo;s recovery trouble is the fact that we have different publications. If we mean business for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must avoid any kind of involvement in problems. When we were on mainland China, only Brother Nee had a publication, and the Gospel Room belonged solely and uniquely to him. He asked me to help in the publication work. I did write some books, among which were a book on the genealogy of Christ, a translation of part of Pember&rsquo;s <em>Earth&rsquo;s Earliest Ages,</em> and some books on the kingdom of the heavens. I never published anything by myself. I always mailed my manuscript to the Gospel Room, which was under Brother Nee and his helper. It was up to their discernment whether my manuscript should be published or not. I liked to have my writings checked as to whether there might be some inaccuracy in the truth. It is not a small matter to write a book that expounds the kingdom of the heavens. I liked my material to pass through their checking. This helped and protected me. Brother Yu, the eye specialist, translated some of the mystical books, but he did not publish anything. We only had one publication. Everything was published through Brother Nee&rsquo;s Gospel Room because the publication is really the trumpeting. The sounding of our trumpet is not just in the verbal message but more in the publication.</p>
<p>I hate to see that some of the brothers would try to publish something by copying my points mixed with their &ldquo;spices&rdquo; and their &ldquo;color.&rdquo; Why do they need to put out some points from my writings in this way? Brother Nee taught us concerning the kingdom of the heavens. I received the basic knowledge from his teaching, but he never expounded on it very much; he simply gave a sketch. It was I who from 1936 began to expound upon the sketch given to me by Brother Nee. After I published my exposition, Brother Nee admired it and told me personally that it was very good.</p>
<p>I hope that some of you brothers would do much development and expounding of all the messages I give. Do not merely speak some points, adding your own &ldquo;color&rdquo; and &ldquo;spices.&rdquo; This changes the taste. It damages my messages. You must receive the ability to expound all these things. I am not narrow. I would like to see that all of you will be great servants used by God. How wonderful that would be. But I do not like to see that some would merely repeat what I have said, pretending that it is their work with their spices and color.</p>
<p>It bothers me that some brothers among us still put out publications. According to my truthful observation there is no new light or life supply there. They may contain some biblical doctrines, but any point of life or light has been adopted from the publications of Living Stream Ministry. There is nearly no item of life or light that has not been covered by our publications. Based upon this fact, what is the need for these brothers to put out their publications? Because all the publications are mine, it is hard for me to speak such a word. But I am forced to tell the truth. By putting out your own publication, you waste your time and money. You waste the money given by the saints, and you waste their time in reading what you publish. Where is the food, the life supply, and the real enlightenment in the other publications among us? Be assured that there is definitely at least one major revelation in every Living Stream Ministry publication.</p>
<p>I was burdened to publish the Life-study Messages to stress the matter of life because this matter has been neglected, missed, and even lost to the uttermost in today&rsquo;s Christianity. In most of the commentaries and expositions there is not much of life. Even the term Life-study is a new term. I have used this term for thirty-two years. In 1954 and 1955 I finished a Life-study on the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation in Taipei.</p>
<p>This does not mean that I am so capable or so knowledgeable. It all depends upon whether or not our sovereign Lord has given you this portion. Even though I wrote some books in mainland China, I never dared to publish anything by myself. I do not like to have another sounding. Our sounding must be one, so we must be restricted in one publication. My intention in calling a writers&rsquo; conference was to encourage you to write something, but not in the way that came out. This fellowship may preserve and protect us from doing things lawlessly.</p>
<p>If some localities would have gone the proper way of the recovery, using all the materials of the ministry, their number would have increased greatly. Some are wasting their time by writing and publishing their own material. This is not their portion. I would like to see that many brothers had this portion with the riches of truth. This would be marvelous and wonderful, but this is our problem today. I advise all of you to take care of this matter. You have to swallow up the dissension. Do not let dissension eat you up.</p>
<p>I hope this fellowship will render some help to all the churches. Take these principles, pray before the Lord, and consider the real situation in your locality. Then you can make some adjustment of the eldership.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TRAINING OF THE FULL-TIMERS</h2>
<p>The training of the young full-timers is needed. Whatever we do, we should not be that confident or contented. We still need to hold an attitude that we are learning. We like to be improved and adjusted. I hope that the brothers who have the burden to take care of the training of the young full-timers do it in this way. I told the saints in Taiwan from the very beginning that we were in the &ldquo;lab.&rdquo; We needed to try things to see what would happen. I did not have the confidence that anything was absolutely right or would really work. If it did not work, we should change and improve. Thank the Lord that most of the things we raised up did work so well. I hope that you brothers would take the same kind of attitude and have the same kind of spirit to do the trainings of the full-timers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Learning How to Contact the Lord</h2>
<p>The next very crucial thing we have to train the full-timers in is that they must learn how to contact the Lord. Every day they must have a proper time to contact the Lord. Everyone must have a private time to pray to the Lord, to have a direct, private, personal contact with the Lord Himself. In our contact we should not pray for so many things, but we need to open to Him to be enlightened, exposed, and judged. We need to exhort them to have some direct dealing with the Lord. This is the way for them to grow up in life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Getting into the Word</h2>
<p>We must also help them get into the Word. The best reference books for the young ones to study are the Recovery Version with the notes and the Life-study Messages. If they still have time, they can get into the cross references. If they use this material, they will get into the proper knowledge of God&rsquo;s New Testament revelation. We must train the saints to get into this material to have themselves equipped with the proper understanding of God&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building Up Their Character</h2>
<p>One basic thing we like to train our young people in is their character. We have a little book with thirty aspects of human character. It is worthwhile to train them in this way. I consider this as something basic. One morning in Taipei I dropped in on the full-timers for about one hour, charging them to build up their character. They were wondering what I meant. Then I began to point out specific things. One brother&rsquo;s necktie was the wrong color, and the way he put it on was wrong and loose. I told them to look at the way they combed their hair, the way their shoes were not shined, and the color of socks they put on. I told them that not wearing a necktie was a sign of their bad character. Whatever such a person says to others will not be regarded. In a bank every teller is required to dress quite well because he is representing the bank in his contact with the public. If the young ones who go out are properly dressed with a proper haircut and are very polite, neat, and straight, they are the right persons. The listeners respect this kind of person and regard him regardless of what he says. Whatever he says, they want to listen to him. Another person may wear a blue shirt with a very strange necktie that does not match in color. His tie distracts people&rsquo;s eyes. When he talks to them, they have no heart to listen. They would only be distracted to look at the tie he is wearing. This becomes a big embarrassment to his speaking.</p>
<p>The full-timers in Taipei were convinced by this fellowship and everyone looked much better the next day. They all even improved the combing of their hair. Some began to comb their hair in a good way but later their old character came back. I told the saints that if they did not build up their character, they could never read the Bible properly. A loose person in character could never understand the Bible in the right way.</p>

<p>We also have to warn them strictly and strongly to not be alone with a member of the opposite sex. Their contact should only be for the work or other necessary purposes. They must be very careful and we must warn them. We have seen a number of young people who had a good beginning get snared by their youthful lusts. The unrestrained contact between the males and females in this present age is terrible. It is an abomination in the eyes of God. The great amount of fornication in the United States frustrates the Lord&rsquo;s blessing this country. For one young male to stay in a room with another female is absolutely wrong. To travel together is also against the principle. We even prohibit the young trainees from giving a ride to someone their age of the opposite sex. Then they will be preserved.</p>

The simple way for the full-timers to take is to learn how to present the printed pages of the ministry and to speak them. If you want to train them in the skill of teaching and preaching, teach them how to use these printed pages.</p></body></html>
