All Redeemed Things and Making Them New</h2>
<p>Everything that was redeemed through Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross will participate in the coming restoration. Redeemed creation will not share God&rsquo;s life, but it will be delivered out of the corruption of the old creation into glory. This is according to the principle of death and resurrection. The ultimate restoration of all things will come with the appearing of the new heaven and the new earth. The new heaven and new earth will come from the restored old heaven and old earth. This is also according to the principle of death and resurrection. On the side of termination and judgment, the old heaven and old earth will pass away (2 Pet. 3:10-12), but on the side of redemption and restoration, the old heaven and old earth will be restored to become the new heaven and new earth (v. 13; Rev. 21:1).</p>
<p>On the side of termination and judgment, we have been terminated on the cross, but on the side of redemption and the impartation of life, we have become the new creation by passing through death and resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3; 2 Cor. 5:17). Even though we are of the old creation, we have been renewed through regeneration, based on the redemption of Christ, to become the new creation. Similarly, all things of the old creation will be renewed and restored through the redemption of the cross to become the new heaven and the new earth. Whereas God&rsquo;s redeemed people will enter into His glory and into the freedom of His glory through the renewing of regeneration, the redeemed things will enter into this glory and freedom through the renewing of restoration (Rom. 8:21).</p>
<p>Even though all things and man were redeemed by the cross, the ultimate issue of the redemption of all things is different from the issue of the redemption of man. Whereas the ultimate issue of the redemption of man gives man God&rsquo;s life and renews man by regeneration, the ultimate issue of the application of redemption to all things will only be restoration by renewal. Although Christ&rsquo;s redemption on the cross restores all things, it does not regenerate all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VICTORY OF THE CROSS</h2>
<p>Negatively, the cross of Christ terminated and redeemed all things. The cross also overcame all things. The cross overcame Satan, who is the ruler of God&rsquo;s enemies, and the demons and evil spirits under him (Gen. 3:15; Heb. 2:14; Col. 2:15). The cross overcame sin (Rom. 8:3), the world (John 12:31), the flesh with its passions and lusts (Gal. 5:24), the old man (Rom. 6:6), and the self (Gal. 2:20). The cross overcame everything that opposes God, contradicts God, hinders God&rsquo;s will, and frustrates God&rsquo;s plan. The cross of Christ is a place of victory. It is the only place of victory in the universe. On the cross Christ triumphed over Satan and over his authority of darkness (Col. 2:15). Hence, Christ can plunder Satan&rsquo;s house and take back those taken captive by Satan (Matt. 12:29). On the cross Christ judged the world, releasing those who were usurped by the world. On the cross Christ dealt with sin, delivering those who were under the bondage of sin. On the cross Christ put the flesh and the old man to death, delivering man from the flesh and the old man. On the cross Christ removed all barriers between man and God, bringing estranged man fully into God&rsquo;s presence, even into God Himself. On the cross Christ overcame everything and accomplished everything.</p>
<p>May we see and receive the victory of the cross, and may we apply it to everything that we encounter. Whoever has the cross has victory. Wherever the cross is, there is victory. The cross is not only a place of victory; it is a place of triumph. The cross is not only victory; it is also a triumph (Col. 2:15). When we receive the cross, we have victory and triumph. May we overcome by the cross and triumph in the cross!</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD CONCERNING<br />
THE FUNCTIONS OF THE CROSS</h2>
<p>There are two negative functions and one positive function of the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Terminating Everything</h2>
<p>The first function of the cross of Christ is to terminate everything. The cross has terminated Satan, sin, sinners, the flesh with its passions and lusts, the old man, and the self. The cross has terminated man. This means that the cross has also terminated Satan, who was mixed with man. By terminating Satan, the cross also terminated the demons and evil spirits who were with him and the world that was under him. By terminating sin, the cross terminated the law as the power of sin (1 Cor. 15:54, 56; Col. 2:14). In terminating the flesh and the self, the cross terminated the law, which the flesh endeavors to obey and the self delights to keep. Everything that opposes God, is contrary to Him, frustrates His eternal plan, and hinders His work of the new creation has been terminated by the cross. Every difficulty and problem in the universe have been dealt with and terminated by the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Redeeming All Things</h2>
<p>The second function of the cross of Christ is to redeem all things. According to His plan, the cross redeemed everything that God created in order to be gained for Christ. God foreordained that man would be for Christ, and He created all things for Christ. The cross redeemed man and all things. It redeemed the earth and all things on the earth, and it redeemed the heavens and everything in the heavens that belongs to God. The cross redeemed everything that God desired to gain but was lost and everything that God prepared for Christ but was corrupted. Everything belonging to God and intended for God in heaven and on earth, whether people or things, was redeemed through the cross.</p>
<p>Redemption follows termination and accompanies termination. The cross of Christ terminated everything in the universe, and it also redeemed all things. The cross separated everything that God does not want from everything that He wants. Christ brought everything in the universe with Him into His all-inclusive death. Whatever God does not want was terminated by His death, and whatever God wants was redeemed by it. On the one hand, the death of the cross terminated everything that was hanging on Christ, and on the other hand, the cross redeemed the things that God desired to gain. The things of God that were terminated by His death were also redeemed through the death of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Imparting Life</h2>
<p>The third function of the cross of Christ is to impart life, to give God&rsquo;s uncreated life to created man. This is the primary function of the cross. The impartation of life is the primary focus of God&rsquo;s eternal plan related to the cross. Termination and redemption are related to the effect of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall on all things. If it were not for the corruption and defilement brought in by Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall, the only function of the cross of Christ would be to impart life. However, due to the consequences of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall, God&rsquo;s eternal plan for the cross of Christ also includes the work of termination and redemption.</p>
<p>Termination and redemption are for imparting life; they are preparatory procedures for imparting life. Termination removes everything in the universe that hinders God from imparting His life into created man, and redemption regains man and all things in the universe for God so that man can be a vessel for the expression of God&rsquo;s life. The cross of Christ terminated everything in the universe that hindered God&rsquo;s life from entering into created man, everything that kept the divine life from being expressed. As vessels to express the life of God, man was redeemed by the cross of Christ so that God&rsquo;s life can be imparted into those who believe. The cross of Christ also restores all things to be a realm for the expression of God&rsquo;s glory. The cross of Christ accomplished God&rsquo;s eternal plan so that God&rsquo;s life can enter into man, and Christ can be expressed through all things.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Cross &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
