BEING DELIVERED FROM MURMURINGS AND REASONINGS</h2>
<p>Philippians 2:12-13 says, &#8220;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.&#8221; In this verse <em>salvation</em> does not refer to the salvation that delivers us from God&#8217;s condemnation and the lake of fire. It refers to being saved daily so that we can be delivered from various situations in our daily living. Verse 14 continues, &#8220;Do all things without murmurings and reasonings.&#8221; For many years I did not understand why verse 14 was written in this way. Verses 12 and 13 speak of something very big, but verse 14 speaks of something quite small. With experience I began to understand that <em>salvation</em> in verse 12 refers to being delivered from murmurings and reasonings. In the original language, <em>murmurings</em> means &#8220;mutterings&#8221; or &#8220;grumblings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although we have heard many messages, we have not been delivered from our murmurings. To murmur is to complain about others. I believe that many of us murmur continuously. If we truly lived in the spirit, our ears would be deaf, our eyes would be blind, and our mouth would be silent. We would not be able to hear, see, or speak; we would only live before the Lord. This would eliminate unnecessary speaking, including criticism and even our prayers of concern, and our spirit would be like a river flowing out to supply others. Our so-called concerns and prayers prove that we are still in the soul, and our criticism of others is a proof that we are not in the spirit. We are not in the spirit even if there is some basis for our criticism. We are even less in the spirit when there is no basis for our criticism. When we are in the spirit, we know nothing and have nothing to say, even though we have a divine view and understanding of a particular matter. This is our condition when we are in the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>Our problem is that we do not realize that genuine spirituality, genuine salvation, is God Himself. When we are murmuring and reasoning about different things in our mind, we are altogether captured by Satan. Whereas he causes us to sin and love the world before we are saved, he also causes us to murmur about others as soon as we touch the Lord.</p>
<p>We cannot cause a seed to grow by studying it; rather, we need to plant the seed in soil in order for it to grow. We have heard many messages about our spirit, but how many of us are living in our spirit? It seems as if we are only studying the spirit. If we were really in our spirit, we would not be going around in circles in our mind. Rather than being in the wilderness, we would be in Canaan and in the Holy of Holies, enjoying the Lord&#8217;s presence. Furthermore, rivers of living water would be flowing out from us, and we would be a supply to others. Thus, there would be no concerns related to others and no need for prayers. I hope that the responsible brothers in all the localities would not stay in their mind, because we cannot bring the saints into a deeper experience of salvation using only our mind. Instead, our spirit must be strong enough to touch the spirit of the saints; then they will experience salvation. We cannot touch others with gospel preaching that is merely eloquent and logical. Although this may touch their mind, salvation depends upon their human spirit being touched by the divine Spirit.</p>
<p>When saints ask me for advice, I usually respond, &#8220;Do not do anything. No method can help you. God is Spirit. You should simply contact Him. You do not need a method; rather, you need to touch Him.&#8221; Some people may respond, saying, &#8220;If this is the case, I do not need to go to a meeting or listen to a message.&#8221; Even if this were true, we would still need to turn to our spirit. We have all fallen into Satan&#8217;s snare; that is, we have fallen into our mind. For this reason Paul tells us to flee into the refuge of our spirit (Heb. 6:18). We all need to flee. Those who think that they have entered into the spirit are the ones who are most in need of fleeing into the spirit. Such ones are self-deluded and self-deceived.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING NO OPINION<br />
WHEN WE LIVE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The real indication of whether we are living in the spirit is not our proclamations, but whether we express our opinions. If we have no opinions when we visit a locality, it is possible that we may be in our spirit at least forty percent of the time. If, however, we have opinions, we are not in the spirit, and we can even quarrel with one another. There are different manifestations of quarreling. For example, two people can disagree to the point of physically fighting with each other, causing bodily injury and involving the police and courts of law. Quarreling, however, can be manifested without any outward manifestation of disagreement. Rather than fighting, two brothers can simply ignore one another. Regardless of how quarreling is manifested, those who quarrel with others are in the mind.</p>
<p>Because of different opinions, it is very difficult for brothers in various places to not quarrel with one another. Some may express their opinion in a refined manner, and others may express theirs in a rough manner. Some may be fleshly and emotional, and others are more peaceful and calm. In any case, everyone is in the mind. May the Lord have mercy on us. When we enter into the spirit, our words and opinions disappear. When young people are married, there is always some quarreling. Incessant quarreling, however, is always an issue of having many opinions.</p>
<p>When a person lives in the spirit, he will not have any opinion. Having no opinion, that is, having nothing to say, is a strong proof that a person is living in his spirit. It would be a miracle if a dumb person begins to speak, but it is an even greater miracle when a believer does not speak his opinion. A believer who can refrain from speaking his opinion is a person who is living in his spirit. In contrast, a believer who always expresses his opinion is living in his soul.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> </body></html>
