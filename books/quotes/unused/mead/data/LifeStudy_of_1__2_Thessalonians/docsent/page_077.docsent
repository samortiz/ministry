   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A CHANGEABLE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Instead of having an established heart, most Christians have a changeable, movable heart.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need a heart that is solidly established, not a heart that is changeable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to our natural birth, however, our heart is changeable.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The most changeable thing about us is our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, in the morning a brother may be very kind to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But during breakfast he may become bothered by something and treat her in an unkind way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is an illustration of the changeableness of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our heart is changeable not only in relation to other people, but even in our relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is the unchanging One; He never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are the ones who are changeable, and we are changeable in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For this reason, Paul was concerned that the hearts of the new believers at Thessalonica would be set, built up, and established.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 13 opens with the word "that."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Greek word here actually means "in order that"; that is, it indicates an issue, a result, of the foregoing verses, especially verses 6 through 12.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to read verses 6 through 13 as a complete section.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then we shall see that verse 13 is a conclusion of what Paul covers in this section.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In these verses Paul's concern is for the Thessalonians' faith and love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His desire is that their faith would be perfected and that their love would increase and abound in order that the Lord may establish their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our heart still needs to be established.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is true both of the young and of the old.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I know the experiences of young people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I also know that young people are changeable.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I can recall my experience as a young person many years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Young people are not steadfast.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now as an elderly man I can speak concerning those who are old.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Old people are not more steadfast than young people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, there is no one who, according to his natural, human life, is steadfast in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As human beings, we all are changeable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Simply because we grow older does not mean that there is a basic change in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, a piece of glass may be very fragile.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After fifty years, the glass will still be fragile.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Age will not make it any stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The same is true in human life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Both the old and the young are changeable in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, I urge you, especially those who are not so young, not to have any confidence in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because our heart changes so easily, it is not at all trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In my ministry I have met thousands of people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Throughout the years I have seen the changeableness of the human heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Time after time I have seen someone have a change of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because our heart is changeable, a crucial need in our Christian life is the establishing of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although we need our heart to be established, we are not able to do this ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only the Lord can establish our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, we need Him to cause our heart to be solidly established and built up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A BLAMELESS HEART</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have seen that according to verse 13 the Lord seeks to establish our hearts blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do you know why our heart is blamable, worthy of blame?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our heart is blamable because it is changeable.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If your heart is set, built up, and established upon a solid foundation, it will then become blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>An unchanging heart is a blameless heart.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sometimes we criticize others for being changeable when we ourselves are also changeable.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, a brother may tell his daughter not to trust in a particular young man because he is fickle and changeable.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As parents we may speak this way in order to protect our children.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Also, in order to care for new believers, we may warn them not to trust certain people who are changeable.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But how about ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Are we not changeable?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I must confess that in the natural life I am changeable.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Further, most of the changes I am referring to are negative.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Years ago I recorded certain things in my diary, for instance, a record of how I had dealt with a particular matter thoroughly before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But years later I dare not read what I have written, for even after writing such a record I experienced some change.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to realize and admit that our heart is changeable.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, we need to receive the mercy and grace from the Lord that we may give Him the permission to establish our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is waiting for our permission before He works within us to do the establishing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When our heart has been established, it will become blameless.</S>
