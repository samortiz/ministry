   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE AND BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to see these two aspects of the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first aspect is that the Lord Jesus entered into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second aspect is that since we have the life of the Lord Jesus, we are part of His mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a matter of building.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians 4:11-12 shows that the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are gifts for the building up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This Body is composed of all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, this composition must go through the process of building.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After we are saved, we become a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the many grains, we need to be broken and then built up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot be individual scattered grains; we need to be blended together to become one bread.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even if we are saved and have the Lord s life, without God s dealing, without God s breaking, and without God s building, we can only be individual, scattered saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We will not become a corporate entity or a spiritual house as God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We will only be a pile of scattered stones, not a built-up house.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the second aspect is related to the matter of building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first aspect is related to life, and the second aspect is related to building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we break bread, we should sense that we are receiving the Lord and enjoying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are eating Him, drinking Him, and enjoying Him as our life and our food.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the first thing that we should sense.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should also sense that after we eat and drink the Lord, we are being built up together with the saints to become one bread, one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Often when we break the bread, we focus only on the first aspect and neglect the second aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We focus only on remembering the Lord, contacting the Lord, and enjoying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes we even neglect enjoying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even if we focus on remembering the Lord and enjoying the Lord, this is only the first half of the significance of breaking the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We neglect the second half of the significance of breaking the bread, which concerns the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Often, we pay attention only to the relationship between us and the Lord but neglect the relationship between us and all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first aspect of the significance of breaking the bread speaks of the relationship between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we receive and eat the bread, we enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The second aspect of the significance of breaking the bread speaks of the relationship between us and all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all partake of one bread and enjoy one Lord and one life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this life we are being built into one Body so that there are no barriers among us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are also being blended together, just as the flour is blended into one loaf.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>NEEDING TO DISCERN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>AND NOT OFFENDING THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When breaking the bread, we often see only the first aspect, which is the relationship between us and the Lord, and we neglect the second aspect, which is our relationship with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this reason, the apostle Paul told the Corinthians, He who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not discern the body 1 Cor 11:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul s intention was to remind the Corinthians not to forget that the bread they touched signifies the mystical Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All those who belong to Christ are in this Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are many, but we are still one bread, one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, there should not be any divisions among us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since the Corinthians did not discern the Body in this way, even though they broke one bread together, there were strifes among them, and they were divided.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They said, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, Paul asked, Is Christ divided? v. 13 . Surely Christ is not divided.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is only one Body, which is signified by one bread.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul seemed to be saying to the Corinthians, The bread that you break is one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This signifies that you are in one Body with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why then are you divided?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is not profitable for you to break the bread in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the eyes of the Lord, what you are doing cannot be considered as breaking the bread or eating the Lord s supper.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You are not qualified to eat the Lord s bread and drink the Lord s cup, because you are divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You do not see the principle of the Body, which is that all the brothers and sisters have been blended into one Body, and that though you are many, you are one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although you break the bread together, you have opinions, strifes, jealousy, and divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By conducting yourselves in this way, you are not discerning the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is a heavy burden within me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In many places, when the children of God come together to break the bread, they stress only the first aspect of remembering the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They stress the relationship between them and the Lord, but neglect the second aspect, which is the relationship among all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For example, suppose on a Lord s Day afternoon Brother A comes to me and criticizes another brother.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>His criticism is very severe, and he expresses strong dissatisfaction toward the other brother.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If afterward I saw Brother A and Brother B sitting in the bread-breaking meeting, I would be deeply concerned because they would be eating the bread, even though they were divided.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This kind of situation offends the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In some places the brothers are jealous of each other and despise one another.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Suppose I despise a brother, and the brother I despise is jealous of me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As soon as I have an opportunity, I will tell others of this brother s shortcomings, and as soon as he has an opportunity, he will tell others of my wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thus, there is much jealousy, despising, and criticism between us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, when the time comes to break the bread on the Lord s Day, we still come to the same table and take the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He partakes of the bread, and I partake of the same bread, but there is much animosity between us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What kind of bread-breaking is this?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Some may say that there is the remembrance of the Lord; however, there is no fellowship of the Body of Christ, because there is no discerning of the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Furthermore, in many places some brothers are not willing to forgive each other.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Suppose you offend a brother, and the brother is not willing to forgive you.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At the same time you are not willing to confess your wrongdoing, and you insist that he was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Thus, neither one is willing to forgive the other.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We encounter this situation in various places.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Although the saints harbor a grudge against each other, when they come to the Lord s table, they conduct themselves as if nothing is amiss.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They take the same bread and even pray, We who are many are one bread and one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They gather together to break the bread, but among them there is no love, no harmony, no consideration, no compassion, no forbearance, and no forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>On the contrary, there is criticism and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The younger ones despise the older ones, and the older ones are dissatisfied with the younger ones; both privately spread many words of death.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When brothers come together, it is easy to talk about the shortage of the church or the shortcomings of the saints rather than spiritual matters, growth in life, or the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Nevertheless, on the Lord s Day they sit at the Lord s table with those whom they have criticized and are unwilling to forgive, and they take the same bread.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This kind of bread-breaking is not discerning the Lord s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There might be a little heart toward the Lord and little remembrance of Him; however, these brothers have not discerned His Body, because they are full of misgivings toward the other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is to eat the bread in an unworthy manner.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I hope that all God s children will have a fearful heart before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We must see that when we break the bread together, we are touching the Lord s mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We all are in this mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>All the saints are in this mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Hence, we must discern this Body such that we are able to forgive our brothers and sisters, and such that those who offend others ask for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We must exercise until we are at peace and in harmony with the other saints, and there is no separation or problem among us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Only then will we not merely remember the Lord when we break bread; rather, we will also have fellowship with all the saints in His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We will not only enjoy the Lord but also enjoy all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It is in this way that our breaking of the bread will be profitable to us.</S>
