<h2 class="head1">THE RICHES OF THE GLORY OF THE MYSTERY</h2><p>Let us now pay closer attention to the riches of the glory of the mystery spoken of in verse 27. The riches of this mystery among the nations are the riches of all that Christ is to the Gentile believers (Eph. 3:8). At the time Paul wrote to the Colossians, the Jews regarded the Gentiles, the nations, as swine. Nevertheless, Paul says that God has willed to make known the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, that is, among the Gentile &ldquo;swine.&rdquo; Various terms could be used to describe the Gentiles: sinners, rebels, enemies of God, sons of disobedience, sons of wrath. Before we were saved, we were in this category. But even among such people God has willed to make known the riches of the glory of this mystery.</p><p>After you were saved, did you not have the sense that you had entered into glory? Many of us had this kind of experience. Although we were sinners, enemies, and rebels, we have become sons of God. We are also heirs of God, joint partakers of Christ, and even the members of Christ. Furthermore, the New Testament reveals that we are priests and kings. As heirs of God, we shall inherit not only God Himself, but all things. We are sons of God, heirs of God, partners of Christ, and priests and kings. What a glory this is!</p><p>If we see this glory, we shall also know the riches of the glory, even though we lack the language to utter these riches adequately. These riches include the divine life, the divine nature, the anointing, and the all-inclusive Spirit. Other aspects of the riches are righteousness, justification, holiness, sanctification, transformation, glorification, comfort, and the divine Presence. It is impossible to list all the riches. They are beyond counting. These are the riches of the unique glory, the glory that is ours because we are sons and heirs of God, partners of Christ, and priests and kings.</p><p>The key to the riches of glory is Christ Himself. Although the Jews in ancient times were the people of God and not Gentile &ldquo;swine,&rdquo; they did not recognize the Lord Jesus as their Messiah. To many Jews today, the term Messiah has no reality. When their Messiah comes and they recognize Him, He will only be among them. But 1:27 indicates that Christ is not merely among us; He is in us. To us Christ is not only the objective One, but also the subjective One dwelling in us. We need to tell the Jews that instead of waiting for their Messiah to come only in an outward way, they too can have Christ, the true Messiah, dwelling in them right now and thereby become sons of God. The Jews who receive Christ into them will not only be the people of God chosen by Him, but also the sons of God regenerated by Him. What a glory it is to be indwelt by Christ!</p><p>As believers in Christ, we know the riches of the glory of this mystery. We cannot exhaust the items of the riches of such a glory. All the blessings in the Bible are included in the riches of this glory, which is our portion. This glory is the glory of the mystery among the nations, and this mystery is Christ in us. The Christ who dwells within us is the mystery full of glory, with countless riches. This is the key point in the book of Colossians.</p><h2 class="head1">BACK TO THE MYSTERY</h2><p>Those in Colosse, however, had lost the vision of this mystery and had become distracted by philosophy, observances, ordinances, and practices. They had been defrauded and carried away as spoil from their prize, the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ. Like the Colossians, today&rsquo;s Christians have also lost the vision of the glory of Christ as the mystery of God&rsquo;s economy. The vast majority of genuine Christians have been distracted and carried away to things other than Christ Himself. Because the Colossians had been distracted, Paul wrote to say that the mystery hidden from the ages and from the generations has been made manifest to the saints. This mystery is the all-inclusive Christ who indwells us. Because we have the One who is all in all, we have no need to turn to philosophies, ordinances, observances, and practices. How I look to the Lord that we all may be brought back to this mystery! Let us forget everything other than Christ and care only for Him. Christ, the mystery among the Gentiles, has a glory filled with riches.</p>
