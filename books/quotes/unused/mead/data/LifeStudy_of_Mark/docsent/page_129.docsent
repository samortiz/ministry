   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR THE PREPARATION OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR HIS REDEMPTIVE SERVICE 11 Scripture Reading: Mark 14:1-26</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message I would like to give a further word on 14:1-26.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In particular, we need a further word concerning the Lord s instituting His supper as part of the preparation of His disciples to enter into His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>APPRECIATING THE LORD S PRECIOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Mark 14:1-42 is concerned with the Lord s preparation of His disciples for His death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this section of the Gospel of Mark concerned with the Lord s preparation, there are two feasts in addition to the feast of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first feast was prepared for the Lord by those who loved Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The second feast was the Lord s supper instituted by Him immediately after the feast of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord s supper was prepared by Him for His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Throughout the centuries, much has been said concerning the feast set up by Simon to show his love for the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During this feast, a woman anointed the Lord as a display of her love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many messages have been given on the Lord s being anointed by the woman in Mark 14.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, it is much more difficult to get into the depths of the significance of the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This matter is very profound, far beyond the ability of the human mind to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The significance of the feast prepared for the Lord by certain of His disciples is shallow compared to the significance of the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the feast prepared by the Lord s disciples, we have the matter of appreciation of the Lord s preciousness, worthiness, and loveliness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Simon, the leper, having been cleansed by the Lord, prepared this feast as an expression of his appreciation of the Lord s mercy, grace, and preciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The anointing of the Lord Jesus was also an expression of appreciation of the Lord s loveliness and worthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, in these matters there is little that could be regarded as deep.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It seems that nothing initiated by us has much depth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A SYMBOL OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>ECONOMY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The supper instituted by the Lord Jesus, on the contrary, is extremely deep.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This feast is a sign, a symbol, of the entire New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s economy in the New Testament age is involved with the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not believe that any of the Lord s disciples understood the significance of His table when it was instituted.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peter, for example, participated in that table, but he certainly did not see the significance of it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bread and the Cup</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Lord Jesus instituted His supper, He took bread, and blessed and broke it, and gave it to them, and said, Take; this is My body 14:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then He took the cup, gave it to them, and said, This is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many v. 24 . Hence, the Lord s table includes a loaf of bread and a cup.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to biblical usage, bread signifies life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus said, I am the bread of life John 6:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This indicates that in the Bible bread is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, according to biblical usage, a cup signifies a portion of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, the cup is called the cup of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The bread is of life, and the cup is of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be sure, this life is the divine life, and this blessing is the divine blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, both the life and the blessing are the Triune God, God Himself in Christ through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do you know what eternal life is?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eternal life is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you know what the divine blessing is?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The divine blessing also is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Both the divine life and the divine blessing, therefore, are actually the Triune God Himself.</S>
