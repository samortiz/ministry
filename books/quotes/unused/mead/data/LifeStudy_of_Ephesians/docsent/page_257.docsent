   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CARING ONLY FOR CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although there are millions of Christians on earth today, very few have been built up with others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The reason for this lack of building is that so many believers still hold on to ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Perhaps you were a member of a certain denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, because of your ordinances, you were not one with others, and you were not able to be built up with them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, you were waiting for the situation to change to fit your ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When there was no change or improvement, you moved to another group, hoping to find there a situation to suit your preference.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This has caused many to travel from one denomination to another.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some have testified that they were not satisfied until they came into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although it is true that we are satisfied spiritually in the church, we must be careful not to hold to any ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In our experience Christ must be everything to us: our peace, our foundation, our cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not care for anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whether the meetings are noisy or quiet makes no difference.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are not for noise or for silence we are for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By caring only for Christ, we can easily be one with others and be built up with them locally and universally on Christ as the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Recently I have been burdened of the Lord to give a number of messages dealing with ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I believe that the Spirit of the Lord within us realizes how important it is for us to be clear about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As more saints turn to the way of the Lord s recovery, it is possible for ordinances to be brought in or for dissenting opinions to be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, it is crucial that we learn to care only for Christ, particularly as we visit localities where the way of meeting differs from that to which we are accustomed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not evaluate a meeting according to whether or not the saints practice pray-reading, exercise tongues-speaking, or pray long prayers or short ones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should care for Christ and for Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we care only for Christ, we shall not have any problems with oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more we care for Christ and drop all manner of ordinances, the more we shall be built up in Christ locally and also universally.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>NO ORGANIZATION</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In speaking of the universal building, we must be careful to distinguish such building from organization.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although we are absolutely for the proper building, we are opposed to organization.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The churches will be built together universally, but this does not mean that they will be universally organized.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>NO ISOLATION</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the truth of the Body, the Body is universally one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason, the local churches should not be isolated from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Isolation is contrary to the truth concerning the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because each local church is part of the Body universally, no local church should be isolated from the others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is especially true today with modern means of communication and transportation that permit the rapid spread of news and information around the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Something of life may be released in Los Angeles today and be known in dozens of other places within hours.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How wrong it is for a church to try to be independent!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Body is receiving a continual transfusion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we isolate ourselves from the other churches, we cut ourselves off both from the transfusion and from the circulation of life in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such a thing violates the law of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although we must shun organization, we need to be built up universally as the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>BUILT UP IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 2:22 Paul speaks of the local building: In Whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The word you refers to the local saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, the word also indicates that the building in verse 22 is local.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to the context, the dwelling place of God in this verse is local, whereas the holy temple in the preceding verse is universal.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul is careful to point out that it is in Christ that the local saints are built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They are not built in ordinances, in practices, or in opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can be built up only in the all-inclusive Christ who is our peace, foundation, and cornerstone.</S>
