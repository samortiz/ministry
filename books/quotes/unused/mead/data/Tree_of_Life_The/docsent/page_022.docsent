   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Due to the fall of man, man became involved with Satan, with the evil force of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the negative things in this universe are related to man due to his fall.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before man was created, Satan, the darkness of Satan, and the evil kingdom of Satan were there already, but man had nothing to do with these negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By the fall, Satan brought all these negative things to man, which are against God s glory, God s holiness, and God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s glory, holiness, and righteousness would not allow fallen man to touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the all-inclusive death of Christ dealt with and did away with all these negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, through His death and in His resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has made Himself available for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Triune God embodied in Christ who is realized as the life-giving Spirit is the central outcome of all the works which Christ has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The tabernacle of the Old Testament shows us that the Triune God is for our enjoyment.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the outer court is the righteousness of God; in the Holy Place is the holiness of God; and in the Holy of Holies is the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you are going to pass the outer court, you have to fulfill the requirements of God s righteousness; if you are going to get into the Holy Place, you have to fulfill the requirements of God s holiness; and if you are going to get into the Holy of Holies, you need to fulfill the requirements of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Holy of Holies is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The ark of testimony is the very embodiment of God and inside the ark is the hidden manna, which signifies that God is our enjoyment.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>AND GLORIFICATION FOR THE BODY LIFE</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first step of justification is from Romans 1:1 to 5:11.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This part of Romans tells us that we are sinful and under God s condemnation, but through the blood of Jesus, we have been justified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From 5:12 through 8:13 is sanctification and 8:14-39 talks about glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God first justifies us, and then He works to sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be sanctified means to be mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more you are mingled with God, the more you are sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to the picture of the tabernacle, all forty-eight boards were overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be sanctified means to be overlaid by God and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God has not only justified us, but has also put us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God has identified us with Christ, has grafted us into Christ, and has made Christ one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are now in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Romans 8 the Spirit is referred to as the Spirit of life v. 2 . Christ is the Spirit, and this Spirit is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is in you, you are in Him, and you have to learn to live not by yourself but by Him and in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To live by and in the Spirit of life is to be in the process of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sanctification means to be mingled with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only Christ in His divine nature is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Romans 8:14-39 tells us that after we are justified and sanctified, we will be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Romans 9 11 is a parenthetical section which talks about God s selection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Chapters twelve through sixteen reveal the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, the book of Romans reveals the tabernacle of God.</S>

   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church life is the mingling of the Triune God with His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The three stages of justification, sanctification, and glorification embody the church life, the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church life is the Triune God God as the source embodied in Christ and realized as the Spirit mingled with His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These chosen people are justified, sanctified, glorified, and built together to form the tabernacle, the Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This truth is the seed of all things related to God s purpose.</S>
