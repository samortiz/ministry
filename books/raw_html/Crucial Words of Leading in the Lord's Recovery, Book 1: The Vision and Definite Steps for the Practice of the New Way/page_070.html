<h2 class="head1">PRAYER</h2>
<p>Lord, release our spirit, give us the burden, and enable us to receive the burden and to stretch out our hands in faith to touch Your throne of authority. Lord, we believe that Your church needs the land in Lin-ko. We thank You for blessing Taiwan because of Your recovery. We still ask You to pour out Your blessing in so many ways. Bless this country, bless the government, and bless the officials. Give them the wisdom to make the right decisions. Cause them to have a deep realization that this decision is a blessed decision. Lord, we are not asking this for ourselves or merely for the church, we are asking this for You and Your interest. We are here to command You to fulfill this matter.</p>
<p>Lord, we also receive the burden to pray for the different church meetings. Since You are the One gathering us together, cause us to sense Your presence in all of our gatherings. Now we petition You in one accord and touch Your throne of holiness. We ask You to hear our prayers. Pour out Your grace and blessing in every meeting.</p>
<p>Lord, we hide ourselves, Your work, Your recovery, Your church, and all the steps of the practice of Your new way in You and under the covering of Your precious blood. We ask You to draw the boundary around us with Your precious blood and not allow the authorities of darkness to overstep. Lord, cover us in many ways. We are touching Your throne of authority and opposing all counter prayers. If there are some who oppose us before You, they are not opposing us, they are opposing Your new way and Your work. Lord, we ask You to act against all counter prayers, resisting the enemy and fighting for us. Since we are here fighting the battle, we ask You to grant us the inner peace so that we may enjoy Your fighting and rest in Your fighting. May Your testimony, the testimony You have shown us, the testimony of the end time, be a living testimony, an anti-testimony, a testimony against Christianity, against its poison, against its traditions, against its oldness, and against its old ways. May Your testimony be a genuine living testimony.</p>
<p>Lord, we also ask You to enable all the co-workers, elders, and full-timers to receive the burden to pray unceasingly and labor faithfully before You. Lord, we will never enjoy rest before You have obtained Your rest. We want to see You resting in all the saints&rsquo; homes. We want to establish all the saints&rsquo; homes and make them Your resting place. Lord, perfect thousands of homes to be Your living testimony for the release and shining forth of Your truth. Build us up and equip us with the truth. Make us good soldiers to spread the gospel, the truth, and even the churches all over Taiwan. Lord, hear our prayer.</p>
<p>Lord, remember that we belong to You and have been set apart for You. Remember that we are here in Your name. Our prayers are also in Your name. Lord, we believe that for Your sake and for the sake of Your interest on the earth, You will answer our prayers. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FEW ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2>
<p>We thank the Lord for giving us the time and the utterance to pray. We must believe that He has heard our prayers in His name. We need to continue to pray that the Lord will execute what He has heard and fulfill our desires before Him.</p>
<p>Regarding the teaching of <em>Truth Lessons,</em> I hope all the elders will carry this out in a serious way. We should try our best to put into practice every point we have fellowshipped in the previous two chapters regarding the teaching of <em>Truth Lessons</em>. I would emphasize again that every elder should take the lead to teach the truth by teaching a truth class in the meeting hall where he meets. If we do know how to teach, we surely should teach, but even if we do not know how to teach, we still must teach, because elders should be apt to teach (1 Tim. 3:2). Some of us may not know how to teach at the present time, but as long as there is the heart to learn, eventually we will be able to teach. If we teach according to what I spoke in the previous chapters, we will see the result.</p>
<p>There will be forty days from the end of this term of the full-time training until the beginning of the next term. This time is also the summer vacation. There will be many activities for college students. I hope that we could have a definite plan and arrangement for the gospel work on the campuses. If possible, we should arrange for some of them to attend the summer training on <em>The Conclusion of the New Testament.</em> This period of time can serve as a bridge to the full-time training to increase the number of those who have the heart to go. I hope that we will pray for this matter and for the full-time training and its leading. These are crucial matters.</p>
<p>Another matter we need to pray for is the move of propagation in the communities. Before we begin the propagation in the towns and villages in 1988, we will focus on laying a good foundation in the communities of the big cities. This is a great matter. We all need to receive the burden to pray for the propagation.</p>
