<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. PSALMS 42&#151;49, 84, 85, 87, AND 88<br>BEING THE HOLY WRITINGS OF THE SONS OF KORAH</H2><P>Psalms 42&#151;49, 84, 85, 87, and 88 are the holy writings of the sons of Korah. Korah was the leader of the rebellion against Moses and God (Num. 16:1-3). After about four hundred seventy years, Samuel the prophet, Heman the singer, and some other psalmists came out of Korah the rebel's descendants at the time of David (1 Chron. 6:31-39). Even the descendants of a leading rebel became the godly writers of psalms, praising God in their holy writings as a record existing for generations. What a grace this was!</P><P>It is marvelous that the descendants of Korah wrote something that became a part of the Holy Bible. Their holy writings have become a record existing for generations. They were also faithful to tell people that they were the sons of Korah, the one who rebelled against God. This shows us that all the psalms were written based upon the infinite grace of God. The sons of Korah were the descendants, the sons, of that great sinner and rebel, Korah, yet they became holy people writing psalms to praise God. Today we are like the sons of Korah. In a sense, we are still poor sinners and rebels, yet we poor sinners can be those who are speakers of the holy Word!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. PANTING AFTER GOD</H2><P>The crucial point of Psalms 42&#151;44 is the psalmist's panting after God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. After Being Stripped by God</H2><P>The psalmist was panting after God at a time when he and his people had been stripped and defeated by the neighboring nations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. As the Hart Panting after the Streams of Water</H2><P>He panted after God as the hart pants after the streams of water (Psa. 42:1-2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Under the Adversaries'<br>Reproaching and Oppression</H2><P>The psalmist was also under the adversaries' reproaching and oppression (42:3, 9b-10). Psalm 42:3 says, "My tears have been my food/Day and night,/While they say to me all day long,/Where is your God?"</P>
