<h1 class="msg">Lesson Ten</h1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE TRIUNE GOD AS REVEALED IN THE EPISTLES (2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Scripture Reading</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Eph. 2:1-6, 13, 17-18; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Eph. 3:14-17.</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Outline</H2><ol class="upper-roman" start="3"><li>The two-way traffic of the Triune God (Ephesians 2)</li><li>The indwelling of the Triune God (Ephesians 3)</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Text</H2><P>In this lesson we will look at Ephesians chapters two and three. Ephesians 2 shows us a wonderful two-way traffic. It shows God coming to us, then us going back to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE TWO-WAY TRAFFIC OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br>(EPHESIANS 2)</H2><P>Ephesians 2 starts by showing that we were fallen into sin and death and that we were even walking in the realm of sin and death (vv. 1-3). But God, because of His great love, came to enliven us, to raise us up from the dead, and to exalt us and seat us in the heavens. But He did not do this directly&#151;He did it through Christ. Without Christ there is no way for God to enliven us. He raised us up and seated us in the heavens in Christ (vv. 4-6). Christ is the means, the element, and the sphere for God to enliven us, to raise us up, and to seat us in the heavens. Outside of Christ God has no way to work out these three matters. God did it, but He did it through a channel, through Christ.</P><P> As God's channel, Christ did many things. All He did can be summed up in the matter of His blood (v. 13). The blood is the sign of Christ's marvelous death. After Christ accomplished so much by His all-inclusive death, He came to preach the gospel (v. 17). How could He preach the gospel to us after He was crucified and buried? The answer is that He resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). When Christ as the Spirit preached such a gospel, we heard and accepted it. What then did we receive? We received the life-giving Spirit. Hallelujah! What started with God's love has come through Christ, the channel, and has reached us as the Spirit!</P><P>This, however, is not the goal. The Triune God ultimately wants to bring us into Himself. So, 2:18 continues, "For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father." These verses show us that when we receive the Son in His preaching, we receive the Spirit. The Spirit then brings us back to the Father through the Son. This is marvelous! The Father came to us through the Son in the Spirit, and now the Spirit brings us back to the Father, through the Son. What a wonderful two-way traffic! We enjoy the threefold dispensing of life by the Triune God.</P>
