   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE LAMB</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>EXODUS 12:5; 13:2</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year; ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The most important qualification of the lamb is to be without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be without blemish is to be without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The reason no one in the world can be our savior is that everyone has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have sinned, and I have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why you cannot save me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You should die, and I should die.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, you cannot save me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus is truly the One without blemish!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He said of Himself, "Which of you convicts Me of sin?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John 8:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Throughout history, only Jesus could say this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For two thousand years, men would only say that the Lord Jesus was too good for not resisting others; no one would say that He was too evil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hebrews 7:26 says that He is "separated from sinners"!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The second point is that this lamb must be a firstborn lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God kills the firstborn ones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why He has to save the firstborn with the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus is the firstborn son Luke 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is indeed a Savior without blemish!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1 Pet 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>V. THE DEATH OF THE LAMB</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>EXODUS 12:6</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the most crucial point!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We sinners need a savior to save us!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if the Lord had not died, we would still perish even if we had seen and heard Him face to face in His days.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if we were able to see and hear Him face to face today, we would still be under woe, for the wages of sin is death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He has to die before He can save us from death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lamb has to be kept "until the fourteenth day of the same month" and killed "in the evening."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the same way, the Lord was killed on the fourteenth day of the first month.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even the hour was not missed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Matthew 27:45 says, "Now from the sixth hour darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"In the evening" means to be between two nights; this is a Jewish expression.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The famous Jewish historian Josephus said that the "evening" is the sixth hour to the ninth hour, which on our clock would be from noon to three o'clock.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord was crucified during this time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The sky became dark during this time until He expired.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Who killed the Lamb?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was the whole congregation of Israel that killed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here is a great type: the priest typifies the church, the twelve tribes typify the nations on earth, and the congregation typifies mankind as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At the time of Noah, the world was divided into three tribes: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the day of the Lord's crucifixion, there were the Jews, of Shem; the Romans, of Japheth; and Simon the Cyrenian, of Ham.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The whole of mankind was there.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord made the testimony before all mankind that He had died!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the time of Caesar Nero, the census recorded that there were over three million people living in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord's death was before so many people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"Neither shall ye break a bone thereof" Exo 12:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord Jesus indeed fulfilled this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>John 19:36 says, "For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled: No bone of His shall be broken.'"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here is a most amazing thing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How could the Lord become a Passover lamb?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to the record of the Talmud, forty years before the destruction of the temple, that is, one year before the crucifixion of the Lord, the Roman Emperor set a decree that forbade stoning people to death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When someone is stoned to death, his bones are broken.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Jews executed men by the way of stoning, while the Romans executed men by crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When Pilate ordered the Jews to examine the Lord according to their own law, the Jews said that they did not have the power to kill anyone John 18:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is another proof.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord prophesied that He would be crucified and not stoned to death.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Otherwise, He would not be able to become the Passover lamb.</S>
