   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God s Economy Being God Coming into Us and Godliness Being God Going Out of Us</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In brief, God s economy is God coming into us, and godliness is God going out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hallelujah for such a heavenly, divine traffic!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Christian life is simply God coming in and God going out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This traffic goes on hour by hour.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Lord s recovery our church life, our daily life, and our family life is simply God coming in and God going out all day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This traffic may be likened to an electrical current in a circuit, which is electricity constantly coming and going.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have a divine current among us and within us; it is the Triune God coming in and going out.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God coming in is God s economy, and God going out is godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not Teaching Things That Are Different</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>from God s Economy</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From our youth we need to learn not to teach things that are different from God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul charged Timothy to remain in Ephesus with the sole purpose of charging certain ones not to teach different things 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should always teach God s coming in and God s going out and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not teach different things, such as how long our hair should be or whether or not we should go to certain places.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This kind of teaching will produce questions and stir up disputations v. 4 . We need to teach God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the saints need to learn the things of God s economy, not only for the sake of their own experience but also in order to be able to teach others in an accurate way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They also need to learn how to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A newly saved young person may ask us, What is your opinion about going to movies?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before I was saved, the movies were my second life; I could not live without seeing at least one movie a week.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now I have heard some saints say that we should not go to movies and others say that we should be liberated to go to the movies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Please tell me whether I should go to a movie or not.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should answer this new one by saying, In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul says that we should not teach things that are different from God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not care for these kinds of concepts, which produce questions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, we need to take care of God s economy, which is the dispensing of the Triune God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now that you are saved, you have the Triune God within you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Father is in you, the Son is in you, and the Spirit is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You should forget about movies.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not movies that abide in you; it is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are not saved for movies or for anything other than our Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now that the Triune God is in you, you do not need to ask me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead, you can ask the Triune God within you, O God, would You like to go to a movie?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If You go, I will go.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If You do not go, even though movies were my second life, I will not go, because I love You and because I love to be one with You.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I love to live with You.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After receiving such an answer, the young person may reply, This morning I prayed in this way, asking the Lord to tell me whether or not to go to a movie.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more I prayed, the more it seemed that He did not want to go.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We could then ask, How do you know that the Lord did not want to go?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The new one may answer, When I considered going, something within was silent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, when I considered not going, something within was joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should fellowship with people in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A newly saved young sister may ask another sister concerning the proper length of hair for a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The sister should answer her, We are not saved in order to have a certain length of hair.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hair is not our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have been saved for Christ, and Christ today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is now dispensing Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This kind of teaching should be prevailing among all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Such teaching has been ministered among us for many years, but it is not often heard in our daily talk.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We read this teaching in the ministry books, but afterward we do not apply what we read.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In our daily talk we argue concerning things such as the proper length of hair.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to change our vain talk and nonsensical gossip into talk about God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Regardless of the question that is raised, we should give only one answer God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Bible teaches God s economy, which is God s stewardship, the dispensing of God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s economy, which issues in godliness, should be the unique topic of our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the saints in the churches, both old and young, will restrict their fellowship to God s economy, the church life will be enriched and uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to learn to make God s economy our daily talk, applying all the messages we hear and read to our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even in our family life we should discuss God s economy, God s dispensing of Himself into our being.</S>
