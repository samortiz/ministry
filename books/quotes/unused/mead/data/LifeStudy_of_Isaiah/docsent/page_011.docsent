   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I. JEHOVAH'S CHASTISEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>ON HIS BELOVED CHILDREN ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After God exposes the actual situation of His people, He comes in to deal with them, to chastise them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His chastisement may be considered a governmental dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although God's people are different from the Gentiles and although in Isaiah God has a threefold love for His people, as a Father, a Mother, and a Husband, He still needs to deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In His dealing God is often more serious than in His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He may let the unbelievers go, but He will not let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is very strict, very narrow, and very genuine in dealing with us because He has His divine government.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is not a God without regulating and controlling principles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Part of the title of this message uses the words Jehovah's chastisement on His beloved children Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I use the expression beloved children to indicate that God's dealing with us is not with a negative motive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, His dealing with us as His beloved children today is always with a very positive motive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although He chastises us, He does not judge us or punish us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, some saints may feel that God is punishing them and that they cannot bear this punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nevertheless, I still say that, instead of punishing us, God chastises us in love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is like a loving father who disciplines his children for their good.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once a child has grown to adulthood, he may realize that what he thought was punishment was actually his father's love.</S>
