   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S POWER AND GOD S WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1:23 and 24 Paul says, But we preach Christ crucified, to Jews an offense, and to the nations foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, God s power and God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God has called us into the fellowship of Christ, the unique One.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This One is the power of God and the wisdom of God to us who have been called.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Corinthians 1:30 says, But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, Who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God has put us into Christ, and now we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Formerly, we were in Adam, but we have been transferred out of Adam and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was not an outward transfer; it was an inward transfer of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In life we have been transferred from one realm into another, from Adam into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now we all can declare, Hallelujah, I am in Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How happy I am to be in Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Being in Christ is a tremendous matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Far from being a mere doctrine, this is a marvelous fact.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are in Christ, and Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How wonderful that we are in such a Person!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>RIGHTEOUSNESS, SANCTIFICATION, AND REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1:30 Paul tells us that Christ has become wisdom to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This wisdom comprises righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Righteousness is related to substance, whereas sanctification is related to action.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may say that righteousness is a thing, but sanctification is a matter that involves a process.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sanctification implies the action of being sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Redemption also is not merely a thing, but a matter that involves a process, for it involves the action of being redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is significant that in verse 30 Paul speaks of righteousness, but not of justification, and of sanctification, but not of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why does Paul speak of righteousness but not holiness, and why does he speak of sanctification and redemption, but not of justification?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have pointed out that righteousness is Christ for our past, that sanctification is Christ for the present, and that redemption is Christ for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because our past life was sinful, we need Christ to be our righteousness for the past.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because our present life is not holy, sanctified, we need Christ to be our present sanctification that we may become holy and separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the future our body will be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, redemption is for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This interpretation of righteousness, sanctification, and redemption is not wrong; however, it is not sufficiently practical.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to understand righteousness, sanctification, and redemption in a deeper and more experiential way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whenever we truly enjoy Christ in our daily life and experience Him, He becomes righteousness to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is different from saying that Christ justifies us or that He becomes our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul is certainly correct in using the word righteousness in verse 30 instead of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once again I would use an illustration from married life to show how Christ can become righteousness to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever a husband and wife argue and exchange words, both parties consider themselves to be completely right.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, it is not accurate to say that either the husband or the wife is altogether right.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose the husband genuinely enjoys Christ in his daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then Christ will become righteousness to him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more he enjoys the Lord, the more Christ becomes righteousness to him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a result, he will realize that, for the most part, he is wrong in relation to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Likewise, if the wife enjoys Christ, He will become righteousness to her, and she will have the same realization about herself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She will sense that she is wrong to argue with her husband and that he is much more right than she is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By this we see that the more we enjoy Christ, the more we become fair, just, upright, and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Moreover, the more a husband and wife enjoy Christ, the more they will condemn themselves and not the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The husband will realize that he is wrong and will condemn himself, and the wife will do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This will keep them from arguing and exchanging words.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this way, Christ becomes righteousness to them day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By nature, no human being is truly righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Not even husbands and wives are righteous with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the contrary, they are often unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brothers, do you honestly believe that you are righteous with your wife?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sisters, are you righteous with your husband?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>During the years of your married life, have you always been righteous with your spouse?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I do not believe that any married person can testify honestly that he or she has always been righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The reason we are not righteous is that we do not have the adequate enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But if we enjoy Christ continually in our daily life, we shall become the most righteous of people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Righteousness is actually Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Christ, therefore, is not merely to be righteousness for our past so that we may be justified by God; He should also be our present righteousness in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I have come to realize this not from books, but through Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Furthermore, this realization did not come easily; it was the result of facing many problems and difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we enjoy Christ in our daily living and if He becomes righteousness to us in a practical way, we shall become special people, a sanctified people.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Instead of being common, we shall be separated to God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is very common for husbands and wives to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Every married couple does this.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If our married life is common, we are not sanctified in our married life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But should a brother be delivered from arguing with his wife because Christ has become righteousness to him, he will be a special husband, a particular husband, a husband who is sanctified, separated to God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Christ as our daily righteousness causes us to become sanctified and separated persons.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>No longer are we common; rather, we are separate from others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, in our daily living Christ should be not only our righteousness, but also our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When we are sanctified and separated unto God, we are also redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This means that we are brought back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Whenever a husband and wife quarrel, they are carried away from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But when Christ becomes righteousness and sanctification to them, spontaneously they are brought back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As we have pointed out, redemption includes termination, replacement, and being brought back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Thus, redemption is actually transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we enjoy Christ daily, He will become our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then Christ as our righteousness will make us different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We shall be sanctified and separated unto God by Christ as our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Automatically this sanctification will bring us back to God, from whom we have gone astray.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is the experience of Christ as our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Furthermore, this redemption terminates us and causes us to be replaced with what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The future redemption of our body will be the transfiguration of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But today we may experience Christ as the One who transfigures our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Thus, Christ will be not only our transfiguration in the future but is also our present transfiguration, redemption, in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Paul wanted the Corinthians to realize that they were foolish to have divisions and preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It was foolish for them to say that they were of a particular person.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>God had called them into the fellowship of His Son, into the fellowship of the One who is God s wisdom and power.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is the Christ who, in our experience, becomes righteousness to us, who sanctifies us, and who brings us back to God by terminating us and replacing us with Himself.</S>
