   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FULFILLING OUR RESPONSIBILITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In your going out to preach the gospel, it may be that you will baptize some nearly every time you go out.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is possible to become addicted to this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every kind of addiction is harmful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you are addicted to baptizing people, even that can be harmful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all must learn not to baptize too many.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If as a team you have already baptized eight, that is good enough; do not endeavor to baptize more.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You should stop baptizing and go to "change diapers."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You must be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not bring forth babies and then hand them over to others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After your team has baptized a small number, stop and form a family to do the work of raising up these new ones as God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You must do everything for them continuously, day after day, week after week, and month after month.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then you will see the proper result.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the way to build up the church life through raising up the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all must bear our responsibility in taking care of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, we should not try to do this on a big scale.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Each team member should have only about three new ones to take care of.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is their duty to meet continuously with these new believers in home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a nursing mother does not have a sense of duty, but only does things according to her desires and likes, her babe will not grow properly and may even die.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Lord's work, there are no vacations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have to go out continuously, not to many homes, but to those three or four homes of the ones you are caring for.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You must attend to your duty like a nursing mother raising up her children.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today you are raising up not only your children but also God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>RAISING UP THE NEW ONES WITH THE WORD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second point regarding the raising up of God's children is that you have to raise them up with the word of God, not with your own word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You must always keep this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not speak your own word too much.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You must learn to seize, or grasp, the opportunity to inject these new ones with the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Feed them with the milk of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why I published Truth Lessons and Life Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In these volumes I have collected the most suitable verses for helping the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I encourage all of you who are working in the Lord's new way to become very well acquainted with all forty-eight lessons in Life Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the subjects of these lessons were carefully selected according to my knowledge and experience to meet the needs of the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Study these lessons, and learn how to use all these golden verses.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is best if you can recite all these verses, but at least you must know where they are in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then if you cannot recite a verse, you can find it quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes, even if you can recite the verse, it is better to open to that verse and let the new one read it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whatever you do, you must do it in a living way, and you should try to cover at least one definite point using the best verses.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first thing we should inject into the new ones is that our Savior is the Spirit and that we as saved ones have a regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to spend at least three or four home meetings to impart this matter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The second category of things we should impart to them must be the basic practices of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As Christians we should read the Bible, the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should pray to God, which is to breathe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Also, we should have morning watch.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every morning we should rise up early to have a time of morning watch with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must also teach them how to practice morning watch by reading some verses and then pray-reading these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You have to charge them to attend the Christian meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then you also have to help them to do the same thing that you did for them, that is, to preach the gospel to others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These are the basic practices of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The next matters we should cover with them are all the different items of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God's salvation is all-inclusive, and within God's salvation there are many different items.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are the washing away of our sins, the forgiving of our sins, redemption, reconciliation, justification, regeneration, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All of these matters are covered in the forty-eight lessons in Life Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You have to take care of all these matters, and to do so will require many weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you cover these three categories properly, the ones who are under your care will be raised up very well.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Spontaneously, they will grow and become steadfast.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The home meeting is like kindergarten, and the group meeting is like elementary school.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In later messages we will have much fellowship on the group meeting.</S>
