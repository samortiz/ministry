   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The Removal of Hindrances 2:15</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 15 says, "Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If this word is spoken by the beloved, it is a continuation of 2:13, which says, "The vines with the tender grape give a good smell."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The "us" here is the same as the "our" in 2:12.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Take us the foxes" is in the imperative mood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The foxes always take away the fruit, whereas little foxes break the branches whenever they can.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The foxes only want the fruit, and there is still a possibility of fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the little foxes make it impossible to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do not pay attention to the matters of the life of the cross before resurrection and the experience of ascension after resurrection, everything will be spoiled by the little foxes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"The vines are in blossom; they give forth fragrance" RSV .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is only the time for blossoming and the giving forth of fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that the state of perfection has not yet been reached.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The manifestation of resurrection is just beginning, and the experience of ascension is just beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are not careful, the foxes can come and spoil them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What are the little foxes?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are the small manifestations, habits, and introspections of the old life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They may not be big sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But a little folly can spoil wisdom and honor Eccl.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>10:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The little foxes are hiding behind the vines.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we are not careful, the vines will be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The little foxes are the things that hinder a person from taking the first step in subjective things and that stop the vines from bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the resurrection life is not well established, there is the need to guard against the little foxes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The maiden cannot deal with the small problems the little foxes alone; nor can they be dealt with by the King alone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They have to be dealt with through the cooperation of the maiden and the King.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>FAILURE AND RECOVERY 2:16 3:5</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 16 says, "My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After the maiden has seen the King's attitude, heard his calling, and apprehended the complete union, she answers in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>She turns back to review her past experience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One thing has satisfied her heart her beloved is hers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She is already clear that her beloved is hers, and she also knows that she belongs to her beloved, but these are not the things that she is after now.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She turns back to consider her past experience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 6:3 the King is the center, even though she is mentioned as well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By 7:10 only the King is the center, and she has forgotten about herself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What she says is not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But she does not answer his question.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What a disappointing answer this is!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are not saying whether the answer is good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are asking whether she has heard what the beloved has said.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A person who has freshly consecrated herself does not know what she should be to the Lord, yet she remembers how her beloved is to her.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She is still the center, and she does not know that He should be the center.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nevertheless, she still has the feeling that she belongs to the beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"He feedeth his flock among the lilies."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although the matter of work is touched here, the emphasis is not on the way the Lord deals with the flock, but on the relationship between the Lord and the lilies.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The lilies are those who have a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They are planted by the Lord Himself, and they are the Lord's own work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the heading to Psalm 45, there are the words, "upon Shoshannim," which mean "set to the lilies."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord is feeding the flock among a group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He implies that we are the lilies and that He is feeding us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As long as we have the Lord, we are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here the maiden pays attention to what He is to her.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, her words do not answer the Lord's question, and as such, do not satisfy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 17 says, "Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"Roe" is "gazelle" in Darby's New Translation and in the margin of the American Standard Version, but the word is "roe" in the King James Version and the text of the American Standard Version.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All three versions, have "a young hart."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"The mountains of Bether" means the mountain of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By saying this, she recognizes the existence of the shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In a disguised way, she also admits that she cannot satisfy the Lord's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>She knows that she has not been fully joined to the Lord, and she knows the importance of the calling of the cross, the demand of ascension, and the expression of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But she is also aware of her own insufficiencies in these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, she asks the Lord to wait until the shadows flee away.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>She is looking for the day to break.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>She expects that the day will break and the shadows will flee away.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>She pleads for the return of the beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The word "turn," on the one hand, shows her inability to hear the beloved's call and to rise up to follow him, and on the other hand, it shows her desire for the beloved's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we combine the two points, we see that she wants her beloved to be with her.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Yet she wants him to be with her on her own terms within the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>She is still introspective with her own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>She only wants to enjoy his presence in her own feeling; she does not have his mountain-leaping, hill-skipping presence.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In other words, she is seeking after pleasure in her feeling, and she is reluctant to participate in any activity in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Putting it in still another way, she has not yet learned the lesson, and she cannot follow the Lord everywhere and under any circumstances with just faith.</S>
