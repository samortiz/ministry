   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Need for a Chinese-speaking Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Bay area, for instance, I did my best to avoid this trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some of you, I know, also tried to avoid this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In fact, I am concerned that among some of you there is still the desire to avoid this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If in your heart you are thinking, How good it will be if there is no Chinese-speaking meeting, you are trying to avoid this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the situation does not give you any way to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you avoid this, the church which you take care of will surely suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It has been suffering already.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At least three years ago, a Chinese-speaking meeting should have been set up in the Bay area.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am not criticizing; at most I am analyzing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Three years ago there was a great demand for such a meeting, but there was a strong avoiding.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I did not say anything at that time, because I knew the time was not ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But don t think I feel the time is ripe now so I am initiating it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The setting up of Chinese meetings was not initiated by me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was Abraham Chang who started it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since it has been initiated, however, the tide is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we, all of us, refuse to have a Chinese-speaking meeting set up in the Bay area, the church will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I do not say this in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By the Lord s mercy, I speak very seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Especially three or four places in the Bay area need such a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no need to mention San Francisco because that is almost a Chinese meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But San Jose and Berkeley both need one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Probably Sacramento does too; I m not sure.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As for the other places in the Bay area, like Santa Cruz, Pleasant Hill, and Hayward, the scale is still small and the need has not yet become evident.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But where there is a need, if we delay, under today s atmosphere the church will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must consider how to find a way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Tonight we have a number of brothers added.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Most of them are the ones who will take care of such meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This doesn t mean that they are elders or will be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A Complicated Situation</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let me give you an illustration of the type of situation you will face.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Last weekend four brothers from Palo Alto told me that they now have twenty saints coming together in a brother s home for the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They feel a meeting is needed, and they are ready to have the church life started there.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I told them that we did attempt to start the church life in Palo Alto more than five years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then I received a phone call from a brother who already had a little meeting there under his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After resigning from the eldership in San Francisco, he took over a little group which was an outpost of the church in San Francisco.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some saints were unhappy about it, so instead of joining him they kept going to San Francisco or San Jose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When this brother heard that the brothers in the Bay area had a burden to start the church life in Palo Alto, he called me, saying, Brother Lee, we are all one family.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are already here, meeting as a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why are the brothers coming here to compete with us?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I realized the situation was complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Without hesitating, I fellowshipped with the brothers that probably the time was not right.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The number was few, although one brother had bought a house for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since there were so few who would be going there, it would be better not to go and get involved in the complicated situation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because of this, the brothers retreated, and the one who had bought a house sold it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Well, when the four brothers from Palo Alto came to me this time, I realized that they were aware of that situation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I told them, The problem still exists there.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you want to start the church life, you surely need to clarify some of those things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then they asked how to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First of all, I answered them, you must clarify yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Why did we feel the situation there in Palo Alto was not clear?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We were deeply concerned as to whether they were clear about the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We also questioned, sorry to say, whether their motive was pure.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Was their understanding of the truth clear?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Was their motive pure?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These questions bothered us because of the way that outpost was taken over.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If there was the likelihood that that outpost was going to be a church, it should have been done under a sweet fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But there was no fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All of a sudden a kind of church was set up.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If there were no other city on earth which had a church, there might not be a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But Palo Alto is one city among many cities in the Bay area with churches; and it was originally an outpost of an already-existing church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For such an outpost suddenly to become a church without fellowshipping with the nearby churches raises the question as to what kind of ground it is on.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Brothers, I continued, this complicated situation came about because of doubtful ground and a motive not so pure.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you want to begin the church life, how about your motive?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you are unhappy with the church you are now attending and still think this is the time to start a church in your locality they all live in Palo Alto , this doesn t qualify you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If my motive was not pure, even if the conditions were favorable, even if I knew about the flesh and the lesson of the cross, I would never start a church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I would choose rather to drive a half hour to keep meeting in that place, even if that is another city.</S>
