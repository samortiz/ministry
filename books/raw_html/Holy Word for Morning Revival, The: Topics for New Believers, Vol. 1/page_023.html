<p class="bold">WEEK 4 — DAY 2</p><h2 class="uhead1">Scripture Reading</h2><p class="bold">1 Thes. 1:9 &nbsp;…You turned to God from the idols to serve a living and true God.</p><p class="bold">Acts 19:19 &nbsp;And a considerable number of those who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them before all; and they counted up the price of them and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.</p><p>[Third], the New Testament contains distinct examples showing us that after a man is saved, the Spirit begins to move and work in him, causing him to clear the past and to deal with the improper things of the past.</p><h2 class="head1">Abandoning Idols</h2><p>One example of the clearance of the past is seen in the case of the Thessalonians [1 Thes. 1:9].<sup>83</sup> To turn to God from idols is not only to turn away from false gods, with the devil and demons at their back, but also from all things that replace God.<sup>84</sup> After a person is saved, whether he is about to be baptized or has already been baptized, he must clear away from his living the idols and things related to idols.…If he finds it difficult to do the clearing, he may find some brothers to pray with him in order to increase his strength and boldness and thereby to help him with the clearing. However, he must do the clearing himself, and do it thoroughly, the more thoroughly the better.</p><p>There are things related to the reading of facial features, fortune-telling, horoscopes, and divination. Since these things involve idols, they should be terminated. It is improper for a believer…to have idols or other superstitious things remaining in his home. We must abandon all things that are related to idols.…Not only should we throw out other images, but we should give up even portraits or statues of Jesus.…The Bible says that, when He was on earth, the Lord Jesus had no form nor comeliness (Isa. 53:2). However, the images of Jesus most commonly seen today look very beautiful.…These pictures represent human superstitions, and in the eyes of God they are blasphemous; hence, they should be disposed of.</p><p>We should use our spirit to worship the Lord, who is Spirit (John 4:24); we should not use our physical body to worship a visible image. The Catholic Church teaches [heretically] that man should worship a visible image with his physical body in order to help him to worship the invisible God with his inner spirit.…We should not follow such a teaching. We should worship the Lord in spirit and not have any outward images.</p><h2 class="head1">Destroying the Demonic and Dirty Things</h2><p>A second example of the clearance of the past is seen in the case of the Ephesians. Acts 19:19 tells us that the Ephesian believers who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them. This is the basis for our practice of burning for the destruction of the demonic and dirty things, the improper things. Examples of these things are the candlesticks and censers used in idol worship, ornaments and clothing with the image of the dragon, sacred writings of heathen religions, books and charms pertaining to divination, and tablets related to ancestral worship. Other examples are gambling instruments, utensils for alcoholic drinking, pipes for smoking, obscene books, and pornographic pictures. [Unbecoming clothing also is in this category.] All these things are demonic and filthy. We all must follow the leading of the Holy Spirit to remove all such things from our lives and our homes.</p><p>In brief, anything related to idols and any demonic and filthy thing, however valuable it may be, should be burned. The biblical principle is that such things should be burned with fire. The Bible records, in particular, that the price of the items which were burned by the Ephesians was fifty thousand pieces of silver. This is to show us that, when they destroyed the demonic and unclean things, the early believers burned a number of valuable things. Therefore, when we destroy the demonic and dirty things, we should not count the cost or the loss.<sup>85</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
