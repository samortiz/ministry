Any saint who knows the New Testament teachings logically and reasonably and who is faithful to the Lord according to His holy and unchanging Word would not care for the unbridled speakings in the present turmoil. So, the rebellion is truly a test to the faithful ones for their approvedness (1 Cor. 11:19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Purification to the Recovery</H2><P>A rebellion always brings about some sifting among God's people. This sifting can be considered as a kind of purification exercised by the Lord's sovereignty to purify His collective people. Furthermore, the occurring of a rebellion also renders some purification to the faithful ones in their intention, their motive, their purpose, their aims, and other matters. To some extent I have been purified. During the turmoil, when I heard that people slandered me and defamed me, as the Lord said in Matthew 5:11, "Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and say every evil thing against you, lying, for My sake," I checked with the Lord to find out if I was wrong. By such checking, I was purified.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PROPER WAY TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEMS<br>IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>Now we need to see the proper way to take care of the problems in the Lord's recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>With a Genuine and Sincere Concern<br>for the Lord's Recovery</H2><P>To take care of the problems in the recovery, we must have a genuine and sincere concern for the Lord's recovery, without any biased view concerning any matter. Furthermore, we should not have any element of self-interest, self-plotting, self-esteem, and self-consideration. We must be unbiased, fair, and pure, without any background that would affect us. We must abandon our self-esteem and self-consideration. We all have our own prestige, and we like to highly esteem ourselves. We also expect that others will esteem us highly. As long as we seek self-esteem in the church life, we become a problem. Perhaps we are always considering, "What about me, my position, my future, and my interest?" If we are considering ourselves all the time in this way, we are unable to take care of problems in the Lord's recovery. In order to take care of the problems, we must be pure, tested, and checked by the Lord. When we have a pure, genuine, and sincere concern for the Lord's recovery, we are qualified to take care of the problems. Otherwise, we become a problem.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
