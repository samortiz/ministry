<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. In His Becoming the Lamb</H2><P>In His becoming the Lamb for the redemption of the lost world, Christ speaks to us how God accomplished His redemption judicially through His death as the procedure according to His righteousness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. In His Becoming the Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>In His becoming the Spirit for life-giving and transforming (1 Cor. 15:45), Christ speaks to us further how God carries out His economy organically by His divine life for His divine purpose according to His heart's desire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. In His Being the Heavenly Ladder</H2><P>Christ, in His being the heavenly ladder at Bethel, also speaks to us how God desires to have a house on the earth constituted with His redeemed and transformed elect, that He may bring heaven to earth and join earth to heaven, to make the two as one for eternity.</P><P>The Word of God is Christ in His creation, in His incarnation, in His becoming the Lamb, in His becoming the life-giving Spirit, and in His being the ladder. In these five greatest historical events, Christ speaks for God. In this sense, we may say that the creation is the Word, the incarnation is the Word, the Lamb is the Word, the Spirit is the Word, and the ladder is the Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>P.S. In the Warfare for God's Kingdom</H2><P>In addition to all the above items, John, in his last writing, Revelation, tells us that even in the warfare for the kingdom of God, Christ is the Word of God speaking for God's purpose (Rev. 19:13). When He comes to fight God's enemies for the kingdom, His name is called the Word of God. In His fighting He is God's speaking. Christ is the Word of God speaking for God's purpose.</P>
