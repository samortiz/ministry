<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah Cleansing Israel and Giving Them<br />
a New Heart and a New Spirit</h2>
<p>Jehovah made a promise to Israel, saying, &ldquo;I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your filthiness and from all your idols I will cleanse you. I will also give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and My ordinances you shall keep and do&rdquo; (36:25-27). God will give them a new heart. This new heart enables them to love God and everything of God. God will put a new spirit within them so that their spirit is enlivened and renewed. God will also give them a heart of flesh so that they are soft and sensitive toward God. God also promised that He would put His Spirit within them so that His Spirit can always strengthen them in their new spirit, causing them to have the strength to love God and to fellowship with Him. Thus, the restored people of Israel in the kingdom age will be able to walk in God&rsquo;s statutes and keep His ordinances.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Holy Temple, the Holy Land,<br />
and the Holy City Being Recovered</h2>
<p>In Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision recorded in chapters 40 through 48, the recovery of Israel will include the holy temple, the Holy Land, and the holy city. The captivity of the children of Israel occurred in 606 B.C. About thirty years after their captivity, in 574 B.C., Ezekiel saw the vision of Israel&rsquo;s restoration. Then after approximately forty years, in 536 B.C., some of the Israelites returned to the land of their forefathers as decreed by Cyrus the king of Persia. First, they recovered the altar (Ezra 3:2), then God&rsquo;s temple (vv. 8-13), and finally the city (Neh. 2:17-18). The temple that was built at the time of their return from captivity was eventually replaced by Herod&rsquo;s temple, which was built in forty-six years (John 2:20). However, neither the temple rebuilt in Ezra&rsquo;s days nor Herod&rsquo;s temple at the time of the Lord Jesus could compare in measurement, scale, or glory to the temple Ezekiel saw in his vision. Therefore, what Ezekiel saw concerns Israel in the restoration.</p>
<p>According to Ezekiel 40 through 48, God will gain the holy temple, the Holy Land, and the holy city among the restored Israelites. The emphasis of the holy temple is the presence of God, the fellowship of God, and the service for God. The existence of the holy temple depends on the Holy Land. If there is no Holy Land, there will not be a building site for the holy temple. At the same time, the Holy Land provides a place for those who serve in the holy temple to live, dwell, and enjoy. Therefore, in order to have the holy temple, there must be the Holy Land. The holy city is for government and administration so that God can have a center of administration among His people. The conclusion of the book of Ezekiel is that God will eventually gain a holy temple and a holy city in the Holy Land. Whether it is the temple or the city, it is where God is, it is His dwelling place, and it is His resting place.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The prophet Jeremiah prophesied concerning Jehovah&rsquo;s promise to restore Israel. Jehovah will gather the remnant of His flock out of all the lands where He had driven them, and will raise up shepherds over them to feed them. In that day Jehovah will raise up to David a righteous Shoot, Christ, who will reign as King and act prudently and who will execute justice and righteousness in the land. Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. The restoration of Israel will take place after Jehovah chastises Israel with justice. The city will be rebuilt on its mound, and the palace will be inhabited after its own manner. Jehovah will turn again Israel&rsquo;s captivity, and He will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beast, and they will be rich in life. Jehovah will multiply the Israelites so that they will not be few, and He will cause them to be honored so that they will not be small. Their children will be as they were of old, and their seed will not cease from being a nation before Jehovah forever. Jehovah will not cast off the seed of Israel because of all that they have done. He will make a new covenant with the house of Israel so that His law is put within them and written upon their hearts. Jehovah will be their God, and they will be His people. They will no longer teach each man his neighbor and each man his brother, for all of them will know Him. Jehovah will forgive their iniquity and will remember their sin no more. He will also restore the holy city and the Holy Land, and the city of Jerusalem will be recovered and healed. The voice of gladness will be heard in the city of Jerusalem. In the Holy Land there will be a habitation of shepherds making their flock lie down. Jehovah will never break His covenant with David and the Levites, and He will never reject them. The good word which was spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah will be established. Jehovah will also multiply the seed of David His servant and the Levites His ministers.</p>
<p>The prophet Ezekiel also prophesied concerning the restoration of Israel. God will set up David as a shepherd to care for them, make a covenant of peace with them, and make them a blessing. God is the God of Israel and Israel is His people. Jehovah will cleanse Israel and give them a new heart and a new spirit so that the restored Israelites will walk in His statutes and keep His ordinances. Finally, the holy temple, the Holy Land, and the holy city will be recovered. God will gain a holy temple and a holy city in the Holy Land to be His dwelling place and His resting place.</p>
