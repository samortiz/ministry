<h2 class="head3">2. By God&rsquo;s Direct Dealing</h2>
<p>Jacob&rsquo;s transformation was accomplished also by God&rsquo;s direct dealing. At Penuel, God in the form of a man wrestled with Jacob until dawn. God did this to expose Jacob&rsquo;s natural life. Then God touched the hollow of his thigh, and he became lame (Gen. 32:22-32). This signifies that throughout Jacob&rsquo;s life he was struggling with God. Finally, in the matter of Joseph&rsquo;s being sold, Jacob was brought by God to a place where he no longer had any strength&mdash;he had become lame. Suddenly, he understood God&rsquo;s dealing, and he was matured in life to become Israel. <em>El</em> in the name Israel means &ldquo;God.&rdquo; God gave Jacob this name to signify that he had experienced God&rsquo;s dealing and had reached maturity. He was God&rsquo;s overcomer, God&rsquo;s prince. He was full of God&rsquo;s element and became God&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<p>Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty, through the sufferings in his circumstances and through God&rsquo;s direct dealing, Jacob was transformed and matured so that he became Israel. Therefore, he symbolizes one who has been regenerated and transformed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Symbolizing One Who<br />
Can Bless People on God&rsquo;s Behalf</h2>
<p>After Jacob had become mature in life, God accompanied him to Egypt (Gen. 46:4a). According to the record in the Bible, there he did nothing but bless others. First, he blessed Pharaoh, and later he blessed each of his own sons.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Knowing the Desire of God&rsquo;s Heart</h2>
<p>In contrast to Isaac, Jacob did not bless blindly. Rather, his sky was clear and he knew the desire of God&rsquo;s heart. Joseph brought his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, to Jacob that he might bless them. He led his older son, Manasseh, toward Jacob&rsquo;s right hand and his younger son, Ephraim, toward Jacob&rsquo;s left hand, expecting that Jacob would place his right hand on Manasseh&rsquo;s head and his left hand on Ephraim&rsquo;s head. However, when Jacob stretched forth his hands to bless them, he crossed his hands. Joseph was displeased and lifted up Jacob&rsquo;s hand to remove it from Ephraim&rsquo;s head and place it on Manasseh&rsquo;s head. But Jacob refused and said, &ldquo;I know it, my son, I know it&rdquo; (Gen. 48:8-20). Although Jacob&rsquo;s eyes were dim with age, his spirit was clear. He knew that God&rsquo;s desire was to place Ephraim above Manasseh. Therefore, he did not bless according to Joseph&rsquo;s arrangement but according to the desire of God&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Blessings Becoming Prophecies</h2>
<p>Jacob&rsquo;s blessings became prophecies because his blessings were shining with light and fit in with God&rsquo;s purpose. Therefore, whatever blessings he gave to his sons became God&rsquo;s prophecies to them. All that is recorded in the Bible from Exodus to Revelation constitutes the accomplishing and the fulfilling of the prophecies in Jacob&rsquo;s blessings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Signifying the Stage of Maturity<br />
in the Life of a Complete, Spiritual Man</h2>
<p>In his old age, when Jacob heard that Joseph had been made governor of Egypt, his reactions were twofold: &ldquo;his heart was numb&rdquo; and &ldquo;his spirit revived&rdquo; (Gen. 45:26-27, lit.). His soul-life had already become dead, and his spirit and soul could be divided. When he arrived in Egypt, he did not demand anything; he only blessed others. Thus, Jacob in his old age signifies the stage of maturity in the life of a complete, spiritual man. In this respect he is unlike Abraham and Isaac, who signify only the initial stage of the experience and life of a spiritually mature person, and not the maturity of a spiritual person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Esau, born the oldest son, the first, symbolizes the natural man, which is hated by God. He was a skillful hunter and was loved by his father according to the natural man. His father loved him because he often ate of Esau&rsquo;s venison. Therefore, Esau also symbolizes the preference of the natural man. Although he was the firstborn son, he despised his birthright and sold it for a morsel of meat. Later, when he desired to inherit his father&rsquo;s blessing, he was rejected.</p>
<p>Jacob symbolizes a chosen one. Before the twins were born and before they had done anything good or bad, God chose Jacob. Jacob, the younger of the twins, was the second. As such, he symbolizes the natural man who has been regenerated to become a spiritual person, who is loved by God. He also inherited the promise given by God to Abraham and Isaac, namely, that all the families of the earth would be blessed in Christ. Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty, through the sufferings in his circumstances and through God&rsquo;s direct dealing, Jacob was transformed and matured so that he became Israel. Therefore, he symbolizes one who has been regenerated and transformed. When he was mature in life, he went down to Egypt, and there he did nothing but bless others. He knew the desire of God&rsquo;s heart, and all his blessings became prophecies. Therefore, he also symbolizes one who can bless others on behalf of God. Furthermore, he signifies the stage of maturity in the life of a complete, spiritual person, and in this respect he is unlike Abraham and Isaac, who signify only the initial stage of the experience and life of a spiritually mature person.</p>
