<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE PROPER HUMANITY FOR THE CHURCH</H2><P>God wants a group of people who are filled with Him and express Him&#151;just like the Lord Jesus. For this we must have the proper humanity, which is the basic structure and strength of the church. Satan tries to frustrate God's purpose by attacking man's humanity. He especially attacks the young people with immorality, drugs, and mental illness. These things can damage young people to the point that they become useless for God's expression. We should not be ignorant of the enemy's tactics. Too many young people have been ruined and even killed by drugs and alcohol.</P><P>The Lord Jesus is living in us. You should sense the Lord objecting in your conscience when you begin to go too far in the things you do, the things you look at, and even the clothes you wear. Too many things in the world are designed to stir up people's lust&#151;lust which Satan uses to damage humanity. In such matters you should not be too "spiritual," thinking that you can resist any temptation. Flee first! Then, seek the Lord with all them who call on Him out of a pure heart (2 Tim. 2:22).</P><P>The things we mentioned above must be more than clear to us. We must also realize that even our sloppiness and laziness can frustrate the Lord. You should sense the Lord objecting inside you when you throw your socks on the floor. It is easier to leave them there, but that is not the humanity of the God-man; that is your lazy self. What will your friends see when they visit your room? You may preach to them often about the Lord but they will only remember your messy room. How we need to enjoy the Lord's fine humanity! We, as the church, must be very different from today's constantly degrading society so that God can be expressed through the highest humanity.</P><P>Do not say, "I am not Jesus, I cannot be like Him. When I get older I will be better." No! Today, when you see that you are short of the standard of Jesus' humanity, you can open to Him, call on Him, and receive the Spirit. We cannot imitate the Lord's human living, but it can become ours by our taking Him in. We have said repeatedly that all that Christ is and has done is now in the life-giving Spirit. The Spirit today is the Spirit of the man Jesus. Not only is there divinity in the Spirit but even more there is the humanity of Jesus. This is the way to grow up into Christ in all things. You cannot be like Christ by imitation, but neither should you wait for the future to be like Him. Today is the day we can take Him in, live Him, and be "Jesusly" human. His highest, finest, and perfect humanity is our need today for the church life. Then God will be expressed through man for the testimony of Jesus. When we have such a living, others will be touched and will be attracted to the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Which verses prove that Jesus was a genuine man?</li><li>Which verses prove that Jesus was a perfect man?</li><li>Which verses show that Jesus lived by the Father's life and worked by the Spirit's power?</li><li>Explain how the highest, finest, and perfect humanity of Jesus is our present need for the church life.</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Concerning the Person of Christ, pp. 32-35.</li><li>Christ as the Reality, pp. 61-63, 69-78, 131-136, 153-159.</li><li>Life-study of Luke, pp. 68-69, 84-87, 129-130, 137-138.</li><li>The Divine Dispensing of the Divine Trinity, pp. 19-21.</li><li>Life-study of Matthew, pp. 410-411.</li></ol>
