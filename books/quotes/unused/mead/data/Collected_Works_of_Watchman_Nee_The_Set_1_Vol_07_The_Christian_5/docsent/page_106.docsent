   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Issue No. 10 THE EDITOR AND THE READERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the summer I went to Anhwei to conduct meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On my way back I passed by Shanghai and got a heat stroke, which put me in bed for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In my sickness I received the necessary lessons from God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thank the Lord for His grace!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you receive this issue of the magazine, I will have left for work in southern Fukien already.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>May you not forget to pray for your weak brother.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The subscriptions of this paper have reached over 1,300.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But our goal is far more than this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We hope that the readers will do their best to introduce it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE EDITOR</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While I was conducting meetings in Anhwei in the summer, some readers from southern Fukien wrote to change their address.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The envelope was addressed to the editor, and the workers in the Gospel Book Room dared not open it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They transferred the letter to me in Anhwei.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I had to then transfer the letter back to Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is a pity that such a small thing as a change of address brought about such delay in time and work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the future, anything that has to do with publication matters should be directed to the Gospel Book Room and should not have my name on the envelope.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As for matters related to the editor, please send to "The editor, The Christian magazine, Pagoda, Fukien."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No matter where the editor is, someone will transfer the letter to me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Please do not forget to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Issue No. 11 AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE CHRISTIAN</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the eleventh issue of The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The next issue will be No. 12.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After that issue, The Christian will have finished its whole year's work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We thank the Lord that He has blessed us during the past year to serve readers on time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have often received letters from readers telling us how they have received help from The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This does not make us proud.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the contrary, it humbles us to realize that God would use such insignificant vessels as we.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although our work is difficult, we are emboldened by the letters from you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May God bless both the editor and the readers!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The subscription period is about to expire!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The important thing to do now is to renew the subscription.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We ask those readers who have subscribed for only twelve issues to note that this is already the eleventh issue.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The next issue will be your last issue.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you do not renew, we will stop mailing to you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You should not lose your friend, The Christian!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We ask that you send in your money to renew your subscription the same day that you receive this issue so that you will not forget later.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The editor of this paper is seriously praying and considering how to improve the content of The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He does not know if he should continue with the "Exposition Issues."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you have any suggestions, please mail to Mr. Nee directly for his reference.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A detailed list of our books is printed on the back cover of this paper.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Issue No. 12 ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE EDITOR OF THE CHRISTIAN</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>PLEASE READ FIRST</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now is the end of a year.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We confess that there were many shortages in our work this year.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We ask that the Lord would forgive our failures, and we ask that you would pardon our oversights.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We fully realize that we are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If anyone has received salvation or has been helped or edified, may all the glory go to God the Father!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We thank God that He has blessed us during this year so that in everything we see His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We thank Him even more for not despising our smallness, but He has used us, the humble vessels, to accomplish something for Him according to His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We praise Him because He has used this humble paper, The Christian, to remind and revive His own children.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even some sinners have been saved through reading The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What more can we say?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We can only give glory and honor to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How solemn a work it is to be commissioned by God to expound His holy Word!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we think of this, we cannot help but stand in fear and awe.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are very willing to communicate to you through our pages the things that you have known, believed, and obeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, our goal is not to please men, but to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we are still pleasing men, how can we be considered the servants of God?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If there is any word in this paper that has pricked your heart, please search the Scriptures before the Lord, trusting in His Holy Spirit, and consider how God would lead and teach you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Please forgive us for our zeal!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We do this because we want to proclaim the whole counsel of God so that His children would fully obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If not for this, are we not aware that we have to treasure man's friendship?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But we thank God that most of our readers are sympathetic toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Most of the saints today love the truth, but not the whole truth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I hope that we will not be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are reluctant to speak many serious words.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But what else can we do when we know that this is God's commandment?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Please forgive us for our forthrightness!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We believe that the day of the return of our Lord Jesus is near.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But we do not know the date.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Hence, we like to do more to awaken God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We have done this, but we will do more next year.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The spiritual life of the saints is also very important.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We wish to pay more attention to this point in the coming days, according to the strength that the Lord has provided us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As to the recent heresies, errors, and human traditions, we will surely issue the warnings according to the teaching of Jude 3.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We desire that we will be able to say, as Paul did, that we have not held back anything that is profitable to you.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Finally, if the Lord delays His coming, and if He wants us to continue testifying for Him, we are very willing to serve all of you again next year.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In lifting our eyes to the condition of today, we see that dusk is approaching and a storm is imminent.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Who knows what the Lord's disciples will face?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The present hours of vanity will soon be over, and the eternal glory is before our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Let us consider more the Lord Jesus who has died for us!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>December, 1926</S>
