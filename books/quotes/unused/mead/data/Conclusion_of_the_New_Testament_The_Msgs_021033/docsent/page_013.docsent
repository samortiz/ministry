   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR CHRIST HIS PERSON 4</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Having considered Christ s person in the Godhead, we shall go on in this message to see Christ s person in the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The aspects of Christ s person in the Godhead are deep, but the aspects of Christ s person in the divine economy are even deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>B. IN THE DIVINE ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is the divine economy?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The divine economy is God s household management, God s household administrative arrangement, the divine dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1 Timothy 1:4 we see God s household administration, which is to dispense Himself into His children so that He may have a household, the church, to express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The English word economy is an anglicized form of the Greek word oikonomia, which is composed of two words: oikos, meaning house, and nomos, meaning law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, oikonomia refers to the house arrangement, household management or administration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word denotes the management and distribution of the wealth of a rich household.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Joseph in the Old Testament, for example, was the administrator of Pharaoh s house, which was so rich that it could supply other nations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There was the need of some management and administration in order to distribute the riches of Pharaoh s house.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This illustration helps us to see that oikonomia is a household management to distribute and dispense the riches of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our Father has a great house with a vast store of the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This great house needs some administration, some management, to dispense all these riches into God s people for the producing of the church as the corporate expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s economy, therefore, is His household administration to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people so that He may have a house, a household, to express Himself, which household is the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this message we need to see Christ in this divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s Anointed</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the divine economy Christ is God s Anointed, the Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Concerning this, John 1:41 says, He found first his own brother Simon and said to him, We have found the Messiah which translated means Christ .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Messiah is Hebrew; Christ is Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Both mean the anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is God s Anointed, the One appointed by God to accomplish God s purpose, His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In John 20:31 we see that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God: These have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Christ is the title of the Lord according to His office, His mission.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Son of God is His title according to His person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is the Son of God to be the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Matthew 16 Peter received a revelation from the Father concerning Jesus being the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Prior to this chapter, the Lord had been with His disciples for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During this time, they came to know Him rather well.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, one day He took these disciples far away from the holy city and the holy temple to Caesarea Philippi, and there He asked them a question: Who do men say that the Son of Man is?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Matt 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They replied, Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets v. 14 . All these answers were according to the natural, religious mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord then directed the question to them: But you, who do you say that I am? v. 15 . Then Peter declared, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 . Here the definite article before the word Christ is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Its importance is explained as follows.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ is the anglicized form of the Greek word Christos, which is equivalent to the Hebrew Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As we have indicated, both Messiah in Hebrew and Christos in Greek mean the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The term Messiah, the anointed One, is used in Daniel 9:26, which says, After threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This refers to Jesus Christ, who is the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to the Old Testament principle, anyone used by God to carry out His administration had to be anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, the kings, priests, and prophets were all anointed when they came into function.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This indicates that the anointing is for the carrying out of God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For the carrying out of God s administration, His economy, Christ is God s Anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The title Christ refers to the Lord s commission.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His commission is to accomplish God s eternal purpose through His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and second advent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When this anointed One was crucified, He was carrying out His function as the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Not only His death but also His resurrection and ascension were part of His function.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, Christ, the anointed One, carried out His function through crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension so that God may dispense Himself into us for the producing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From this we see that the Lord is the anointed One to accomplish God s purpose to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Through the function of Christ, the anointed One, the Triune God is dispensed into us for the producing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As the One anointed by God Christ is the appointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His appointment is related to His commission.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ has been appointed to carry out the intention of God, the Appointer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, as God s anointed One, the Messiah, Christ has been commissioned by God to carry out the desire of His heart.</S>
