   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE NINETEEN THE VISION OF THE HOLY BUILDING OF GOD Scripture Reading: Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>40:1-27</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing messages we saw the appearance of the glory of the Lord, the judgment of God by fire, and the recovery of the Lord by life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we come to the last section of Ezekiel chs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>40 48 , which is concerned with the holy building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The three previous sections are for the last section; that is, the glory of the Lord, the judgment of God, and the recovery of the Lord are all for the holy building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may even say that the issue of the glory of the Lord, the judgment of God, and the recovery of the Lord is the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s eternal purpose is to have a building.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whatever God does among His people on earth is for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE TIME OF THE VISION</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the very beginning of this section 40:1 , we are told the time of the vision the year, the month, and the day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we compare the year mentioned here with that mentioned at the beginning of the first chapter, we will see that there is a difference of twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The vision of the appearance of the glory of the Lord which Ezekiel saw in chapter one was seen in the fifth year of the captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The vision of the building of God s house which he saw in chapter forty was in the twenty-fifth year of the captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is a difference of twenty years, which is not a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to remember that when Ezekiel saw the first vision, he was thirty years of age, the age at which a priest began to function.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When he saw the last vision, he was fifty years of age, the age of retirement for a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is very meaningful, for it indicates that to see the building of God, Ezekiel needed more maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When he saw the first vision, he was still rather young, only thirty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when he saw the vision of God s building, he was at the age of retirement, indicating that he attained further maturity in life and could see the building of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To see the vision of God s building, maturity in life is required.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Due to their immaturity in the divine life, very few of today s Christians have seen anything regarding the Lord s building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Spiritually speaking, many are far below the age of thirty and thus are not even qualified to be an apprentice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, it is not possible for them to see the vision of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is significant that the years are counted in increments of five.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first vision was seen in the fifth year, and the last vision was seen in the twenty-fifth year.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Twenty-five is five times five.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Bible the number five signifies man plus God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Four is the number of the creature, man, and one is the number for the Creator, God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Five signifies the bearing of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, five, which is composed of four plus one, signifies that man as a creature plus God as the Creator together bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The number twenty-five signifies not only maturity but also the full qualification for bearing responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This year is also called the fourteenth year.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The twenty-fifth year was counted from the time of the captivity, whereas the fourteenth year was counted from the time of the destruction of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ezekiel 40:1 says, After that the city was smitten.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Bible the number fourteen is composed mainly of seven times two.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Seven is the number of completion, and two is the number of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, seven times two denotes a testimony of completion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This indicates that for fourteen years the destruction of the city of Jerusalem had been a strong testimony to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Originally, the people did not believe that the city would be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nevertheless, Ezekiel prophesied concerning the destruction of the city of Jerusalem, and his prophecy was fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Fourteen years after the destruction of Jerusalem, Ezekiel saw further visions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that the testimony of the destruction of the city was sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It stood for fourteen years, and after those fourteen years the people in captivity realized that it was a strong testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, we are told that Ezekiel saw the visions at the beginning of the year, in the first month.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The first month indicates a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This indicates that with us in our experience, the building of God must have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we see something regarding the building up of the church, this is a new start in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The record speaks also of the tenth day.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to Exodus 12:3 the tenth day of the first month was the day that the people of Israel prepared the lamb for the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This surely points to Christ, our Passover, for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From this we see that whenever we have a new beginning in our Christian life, it must be based on Christ and His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In ourselves, by what we are and what we can do, we can never have a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are not qualified to have a new beginning, and we have no merit to have a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Any new beginning that we can have in our spiritual life is always based on Christ, the Passover Lamb, and His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only by Christ and His redemption can we have a new beginning in our Christian life.</S>
