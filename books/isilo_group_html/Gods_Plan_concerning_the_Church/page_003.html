<p>Ephesians 1 and 3 reveal that God has an economy in His plan concerning the church. His economy is a kind of management, administration, and arrangement. The Greek word for <em>economy</em> in these chapters has the same meaning as <em>economy</em> in economics. Before God created all things, He had a plan in Himself to manage something for Himself. This management requires an administration and an arrangement. If we read the Bible carefully, we will touch this thought of God.</p>
<p>Verse 2 of chapter 3 speaks of the stewardship of the grace of God. The Greek word for <em>stewardship</em> is the same word for <em>economy.</em> Hence, the stewardship of the grace God can also be rendered as &ldquo;the economy of the grace of God,&rdquo; &ldquo;the economics of the grace of God,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the administration of the grace of God.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s economy concerning the church involves His management of grace, that is, His economics of grace. God wants to manage His church in His grace.</p>
<p>We must pay attention to three points concerning the economy of God. The first point is related to the resources of the economy. An economy is managed with resources and uses all its available resources. What resources does God manage in His economy? In eternity God planned to have the church in Himself. Therefore, God in His plan manages His economy with Himself as the resources. He is the resources and the material for the producing of the church.</p>
<p>Verse 19 says that the church is &ldquo;filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; Colossians 2:9-10 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and you have been made full in Him.&rdquo; All the fullness of the Godhead is in Christ and is gained by us in Christ. Eventually, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God. This means that God provides Himself as the resources for managing His economy to produce the church. God is using all His fullness, which is Himself, as the resources for His management of His economy and as the material for His building of the church. God wants to work Himself into the church and to express all His fullness through the church.</p>
<p>The second point that we must pay attention to is that management requires not only resources but also power. Since God manages His economy with Himself as the resources, the driving power of His management is His great power. Ephesians 1:19 through 21 speaks of &ldquo;the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power.&rdquo; This power is exceedingly great; it is the all-transcending power of God that raised Christ from the dead and caused Him to ascend to the heavens.</p>
<p>Verse 20 of chapter 3 says that God is able to do superabundantly according to the power which operates in us. This power is not only God&rsquo;s creating power but also His resurrecting power. The Bible reveals that God calls things not being as being and also gives life to the dead (Rom. 4:17). God&rsquo;s creating power calls things not being as being, and His resurrecting power gives life to the dead. Both God&rsquo;s creating power and His resurrecting power are His power. However, God&rsquo;s resurrecting power includes His creating power and surpasses His creating power. Whenever we speak of God&rsquo;s resurrecting power, we are speaking of all His power. God is using His power as the driving power in the management of His economy to produce the church. Thus, He can express His infinite power through the church.</p>
<p>The third point that we need to pay attention to is that in addition to resources and power, management also involves methods. In managing and building a house, we need materials, power, and also methods. The method that God uses in His management of His economy is His wisdom. Concerning what God is to the church, Ephesians and Colossians speak of God&rsquo;s fullness, God&rsquo;s power, and God&rsquo;s wisdom. God&rsquo;s fullness is the resources for His management of His economy to produce the church. God&rsquo;s power is the driving power of His management. God&rsquo;s wisdom is the method of His management.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:8 says that God caused His grace to the church &ldquo;to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence.&rdquo; Also, verse 10 of chapter 3 says, &ldquo;In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church.&rdquo; Concerning Christ, Colossians 2:3 says, &ldquo;In whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.&rdquo; This means that all God&rsquo;s wisdom is hidden in Christ. All God&rsquo;s wisdom is gained by us in Christ and is expressed through us. God&rsquo;s wisdom is the method by which He manages His economy. Eventually, God&rsquo;s multifarious wisdom will be expressed in the universe through the church.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s management He is the resources, His power is the driving power, and His wisdom is the method. Everything is out of God; there is no room for anything that is out of man. God does not need human power or wisdom in His management of His economy to produce the church. Those who have been taught by God know that in touching the church, they must reject their own power, wisdom, and everything.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>God's Plan concerning the Church &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
