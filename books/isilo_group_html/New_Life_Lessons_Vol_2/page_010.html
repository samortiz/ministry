<p>After we are saved and have come to know the Lord Jesus Christ, we still need to go on to know the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. WHAT IS THE CHURCH?</h2>
<p>The first time you heard the word <em>church,</em> what did you think the church was?</p>
<p>The church is not a cathedral,<br />
a chapel, or a meeting hall. <br />
It is not a house or a building. <br />
It is not a human organization. <br />
It is not a religious group.</p>
<p>1. THE CHURCH IS THE CONGREGATION OF THE CALLED ONES</p>
<p>In the original language the word <em>church</em> is <em>ekklesia.</em> It is composed of two words. The first word is <em>ek,</em> which means &ldquo;out,&rdquo; and the second is derived from <em>kaleo,</em> which means &ldquo;to call.&rdquo; When these two words are put together, they mean a congregation of called out ones, or a gathering of the called ones.</p>
<p>Hence, from the meaning of the word itself, the church is a group of people called out of the world by God to gather together.</p>
<p>2. THE CHURCH IS THE BODY OF CHRIST</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo;</strong> Ephesians 1:22b-23</p>
<h2 class="head2">(1) The Fullness of Christ</h2>
<p>The fullness of Christ is the Body of Christ as His expression. The church as the fullness of Christ is the overflow of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">(2) That Which Comes out of Christ</h2>
<p>As Eve came out of Adam (Gen. 2:21-24), so also the church is out of Christ.</p>
<p>From this we know that:</p>
<p>The church is a living organism, <br />
not a dead organization.<br />
The church takes Christ as her Head.<br />
The church shares the same<br />
life and nature as Christ.<br />
The church is the fullness of Christ, <br />
the expression of Christ.</p>
<p>3. THE CHURCH IS THE HOUSE OF THE LIVING GOD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;That you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.&rdquo;</strong> 1 Timothy 3:15</p>
<p>The church is the house of God,<br />
the place of His rest.<br />
The church is the place where God<br />
manifests Himself on earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH<br />
IN RELATION TO GOD</h2>
<p>1. TO EXPRESS GOD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His [God&rsquo;s] will.&rdquo;</strong>  Ephesians 1:5</p>
<p>The meaning of sonship through Jesus Christ is that through Him we are redeemed and regenerated to become the children of God, possessing the life and position of God&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>God predestinated us (the church) to receive sonship, so that He Himself may be expressed through us.</p>
<p>2. TO DEAL WITH THE ENEMY</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the church the multifarious wisdom of God.&rdquo;</strong> Ephesians 3:10</p>
<p>The rulers and authorities in the heavenlies here refer especially to the evil angels.</p>
<p>Before we were saved, we were dead in trespasses and sins. But now we are redeemed and regenerated and have received the sonship to become the Body of Christ. This surely manifests the multifarious wisdom of God and is a great shame to His enemy, the devil.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH<br />
IN RELATION TO THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>1. THE CHURCH IS OUR LIVING</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Having put off the old man with his practices, and having put on the new man.&rdquo;</strong> Colossians 3:9-10a</p>
<p>The church is the house of God and also our home. To be regenerated is to be born into the family of God. For this reason we should put off our old manner of life and come into the church life.</p>
<p>2. THE CHURCH IS OUR PROTECTION</p>
<p>When the Bible speaks of the church life, it often uses the phrase <em>one another.</em> This life of mutual care is our protection.</p>
<p>We should not be individualistic Christians. We should give ourselves to the church.</p>
<p>One piece of burning coal can die out easily, but a pile of coals will not die out so easily.</p>
<p>One chopstick can be broken easily, but a bundle of chopsticks cannot be broken so easily.</p>
