   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INCLUSIVENESS OF THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we began to take this way, we were not quite sure of the way of doing things; however, we have seen quite clearly the principle and the emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I held on to one thing: the principle cannot be changed, and the emphasis cannot be shifted; the truth is forever the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My principle and emphasis are Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although my voice for changing the system and walking the new way was very high and strong, I walked very firmly in a stable way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I walked slowly, step by step, according to my evaluation of the church s situation and the pace of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I was like a cook, busy working in the kitchen every day, preparing to put forth a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, I hope that no one will be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You cannot require that we succeed within three years in this change of the system which has not been successfully accomplished within the last fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You need to wait patiently and broaden your view.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You also need to listen accurately and should not assume that your understanding is the same as what I spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I found that the people outside the training were not clear, or misunderstood, or had too many opinions concerning the change of the system.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even with those who were in the training, there were areas where they did not listen accurately, or understand adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They may have listened correctly and understood rightly, but when they went out to speak, they did not speak accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, now I feel compelled to present the inclusiveness of the new way in its entirety so that you can have a complete view.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Objective Aspect of the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ, the Spirit, Life, and the Church</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should realize that the Lord s recovery is to recover Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is the embodiment and expression of the Triune God; He is the all-inclusive God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Concerning this point, Hymns #501 has given a simple, clear, and appropriate description.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit is the ultimate expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The theology in Christianity has separated God into three Persons: the Father being one Person, the Son being one Person, and the Spirit being another Person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we see from the Bible that Christ is the embodiment of God and is not separate from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He Himself says, I and the Father are one John 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then, again, He says, You, Father, are in Me and I in You John 17:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bible also says that the Holy Spirit is the reality of the Son John 14:17-20; 1 John 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This Triune God has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection from the dead, and He has become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, now the Lord is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the end of the Bible it says, The Spirit and the bride say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rev 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit here is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moreover, life is simply Christ, and life is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In John 14, Christ says, I am the life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This Christ who is life, having passed through the processes to become the life-giving Spirit, entered into us to be the life that we enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Romans 8:2 speaks of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This term joins life together with the Spirit, which indicates that everything related to life is contained within the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Life belongs to the Spirit; and the Spirit is of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These two are one in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit entering into us is the Triune God being our eternal and incorruptible life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When this life is gained by us, the result is the producing of the church, and the ultimate consummation of the church is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The sixty-six books of the entire Bible begin with God, the Triune God, and consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And the New Jerusalem is the ultimate manifestation of the mingling of the processed Triune God with the redeemed and transformed tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is our vision, and it is the objective truth in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have released over two thousand messages concerning Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These messages have also been published as books.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I hope that the younger generation and the newcomers to the Lord s recovery would spend time to study these messages.</S>
