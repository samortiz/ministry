   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Furthermore, we should not despise anyone or any church if they do not fully practice the ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Criticism and gossip obviously are absolutely not from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whether a brother or sister takes this way or not, they are still in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whether a church takes this way or not should be left to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All of the churches and all of the saints are members of the Body of Christ in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whether someone takes this way or not should not concern us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But since we have seen something, we should be faithful to practice what we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must also realize that the gifted persons have to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The best way and the best place to perfect the saints is in the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you are a gifted person, you should go to a group meeting to perfect the saints in that group.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When you are with them, you can observe them and get to know everyone's condition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then you can not only perfect them in the meetings but also perfect them outside the meetings by going to be with them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul said in Acts 20 that he taught the saints publicly and from house to house v. 20 and that he admonished each one with tears v. 31 . He taught the saints not only in the big meetings but also in the homes and one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a detailed, fine work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It takes much labor and time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If I am a person who has the portion, the capacity, and the gift to perfect the saints, I should attend a group meeting all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As everyone speaks in the group meeting, I will get to know their real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then I can go to their homes to spend personal time with them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps I could visit one person each week to have a direct talk with each one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is for the purpose of promoting each one's gifts, to develop his capacity, and to enrich his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can render much tutoring by this one-on-one contact.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way the saints will be perfected face to face by some of the gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This labor will not be in vain because some saints will be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, the saints will be perfected to do what the gifted persons do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, the gifted persons will produce gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the old way, there was not such a result because the way was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this producing way, we all learn to do something and to share something, and we will fully use our capacity to function.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then the riches of Christ will come out of every member of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We will perfect one another, and everyone will be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It may be that in a five-year period, we will perfect someone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But after this, he will perfect us because he has learned more.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By this God-ordained way, everyone will be perfected, everyone will be useful, and everyone will have the development of his capacity in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every saint will be occupied, and no time, energy, or persons will be wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The numbers will increase, and the life and spiritual knowledge will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to cooperate with our Lord to take His ordained way to organically build up the Body of Christ.</S>
