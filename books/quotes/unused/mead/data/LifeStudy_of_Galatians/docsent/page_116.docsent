   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR FAILURE TO LIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before you were saved, you might have paid little attention even to your self-made laws.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But after you were saved and especially after you began to seek the Lord in the church life, your self-made laws began to exert a very strong influence on your daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You can say truly that you love the Lord and seek Him, but can you honestly say that you live Christ day by day?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead of living Christ, you may live your kind of law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you break one of your self-made laws, you repent and make confession to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But have you ever repented and confessed for not living Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I do not believe that many Christians have made this kind of confession.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In recent months my confession to the Lord has mainly been related to my failures in living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the morning I may have an excellent time to pray and enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During my prayer, I am one spirit with the Lord and live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But afterward I may go to the breakfast table, begin to eat, and completely forget about Christ and living Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometime later I may suddenly realize what has happened and come back to Christ and say, O Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lord, I want to be one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For a few minutes, I may again be with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, I soon become occupied with something else and forget Him again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Is this not your experience also?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot say that we live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead of living Him, we live our laws, culture, religion, and tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have pointed out that the book of Galatians covers God s two economies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His first economy, the economy in the Old Testament, involves law, our ethical laws as well as the God-given law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever a person is regenerated, he continues to live according to the ethical laws he has assimilated from his culture.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Very few, if any, live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even though we may seek Christ, we still live our own cultural laws and, thereby, in our actual experience, keep ourselves in God s first economy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A CHANGE OF ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second economy of God, His New Testament economy, is wholly related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before Paul was converted, he was altogether in God s first economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1:14 Paul tells us that he advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>So zealous was he for the Jewish religion that he resolved to persecute all those who were living in God s second economy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason, he persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are all familiar with the fact that when Paul was on the road to Damascus, the Lord intervened and revealed Himself to Paul, causing him to fall to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul experienced a genuine conversion, a real turn from God s old economy of the law to His new economy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He refers to this turn in 1:15 and 16, where he tells us that it pleased God to reveal His Son in me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ was revealed not only to Paul, but also into him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Paul was a leading religionist, a top dog in Judaism, the Son of God entered into him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was the reason Paul says in 1:16 that the Son of God was revealed in him, not merely to him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because he had such a revelation of Christ, Paul could testify to the believers, Dear saints, I want to tell you that I have the living Person of the Son of God within me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is utterly no comparison between this Person and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The law is good, but it is inferior to this living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For years, I tried to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But one day the living Person of the Son of God was revealed into me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What a wonder!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What a miracle!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even now as I am writing to you, this living Person is one with me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I write, He writes, for He writes in my writing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What we see in chapter one of Galatians is a change of economy, a shift from the old economy to the new in which the Old Testament economy is replaced by the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This change is not a matter of theory, philosophy, or culture.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is an actual shift related to the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Formerly, Paul was absolutely given to God s Old Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But after Christ was revealed into him, he was wholly in God s new economy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>DEAD TO THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In 2:19 Paul says, For I through law have died to law that I might live to God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul wanted the Galatians to realize that he was dead to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No matter how good the law may be, Paul had died to it and had nothing more to do with it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Death had separated him from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This made it possible for him to live to God.</S>
