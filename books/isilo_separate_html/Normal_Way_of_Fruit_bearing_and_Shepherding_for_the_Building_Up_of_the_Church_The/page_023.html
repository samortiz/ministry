<h1 class="title">SERVING IN ONENESS AS<br />

<h2 class="head1">THE PRIESTHOOD BEING<br />
A BUILT-UP SPIRITUAL HOUSE</h2>
<p>It is not easy for Christians to understand what the real service is that we render to the Lord. The natural thought is that anything we do for the Lord is a service. The word <em>service</em> has even been damaged in Christianity today. People speak of the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting as a &ldquo;service,&rdquo; and in the evening they also have an &ldquo;evening service.&rdquo; What they mean by <em>service</em> is simply a Christian gathering. In the Bible, however, service has a much different meaning. The best portion to see the proper understanding of the service is in 1 Peter 2. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood.&rdquo; In the original Greek of the New Testament, there are two words translated as &ldquo;priesthood&rdquo; in English. One word is used in Hebrews 7, referring to the priestly service, the service of the priests (vv. 11, 12, 24). The other, used in 1 Peter 2:5 and 9, refers not to the priestly service but to the group of priests, the priestly body. The spiritual house in verse 5 is the priesthood, the priestly body, and this priesthood is the spiritual house. Both the spiritual house and the holy priesthood are being built up. Verse 5 continues, &ldquo;To offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; To offer is to serve; the offering up of spiritual sacrifices is the real service. The true service which we render to the Lord is an offering by a built-up body of priests, and this built-up body is the spiritual house. By this we can see that the genuine, proper service depends upon the building. If there is no building, there can be no house, and if there is no house, there can be no priesthood. The building is the house, and the house is the priesthood, the priestly body.</p>
<p>Today we speak of &ldquo;service groups&rdquo; in the church. This is a good term. In the biblical language, the service groups are the priesthood. &ldquo;Service group&rdquo; is simply a modern way to refer to the classical, or scriptural, term <em>priesthood.</em>The service of arranging chairs is a chair-arranging priesthood, and the cleaning service group is a cleaning priesthood. We also have the junior high, nursery, and clerical priesthood. The word <em>priesthood</em> should remind us that our service groups are the building up of the priests. If we are not serving as priests in this way, what we have is not a service group. Those who arrange the chairs in the meeting hall are not merely chair arrangers; they are priests. This means that they not only arrange the chairs; they render a service to God. Chair arranging is not their business, duty, or service. Their service is something holy and spiritual. In itself, chair arranging is not holy or spiritual; it is not a service. Our chair arranging is different. It is a holy and spiritual service rendered to God.</p>
<p>The first test of our service is whether we are serving as priests. The second test is whether we are serving as individual priests or as the &ldquo;hood,&rdquo; the corporate priesthood. Those who arrange the chairs are priests, but this is not enough. They should serve not as individual priests but as the priesthood. Priests are many, but the priesthood is one and unique. In the service groups there is only one priesthood, which is composed of the many priests. This implies the building up. The genuine service in the church has the nature of being priestly and of being built up. If our service is not of this nature, it is not genuine; it is a counterfeit and an imitation. Our service is a priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRIESTHOOD BEING HOLY AND ROYAL</h2>
<p>A priest is not a common, natural person. Of the billions of people on the earth today, relatively few are priests. They are merely common people. A priest is, first of all, one who is separated, not common. Everyone in the church service must be a separated, sanctified, marked-out person. This is why 1 Peter 2 says that the priesthood is holy. It is something special, separated, and sanctified. We must not be common in our thinking, attitude, speaking, expression, in the way we dress, and in every matter and every aspect of our living. If we are common even in one matter, we will lose our standing as priests. A priest is a holy, separated person. In the ancient time among the Israelites, the priests clothed themselves, ate, and lived in a different way, and they lodged in a different building. This was a type, but today the reality is the same in principle. As priests we must take care of what we are. We must be separated, different, and not common. We must be special. Some may say that we need to be &ldquo;human,&rdquo; but we need to be careful when we say this. If we are &ldquo;human&rdquo; in a common way, we are finished as priests. We need to be human in a holy way with a holy humanity. This is the meaning of being a priest.</p>
<p>Moreover, a priest must also be royal, or kingly. First Peter 2 speaks of both the holy priesthood (v. 5) and the royal priesthood (v. 9). To be royal is not only to be uncommon and special but to have a high standard. Many dear saints love the Lord and know the church, but the way they behave, speak, and do things is too low, not like kings. We must not be proud, which is to be ugly and foolish, but we should not forget that we are kings. We are high persons who belong to the royal family. This also is included in the matter of service. Those who arrange chairs are royal chair arrangers; they are kings arranging the chairs. In this way, chair arranging becomes a kingly service.</p>
<p>Some Christians are ambitious for position in the church. They desire to be one of the leaders, even the leading one among the leaders. We should not care for whether we are elders, leading ones, or simply small brothers with no name. Rather, we should care for the kind of person we are. If a beggar ascends to a king&rsquo;s throne, his kingship will be beggarly, but if a king sweeps the street, his street sweeping will be kingly. If the chair arranging brothers and sisters are kingly, the chair arranging in the church service will be kingly, and people will see something high. They will not see a group of lowly workers arranging the chairs; if this is all that people see, we are altogether a failure in our church service. Instead, the new ones should be able to see something high and kingly even in the lowly affairs such as chair arranging and cleaning the hall. Whether these matters are high or low depends on who does them. If the President of the United States comes to arrange the chairs, the chair arranging would be a great matter. Arranging chairs is the same business one way or another. What makes a difference is who does it. We are the holy and royal priests. We must be holy, separated, and not common, and we must also be kingly, with a high standard. In the church service even the young ones should consider themselves kingly.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
