The way of training can only work out something with qualified persons. When we talk about door-knocking, we are talking about this kind of door knocking, not the kind practiced by the Mormons. You have the Lord, you have the word, you have the Spirit, and you have the Lord's authority. You go out with these four things. Do you not have the Lord? You are one with Him; you abide in Him. Do you not have the word? You are soaked and saturated with the word. Do you not have the Spirit? You are filled with both the essential and economical Spirit. Do you not have the authority of Christ? You are His ambassador. You have Christ the Lord, His word, His Spirit, and His authority to go out, so you are a fully equipped soldier. Who can resist you or stand against you? This is the way we go out.</P><P>I hope that the co-workers and elders would go out this way. Forget about giving messages in the halls. We have been doing that for years. That did not do much. Thank the Lord for these qualifications of door-knocking for fruit bearing: aggressive desperation, absolute consecration, uninterrupted abiding in the Lord, full saturation with the word, prayer for the filling of both the essential and economical Spirit, and going with the authority of Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Being Desperate and Living Uniquely for the Gospel &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
