The way of the Cross means sacrifice<br />70. Can you be obedient<br />76. Cross of Christ! lead onward<br />82. Alas! and did my Savior bleed?<br />94. When we survey the wondrous cross<br />128.	How vast, immense, and measureless<br />131.	Via Bethlehem we journey<br />144.	This day the Lord has spoken<br />148.	When we walk with the Lord<br />149.	Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him?<br />151.	I've turned my back upon the world<br />155.	Not by wrestling, but by clinging<br />156.	Am I a soldier of the Cross<br />161.	How shall I follow Him I serve?<br />180.	Once I had a fervent heart<br />185.	Let me love and not be respected<br /><br /><li>SPIRITUAL WARFARE<br /></li>23. Charge, soldiers, charge in battle!<br />24. Standing on the victory of Christ my Lord<br />27. In the Lord's victorious name<br />41. In the mighty Name of Jesus<br />48. The name of Jesus is our stand<br />53. When you suffer Satan's temptings<br />55. With all the pow'r in heav'n and earth<br />56. When war is hot and fierce<br />57. Satan's assaults are conquered<br />61. Hosts of darkness are approaching<br />62. God's people have been robbed<br />68. To the foe my word is always, "No"<br />69. Rise up, soldiers, rise! To the battlefield!<br />74. Long has Satan fought, resisting<br />159.	Hallelujah! Christ is Victor<br /><br /><li>THE HOLY SPIRIT<br /></li>66. First the blood, and then the ointment<br />72. Fainting in the desert<br />121.	Lord, may Thy blood now cleanse me<br /><br /><li>THE WORK<br /></li>63. God's servants must now proclaim<br />184.	Christians, make haste, your mission high fulfilling<br /><br /><li>GENERAL<br /></li>16. On that same night, Lord Jesus<br />93. Break Thou the Bread of Life<br />99. Around Thy grave, Lord Jesus<br />133.	Once more, before we part<br />157.	For the bread and for the wine<br />163.	Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face<br />171.	Why grasp riches, harbor worry?<br /><br /><li>PRAISE OF THE SUCKLINGS<br /></li>110.	As young ones we to Jesus come<br /><br /><li>TRUMPET OF THE GOSPEL<br /></li>134.	I hear the Savior say<br />135.	Just as I am, without one plea<br />136.	I hear Thy welcome voice<br />137.	Working will not save me<br />162.	Come, ye sinners, poor and wretched<br />166.	Jesus waits for you, hoping you will come<br />167.	"Whosoever heareth!" shout, shout the sound!<br />168.	Oh, what a Savior that He died for me!<br />169.	Eternity! Eternity!<br />172.	Do come to Jesus now<br />179.	"Almost persuaded," now to believe<br /><br /></ol><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> </body></html>
