   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE BEING SAVED AND RENEWED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY CHRIST AS LIFE Scripture Reading: Rom 5:10; 6:4; Titus 3:5; Eph 4:22-24, 15-16; 2:21; Col 2:19; 1 Pet 2:2, 5</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus far, we have seen the way to take life in and how life grows and transforms us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter we want to see something more about life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>SAVED IN HIS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 5:10 says, "Much more we will be saved in His life."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Life grows, life transforms, and life saves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all have to pay our full attention to Romans 5:10.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It says that when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be reconciled to God is good, but we still need something more, much more.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Much more we will be saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once we were enemies to God and were absolutely fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In one sense, even today while we are here on this earth and in this flesh, we are still in a fallen condition, a fallen situation, and a fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So we need to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to spend time in the presence of the Lord to pray, "O Lord Jesus, show me the items from which I need to be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You may say that you need to be saved from self, Satan, and the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if you ask the Lord, He will show you hundreds of items from which you need to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One thing from which we need to be saved is our looseness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This looseness comes not from God's original creation but from our fall.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To be loose proves that we are fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>An example of our looseness is that we are not accurate when we report something.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may say that there were about one thousand people present in one of our meetings, but our report is exaggerated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to be saved from our looseness and from many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have been saved from eternal perdition and from God's condemnation, but we are fallen people, and all of the things related to us are in a fallen condition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The way we talk is fallen, the way we express ourselves is fallen, our attitude is fallen, and our talk is fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even the way we walk is fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The way we dress and cut our hair is fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way we laugh and shout is fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The way we look at people is fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whatever we do, whatever we are, whatever we have, whatever we say, and however we behave are altogether fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our conduct is absolutely a fallen matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since it is fallen, we need salvation; we need deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to be delivered from the way we talk to people, from the way we laugh, and from the way we express ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to be delivered from the way we dress.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now that we have been reconciled, much more we will be saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the fallen situation, Satan is subtle with certain persons in one aspect and with other persons in another aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some people are wild.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Wildness is a proof of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are wild because we are fallen, so we need to be saved from being wild.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But this does not mean that we should be refined.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be refined is a matter of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some people may be refined without, but within they are like wild beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all need to be saved by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we call on the Lord by saying, "Lord Jesus," we take Him in as life, and this life saves us from being wild or from our natural refinement.</S>
