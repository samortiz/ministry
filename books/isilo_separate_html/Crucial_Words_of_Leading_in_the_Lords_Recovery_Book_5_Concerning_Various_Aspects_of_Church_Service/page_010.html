<p><em>Question: What should we say if people ask us why we do not participate in a campus-wide fellowship involving other Christian groups?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This matter is related to the truth of the church (Matt. 16:18; 18:17). The Lord Jesus has only one Body in the universe, and this Body is His universal church. There is only one expression of this church in each locality. For example, in Jerusalem there were many believers but only one church, which was called the church in Jerusalem. If there are two expressions of the church in one locality, there is division. This is the reason that at the end of the Bible, in Revelation, each of the seven cities has only one church, such as the church in Ephesus, the church in Smyrna, the church in Pergamos, and the church in Thyatira. There was only one church in a city (1:11).</p>
<p>Shortly after the time of the apostles, however, the church encountered problems. There was a great controversy mainly related to the truth concerning the Triune God and the person of Christ. By the end of the sixth century, after several councils Catholicism was officially formed, and the pope controlled everything. This condition continued for more than nine centuries, that is, close to one thousand years. This period is called the Dark Ages in church history. Later, reformers, such as Martin Luther, were raised up. They did not accept church traditions; they returned to the truth in the Bible and compared traditions with the truth. The first item they recovered was justification by faith. This was the recovery of the foundation of salvation. Thereafter, item after item of the truth has been recovered.</p>
<p>Martin Luther did not intend to leave Catholicism; he felt that he should rise up simply to recover the truth. However, the Catholic Church desired to kill him, which caused a German nobleman to rise up to protect Luther. Under such circumstances, Luther had little choice in the formation of state churches. As a result, the state church, which appeared first in Germany, believed in justification by faith and was called the Lutheran church. It was the first denomination.</p>
<p>Soon many European countries, such as Denmark and England, also rose up to form state churches. There is the state church of Denmark, the state church of Sweden, and the state church of Norway. The rulers of these countries are also the head of the state church. The queen of England is the head of the Anglican Church, which is the state church of England.</p>
<p>Later a group of believers pursued the truth and saw that the practice of state churches was not according to the Bible. They formed the so-called private churches, such as the Baptists, the Presbyterians, and the Methodists. Still later the Pentecostals rose up, as well as many other groups. Now the various denominations and sects can be compared to the numerous trees in a forest. Even in the city of Taipei there are many denominations. This situation has divided the Lord&rsquo;s Body.</p>
<p>About one hundred fifty years ago, the British Brethren were raised up, and they saw the light that the practice of sects is not according to the Bible. Consequently, some left the Catholic Church and others left the Anglican Church. Their leaving the sects was thorough and powerful. The truth unveiled by the British Brethren affected believers in many places.</p>
<p>Around the year 1920 this truth reached us in China, and we began to meet outside of any denominational structure. We accepted all the saints regardless of their denominational background, as long as they were genuinely saved. Our accepting of others was not based on different faiths but on the fact that when a person repents and believes into the Lord, he is washed, regenerated, justified by God, and becomes a child of God. As long as a person was a member of Christ, we accepted him and met with him. This was our attitude.</p>
<p>Any so-called campus-wide fellowship is a gospel organization formed by several groups that work together on the campuses. They send the students they gain to the denominations. We will not interfere with a believer who joins such a campus-wide fellowship, because this will only give rise to criticism. However, we are led by the Lord to enter into the church life, and we believe that gradually all believers will know the truth concerning the church. When we contact students, we need to preach the gospel to them. Then we need to supply them with life. When the students begin to love and pursue the Lord, we can release the truth to them. We do not need to engage others in debates; we should only present the truth to them.</p>
<p>We do not criticize those who desire to meet in the Catholic Church or in the denominations. We leave this decision to them. It would be wonderful for others to be enlightened by our testimony and by the supply of the truth so that they would be unwilling to stay in any division but would rather take the way of the church and become a part of the testimony of oneness. Nevertheless, this choice is theirs, and we should not argue with them.</p>
<p>We have the gospel, life, and the truth. There is also a testimony for others to see. We should also lead other believers to testify for the Lord. We are not creating our own sect. Hence, when someone asks what denomination we are in, we should reply that we do not belong to any denomination. At the most, we can say that we are the local church. We are not a sect, a denomination, or a special group of people. We are those who are saved and who love the Lord. We meet together in each locality to testify for the Lord. Concerning other believers, our hope is simply to state the truth clearly to them. The way they receive our speaking is according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
