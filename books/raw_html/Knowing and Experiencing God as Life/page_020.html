        <h2 class="head1">THE ANOINTING</h2>
<p>Another necessary item is the anointing. Concerning the anointing, 1 John 2 says that every believer has the anointing (vv. 20-27). The anointing does not refer to an ointment but to the action of applying the ointment. The anointing is the moving of the Spirit within us. The indwelling Triune God is always moving in us, and His moving is the anointing.</p>
<p>Verse 27 says, &ldquo;The anointing which you have received from Him abides in you,...and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.&rdquo; We should abide in the Lord according to the anointing. We should speak when the anointing wants us to speak, keep quiet when the anointing wants us to be quiet, and move when the anointing wants us to move. This is the way to abide in the Lord and have constant fellowship with Him. If we do not obey the anointing, our fellowship with the Lord will be cut off. In our experience this means that we will not be in Him. Whether or not we abide in the Lord depends on whether we obey the anointing.</p>
<p>For the cleansing of a leper in the Old Testament, the priest would put blood on the lobe of the leper&rsquo;s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. Then the priest would put oil on the lobe of the leper&rsquo;s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot (Lev. 14:14-18, 25-29). Wherever the blood was put is where the ointment was applied. The ointment could be applied only to the places that were covered with blood. The anointing ointment is God Himself. God is holy, and He is light. He cannot tolerate darkness, nor can He co-exist with wickedness. Hence, before He can anoint man with Himself, man must be cleansed by the blood.</p>
<p>First John speaks of the same sequence. There is first the cleansing of the blood and then the anointing. The apostle John wrote his Gospel and then his three Epistles. The Gospel of John says that God was incarnated to enter into us in order to be our life and that when we believe in Him, we receive His life. The Epistles of John, especially 1 John, say that since we have the life of God, we must live by this life and abide in this life in order to fellowship with God. In order to maintain this fellowship, two things are indispensable: the blood and the anointing. On the negative side, we need the blood, and on the positive side, we need the anointing. The blood cleanses us from the improper things within us, and the anointing anoints us with God. Whenever the Spirit as the ointment operates and moves within us, He anoints us with God.</p>
<p>The Spirit can be likened to a painter painting a table. Initially, the table does not have any paint on its surface. Then the painter applies paint to the table. The more he paints, the more the element of the paint is added to the table. Eventually, the table is filled with the element of the paint. This is the way that God anoints us. Each time that we allow Him to move in us, He anoints us with more of His element.</p>
<p>The anointing can be applied only to where the blood of Christ has been applied (Lev. 14:28). If we have not been covered with the blood, we cannot receive the anointing, and without the anointing, we cannot have fellowship with God. Hence, there must be the application of the blood and the application of the anointing ointment. The combination of these two makes it possible for us to maintain our fellowship.</p>
<p>When we were saved, we received the blood and then the anointing. The moment we repented, confessed our sins, and received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, the blood that He shed on the cross was applied to us, and the Spirit, who is the ointment, anointed us immediately. Thus, the Spirit began to abide in us. After our salvation we still need to fellowship with God and to abide in Him (1 John 2:28). As we abide in Him, we will see that we are defiled and sinful. This is when we need the blood to cleanse us. Once the blood is applied to us, the anointing ointment will follow. When the anointing is applied, the element of God will increase in us, and God as light will shine brighter in us. The brighter God&rsquo;s light shines, the more our sins are manifested, and as a result, we see that we need more of the cleansing of the blood. The cleansing of the blood ushers in a further application of the anointing, which in turn adds God&rsquo;s element into us. This is an endless cycle. The more times that this cycle is repeated, the more our naturalness will be washed away and the more we will be anointed with God&rsquo;s element. The more that this cycle is repeated, the more we will receive the shining of the divine light, and the cleansing blood will wash us of improper things. At the same time, the anointing ointment will add the divine element into our being. Eventually, everything in us that does not match God will be dealt with by the light and the blood, and we will be saturated with the element of God through the anointing. This is the genuine growth of life in the fellowship of life. Genuine growth in life is through the divine light, the blood, and the anointing.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
