   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to be clear that the elders administration of the church is not merely organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In fact, it does not contain much element of organization; rather, the emphasis is on building.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moreover, this is not the building of a physical house but the building of the church, which is not an organization but an organic Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If it were the building of an organization, it would be organizational, but the building of the Body is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The elders must see that they are not building an organization in their respective localities; rather, they are building an organic Body, which is altogether a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Wherever the elders of the churches are, whether in a church as big as Taipei or in a church as small as Tong-shi, they must see that the churches which they are building are not merely an organization but an organism, a part of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The building of an organization is organizational, whereas the building of the Body is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For instance, when a carpenter makes a table, he uses many pieces of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He cuts, polishes, and then nails them together to make a table.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To be a carpenter is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>An apprentice can learn to do it well in three to five years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, the study of the human body is not like this, because the human body is not easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Medical doctors are aware of how complicated and troublesome the human body is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, some medical doctors focus their studies on the ear, nose, and throat; some focus on the blood; and some, on the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These people spend their whole life studying yet still cannot thoroughly understand the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Recently I needed eye surgery for a cataract.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Soon after the surgery, I began to experience a retinal detachment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My doctor became worried and immediately called another specialist for advice.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Puzzled, I asked my doctor, Are you not an ophthalmologist?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yes, he replied, but there are different kinds of specialists in ophthalmology.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some ophthalmologists specialize in treating retinal detachments.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since my doctor was a surgeon who specialized in cataracts, he was not able to handle the problem of a retinal detachment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This shows that organic matters are complicated and difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the church life we always complain about the elders, saying that this one does not do something well and that another one does not lead well.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As time goes by, however, we murmur less because we develop sympathy for them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today people of all ages go to see doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who are younger nitpick and more easily blame the doctor for being ignorant in regard to a particular matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When older people visit their doctors, however, they are not as likely to become angry because they know that their bodies are truly difficult to manage and cannot easily be understood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A person may go to see a doctor because a tumor has developed in his body or a certain part has developed in a wrong way, but the doctor may not be able to tell him exactly what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In regard to an organism such as the human body, doctors may spend their entire life studying yet never fully understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Likewise, it is difficult for the elders to administrate the church, because the church is an organism, not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let us turn again to the example of the table.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a table is missing a corner, the carpenter will have to consider how to patch the missing corner.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If he does not patch the missing corner, the table may have a missing corner until the world comes to an end. Our human body, however, is quite different.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a certain part of our body is injured or hurt, within a week it may grow and be healed naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A corner of a table that has been cut off will never grow back no matter how long we wait.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is because it is something organized.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In contrast, our human body can grow and naturally heal itself after a period of time because it is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, we must believe in the organic nature and functions of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The condition of the church is also organic.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we lead the brothers and sisters, we need to rely on the organic capability within them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A brother or sister may fall, but we should not be too worried.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He or she may rise up again next year.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>An experienced elder will surely say Amen to this word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the church life we sometimes see brothers who are in a healthy condition and have a bright spiritual future; however, two years later such a brother may fall quite terribly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the same time there may be another brother in whom people have little hope, but after two years he may make the most progress and became the most promising one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, when we serve the saints, it is difficult to know them accurately according to their behavior; rather, we need to pay attention to the development of the organic capability within them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the matter of leading people to salvation, it may be difficult for us to know whether a person has touched the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We know a person must touch the Spirit in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once he touches the Spirit, he is enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, we may not know the signs that indicate that salvation has occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We may only know to preach the Lord Jesus to people and to baptize them after they believe into the Lord, receive Him, and pray to Him, but we may not know if they have touched the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sometimes we have seen a person who seems to experience a dynamic salvation; once he is saved, he removes all the idols from his house.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is really wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Who would have thought that after half a year, he would buy another idol and bring it into his home!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We may then ask him to remove it, but he may be stubbornly unwilling and insist on keeping it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At such a time we may become totally disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, three years later he may burn the idol and have an even stronger dealing than the previous one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There have been cases like this.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we serve the church, we need to realize that the church is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In serving, the greatest need is to avoid interrogating people.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For example, after a brother is baptized, we should not constantly try to find out whether he has been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In Matthew 13:24-30, the Lord Jesus spoke a parable regarding the sowing of seed in a field.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A man sowed good seed, wheat, in his field, but in the end tares were manifested, apparently without reason.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When the seed was sown, it was pure, genuine seed, yet tares appeared after the sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Some may have thought that birds brought in the tares, and others may have said that the wind blew tares from one field into another field.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, these considerations are not reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In His reply to the disciples, the Lord Jesus said, An enemy has done this v. 28 . Experts say that there is absolutely no way to distinguish wheat from tares at the time of sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The two look exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Once they grow and produce fruit, they are the same height and have the same form, but the fruit of the wheat is golden yellow and that of the tares is black.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Only at the time of the harvest are people able to distinguish between the two; nevertheless, it is too late.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the same way, at the time of baptism we have absolutely no way to know who among the newly saved ones may be tares.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is difficult to discern.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, we should not hastily jump to a conclusion; rather, we should pray.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When we preach the gospel, we need to have the Spirit, power, and the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As to whether or not people have actually been regenerated, we can only give the matter to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we think that someone has not been saved, we can give him a nutritious shot by ministering life to him the following day.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Even if he is a false one, after receiving our ministering several times, he will become a genuine one.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We need to see that the church is an organism and that everyone in the church is directly a part of this organism.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Hence, when we serve the church, we need to deal with people as part of an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we see that a certain brother or sister is not comely, we should not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Perhaps a year later he or she will grow a little more and there will be more hope.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Some people, after being baptized, do not exercise spiritually or come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Yet one day, for an unknown reason, they begin to be zealous and attend all the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Some people, on the contrary, meet regularly after they are first saved, but one day, because of an offense from an elder, they stop coming.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We probably have encountered all these cases.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The church is truly an organism that requires us to deal with it in an organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God s New Testament economy is to build up an organism, that is, the Body of Christ Eph 3:3-11; Matt 16:18 .</S>
