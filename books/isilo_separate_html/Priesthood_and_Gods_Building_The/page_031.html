<h1 class="title">BURNING THE INCENSE,<br />
LIGHTING THE LAMPS, AND SINGING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 27:20-21; 30:6-8; 1 Chron. 6:31-33; 25:1, 7-8; Luke 1:8-10; Rev. 5:8; 8:3-5; Eph. 6:18; 5:18-19</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD IN CHRIST BEING MAN&rsquo;S ENJOYMENT</h2>
<p>All the riches of God are in the Son to be man&rsquo;s enjoyment. The Bible uses many types of enjoyment to show how man receives Christ. In the Old Testament Christ is portrayed as manna to eat and living water to drink (Exo. 16:4, 15-18, 31; 17:6). This indicates that Christ is our enjoyment (1 Cor. 10:1-4). In the New Testament the Lord is even more explicit, speaking of Himself as the bread of life coming down out of heaven for us to eat and as living water for us to drink (John 6:33, 35, 48-51; 4:14). Eating and drinking are matters of enjoyment. The Lord also spoke in a parable, comparing His complete salvation to a great feast for which He sent slaves to invite people to come and eat, saying, &ldquo;Come, for all things are now ready&rdquo; (Luke 14:17). The feast has been prepared, and we need only to come and enjoy. These verses indicate that God&rsquo;s desire is to give Himself to us in Christ for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>In order for God to become our enjoyment, Christ had to pass through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Through the Spirit, God has a relationship with man. The Spirit is God entering into man and God coming upon man. Our experience of the Spirit involves two aspects. On one hand, He enters into us for us to drink for our inward supply, and on the other hand, He pours Himself upon us to empower us for His work outwardly. The Spirit wants to fill us inwardly with Himself but also to immerse us fully in Himself. These two aspects cause us to be fully mingled with God. God gives Himself to us for our enjoyment by fully mingling Himself with us in order that we would be blended in His life and nature to become a living, corporate entity, the Body of Christ. This corporate entity is the dwelling place of God and His beloved counterpart. This is God&rsquo;s marvelous intention.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRIESTS BEING ENJOYERS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>According to typology in the Bible, the priests enjoy Christ in a full and rich way. We often say, &ldquo;Christ is our manna,&rdquo; or &ldquo;We enjoy Christ as manna every day.&rdquo; Although manna was surely sweet and pleasant, the priests who ministered in the Holy Place of God ate food that was much richer than manna, because the offerings that were presented to God were also food for the priests. They enjoyed the offerings together with God. We need to consider all the different offerings in the Old Testament because every part of every offering typifies Christ. For example, in the meal offering there was fine flour, oil, and frankincense (Lev. 2:1). The priests could also enjoy the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering out of the peace offering (7:34). There were burnt offerings, sin offerings, trespass offerings, freewill offerings, and thanksgiving offerings, as well as offerings of the firstborn and firstfruits to God. All these offerings are types of Christ, and the priests were entitled to a portion of all these offerings. Although manna was certainly good, it represented only one aspect of Christ. The food that the priests enjoyed was multifaceted and much richer than manna. Hence, a priest is one who enjoys Christ in a full and rich way.</p>
<p>The children of Israel ate only manna in the wilderness, but the priests in the Holy Place enjoyed the riches of Christ. In the journey of the children of Israel, they erected the tabernacle whenever they encamped, and the priests presented offerings in the tabernacle. Thus, while the children of Israel were eating manna, the priests were enjoying the riches of the offerings. Even though the priests passed through the wilderness, they enjoyed the riches of the offerings because they were serving in the Holy Place. Similarly, if we want to have the full enjoyment of Christ, we must be a priest.</p>
<p>Today the children of God may know Christ as manna, but they have little realization that manna was food for the children of Israel only when they were wandering in the wilderness; it was not the food found in the Holy Place. If we serve God as priests in the Holy Place and minister before God, we will have an endless supply of food from the offerings on the altar because these offerings also were food for the priests. Eating the breast typifies enjoying the love of Christ, and eating the thighs typifies enjoying Christ as power. If we serve as priests, we will enjoy Christ in all His riches. Conversely, if we are wandering Christians who never enter into the Holy Place to live before God, our enjoyment of Christ will be limited to one aspect. If we want to enjoy Christ in a thorough, multifaceted, and full way, we must function as a priest. We must enter into the Holy of Holies and serve God before the throne of grace. In this place, everything of Christ will become an enjoyment to both God and us.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> </body></html>
