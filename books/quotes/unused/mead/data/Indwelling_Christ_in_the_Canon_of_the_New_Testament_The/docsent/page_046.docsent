   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD WORKING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After this, verse 13 of the same chapter says, For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this book, some verses speak of Christ s indwelling, one speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit, and here is a verse that says that God is working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Who then is working, God, Christ, or the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is so simple: when the Spirit works, that is Christ working, and when Christ works, that is God working.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are three in one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not have three persons indwelling us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have only one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God in Christ as the Spirit is indwelling us and working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all like Philippians 2:13 because it tells us that God is working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the next verse is quite practical.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We might think that it should tell us to do all things to glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But it says, Do all things without murmurings and disputings Phil 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a real test of whether we are enjoying the working of God in us or not.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Are we murmuring or disputing?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These two things are so practical and ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you would not murmur for one week, you would be the leading saint.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are no high doctrines in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We only find some practical matters to help us in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Have you ever seen a book in Christianity entitled, Without Murmuring ?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do need to publish such a book.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not some great teaching, this is something very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do you murmur about your wife or husband?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do you murmur about the brothers and sisters, or the church service?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul was so wise; he knew that the biggest hindrance in the practical church was murmuring and disputing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is especially true of the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They don t like to dispute outwardly, but they do it inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They would not outwardly criticize anything announced by the elders, but still there is some disputing within.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why Paul tells us to let God work in us without murmuring and disputing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How can this be possible?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only by exchanging persons.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all have to be replaced in our thinking, our concepts, and our ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is better not to know so much.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We only need to learn to take Christ as our person and minister Him to others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>COUNTING ALL THINGS LOSS</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now we come to chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all love this chapter because Paul tells us how absolute he was to gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death Phil 3:8, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul says that he counted all the religious things as loss for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When he compared his religion with Christ, he realized that every bit of his old religion was a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>So he left it all for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not only so, but he counted all things loss for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He counted not only the religious things, but all things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To count everything as loss means to count as loss the whole human culture.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This includes religion and all the things of the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul counted all these things as dung.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This word in our modern usage would mean trash or garbage.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul counted all things as garbage that he might gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>INDWELLING RESURRECTION POWER</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the religious things were quite precious to him in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But once he came to know Christ, he counted them all as loss.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He even counted the whole human culture as trash that he might gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The way to gain Christ is to know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This means to experience Him in the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is something of His indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We could never experience the power of Christ in resurrection without His indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If He were merely in the heavens, how could we experience the power of His resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is similar to today s electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Until it is installed in the building, we can never experience its power.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Praise the Lord that Christ has been installed into us!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now we can experience His resurrection power, and by this we gain Christ.</S>
