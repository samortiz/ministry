TO TAKE GOD AS LIFE</h2>
<p>In order for God&rsquo;s life to be lived out of man, the soul-life must die. This is indicated by the baptism of the Lord Jesus. We surely need to be baptized when we repent and believe in the Lord, because we are sinners. But why did the Lord Jesus need to be baptized when He began His work (Matt. 3:13-17)? The Lord&rsquo;s baptism has many significances. His being baptized was a declaration to the whole universe that as a man He was willing to be put to death. He was not corrupt, nor was He sinful; He was without sin. But in order to do God&rsquo;s work, accomplish God&rsquo;s will, and live for God, He, even as a sinless man without corruption, needed to die. For this reason, He placed Himself into death through baptism.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus continually put His life to death and let God live in Him. Hence, He lived out God. From the beginning of His ministry, He never left the position of death. This is how He served God in order that God could live out of Him.</p>
<p>We should not understand being in the place of death to mean suffering. The thought that the cross is a suffering is poison from Catholicism. It is true that there is suffering related to the cross, but suffering is not the main meaning of the cross. The Roman government would say that to put a person on the cross was to kill him. Hence, the focus of the cross is not suffering but death. Once a brother whose wife was sick said to another brother, &ldquo;This is the cross that the Lord gave me. How can I not bear it?&rdquo; There was also a sister who could not find a suitable maid and was constantly looking for a new one. When she spoke with the saints about this matter, she said, &ldquo;It is so hard to find a suitable maid. Nevertheless, I thank and praise the Lord for the cross that He gave me.&rdquo; Most of God&rsquo;s children regard the experience of the cross to be a matter of suffering.</p>
<p>However, the cross does not stress suffering but death. The purpose of the cross is not to make us suffer but to kill us. The Lord&rsquo;s baptism at the beginning of His ministry was a declaration in which He seemed to say, &ldquo;As a man, I am standing in the place of death. I am serving God in death. It is not I, Jesus the Nazarene, who lives, but it is God who lives in Me. Although I have life, even a sinless life, I will not live by My human life. God wants to be My life, and He wants to live out of Me, so I want to take Him as My life. I put My life in the place of death; I am willing to hang on the cross. I will not come down from the cross so that God may live out of Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dying of the Lord Jesus on the cross did not occur only at Golgotha. He lived a crucified life. From the beginning of His ministry, He chose the cross and He never left the position of the cross. In serving God by casting out demons, healing the sick, and preaching to the people, He stood in the death of the cross so that God could be lived out.</p>
<p>For this reason, when we read the Gospels, we see that God was manifested in Jesus the Nazarene. His words and His conduct were filled with God; His living and His work were the expression of God. He was Jesus the Nazarene, but He did not express or live out a Nazarene; He expressed and lived out the glorious God. He was a lowly man who expressed the glorious God. This is glorious!</p>
<p>God delights in such a living. This was the living of the Lord Jesus, and it should also be our living. We are lowly people, but God desires to live out of us. Hence, death is necessary. If we love Him and give ourselves to Him, He will operate in us, and we will sense that there is a demand in His operation that we die. Genuine obedience to Him involves the acceptance of death. Obedience without death is not genuine obedience. It is not necessary for us to be concerned about obeying Him, for genuine obedience is death. Every time that the Lord operates, He demands that we die. We should say, &ldquo;Lord, I am willing to deny the self and be put to death, because I love You. You have already put me in death; I am willing to accept this fact. I accept what You have arranged and stand in what You have accomplished. Since I am already dead, how can I still be living? I accept this death.&rdquo; Obedience is not a problem when we accept God&rsquo;s demand of death. Genuine obedience is death.</p>
<p>Philippians 2:8 says that the Lord was obedient unto death. Unless we die, our obedience is not absolute and not genuine. Absolute and genuine obedience is the obedience unto death. Hence, it is not a matter of obedience but of death. Every demand that the Lord makes in us is a demand for us to die. If we are willing to die, we will have genuine obedience.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Knowing and Experiencing God as Life &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
