It is a little hard for me to speak tonight because I spoke a word just a few days ago. I am here again after only a few days. It seems too soon for me to speak again on this subject. We have mentioned one thing again and again among us; perhaps, it is good to mention it again today. I have said over the past few years that we should not consider marriage to be nothing but happiness. If our hope is too high, our disappointment will become great. Brother Ping and Sister Bau, this may be the beginning of happy days, but there are surely days of suffering ahead. It seems that the word suffering is not a very appropriate word for an occasion like today. Perhaps I should say that all of the days ahead may not be happy ones. A few days ago I said that happiness will come after five years. Two years ago I met a family in Hangchow. Perhaps I can say that it was an ideal family, the best that I have seen. I asked the brother, "It seems to me that you have an ideal family, but at what point did your family become so ideal? Did it start from the day that you were first married, or did it begin sometime afterward?" He wondered what I meant, so I said, "I somewhat hold to the notion that a happy family life begins five years after the marriage. The honeymoon is the beginning of bitter waters; the waters do not turn sweet until later." In the evening we sat and talked in the courtyard. He was silent for a while and then suddenly jumped up and said, "You are right. At the beginning there was quite a lot of friction and noise between the two of us. Later it went away." During the past few days, I have met with Brother Ping a few times and Sister Bau also. They have bought their wok, their dishes, their broom, and their towels. But tonight I will ask you to bring home one more thing. If you do not bring this home, you cannot form a real family. You have to bring this home before your family can become a family. This one thing is the adjustment of the differences between the husband and the wife.</p><p>Formerly you both lived as individuals, and you were free to do whatever you wanted. But now your tent has been nailed down; the stakes are there, and something binds you. From now on there is another person in your life and living. The two are together and have become one. The Chinese have a saying: "To make two become one." If there is only one person, nothing will happen; there is no need for harmony if there is only one person. Oneness is the representation of harmony. The ultimate expression of harmony is oneness. Therefore, it is right to say, "To make two become one." But this is exactly where the problem lies. In the beginning everything was well between Adam and Eve because God made Eve out of Adam and gave her back to Adam. The two became one. They were one becoming two and two becoming one again. The problem today, however, is that Sister Bau did not come out of Brother Ping. The first part of the story is missing; only the second part is present. Our wedding meeting is only the second half&mdash; putting together two persons with different lives, different educational backgrounds, different upbringings, and differences in everything. If we merely put the two together, they are still two. Only when the two become one will the family be free from trouble. If the two cannot become one, the family will never be a success. You can do without all the miscellaneous things in a family, but you cannot do without this one thing.</p><p>You may ask me whether I have the assurance and the way to deal with the differences between husbands and wives. Brother Ping and Sister Bau, are you ready? You have to start picking up this matter immediately. This is one item of furnishing that you must have. From now on, you will see each other more, and you will also rub each other more. The question is whether or not there is oil in your rubbing. It may be difficult to find such a thing among the unbelievers or in the world. But thank the Lord that we are Christians, and it is easy to find this. Some among us today are not yet believers, and it is impossible to find this among them. But we are believers, and we can consider this matter from God's view. God has divided all people into two categories: those who are in Adam and those who are in Christ. If our brother and sister remain in their position in Christ, this couple, this family, will never run into trouble. But if they live in the other realm, if they live in Adam, it will be impossible to not get into trouble as a couple and as a family. We should never think that as long as the woman manages the home well and the man keeps his job, the family will be kept together. Just as spirituality is needed in a meeting, spirituality is needed in the family as well. Just as the meeting life has much to do with our spirituality, the family life also has much to do with our spirituality.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_084.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_086.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 38: General Messages (2) &nbsp; pg 85</div><br></body></html>
