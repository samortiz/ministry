He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified."</P><P>When the Lord was speaking this word to His disciples, the Spirit of God was already there. Yet the Spirit at that time was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified. What does this mean? To find out the meaning, we have to know when He was glorified. Many of us think that the Lord was glorified when He was taken into the heavens. But this is not accurate. Luke 24:26 shows that by His resurrection the Lord was glorified. That verse says, "Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into His glory?" This word was spoken before the Lord was taken up to the heavens. After His resurrection, He met the two disciples and told them that He had entered into glory already. Thus, it was by resurrection that the Lord was glorified.</P><P>What does it mean for the Lord to be glorified? The Lord is the God of glory (Acts 7:2; 1 Cor. 2:8). One day He was incarnated to be a man. The very God of glory came into a man and put man upon Himself. He concealed all the glory of God within this man. Thus, the glory of God was covered, veiled, by this man. When He was on this earth, people just saw Him as an ordinary man. Outwardly, He was merely a humble man, yet inwardly, He was the God of glory.</P><P>Eventually, He passed through death and was resurrected. By His resurrection He was glorified. We can use a grain of wheat or a seed of any kind of beautiful flower as an illustration. Within the seed, the glory of the flower is concealed, veiled. Once the seed falls into the earth and grows up and blossoms, that is its glorification. The Lord died and resurrected. Through His resurrection the very glory of God which had been concealed, veiled, covered, in His flesh was manifested. This was His glorification.</P><P>When the Lord was on the earth, the Spirit was not yet, because the Lord had not yet been glorified (John 7:39). It was after the Lord's glorification, that is, after His resurrection, that the Spirit entered into His disciples. After the Lord resurrected, He came in the evening to the disciples and breathed into them, saying, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (20:19-22). This shows clearly that the Holy Spirit came into the disciples after the Lord had been glorified in His resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF JESUS</H2><P>Now let us read Acts 16:7: "And when they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, yet the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them." The Spirit of Jesus is a special term. This is not the Spirit of God and not even the Spirit of Christ, but the Spirit of Jesus as a man. Now let us read the previous verse. Verse 6 says, "And they passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia." The Spirit of Jesus in verse 7 is the Holy Spirit in verse 6. After the Lord's resurrection, the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
