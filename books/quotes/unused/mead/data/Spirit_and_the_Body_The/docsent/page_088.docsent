   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EPISTLES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament we have not only 1 Corinthians, but also 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whenever there are two books of a certain kind in the New Testament, the second is more vital than the first.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, 2 Corinthians is more vital than 1 Corinthians, 2 Timothy is more vital than 1 Timothy, and 2 Thessalonians is more vital than 1 Thessalonians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus we should not stop with 1 Corinthians, but go on to 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second Corinthians does not take care of your gifts; it deals with you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this book what matters is how much you have been anointed and sealed 2 Cor 1:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 2 Corinthians 3:3 the Apostle Paul likens us to an epistle: "Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not a matter of how many gifts we have, but of how much we have been written upon.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is important is that we are an epistle of Christ, an epistle that speaks for Christ and that ministers Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How much of Christ has been written on you by the Spirit of the living God?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The living Spirit must be constantly writing something of Christ upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Throughout the past years, a great deal may have been written into your being by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If so, then you are not an epistle of just two or three pages, but perhaps of a hundred pages.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If anyone begins to read you as an epistle of Christ, it will take him several hours to finish.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As he reads you, he will say, "Certainly this man has a great deal of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is a person full of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, some of you may just have three or four words written on you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is what you are as an epistle of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 2 Corinthians the Apostle Paul no longer had the thought of gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, he turned the attention of the church in Corinth to the need to have Christ written into the being of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Something of Christ must be inscribed into our being, not with ink, but with the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything that is written into you is written by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a great deal of the Spirit has been inscribed into your being, you will not always need to function.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sometimes you simply need to let others read you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 2 Corinthians it is not a matter of functioning, but a matter of being read by others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When others come to you, will they find something of Christ in your being that they can read?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all need to have Christ written into our being by the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If in the meetings there are none who have Christ written into them, you will have the sense that the meeting is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if even one with Christ written upon him is present, the meeting will be enriched.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a one does not need to say anything or do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Simply by being present he enriches the meeting, because a great deal of Christ has been written upon him by the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to go on from 1 Corinthians, the first stage, to 2 Corinthians, the second stage.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 1 Corinthians it is a matter of function; in 2 Corinthians it is a matter of Christ written upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>MIRRORS REFLECTING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 2 Corinthians 3 Paul firstly likens us to an epistle in which people can read Christ and then to a mirror with an unveiled face that beholds and reflects Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As an epistle, we need to be written upon.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But as a mirror, we need to reflect.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How much of Christ has been written into you, and how much do you reflect Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you reflect Christ, there is not always the need for you to stand up and function in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This does not mean, however, that I am saying you should not function.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If Christ has been written into you and if you with an unveiled face have been looking to Christ day by day, in the meeting you will be a mirror reflecting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When people look at you, they will see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is not a matter of functioning, but of reflecting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Reflection is much more than function.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, in today's religion people know only a little of the matter of function; they do not care for reflection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we come to the meetings, we need to reflect Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is not a matter of gifts, but a matter of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As we grow in Christ, more of Him will be written into our being by the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whatever has been written upon us will be reflected from us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, we are not only an epistle, but also a mirror reflecting Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today Christ needs epistles and mirrors.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He needs many epistles with Christ written on them by the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit so that people may read Christ on them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are the living epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At the same time, we need to be bright, unveiled mirrors reflecting the very Christ who has been written into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This will strengthen, uplift, and enrich the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need such a Body life, a Body life not only according to 1 Corinthians, but also according to 2 Corinthians.</S>
