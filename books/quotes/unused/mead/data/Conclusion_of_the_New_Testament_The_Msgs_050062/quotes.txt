[2]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE FIFTY CHRIST HIS PERSON 30
[3]  In 1 Corinthians 1:30 Paul says that Christ "became wisdom to us from God."
[4]  This indicates that at one time Christ was not wisdom to us but that later He became wisdom to us.
[5]  But when we believed in Christ, God put us into Him, and then Christ became wisdom to us.
[6]  For the believers' experience and enjoyment Christ is the life-giving Spirit.
[7]  As the life-giving Spirit, Christ is also the freeing and transforming Spirit.
[8]  All three aspects of Christ as the Spirit are found in 2 Corinthians 3.
[9]  For the believers Christ is also the door to leave the fold John 10:9 .
[10]  Before Christ came, God put His chosen people under the custody of the law.
[11]  In addition to being the door and the pasture, Christ is our Shepherd.
[12]  He calls His sheep by name and leads them out of the fold John 10:3 .
[13]  Then He goes before the sheep, and they follow Him v. 4 . As the Shepherd, Christ takes the sheep out of the fold through Himself as the door and to Himself as the pasture.
[14]  As the good Shepherd, Christ laid down His psuche life, His human life, for the sheep so that they may have the zoe life, the divine life, the eternal life.
[15]  In this message we shall see more concerning what Christ is in His person to the believers.
[16]  The riches of Christ are what Christ is to us.
[17]  In chapter one of Ephesians Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation to know three great and profound matters: the hope of God's calling, the riches of the glory of God's inheritance in the saints, and the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, the power God exercised in raising Christ from among the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, a power that is now being transmitted to us and applied to us vv.
[18]  These three categories of profound matters are aspects of the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[19]  When Paul spoke regarding the unsearchable riches of Christ, he was referring to such important matters as the hope of God's calling, the riches of the glory of God's inheritance, and the surpassing greatness of His power, not merely to such minor items as joy, peace, and rest.
[20]  Therefore, if we would know the unsearchable riches of Christ and testify of them, we need to know the hope of God's calling, the glory of God's inheritance, and the greatness of God's power exercised in Christ.
[21]  This refers to manna Exo 16:14-18 , which typifies Christ as our daily life supply John 6:31-35 for the Christian journey.
[22]  Paul's word in 1 Corinthians 10:4 indicates that Christ is the rock flowing with the spiritual drink: "All drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ."
[23]  The spiritual drink here refers to the living water that flowed out of the cleft rock Exo 17:6 , which typifies the Spirit as our all-inclusive drink John 7:37-39; 1 Cor 12:13 .
[24]  In His person Christ is the believers' way to the Father.
[25]  In John 14:6 the Lord Jesus also says that He is the reality.
[26]  Apart from the Triune God, the entire universe is vanity, having no content, no reality.
[27]  Speaking of Christ, Ephesians 2:14 says, "He Himself is our peace."
[28]  Colossians 2:16 and 17 say, "Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ."
[29]  Ephesians 6:14 says, "Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth."
[30]  For us to gird our loins is to strengthen our entire being.
[31]  Ephesians 6:16 continues, "With all these, having taken up the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one."
[32]  We need truth to gird our loins, righteousness to cover our conscience, peace as the standing for our feet, and faith to shield our entire being.
[33]  We come now to the very important and vital matter of Christ being the One who lives within the believers so that they may live Him.
[34]  In Galatians 4:19 Paul says, "My children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you."
[35]  Christ was born into the Galatian believers, but not formed in them when they were regenerated through Paul's preaching the gospel to them the first time.
[36]  The Christ who lives in us and who is being formed in us is now making His home in our hearts.
[37]  In Ephesians 3:17 Paul says, "That Christ may make His home in your hearts."
[38]  In Philippians 4:13 Paul says, "I can do all things in Him who empowers me."
[39]  If we would experience Christ as the empowering One, we need to let Him live in us, be formed in us, make His home in us, and be magnified in us.
[40]  But when Christ lives in us, is formed in us, makes His home in us, and is magnified in us, the way is prepared for Him not only to strengthen us but to empower us.
[41]  We have seen that to the believers Christ is the One living within them so that they may live Him, that He is being formed within them, that He is making His home in their hearts, that He is the One magnified in them, and that He is the One empowering them.
[42]  If we experience Christ in this way, we shall regard Him as most precious, as a treasure of excellent power.
[43]  First Corinthians 2:10 says, "The Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God."
[44]  The depths of God refer to the deep things of God, which are Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion, foreordained, prepared, and given to us freely by God.
[45]  The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation.
[46]  First Peter 2:21 says, "Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model that you should follow in His steps."
[47]  Hebrews 2:10 says, "It was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings."
[48]  The last step of God's great salvation is to bring His many sons into glory, into His expression.
[49]  Hebrews 4:14 says, "Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession."
[50]  Christ was sent from God to us through incarnation to be our Apostle.
[51]  In this message we shall cover the remaining aspects of what Christ is in His person to the believers.
[52]  In 1 Corinthians 11:3 Paul says, "I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God."
[53]  To the believers Christ is also the Master as their Sovereign Lord.
[54]  Second Peter 2:1 speaks of Christ as the Master who bought us, referring both to Christ's person and His redemption, by which He purchased the believers.
[55]  Jude 4 speaks of "our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ."
[56]  Hebrews 1:9 and 3:14 reveal that Christ is our Partner.
[57]  Hebrews 1:9 says, "God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy above Your partners."
[58]  In God's economy Christ is God's appointed One to accomplish God's plan, and we are Christ's partners in the divine interest.
[59]  Hebrews 13:5 says that our way of life should be without love of money and that we should be satisfied with our circumstances, for the Lord upholds us and will by no means forsake us.
[60]  "So that, being of good courage we say, the Lord is my Helper" v. 6 . We should be satisfied with whatever we have and with whatever circumstances we are in, knowing that we have the Lord and that we can trust in Him for our living.
[61]  Because we have Christ as our Helper, we should be content and at peace.
[62]  In this message we shall begin to consider what Christ is in His person in the church.
[63]  After Peter, receiving a revelation from the Father, declared that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God Matt 16:16 , the Lord said, "On this rock I will build My church" Matt 16:18 .
[64]  In addition to being the Savior of the Body, Christ is also the Head of the church.
[65]  In the church Christ is every member of the new man.
[66]  Colossians 3:11 says, "Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all."
[67]  Then we shall go on to see Christ in God's building.
[68]  The High Priest Dressing the Lamps in the Sanctuary
[69]  In Revelation 1:13-16 we see that Christ is the High Priest dressing the lamps cf.
[70]  The Holder of the Keys of Death and Hades
[71]  In Revelation 1:18 the Lord Jesus says, "I have the keys of death and of Hades."
[72]  Due to the fall and sin of man, death has come in and is now operating on earth to collect all sinful people and to bring them to Hades, the place where the dead are kept.
[73]  In God's building there is the need for a rock, and this rock is Christ Matt 16:18 .
[74]  This rock is Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 and as the consummation of the Triune God after the steps of His process.
[75]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE SIXTY CHRIST HIS PERSON 40
[76]  In this message we come to the last aspect of what Christ is in His person Christ in the divine administration.
[77]  In the divine administration Christ is the Ruler of the kings of the earth Rev 1:5 .
[78]  The Christ who is God eternal, who became a man, who lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, who died an all-inclusive death on the cross, who resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit, and who ascended to the heavens to be the Lord, the Christ, and the Executor of God's New Testament economy is now the Ruler of the kings of the earth.
[79]  In Revelation 5 we see that, in the divine administration, Christ is the Opener of the new covenant.
[80]  The book of Revelation is a book of judgment, and Revelation 8:3-5 unveils Christ as the Executor of God's judgment.
[81]  Verse 3 says, "Another Angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and much incense was given to Him that He should add it to the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne."
[82]  This another Angel is Christ, not as a common angel but as a special Angel.
[83]  The Judge of the Believers at the Judgment Seat
[84]  Certain verses in the New Testament reveal that Christ is the Judge of the believers at the judgment seat.
[85]  "We must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may be recompensed for the things done through the body, according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad" 2 Cor 5:10 .
[86]  The King of Kings and Lord of Lords Defeating Antichrist
[87]  Verse 11 says, "I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sits on it called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war."
[88]  In the divine administration Christ is the Judge of the living.
[89]  "The Father does not judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son" John 5:22 .
[90]  As the Son of God John 5:25 Christ can give life John 5:21 , and as the Son of Man He can execute judgment.
[91]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE SIXTY-ONE CHRIST HIS ATTRIBUTES AND VIRTUES 1
[92]  In this message we shall begin to consider Christ's attributes and virtues.
[93]  We use "attributes" in relation to God and "virtues" in relation to man.
[94]  Another of Christ's attributes is honor Heb 2:9; Rev 5:12 .
[95]  Honor is the preciousness related to Jesus' worth, value "precious" in 1 Peter 2:7 is the same word in Greek as "honor" in Hebrews 2:9 , and the dignity which is related to His position 2 Pet 1:17; Rom 13:7 .
[96]  Whereas glory, the expression of God, refers to a condition, honor refers to a high position, in particular to the dignity that is related to such a position.
[97]  As the ascended One crowned with glory and honor, Christ is in a state of glory and has a rank of honor.
[98]  Although Christ is both the Son of God and the Son of Man, when we come to His being crowned with glory and honor, we must pay special attention to His humanity, to His being the Son of Man.
[99]  Revelation 5:13 says, "To Him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb, be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever."
[100]  This verse indicates that might is another of Christ's attributes.
[101]  John 14:27 says, "Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you.
[102]  Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful."
[103]  Here we see that Christ has the attribute of peace.
[104]  Christ's peace is not only an attribute of Christ; it is also Christ Himself.
[105]  In this message we shall consider further Christ's divine attributes and human virtues.
[106]  Hebrews 2:17 says, "He ought to be made like His brothers in all things, that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God."
[107]  Christ became a man and lived on earth as a man, passing through all the human sufferings.
[108]  In His humanity Christ has the virtue of meekness.
[109]  To be meek means not to resist the world's opposition but to suffer it willingly.
[110]  To have the virtue of meekness means that we do not invade others or fight with them.
[111]  A person may be humble without being willing to be lowly, for he may desire to be uplifted.
[112]  In 2 Corinthians 11:10 Paul says, "The truth of Christ is in me."
[113]  Because Paul lived by Christ, whatever Christ is became his virtue in his behavior.
