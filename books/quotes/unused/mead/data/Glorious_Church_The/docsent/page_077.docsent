   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE AND THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have yet to see what God will show us at the end. Verses 22:1-2 say, "And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here we are reminded of verse 2:7, which says, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The tree of life is planted in the Paradise of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the tree of life is in the city, this tells us that the New Jerusalem is the Paradise of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Recalling the book of Genesis, God created man as a type of Christ and the woman as a type of the church he desired to obtain in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God then put them, husband and wife, in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus we have the man, the woman, and the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then in Genesis 3 the serpent came in and they fell; as a result, God drove them out of the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Revelation 21, whom do we see in the New Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is the Lamb, the One whom Adam typified in Genesis 2; He is wholly for God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is also the wife of the Lamb, who was typified by Eve in Genesis 2; she is wholly for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The New Jerusalem is the wife of the Lamb and is also the Paradise of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Genesis 2 there were three entities Adam, Eve, and the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in Revelation 21 and 22 there are only two the Lamb and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The city is the bride and also the Paradise; the woman and the Paradise have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The woman in Genesis could be driven away, while the woman at the end of Revelation can no longer be driven out.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some people may worry and ask, "What will happen in eternity?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What if the devil should come in again then what would we do?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can answer that it is impossible for this to happen again, because in eternity God Himself will dwell in the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Praise God!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He set up a garden in Genesis, a garden which had no wall and which was not guarded well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, the serpent and sin could enter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But God finally obtains a city for the sake of protection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is impossible for this city to be ever involved in a fall.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The woman and Paradise have been so joined that nothing can ever separate them again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Henceforth, this woman cannot be driven out by any means.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 22:1 speaks of a river of water of life being in the middle of the street of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Genesis there were four rivers, two of which have always oppressed the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Babylon was built upon the river Pison, and Nineveh upon the river Hiddekel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's children have always been persecuted by these two rivers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But in the New Jerusalem there is only one river the river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This river gives life and joy to man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Psalm 46:4 says: "There is a river whose streams gladden the city of God,/The holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This river especially gives gladness to God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The water of this river proceeds "out of the throne of God and of the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The throne is singular because God and the Lamb are sitting on one throne.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that the reign of Christ is the reign of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 2 says, "And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once again the number twelve is used.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What does it mean that the tree bears twelve kinds of fruits and yields its fruit every month?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a way of saying that everything is satisfied, and that this satisfaction is for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every month there is life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In eternity we will continue to know Christ and continue to receive the life of the Lord without any interruption there will not be a month when there is no fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that there will be no regression.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today we see something which is very sad that which the Scripture shows as the evaluation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Men from twenty years of age to sixty years of age were given a certain valuation, but the value was lowered for those over sixty years of age Lev 27:3, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is going backward, but in eternity there will be no going backward.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There will be new life and new fruit every month.</S>
