<h1 class="title">CHRIST BEING<br />
THE CENTRAL PURPOSE OF GOD</h1>
<p>Colossians reveals the all-inclusive and unlimited Christ. Speaking of Christ as the Beloved, 1:15 says, &ldquo;Who is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation.&rdquo; Verses 17 through 19 say, &ldquo;He is before all things, and all things cohere in Him; and He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things; for in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell.&rdquo; We need to pay attention to a few things in these verses. First, Christ is the image of the invisible God. Without Christ, people cannot see God. Second, Christ is before all things. Third, Christ is the Firstborn of all creation. Fourth, He is the Head of the Body, the church. Fifth, He is the Firstborn from the dead. Verses 15 and 18 speak of two aspects of Christ&rsquo;s being the Firstborn. He is the Firstborn of all creation and the Firstborn from the dead. Sixth, because Christ is the Firstborn both in creation and from the dead, He has the first place in all things, in everything. Seventh, all the fullness is pleased to dwell in Him.</p>
<p>I hope that we can remember these seven points. Christ is the image of God; Christ is before all things; Christ is the Firstborn of all creation; Christ is the Head of the Body&mdash;the church; Christ is the Firstborn from the dead; Christ has the first place in all things; and all the fullness is pleased to dwell in Christ. Most Christians pay attention to verse 14, which says, &ldquo;In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.&rdquo; Every believer is deeply impressed with the redemption that Christ accomplished for the forgiveness of sins. As a result, when we consider the Lord, we thank and praise Him mainly for redemption. However, we must remember that in addition to redemption Colossians speaks of at least seven more points concerning Christ. It is regrettable that we often neglect these seven points.</p>
<p>Colossians 2:2-3 says, &ldquo;Unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ, in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.&rdquo; Verse 9 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; These verses reveal that Christ is the mystery of God. In other words, Christ is the explanation of God, because all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:11 says, &ldquo;Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; The word <em>all</em> here refers to all the members who compose the new man. In the new man Christ is all and in all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTRAL PURPOSE OF GOD IN THE UNIVERSE</h2>
<p>The vision concerning Christ is a great matter in the Bible and a tremendous matter in the universe. It is not an exaggeration to say that Christ is the meaning of the universe. Human beings invented religion, but religion is unable to understand the central meaning of the universe. God created man with a spirit so that man would have the desire to worship God; however, man does not know the meaning of the universe, because man lacks revelation from God. It is easy for man to realize that there is a God in the universe, but it is not so easy for man to see the central purpose of God in the universe. It is easy to lead people to believe that there is a sovereign God in the universe, because this does not require much revelation or vision. Romans 1:20 says, &ldquo;The invisible things of Him, both His eternal power and divine characteristics, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, being perceived by the things made, so that they would be without excuse.&rdquo; Hence, people are able to perceive from the various things in nature that there is a God in the universe. But if they want to know the central purpose of God in the universe, they must receive revelation from God. I hope that we will see the central purpose of God in the universe and the meaning of the universe.</p>
<p>Discussions concerning worshipping or serving God usually involve concepts related to philosophy, morality, religion, and spiritual gifts. A person who neither desires nor worships God will not consider these things. However, the day that this person desires to worship or serve God, his concept will fall into one of these four areas. He may have a philosophical concept, or he may have a moral concept of doing good. He may have a religious concept of revering and fearing God and of trying to please God, or he may have a more advanced concept of wanting to be spiritual or gifted. As soon as a person considers God or wants to serve Him, he cannot avoid these concepts. These concepts are good, but they are natural and are not based on revelation from God. Many believers, who have a heart to serve God, have still not been delivered from these concepts. The Bible reveals that these concepts are not the central purpose of God in the universe. God does not want people to be foolish or immoral, to not fear Him, or to be without spiritual gifts, nor does God want people to focus on philosophy, morality, religion, or spiritual gifts. Christ is the central purpose of God and the ultimate meaning of the universe. Christ is God&rsquo;s desire, and Christ is also the central meaning of the universe. God&rsquo;s purpose for man and the meaning of the universe are nothing other than Christ.</p>
<p>There are four books in the Bible that deal specifically with the four problems of philosophy, morality, religion, and spiritual gifts. Colossians deals with philosophy, Galatians deals with morality and keeping the law, Hebrews deals with religion, and 1 Corinthians deals with spiritual gifts. If we see light in the Word of God, we will realize that philosophy, morality, religion, and spiritual gifts are versus Christ. Philosophy is versus Christ, morality is versus Christ, religion is versus Christ, and spiritual gifts are versus Christ. Most believers know that the flesh, the world, sin, and the self are versus Christ. However, we must see that not only these negative things are versus Christ; even the positive things in human society and culture&mdash;philosophy, morality, religion, and spiritual gifts&mdash;are versus Christ. Just as the negative things are versus Christ, so also the positive things are versus Christ. Satan&rsquo;s stratagem is to prevent people from paying attention to Christ. Regardless of whether something is positive or negative, as long as we focus on it instead of Christ, Satan has attained his goal.</p>
<p>Concerning society, it is commonly believed that people in the East are different from people in the West. People believe that the Japanese are different from the Germans and that the British, the Americans, and the French are different from one another. However, if we travel, we will discover that no matter where people are from, all persons bear the same likeness, the likeness of Adam. All people have the same ancestor&mdash;Adam; they are descendants of Adam. We can say that we all have the same last name, Adam, because we are all out of Adam. People in the United States often like to say which country their ancestors came from; however, all of our ancestors came out of Adam.</p>
<p>People from different places in the world may act differently&mdash;the Chinese eat with chopsticks, and the Westerners eat with knives and forks&mdash;but all people have the same lust. Many different things happen in society in the East and in the West, but these things are all according to the same principle of Satan using many things to replace Christ. On the negative side, some people like to sin and to love the world, and others indulge themselves and live in the flesh. On the positive side, some people endeavor to do good and are zealous concerning religion, and others pursue spirituality and seek gifts. If we would carefully consider these matters, we will realize that the evildoers do not give ground to Christ, and those who promote philosophy, morality, religion, and spiritual gifts also do not give ground to Christ.</p>
<p>When I was in New York, I visited an elderly American woman who said that she was a Christian and who had also grown up in a Christian family. While discussing spiritual matters with her, I gradually realized that she had not believed in the Lord. She had many religious regulations but very little knowledge of Christ. Later, she told me that a certain chapel served as the center for the social life of the local residents. People in that area went to the Sunday service every week because it was the best social activity. The pastor exhorted them to be good people and to be kind to their neighbors. It is sad to see people keeping religion but not giving Christ any ground in their being. Some people in society commit crimes, and others follow religion, but Satan is doing the same thing with both types of people: he is preventing them from giving Christ the ground in them. Philosophy, morality, religion, and spiritual gifts are not the central purpose of God. As those who pursue the Lord, we must ask Him to visit us and show us a vision so that we may see that Christ is God&rsquo;s central purpose and the central meaning of the universe. God wants Christ to be the center of all things and to have the first place in all things.</p>
<p>Even today the universe is still a mystery to mankind. Why does the universe exist? Nearly no one can answer this question. The Bible, however, reveals that Christ is the only answer to the existence of the universe and of mankind. God wants Christ to be expressed. Therefore, Christ has entered into a group of created people to be expressed through them. This is the mystery of mysteries. Colossians reveals that Christ is the meaning of the entire universe. God created the universe and mankind for Christ, and God is gaining the saints and the church for Christ. If it were not for the revelation in the Bible concerning Christ as the centrality of God, the human mind would have no way to comprehend this matter. Hence, we need to be delivered from our natural concepts and receive the revelation in the Bible in order to know Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
