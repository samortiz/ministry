<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION</h1><h1 class="title">(4)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: July 26, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><h2 class="head1">NOT BEING SUBJECTIVE IN LISTENING TO OTHERS</h2><p>Question: What are the particular things we have to know concerning listening to others?</p><p>Answer: Whether or not we can listen to others depends mainly on our objectivity. Only those who are objective can "translate," rather than "interpret," what they hear. In order to be objective, the self has to be dealt with. Once the self is dealt with, we become objective. Only an objective person can listen to others. Once a man becomes subjective in his attitude, he is useless in the work of God. A subjective person cannot listen to what others have to say, much less listen to what God has to say. The basic requirement for listening to others is to be objective. A lazy person is useless in the hand of God. So is a subjective person.</p><p>The same basic requirement holds true in understanding God's word&mdash;one must not be subjective. The kind of person we are will determine the kind of "word" we get. Once a man becomes subjective, he will read his own thoughts into God's word. Only an objective person will find God's will in His word.</p><p>No subjective person will truly understand others' feelings. Suppose three or five persons with a similar frame of mind are together. If a subjective person joins them, he may indulge in a self-centered discourse to the neglect of the others' feelings. Such a person lives in the realm of his own feelings. He cannot touch others' feelings. An objective person, however, would first touch others' feelings; he would easily blend in with their feelings and be one with their spirit. A subjective person can never catch up with others' spirit or enter others' feelings. He cannot touch God's word, because he cares only for his own feeling. He is insensitive to the feeling of the Holy Spirit. A subjective person only cares about himself. He wants to subject others' feelings to his own. Problems arise when a subjective person takes control, because others' feelings are always trampled.</p><p>The main reason for subjectivity is an unbroken self. All subjective persons are audacious, and all of them are short of spiritual knowledge before God. A subjective person only sees himself. He does not know how high the sky is or how great the earth is. A subjective person must be thoroughly broken.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT BEING SUBJECTIVE IN JUDGMENT</h2><p>It is not easy for a worker of the Lord to make judgments. We have to pray and consider much before we can make a small decision. If a man can make a decision within five minutes, it means that he is a very subjective person. In order to deal with a situation, we have to build up some history behind us. Otherwise, we cannot deal with it. For example, the disciples once asked the Lord the reason they could not cast out a demon. The Lord answered that the kind of demon in question could only be cast out through fasting and prayer (Matt. 17:19, 21). Yet the Lord cast out the demon immediately, indicating that the Lord Himself was well prepared. This is a basic requirement for working for the Lord. Many brothers and sisters are too bold. There is a saying that a foolish man will dare to go where angels fear to tread. When a man places himself under God's mighty hand and remains in submission, not speaking or acting rashly, and not trying to be a teacher to many, he will carry out God's will and be qualified to make judgments.</p><p>Subjectivity should be condemned. All divisions arise out of human subjectivity. A subjective person cannot obey others. Before the Lord, it is not easy to make judgments concerning many things. Yet many young brothers come to some kind of judgment within five minutes without having prayed about it at all. (Or perhaps they do not know how to pray in the first place.) They are too bold. They are bold because they are foolish. It is impossible to tell such a person to fear God or to submit to others.</p>
