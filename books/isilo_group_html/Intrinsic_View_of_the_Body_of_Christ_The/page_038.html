For many of us, the way that we comb our hair is not up to the standard of being in Christ as the Head. We comb our hair in ourselves, not in Christ. Some of the sisters spend a great deal of time to style their hair, and yet they say that they do not have time for morning revival. This shows that they need to grow up into Christ in combing their hair. When the brothers buy a pair of shoes or a tie, they should buy them in Christ. We should be in Christ even regarding the shoes and ties which we wear. We need to be those who are growing up into the Head, Christ, in all things.</P><P>When we grow up into the Head, something proceeds out from Him. Ephesians 4:16 says, "Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love." To grow in life is to grow into the Head, Christ, but to operate in the Body of Christ is to operate out from Him. First, we grow up into the Head; then we have something that is out from the Head for the building up of the Body.</P><P>The Body is joined together through the joints of the rich supply and knit together through each one part functioning in its measure. Even a physical building needs steel frames as the joining factor. Then material needs to be knit together to fill up the holes between the frames. Through this joining and knitting, the building becomes a solid entity. The Body of Christ is joined together and knit together by two groups of believers&#151;the joints and the parts. Through the functioning of all the members, all the Body causes the growth of the Body, and this growth is for the building up. The Body is built up by itself through all the members.</P><P>The first section of Ephesians 4 shows us that mingling is going on, and the second section shows us that building is going on. Thus, Ephesians 4 shows us mingling and building. Mingling is going on with the Body, the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father. The Spirit, who is the realization of God the Son, is the essence of the divine mingling with the believers; the Son, who is the Lord and embodiment of the Father, is the element of this mingling; and the Father, who is over all, through all, and in all, is the origin, the source, of the divine mingling. This mingling is the constitution of the Body of Christ.</P><P>The mingling is going on, but we all can testify that our being mingled with the Triune God is not thorough. Much of the time, the Triune God cannot get through in us. Our mind is too strong and our emotion is either too hot or too cold. How can the Triune God have the full way to mingle Himself with us? The three of the Godhead are fellowshipping among Themselves for the purpose of mingling with us. They are finding a way to mingle Themselves with persons who are so strong in their mind and fluctuating in their emotion.</P><P>The things in our environment are sovereignly arranged to help us to be mingled with the Triune God. After being married, some couples may think that their marriage was a mistake. During the time of courtship, the brother thought that the sister was wonderful, and the sister thought the same about the brother. After their marriage and honeymoon, however, both of them may feel that their marriage was wrong. This is according to the human viewpoint. But the Lord knows that the husbands need their wives, and the wives need their husbands. This is God's assignment. Many times only the wife has a way to break the husband. This dear wife, the "wrong" wife, is Christ's cross to her husband.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Intrinsic View of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 38</div><br></body></html>
