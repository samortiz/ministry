   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE ONE INTRODUCTION TO A HOLY LIFE FOR THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 1:1-3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The two Epistles of Paul to the Thessalonians may be considered the earliest of Paul's writings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thessalonica was a city of the Roman Empire in the province of Macedonia, north of the province of Achaia.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the Macedonian call, which Paul received on his second journey of ministry, he and his co-worker Silvanus visited first Philippi and then Thessalonica Acts 16:9-12; 17:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The apostle stayed and worked there for only a short time, probably less than one month Acts 17:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>WRITTEN TO NEW BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The two Epistles to the Thessalonians were written in the early days, while Paul was still on his second journey of ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the course of this journey, Paul stayed in Thessalonica for less than a month.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Acts, Paul worked there for three Sabbaths, for about three weeks, not long after his visit to Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Epistle to the Philippians, a wonderful book, was written much later, during Paul's imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No doubt, when Paul wrote to the Thessalonians, the church in Thessalonica was still very young.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I doubt that the believers there had been in the church life for even a full year when these two Epistles were written.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, in 1 and 2 Thessalonians we see certain points that are not covered in Paul's other Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because the church in Thessalonica was so young, Paul's Epistles to the Thessalonians are more or less to those in a childhood stage.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some of what Paul says to the Thessalonians is different from what he says to other churches that were more experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is worthwhile for us to study 1 and 2 Thessalonians in order to know the situation and condition of a young church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By reading these two books we can know the young Christian life and the young church life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we keep in mind this aspect of the background, we shall be helped in our reading of these Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The books of 1 and 2 Thessalonians were not written to experienced Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They were written to young believers, to those who had been saved for less than a year.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Most of them had been typical Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, in writing to them, Paul surely viewed them as young believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These Epistles are very precious, for they render us particular help concerning the young Christian life and church life.</S>
