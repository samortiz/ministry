for Their Growth and Function</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4 tells us that the Lord as the Head of the Body gave many gifts, gifted persons, as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers (v. 11). The thought in Christianity is that this verse refers to ministers, or preachers, to take care of the Christian work. But here the apostle Paul tells us that these gifted persons&rsquo; duty and ministry are to perfect the saints (v. 12). What is it to perfect the saints? Many years ago I thought that to perfect the saints was just to teach them or to train them, but this is not right. Now I can say definitely that to perfect the saints is to feed them, to give them something to eat that they may be nourished, that they may grow.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:12 speaks of the perfecting of the saints. Then verse 13 says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at...a full-grown man.&rdquo; A small boy becomes a full-grown man not by being taught and regulated but by eating nourishing food. The mother day by day prepares food to feed him until he becomes a full-grown man. Ephesians 4 does not say that we perfect the saints until they graduate from a seminary. It says that we perfect the saints until they all arrive at a full-grown man. Then the following verse, verse 14, says, &ldquo;That we may be no longer little children...&rdquo; How can you make a child grow? No doubt, you have to feed, to nourish, the child. Then verse 15 says, &ldquo;Holding to truth...we may grow up into Him in all things.&rdquo; In these verses we need to take note of the phrases <em>full-grown man, no longer little children,</em> and <em>grow up into Him in all things.</em> This shows that to perfect the saints is to nourish them that they may grow.</p>
<p>The little babes have all the necessary organs. They have eyes, ears, a nose, feet, and arms, but they do not have the adequate function, because they are short of growth. To perfect the saints does not mean that the saints do not have &ldquo;ears,&rdquo; so you come to make ears for them. In other words, to perfect the saints does not mean that you come to teach them. Instead, to perfect the saints is to feed them that they may grow. When little babes are fed, eventually they are able to function more and more in listening, speaking, and walking. They have all the organs, but they do not have the function, because they are short of growth. You cannot teach them to have the function. The only way for them to have the function is for them to grow up, so you need to feed them. This is not my concept. In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul said that he fed the saints, and God caused the growth (vv. 2, 6). By the growth our functions will come out.</p>
<p>In Christianity the Christians are put into the pews just to sit there, making them jobless. But even if they were given some responsibility, it would be hard for them to function because of their lack of growth in life. Once when I was staying in Manila, a brother in the church was sick in the hospital. Some of our brothers went to visit him, and they had a long prayer time. This brother&rsquo;s relatives who were in Christianity were surprised. They said to each other, &ldquo;Are all these people pastors and ministers? If not, how could they pray?&rdquo; This shows that many in Christianity do not know how to pray. When people have legal problems, they go to a lawyer. If they are sick, they go to a doctor. If they have something to pray about, they go to a pastor. This is the real situation. This is because Christianity gives people only doctrinal teaching. Second Timothy 4:3 says, &ldquo;The time will come when they will not tolerate the healthy teaching; but according to their own lusts they will heap up to themselves teachers, having itching ears.&rdquo; These are ears that seek pleasant speaking for their own pleasure. Such speaking does not feed people. We need the healthy teaching and the speaking that feeds others so that they may grow in the divine life.</p>
<p>Today the Lord is going to recover the building up of His Body. In order to carry out this recovery, we have to reject all the dead teachings, regulations, and formalities. The Lord wants us to eat Him. By eating we will grow. We are an eating people. All the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are feeders. They feed the saints to make them grow. By growth they will be perfected to function. This is why everyone is a functioning member in the church. Everyone can function because everyone eats. Now we know that by eating Jesus we grow, and by this growth we have the function and also grow up into Christ in everything.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:16 goes on to say that when we grow up into Him, something comes out from Him. First, we grow into Him; then out of Him we all have something to share. Every joint has something to supply, and every part has something with which to operate. By all the parts and joints, the Body grows unto the building up of itself in love. This is the way the church is built up.</p>
<p>The Head, Christ, gives all the gifted persons, and the gifted persons do not do a common Christian work. They perfect the saints by feeding them. Then all the saints grow, and they will have the functions. When all these functions are put together, this is the building up of the Body. Today the Lord is going to recover this kind of building. If someone asks you who your pastor is, you have to say that among us everyone is a pastor. This is because everyone functions.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4 shows that the Lord Jesus does not build the church directly by Himself. Neither do the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers build the church directly by themselves. It is the functioning members who build up the church directly. Christ gave the gifted persons, who do the perfecting work. Then the saints are perfected to grow and to gain the function. Then they use their function to build the church directly by themselves. This causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. This is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We believe that today is the time for the Lord to fully fulfill His prophecy to recover you and me, every member, as a functioning one for the building up of His Body.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
