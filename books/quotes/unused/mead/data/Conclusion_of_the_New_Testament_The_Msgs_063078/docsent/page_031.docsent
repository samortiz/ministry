   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall begin to consider Christ's work in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>E. IN HIS DEATH 1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Giving Himself for the Believers That He Might Redeem Them and Purify to Himself a People for His Own Possession as His Peculiar Treasure</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In His death Christ gave Himself for the believers that He might redeem them and purify to Himself a people for His own possession as His peculiar treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians 5:2 says that Christ loved us and "gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Bible there is a difference between an offering and a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>An offering is for fellowship with God, whereas a sacrifice is for redemption from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ gave Himself up for us both as an offering to have fellowship with God and as a sacrifice to redeem us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In loving us Christ gave Himself up for us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was for us, but it was a sweet-smelling savor to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whereas the title "Christ" mainly denotes Christ's mission to carry out God's plan, "the Son of God" denotes Christ's person to impart God's life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Son of God loved us and purposely gave Himself for us that He might impart the divine life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As Paul wrote this verse, he was filled with appreciation of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was the reason at the end of the verse he spoke of Christ's loving him and of having given Himself for him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Titus 2:14 Paul says that Christ "gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify to Himself a people for His own possession, zealous of good works."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The words "for us" here mean on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They do not mean instead of us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To redeem means to buy with a price 1 Cor 6:20; 1 Pet 1:18-19; 1 Tim 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ gave Himself for us not only that He might redeem us from all lawlessness but also purify to Himself a people for His own possession.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A people for His own possession or a peculiar people is an expression borrowed from the Old Testament Deut 7:6; 14:2; 26:18 and denotes a people privately possessed by God as His peculiar treasure Exo 19:5 , His own possession 1 Pet 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>2.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ephesians 5:25 tells us that Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ's loving the church and giving Himself up for her was for redemption and for the impartation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to John 19:34, blood and water came out of the Lord's pierced side.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The blood was for redemption, and the water was for the impartation of life so that the church might come into existence.</S>
