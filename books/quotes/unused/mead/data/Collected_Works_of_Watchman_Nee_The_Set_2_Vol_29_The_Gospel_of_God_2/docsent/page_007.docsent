   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WE BEING THE SPIRITUAL HOUSE GOD IS BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Fifth, the church is not only a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the individual Christians come together before God, they become a temple.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every Christian is like a stone, and the church is the spiritual house that God is building.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus is the foundation of this spiritual temple.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is a great stone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every Christian is a small stone built upon the Lord Jesus to become the temple of God and the habitation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is what is spoken of in 1 Peter 2:5.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there were a possibility for Christians to perish, the temple of God would become more unsightly than our run-down meeting hall; one minute the stones would be taken out, and another minute they would be put back in again, and the walls would be full of holes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If that were the case, why would God not make up His mind before He saved men?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God intends that we be built up into a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If it is a spiritual house, then not one stone can be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If any stone can be lost, the spiritual house would be in trouble and would not be up to standard.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Old Testament record in 1 Kings 6:7 tells us how the temple of Solomon was built.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chapter five is an account of Solomon sending men to the mountains to cut the stones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The stones were cut in the mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By chapter six, they were moved to mount Moriah for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, when the temple was being built, there was no sound from iron tools.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There was no need for further cutting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The skilled workmen had calculated accurately and prepared everything on the mountain before the materials were moved to the building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There was no more need of improvement; everything was done properly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If while building the earthly temple, Solomon's skilled men could cut the stones so well that they were exact in every way and had no need for improvement, could God change us, the living stones, once every two or three days when He builds the spiritual temple?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Could God have such oversight?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Would God not know how to calculate?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Is God worse than man?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Old Testament, God used men to build.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the New Testament, He builds by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Is God's own work inferior to man's?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the believers are stones for the building of the spiritual house, can they be lost?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, if we are in God's temple, we can never be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>HAVING THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>AS THE SEAL AND THE PLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sixth, there is another very important and wonderful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the time that every unbeliever is saved, not only does he receive eternal life and become a member of the Body of Christ and a living stone in the temple, but he receives the Holy Spirit as a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God places the Holy Spirit in him as a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ephesians 1:13 says, "In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Is that not our history?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have heard the gospel of our salvation and have believed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What happened after we believed?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every Christian has the Holy Spirit as the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is very obvious that the Holy Spirit does not belong just to some special Christians and that only specially sanctified Christians have life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 13 says that all who have heard the gospel of salvation and who have believed, have received the Holy Spirit as the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This proves that the seal of the Holy Spirit is something that all Christians have in common.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As soon as one believes, he is saved and has the Holy Spirit as the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What does it mean for a Christian to have the Holy Spirit as the seal?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is a seal?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are over three million people in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How does God know who belongs to Him and who does not?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you bring me a Bible today, how do I know that it is yours?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There are countless Bibles like yours.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Bible Society recently published a report saying that it sold over eleven million Bibles last year.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Among all those Bibles, how do you know which one is yours?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When you go home and put a seal on your Bible you know that it is yours.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even if you were to mix this Bible with all the Bibles in the world, you could still identify it as yours.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today, because there are so many people in the world, how do you know who belongs to God and who does not?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God has put a seal on you, proving that you belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God did not seal you on your forehead with a large wooden chop.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is not like the coming Antichrist, who will place a mark on man's forehead.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God put the Holy Spirit in you as a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All those who have the Holy Spirit belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All those who do not have the Holy Spirit do not belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At the time a person is saved, God does a sealing work on him and puts the Holy Spirit within him to prove that he is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If the seal of the Holy Spirit in us can be erased, then it is possible for us to perish; we may be considered as not belonging to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may be considered as typical people in the world or even as God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But if this seal is within us, then we belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How long will the seal of God be in us?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The last part of Ephesians 4:30 says, "In whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>"Whom" refers to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The previous clause says, "And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This seal will last unto the day of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>How long does the Bible say that we will have the seal of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We will not have it for merely three or five years, or for three or five hundred years, but until the day of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What is the day of redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Romans 8 says that the day of redemption is the day when the Lord Jesus will come back.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The day of redemption is the day when our bodies will be redeemed v. 23 . Hence, this denotes the day when the Lord Jesus comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The seal of the Holy Spirit remains in us until the coming again of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When the Lord Jesus comes again not the time of the first rapture at the beginning of the tribulation, but at the time that the whole Body will be raptured , all the believers will be taken up into the air.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord Jesus will send the angels to come and gather these believers.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The angels are limited.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They are not omniscient; they do not know everything.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The angels are the servants sent out to invite the guests.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When these angels see all those with the seal of the Holy Spirit, they will gather them.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Hence, the Holy Spirit is not in us for three or five days, or for three or five hundred days, but in us until the day of rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Today if a man says that he can lose his salvation and perish, then I will ask him what he will do with the seal of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Since God has said that we have been sealed by Him, there is nothing we can do to remove this seal.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>God has said that this seal will remain until the day of Jesus Christ and the day of rapture.</S>
