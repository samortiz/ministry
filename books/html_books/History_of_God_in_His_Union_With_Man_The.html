The living, purposeful, active, and acting God surely needs a history, a biography. Recently we published a biography of Brother Watchman Nee (Watchman Nee: A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age published by Living Stream Ministry). Should there not also be a book concerning the biography of God? We need to realize that there is such a book. This book took approximately fifteen hundred years to complete through more than forty writers. The first writer was Moses and the last writer was John. This book is the Bible. The Bible is the biography of God, the history of God. Actually, we may say the Bible is the autobiography of God, because it is a book about God written by God Himself through a number of writers moved by the Holy Spirit. Through His servants, God wrote His autobiography. The entire Bible is a history of the Triune God.</P><P>We have to know God's history because His history has everything to do with us. This is why this series of messages is entitled The History of God in His Union with Man. This means that God's history has become our history because He is in union with us. We can illustrate this with the union between a husband and wife. In my book about Brother Nee, there is a photograph of him with his wife. A history of Brother Nee could not be written without speaking about his wife. In like manner, the Bible is God's history in union with us. He is our Husband, and we as His chosen and redeemed people are His wife.</P><P>The Christian life is a life in union with God. The New Testament says that Christ as the embodiment of God is the Husband and the church is the wife (Eph. 5:25-32; 2 Cor. 11:2). The New Testament also says that Christ will have a wedding. Revelation 19 speaks of the marriage of Christ and His marriage dinner (vv. 7-9). Revelation 21 and 22 show us the marriage life in eternity between God embodied in Christ and His chosen, redeemed people. The New Testament is a book concerning the Triune God with His wife. Thus, when we touch God's history, we touch our Christian life. The Christian life is a marriage life. We are the wife, and Christ is our Husband. The Christian life is the life of a wife who is married to the Triune God.</P><P>Our God has a history, and the most wonderful part of His history is His history in His union with man. Even in the Old Testament, God referred to Himself as the Husband and to His people as His wife (Isa. 54:5; 62:5; Jer. 2:2; 3:1, 14; 31:32; Ezek. 16:8; 23:5; Hosea 2:7, 19). The marriage life God desired with His people in the Old Testament is realized in the New Testament. In this series of messages, we want to teach and interpret the Bible with the view of the history of God in His union with man.</P><P>To teach the Bible is to teach people about God's history. The Bible is not merely a book of stories, but a living history of a living God. The Bible is written in a particular sequence from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22 to show us the biography of this wonderful living person. We need to know the Bible according to the view of God's history.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE NAME OF GOD</H2><P>The first thing we have to let people know in a biography is the name of the person about whom the biography is written. This is why we need to know the name of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah, Meaning I Am Who I Am&#151;<br>Self-existing and Ever-existing</H2><P>There are many divine titles of God, but in this message I want to refer to only two of them. God's name is first Jehovah. Jehovah means I Am Who I Am, the self-existing and ever-existing One. Exodus 3:13-14 says, "And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you." God called Moses and charged him to say to Israel that His name is I Am. Jehovah means I Am, I Am That I Am.</P><P>We can also say that Jehovah means I was, I am, and I will be. Revelation 1:4 refers to God as the One "who is and who was and who is coming." He is the One who was in the past, who is in the present, and who will be in the future. In other words, He is self-existing and ever-existing, implying that He has no beginning and no ending.</P><P>In John 8 the Lord referred to Himself as the "I Am" three times. In verse 24 He said, "Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins." He said in verse 28, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am." Finally, the Jews challenged Him by asking, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?" (v. 57). Then the Lord Jesus responded, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I am" (v. 58). Strictly speaking, it is wrong grammar to say that before Abraham came into being, "I am." Grammatically, He should have said that before Abraham, "He was," or "He had been." But this would be wrong theologically. He is the great I Am without beginning and without ending, from eternity to eternity.</P><P>His being the I Am means "I am whatever you need" and "I am everything." We have a signed check with the space for the amount left blank, and we may fill in whatever we need. After the name "I Am" we can fill in the amount. The heavenly bank will cash this check. The Lord is whatever we need. If we need salvation, light, life, power, wisdom, holiness, or righteousness, Jesus Christ Himself is all these things to us. He is Jehovah God, the great I Am.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Elohim (God), Implying the Faithful Strong One</H2><P>Another name for God is the Hebrew title Elohim, implying the faithful strong One (Gen. 1:1; 2:4). The word Elohim is plural in number. This indicates that God is triune. Genesis 1:1 says that in the beginning God (Elohim) created the heaven and the earth.</P><P>After God's creation and restoration of the universe, He came to the creation of man. In Genesis 1:26 God said, "Let Us make man in Our image." There is one God but the pronouns here are "Us" and "Our," indicating that there is a plurality with God. The words "let Us" imply that God is triune and that the three of the Godhead had a conference among Themselves. Thus, the Divine Trinity is fully implied at the beginning of the Bible in Genesis 1. Scofield pointed out that the word Elohim is composed of two Hebrew words, implying strength and faithfulness. Thus, God, Elohim, is the faithful strong One. He is strong and He is faithful, so He can do everything to keep His word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. GOD BEING ETERNAL</H2><P>The Triune God is eternal. No one can adequately explain what eternal means. The word eternal first implies the element of time. According to time God is forever and ever, eternal. God's being eternal also implies quality. His being eternal means that He is altogether complete and perfect, without defect. Concerning time He is eternal. He has no ending and no beginning. Concerning His quality He is complete and perfect. When the Bible says that God is life, this means that this life is without beginning and without ending. It also means that this life is complete and perfect. Our human life is not eternal but temporary. Also, our human life is not perfect or complete. God, however, is eternal both in time and in quality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. From Eternity to Eternity</H2><P>Psalm 90:2b says that from eternity to eternity He is God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Uncreated (as the Creating One)</H2><P>God, as the creating One, is uncreated (Gen. 1:1). The first sentence in the Bible says, "In the beginning God created..." This means that God Himself is the beginning. With Him there is the beginning because He is the beginning.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Without Beginning and without Ending&#151;<br>Self-existing and Ever-existing</H2><P>Hebrews 7:3 reveals that Christ as the Son of God is without beginning and without ending&#151;self-existing and ever-existing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Eternal in His Trinity</H2><P>God is eternal in His Trinity. Isaiah 9:6 speaks of the eternal Father. Hebrews 1:12 and 7:3 indicate clearly that the Son is eternal, self-existing, and ever-existing. Hebrews 9:14 refers to the eternal Spirit. This shows us that in totality the Triune God is eternal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. GOD BEING TRIUNE</H2><P>God is triune. Triune is from Latin. Tri means three, and une means one, so triune means three-one. Our God is three yet one and one yet three.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Elohim Being Plural,<br>Indicating That God Is Triune</H2><P>Elohim (God&#151;Gen. 1:1) is plural, indicating that God is triune, three-one, as confirmed by the pronouns Us, Our, and He in Genesis 1:26-27; 3:22a; and 11:7.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Name of the Father<br>and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit</H2><P>Matthew 28:19 tells us that we baptize people into one name of three persons: into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. One name implies three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, indicating the Divine Trinity. Before the Lord spoke this word, nobody knew that God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Old Testament did point out in some verses that God is the Father, in other verses that God is the Son, and in some verses that God is the Spirit. The three were there in the Old Testament, but they were never put together as one until the time of Matthew 28:19.</P><P>Matthew 28:19 was spoken after Christ's resurrection. The Triune God was consummated in resurrection. Before resurrection the Triune God was in a process of being consummated. When God came into time, He entered into a process, and His process can be illustrated by a tunnel. That tunnel was from incarnation to resurrection. When He was resurrected, He came out of that tunnel, so resurrection is the consummation of His process. After the consummation of His process, the Lord Jesus revealed the Triune God. In the Gospels the Lord Jesus charged the disciples to go and baptize people into the Triune God, but in the Acts the disciples baptized people into the name of the Lord Jesus (Acts 8:16; 19:5). This indicates that the Lord Jesus equals the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Father Being the Source of the Triune God,<br>the Son Being the Expression of the Triune God,<br>and the Spirit Being the Reaching,<br>the Application, of the Triune God</H2><P>The Father is the source of the Triune God, the Son is the expression of the Triune God (John 1:18), and the Spirit is the reaching, the application, of the Triune God (2 Cor. 13:14). These are simple, clear, and wonderful expressions. The Father is the fountain, the source, and the Son is the spring as the course to express the source. This course, this spring, issues in a flow, which is the Spirit as the reaching, the application, of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Three Co-existing and Coinhering<br>at the Same Time from Eternity to Eternity</H2><P>The three of the Godhead co-exist and coinhere at the same time from eternity to eternity (John 1:1-2; 14:10-11; 8:29; 15:26; Rev. 1:4-5a). The Father, the Son, and the Spirit co-exist. They are distinct. They also coinhere. To coinhere is to live within one another. While the three of the Godhead are co-existing, They are also mutually indwelling one another. In Their co-existence, the three of the Godhead are distinct, but Their coinherence makes Them one.</P><P>We believers and the Triune God also coinhere. Christ is in us, we are in Him, the Father is in Him, He is in the Father, and He with the Father and the Spirit is in us (John 14:10a, 17, 20). Thus, we are one with the Triune God. In John 15 the Lord Jesus said, "Abide in Me and I in you" (v. 4a). Christ and we become a mutual abiding place. We abide in Him, and He abides in us.</P><P>In eternity past, in the present, and in eternity future, the three of the Godhead are co-existing and coinhering. John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." This verse says that the Word was with God and that the Word was God. The Word and God co-exist, but the Word also is God. Thus, the Word and God are "two-one."</P><P>Verse 2 says, "He was in the beginning with God." This confirms that He was with God not only in time but also in the beginning. In the beginning, that is, from eternity past, the Word was with God. Christ's deity is eternal and absolute. From eternity past to eternity future He is with God and He is God.</P><P>John 14:10-11 says, "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me." This shows that the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son. When the Son speaks, the Father works. The Son's speaking is the speaking of the Father because They are coinhering. The Son and the Father are not separate. They are two, yet They are also one. In existence They are two, but They are coinhering, so They are one. The First is in the Second, and the Second is in the First, so when the second One speaks, the first One does the work.</P><P>In John 8:29 the Lord Jesus said, "He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone." God the Father sent Christ, but the Lord said that He who sent Him was with Him. When the Son came, the Father came with Him. When the Lord Jesus was traveling on this earth, He was traveling with the Father. He said that the Father had not left Him alone. Thus, when He was praying in Gethsemane, the Father was there. When He was dying on the cross, He was dying there with the Father. Jesus the Man was dying on the cross with God. Charles Wesley wrote a hymn with a line that says, "Amazing love! how can it be/That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?" (Hymns, #296). This means that our God died for us. When Christ died on the cross, that was God dying for us. Christ died with God because God never left Him alone. Even in His crucifixion, God was with Him.</P><P>John 15:26 says, "But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality, who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me." The Greek word for "from," used twice in this verse, is literally "from with." The Spirit of reality, who is sent by the Son from the Father, comes not only from the Father but also with the Father. John 8:29 shows that the Father was with the Son. Then John 15:26 shows that the Father was with the Spirit. Thus, the three are one. When the Son came, He came with the Father. When the Spirit comes, He comes with the Father. Thus, the Father was and still is with the Son and with the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Son Coming from with the Father<br>and in the Father's Name</H2><P>The Son came from with the Father and in the Father's name (John 6:46; 1:14; 5:43a; cf. 1 John 2:23b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Spirit Being Sent<br>from with the Father in the Son's Name</H2><P>The Spirit was sent from with the Father in the Son's name (John 15:26; 14:26). Thus, the Son came in the Father's name, and the Spirit came in the Son's name. This shows that the three came as one. The Son came with the Father, and the Father's name is His name. He came with the Father as the Father. Then the Spirit came with the Father, and the Son's name is His name. He came with the Father as the Son. Thus, the Son is the Father (Isa. 9:6) and the Spirit is the Son (2 Cor. 3:17), so the three are one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Among the Three of the Divine Trinity,<br>There Being Distinction but No Separation</H2><P>Among the three of the Divine Trinity, there is distinction but no separation. The Father is distinct from the Son, the Son is distinct from the Spirit, and the Spirit is distinct from the Son and the Father. The three of the Godhead co-exist in Their coinherence, so They are distinct but not separate. In the Triune God there is no separation, only distinction. The Triune God exists in His coinherence. On the one hand, the three are coinhering; on the other hand, at the same time they are co-existing. Thus, They are one. They are not separate.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. GOD MAKING AN ETERNAL ECONOMY</H2><P>In eternity past God made an eternal economy (Eph. 3:9-10; 1:10). This is God's history in eternity past. Ephesians 3:9 and 10 say, "And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church." The economy of God's mystery is to have a church for the manifestation of God. The first thing which God may have done before the foundation of the world in eternity past was to make an economy to produce the church to manifest God. The economy of the mystery hidden in God throughout the ages was to produce the church for the showing forth of God's multifarious wisdom.</P><P>Ephesians 1:10 says, "Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him." This verse shows that God's economy is to head up all things in Christ. The above portions of Ephesians show us that God in eternity past made an eternal economy to produce the church for the manifestation of God and for the heading up of all things in Christ. Therefore, this economy is all-inclusive. In the whole universe, two things are most crucial: 1) to produce the church for God's manifestation; and 2) to head up all things in Christ. These two things were determined in an economy made by God in eternity. This might have been the first item of God's history, the first thing He did in eternity past.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. GOD IN HIS DIVINE TRINITY<br>HOLDING A COUNCIL IN ETERNITY</H2><P>God in His Divine Trinity held a council in eternity (Acts 2:23 and note 1&#151;Recovery Version). Acts 2:23 says that Christ was "delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God." God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit held a council, a conference, in eternity to make the determination concerning the crucial death of Christ for the carrying out of God's eternal economy. God made an economy, but God had to make a decision regarding how to carry out His economy. For the carrying out of God's economy, Christ had to die an all-inclusive death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE SECOND OF THE DIVINE TRINITY<br>PREPARING TO CARRY OUT HIS<br>"GOINGS FORTH" FROM ETERNITY INTO TIME<br>TO BE BORN IN BETHLEHEM AS A MAN</H2><P>The Second of the Divine Trinity was preparing to carry out His "goings forth" from eternity into time to be born in Bethlehem as a man. Micah 5:2 tells us that Christ was going to be born in Bethlehem and that was a part of His "goings forth." Thus, in eternity past the Triune God was preparing to be incarnated, and that preparing was a part of His goings forth. His goings forth are His coming forth. Before God as the Second of the Divine Trinity came to be born in Bethlehem in time, He was preparing to come in eternity past.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. GOD BLESSING THE BELIEVERS IN CHRIST WITH THE SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS IN THE HEAVENLIES BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD</H2><P>God blessed the believers in Christ with the spiritual blessings in the heavenlies before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:3-6). In eternity past God blessed us before we were created. Before we were created, He blessed us in two things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Choosing Them to Be Holy,<br>to Be Sanctified unto Himself<br>with His Holy Nature</H2><P>In eternity past God chose us to be holy, to be sanctified unto Himself with His holy nature (v. 4). In eternity past God chose us to have His nature, indicating that He would be one with us, that is, that His nature would become our nature. With this nature we are being sanctified, separated unto God. He is holy in nature, and we are being made the same as He is in nature (Heb. 2:11; 2 Pet. 1:4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Predestinating Them, Marking Them Out,<br>unto Sonship, Making Them Sons<br>to Himself with His Divine Life</H2><P>In eternity past God predestinated us, marking us out, unto sonship, making us sons to Himself with His divine life (Eph. 1:5a). Thus, God blessed us in eternity past with two things&#151;with His nature and with His divine life. This is the top blessing which was given to us in eternity past before we were born.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. According to the Good Pleasure of His Will<br>to the Praise of the Glory of His Grace</H2><P>God's blessing us in eternity past with the spiritual blessings in the heavenlies was according to the good pleasure of His will (v. 5b) to the praise of the glory of His grace, with which He graced us in Christ, His Beloved (v. 6).</P><P>This is God's history in eternity past and this involves us. In eternity past, God made an economy to produce the church for His manifestation and to head up all things, including us, in Christ. He also held a council to determine that the Second of the Divine Trinity should come to die for us to carry out His economy. Then in eternity past He chose us to have His nature and to have His divine life so that we could be holy as He is and be His sons as His children to express Him. This is God's history in eternity past, and this history is our history. The Christian life began from God's choosing us and predestinating us in eternity past before the foundation of the world.</P><P>We need to know God in such a way from a deeper angle. Our God has a marvelous history which includes us. Actually, whatever He has done, whatever He is doing, and whatever He will do in His history are all for our Christian life. His history builds up our Christian life.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S HISTORY IN TIME<br>(FROM THE CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE<br>TO THE FINAL JUDGMENT<br>AT THE GREAT WHITE THRONE&#151;<br>GEN. 1:1&#151;REV. 20:15)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CREATING THE UNIVERSE AND<br>JUDGING SATAN AND THE UNIVERSE</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Creating the universe:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>God created the heavens and the earth&#151;Gen. 1:1:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>God created the heavens with all the living things in the heavens:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Stretching forth the heavens&#151;Isa. 42:5a; Zech. 12:1a.</li>			<li>Creating the stars&#151;Job 38:7a.</li>			<li>Creating the sons of God&#151;the angels, one of them becoming Satan&#151;Job 38:7b; 1:6.</li>			</ol>		<li>God created the earth with all the things on the earth:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Laying the foundations of the earth&#151;Zech. 12:1b; Job 38:4.</li>			<li>In the proper measurements with the solid bases and the marking cornerstones&#151;Job 38:5-6.</li>			<li>Spreading forth the earth and what springs up from it&#151;Isa. 42:5b.</li>			<li>The stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy at God's beautiful building of the earth&#151;Job 38:7.</li>			</ol>		</ol>	<li>God's initial creation of the universe before Satan's rebellion.</li>	</ol><li>Judging Satan and the universe:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Satan was the Daystar (translated in Latin, Lucifer), son of the dawn, indicating that Satan was one of the early angels created by God at the "morning" of the universe&#151;Isa. 14:12.</li>	<li>He was in Eden, the garden of God, upon the holy mountain in the heavens, and was anointed by God to be the chief archangel (Jude 9) above all the angels&#151;Ezek. 28:13-14:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>As the ruler of the world (proven by the musical instruments&#151;Ezek. 28:13b)&#151;John 12:31; Luke 4:5-6; Eph. 2:2.</li>		<li>As the cherub covering the ark, close to God as the high priest serving God&#151;Ezek. 28:14-15a.</li>		</ol>	<li>He rebelled against God&#151;Ezek. 28:15-16:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>His heart was lifted up because of his beauty and his brightness&#151;Ezek. 28:17.</li>		<li>He said in his heart, "I will ascend to heaven; / Above the stars of God / I will exalt my throne. / And I will sit upon the mount of assembly / In the uttermost parts of the north. / I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; / I will make myself the Most High"&#151;Isa. 14:13-14.</li>		<li>One-third of the angels of heaven participated in his rebellion&#151;Rev. 12:4a.</li>		<li>The living creatures in the preadamic age also joined him in his rebellion.</li>		</ol>	<li>The issue of his rebellion:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>He became God's adversary (Heb., Satan&#151;Zech. 3:1-2; Rev. 12:9a; 20:2a).</li>		<li>He and his subordinate angels became the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies, of which he is the ruler&#151;Eph. 6:12; 2:2b; Dan. 10:13, 20.</li>		<li>The living creatures of the preadamic age became demons (Matt. 12:43-45), working for his kingdom of darkness&#151;Matt. 12:26; Acts 26:18a; Col. 1:13a.</li>		<li>God judged Satan so that he will be cast from the heavens to the earth and to Sheol, to the sides of the pit&#151;Ezek. 28:16-17; Isa. 14:15.</li>		<li>God judged the heavens and the earth, which were polluted by Satan's rebellion, and thereby the entire universe became dark&#151;Job 9:5-7; Gen. 1:2a.</li>		<li>God will execute His judgment upon Satan, step by step, until he is cast into the lake of fire&#151;Luke 10:17-19; Rev. 12:9, 10b, 13; 20:2-3, 7, 10.</li>		<li>Before the completion of the execution of God's judgment upon him, he can still enter into the presence of God to accuse God's people (Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7; Zech. 3:1-2; Rev. 12:10b) and, as a roaring lion he walks about, seeking someone to devour (1 Pet. 5:8).</li>		<li>Christ, in His flesh on the cross, destroyed him, in his person and nature, as the one who has the might of death&#151;Heb. 2:14.</li>		</ol>	</ol></ol><P>God is omnipotent, but apart from the Bible there is no record about Him in the whole universe. It is even hard to find a record concerning some of the false gods. But we do have a record about God, that is, the Bible. The most wonderful thing on this earth among the human race is this record.</P><P>The Pentateuch, which the Jews call the Torah, was written by Moses. Moses was not very early; rather, he was at least four hundred years later than Abraham and at least twenty-five centuries later than Adam. Here then is a marvelous question: Where did Moses get all his facts for the writing of the Pentateuch? Genesis is a record written by Moses, but you cannot find Moses' support for his record. Therefore, people wonder where Moses got the material for Genesis, the account of Adam to Joseph. Sometimes Moses gives us a very detailed record, as in Genesis 3. Moses tells of man's fall through the serpent and even gives us the conversation between the serpent and Eve in much detail. But where did Moses get this material?</P><P>From my youth I was told that the verbal record went down through the generations to Moses. But a verbal record is terrible. It is sometimes like a snowball: As it goes through the generations, it becomes a big ball with little fact and the rest myth. But if you study Genesis carefully, you cannot find myths. It seems that everything is a fact. That conversation in chapter three is very reasonable and very much like fact. Therefore, we must believe that while Moses was writing, he was under the moving of the Holy Spirit (2 Pet. 1:21). No doubt, there is some verbal tradition, but I believe the main source of Moses' writing was the move of the Holy Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HISTORY OF GOD REVEALED<br>THROUGH HUMAN STORIES</H2><P>The best Bible teachers say that Genesis is a book of history. But Genesis is also a book of stories. If Genesis were just a book of history, the record concerning Joseph, for instance, would not need to be as long as it is. It is strange that only three pages of Genesis are about God's creation, while many pages are about this one man Joseph. Of the fifty chapters of Genesis, thirteen are about Joseph.</P><P>Why is the record of God's creation so short and the record of this youth named Joseph so long? You must realize that the history of God is not a history related much to the creation. If Genesis were a full record of God's creation, fifty chapters would not be sufficient. Scientists today spend not pages but books to tell us about the existence of the universe. But the Bible is not that kind of history. The Bible is a history of God in union not with the stars and the heavenly host nor with the beasts. The Bible is a history of God in union with man. Joseph occupies such a long portion of the record because God wants to show us how much He is there in Joseph's situation. In the creation God only said, Let there be light, and there was light. There is no more detail than that. But when the same writer comes to Joseph, the record is in much detail. Because of the detail, you cannot read the story of Joseph without your affections being touched. Therefore, from reading these details we see that our God in His history is very much related to humanity.</P><P>Acts 7 says that when Abraham was still in Chaldea, the God of glory appeared to him (v. 2). Do you know in what way God appeared to Abraham? Genesis 18 gives us a clear record of this. One day Abraham sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day. Then suddenly three men came. Of these three, one was Christ, who is called Jehovah in this chapter (vv. 1, 13). When the two angels who came with Christ left, Christ remained with Abraham, and Abraham talked to Jehovah face to face as he would to another person. This chapter is clear, but it presents a big problem. Christ was there in the human form, with a human body. He even ate Sarah's cooking, and Abraham brought Him water so that He might wash His feet. This seems to contradict John 1:14, which says that at the time of the incarnation God became flesh. How could Christ already be in the flesh long before John 1:14? This is God's history. Moses' writing is very human, yet in this human record you can see God. God lived in this record. We may think that only God's creation of the heavens and the earth is worth recording and that there is no need to have a long record about a youth like Joseph. But do you like to read Genesis chapters one and two more than chapters thirty-seven through fifty? Even if you read chapters thirty-seven through fifty ten times, you will not get tired of them. These chapters are humanly very interesting, but you can see God there. This is God's history in a human story. Chapters thirty-seven through fifty of Genesis are a man's story, but that story comprises God's history.</P><P>Based upon this principle, the story about Jacob is even more interesting. His name means one who grasps the heel, and he was surely a grasper. When his uncle charged him to shepherd the flock, he took the opportunity to grasp his uncle's cattle (Gen. 30:25-43). Here you can see that although one of God's chosen people was so cunning, God was working on him to change him from being a grasper into being a prince. Formerly, he was Jacob, but eventually his God made him Israel, which means a prince (32:28). In his youth this Jacob seemingly robbed everybody in his contact with them&#151; his father Isaac (27:1-29), his brother Esau (25:29-34), and his uncle Laban. But when he was old and matured, he blessed others everywhere he went. What seemed to be stealing hands became blessing hands. When he met Pharaoh, the top king on the earth, he blessed him (47:7). In the Bible there is the principle that the one who blesses is greater than the one who is blessed (Heb. 7:7); hence, Jacob was greater than Pharaoh.</P><P>Genesis 5:22 says that Enoch walked with God for three hundred years. This also means that God walked with Enoch, a man, for three hundred years. These two friends never changed. After three hundred years God took His very intimate friend from the earth and away from death. Is this the story of Enoch or the history of God?</P><P>In Genesis 3 we read that after man fell, Adam and Eve were afraid. Then God came and called out to Adam, asking, Where are you? (v. 9). This seems very human. The righteous God talked to a sinner in a very intimate, friendly way. Without such a story, how could you know God? Is this the record of Adam and Eve? Apparently it is, but actually it is even more a record of God's history. It shows us more about God than about Adam and Eve.</P><P>If you pick up this principle and apply it to the entire Bible, you can see God on every page. The Bible is not mainly a record of men but a record of God. Furthermore, it is not a record of God in creation; rather, it is a history of God in His dealing with man, who is on His heart. In His dealings with man we can know Him, and we can see what kind of God He is.</P><P>You need to read Genesis again according to this principle to see what kind of God is there. Genesis is the first book of God's history. By reading Genesis in this way, you can see this God manifested and shown to us through all the stories of Him with man. When you add all these stories together, you see His history. Without Genesis you cannot know God very well. Some people say that the New Testament is more important than the Old, and some would even say that we do not need the Old Testament today. But I must tell you that without the Old Testament, you cannot know God so well. Without the story in Genesis 32 could you believe that God wrestled with the man Jacob and that He was not able to prevail against a man (v. 25)? In His wrestling He had no way to put Jacob down, but He exercised His almighty, divine, omnipotent strength and touched his thigh. Then Jacob was crippled, and from then on he limped when he walked. Without such a story how could you know that God would even wrestle with His people? Perhaps you think that this is just the story of God with Jacob and that today He would not wrestle with anyone. But you are wrong. He may have even tried to wrestle with you this morning, but perhaps you were not ready. Jacob was ready that night because he was desperate, because his brother, whom he had cheated, was coming. He was afraid, so he sent his wife and his children ahead while he remained there. Then he began to wrestle with God, and he would not let God go, for he had one thing to solve with God.</P><P>God is this kind of God, but without the Bible we cannot know God in this way. We have heard all the terms about God, that He is righteous, faithful, kind, loving, merciful, and so much more. But we do not know how He is all these. If you would pick up this principle when you read the Bible, I believe that from today the Bible would be a different book to you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD IN ETERNITY PAST</H2><P>In the previous message we saw God in eternity past. Why is the record of God in eternity past so short? Because there was no man there. Since there was no man there, God did not have much interest in recording this. Therefore the record in Genesis 1 concerning this is just a half-sentence long. In the first sentence of the Bible only the first half-sentence is concerning God in eternity. "In the beginning..." This is in eternity past. Then the next half is concerning time: "God created the heaven and the earth." God's creation is a landmark between eternity and time. On the other side of creation is eternity, and on this side of creation is time. But these two sides are presented in just one verse. We know more about God in eternity past than what is in this verse because in the sixty-six books of the Bible, there is a sentence here and half a sentence there, a small point here and a small point there, about this matter. We have spent years to pick up all these points. But the record in Genesis 1 is so short: "In the beginning." If you could ask God why the record is so short, I believe He would say, "Do you not realize that in the beginning, in eternity past, there was no man? I have no interest in that because I want to be in man that I can be one with man. I wanted to make man so that he can be like Me. This is My interest." Now we can understand why the Bible is full of men, even full of men with troubles of all kinds. It is in all the troubles among men that God is revealed. We can know God in His history only through man's stories.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD IN TIME</H2><P>Time began at the creation of the universe, as recorded in Genesis 1:1, and continues until the final judgment at the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15). Hence, Genesis 1:1 through Revelation 20:15 relates God's history in time. Eternity past was before Genesis 1:1, and eternity future will be after Revelation 20:15. In between, there is the long span of time going from God's creation to His final judgment.</P><P>In this span of time, probably around seven thousand years, God has a long history. Although the record of His history in eternity is not very long and does not have many stories, His history in time is long and full of stories. There is even a story about two twin brothers who fought in their mother's womb (Gen. 25:22-26). They were competing to see who would come out first. I have never read another book that tells of twins fighting in their mother's womb, struggling to be the first to come out of the womb. Only in the Bible have I read such a story. Yet you can see God in this story because it is a part of the history of God. In that fighting God evidently chose Jacob. God loved him and hated Esau (Rom. 9:13). We all know that God is a loving God, but through His dealing with Esau we know that He is also a hating God. If God is both a loving God and a hating God, how do we know whether He loves us or hates us? We know that He loves us because the Bible tells us that in eternity past He loved us and chose us, and after choosing us, He predestinated us in love (Eph. 1:4-5). We are not under God's hating as Esau was but under God's loving as Jacob was. We may not be as good as Esau; but even if we are as bad as Jacob, God can hate the good one and love the bad one. This may not be logical, but it is the Bible as God's history. By all these stories you can see that the Bible is a history of God in humanity.</P><P>Let us now consider God's history in time as it relates to His creation of the universe and His judgment on Satan and the universe.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. CREATING THE UNIVERSE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. God Created<br>the Heavens and the Earth</H2><P>The creation spoken of in Genesis 1:1 was the original creation, which preceded the restoration and further creation beginning with verse 2b.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God Created the Heavens<br>with All the Living Things in the Heavens</H2><P>When God created the heavens, He first stretched forth the heavens (Isa. 42:5a; Zech 12:1a). Then He created the stars. Job says that when God was creating the earth, the stars were praising God (38:7a). Hence, before God created the earth, He created the stars. God then created certain living things in the heavens. At least the angels were created then. Job 38:7b tells us that the sons of God, that is, the angels, were also present when the earth was created. One of these angels became Satan, God's enemy (Job 1:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God Created the Earth<br>with All the Things on the Earth</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Laying the Foundations of the Earth</H2><P>The Bible says strongly that when God created, He laid the foundations of the earth (Zech. 12:1b; Job 38:4). Can we say what the earth is laid upon? The foundations of the earth are not laid upon anything. The earth has foundations, but it seemingly does not have anything supporting it. Actually, all things are upheld by Christ (Heb. 1:3; Col. 1:17). Hence, many scientists agree that there must be an Almighty One who holds the earth. This Almighty One is Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. In the Proper Measurements with the Solid Bases<br>and the Marking Cornerstones</H2><P>When God created this earth, He measured it out and laid it on solid bases. Not only were there bases, but there were also cornerstones, marking the corners. The earth was made very well, not in a messy way. Job 38:5-6 mentions this clearly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Spreading Forth the Earth<br>and What Springs Up from It</H2><P>God spread forth not only the earth but also all the things that spring up from the earth (Isa. 42:5b). What was His purpose in doing this? Isaiah 45:18 says that God created the earth to be inhabited by man. The globe is a fitting place for man to live on. When man landed on the moon over twenty years ago, we found out how different from the earth things are there. There is no air on the moon, so we cannot live there. There are no living things on the moon. The moon is not a fitting place for us to live. Genesis 1 speaks of the firmament. That is the air. From the firmament rain comes, and in the winter the snow comes. These make the earth a fitting place for us to live.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Stars Sang Together and All the Angels,<br>the Sons of God, Shouted for Joy<br>at God's Beautiful Building of the Earth</H2><P>At the time when God was spreading forth the earth, the stars sang together and all the angels, the sons of God, shouted for joy at God's beautiful building of the earth (Job 38:7). The earth is really beautiful. This is why so many people enjoy sightseeing. In places like Yosemite or Yellowstone, you can see how beautiful the earth is. Everything is beautiful, even the flowers. If you go to a zoo, you can see beautiful animals: bears, tigers, lions, leopards, and all kinds of birds. God created the earth in this way for us. God is a God of good pleasure, and He made us as men of good pleasure. Because of this, man seeks amusement. Today's amusements, however, are terrible because they are full of Satan. But in the beginning there was real amusement. In Genesis 2 there is such a phrase: "every tree that is pleasant to the sight" (v. 9). All the trees are pleasant to the sight. How do we know that God loves beauty? We need only look at the earth He created for us. Furthermore, on a clear night we can see how beautiful all the stars are. All these prove that God is a God of beauty.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. God's Initial Creation of the Universe<br>before Satan's Rebellion</H2><P>The foregoing matters are all related to God's initial creation of the universe, which occurred before Satan's rebellion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. JUDGING SATAN AND THE UNIVERSE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Satan was One of the Early Angels<br>Created by God at the "Morning" of the Universe</H2><P>In Isaiah 14:12 Satan is called the Daystar. This term Daystar was translated Lucifer in the Latin version of the Bible. Daystar means morning star. He is also called the son of the dawn, indicating that Satan was one of the earliest angels created by God at the "morning" of the universe.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. He Was in Eden, the Garden of God,<br>upon the Holy Mountain in the Heavenlies,<br>and Was Anointed by God to Be the Chief Archangel</H2><P>Ezekiel 28:13-14 says that Satan was in Eden, the garden of God. This is not the Eden in Genesis 2, which was the Eden on this earth. The Eden here is the garden of God upon the holy mountain in the heavenlies. Furthermore, Satan was anointed by God to be the chief archangel. Jude 9 also tells us that he was the chief archangel and was above all the angels.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. As the Ruler of the World</H2><P>From the day of Satan's creation, God prepared musical instruments around him (Ezek. 28:13b). This indicates that he was a ruler, a king. Furthermore, in John 12:31 the Lord says that Satan is the ruler of the world. Then in Luke 4:5-6 Satan himself indicated that he has authority over the world. Ephesians 2:2 calls Satan the ruler of the authority of the air.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. As the Cherub Covering the Ark</H2><P>Ezekiel 28:14 goes on to tell us that Satan was the cherub covering the ark. This is not the ark on the earth but the ark in heaven. He was the cherub upon the ark, covering it. He was very close to God as the high priest serving God. Therefore, on the one hand he was a king, and on the other hand he was a priest. Today we have taken this position. We were born priests, and we are going to be kings. Our position today was once Satan's position. Because of his failure, this position has come to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. He Rebelled against God</H2><P>Satan's heart was lifted up because of his beauty and his brightness (Ezek. 28:17). This was arrogance. He said in his heart, "I will ascend to heaven; / Above the stars of God / I will exalt my throne. / And I will sit upon the mount of assembly / In the uttermost parts of the north" (Isa. 14:13). The uttermost parts of the north means the highest place. This was Satan's arrogant declaration. He wanted to sit upon the throne of assembly, where God sits in the uttermost parts of the north. In Job there are two times when God assembles with all the angels in this place of assembly (1:6; 2:1). Isaiah 14 continues: "I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; / I will make myself like the Most High" (v. 14). These are the five points of Satan's arrogant declaration, each beginning with the words "I will." Satan wanted to be on the same level as God. This was his rebellion.</P><P>When Satan rebelled, one-third of the angels of heaven participated in that rebellion. Revelation 12:4 says that one-third of the stars, that is, one-third of the angels, followed the dragon Satan. This indicates that they followed Satan in his rebellion. These angels eventually became the fallen angels.</P><P>The living creatures in the preadamic age also joined Satan in his rebellion. Students of the Bible agree that according to the record of the Bible, in the age before Adam, there should have been some living creatures. Those living creatures also followed Satan in his rebellion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Issue of Satan's Rebellion</H2><P>Because of his rebellion Satan became God's adversary, God's enemy (Zech. 3:1-2; Rev. 12:9a; 20:2a). Satan is a Hebrew word that means adversary. He is the adversary within and the enemy without. Satan and his subordinate angels then became the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies, of which Satan is the ruler. This is clearly revealed in the book of Ephesians (6:12; 2:2b; Dan. 10:13, 20). The living creatures of the preadamic age became demons (Matt 12:43-45), working for Satan's kingdom of darkness (Matt. 12:26; Acts 26:18a; Col. 1:13a).</P><P>God then judged Satan so that he will be cast from the heavens to the earth and into Sheol, to the uttermost parts of the pit (Ezek. 28:16-17; Isa. 14:15). Sheol in the Old Testament equals Hades in the New Testament. Satan wanted to go to the uttermost parts of the north, to the highest place; but eventually God judged him, and He will throw him into the uttermost parts of the pit.</P><P>God also judged the heavens and the earth, which had become polluted because of Satan's rebellion. The heavens were polluted by Satan because after his rebellion he continued to go into heaven. Hence, the entire universe became dark (Job 9:5-7). In Genesis 1:2a the darkness of the entire universe is mentioned.</P><P>Although God has judged Satan, He will execute His judgment upon him step by step, until Satan is cast into the lake of fire. God judged Satan and declared His verdict on him, but He did not execute the verdict at that time. According to the Bible God carries out the execution of His judgment upon Satan gradually, step by step. In Luke 10:17-19 the Lord Jesus said that while He was on this earth, He saw Satan falling down out of heaven. Then in Revelation 12:9 Satan is cast down from the heavens at another time, and in Revelation 20:2-3 he is bound and cast into the bottomless pit. Finally, he is cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:10). Yet before the completion of the execution of God's judgment upon him, he can still enter into the presence of God to accuse God's people, as he did in the case of Job (Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7; Zech. 3:1-2; Rev. 12:10b). Today he also walks about on the earth as a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour (1 Pet. 5:8). Nevertheless, whatever he does is a kind of help to God that God may perfect His people.</P><P>Hebrews 2:14 tells us that Christ, in His flesh on the cross, destroyed Satan, in his person and nature, as the one who has the might of death. Thus, Satan's judgment has been executed on his person and nature, because Christ has destroyed him on the cross.</P><P>In the history of God in time, these are the initial things: God's creation, Satan's rebellion, God's judgment on Satan, and God's carrying out of His judgment on him.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S HISTORY IN TIME<br>GEN. 1:1&#151;REV. 20:15</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>RESTORING THE JUDGED UNIVERSE<br>AND CREATING MAN</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Restoring the judged universe&#151;Gen. 1:2-25:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep&#151;the issue of God's judgment upon His original creation&#151;v. 2a.</li>	<li>The Spirit of God was brooding upon the face of the waters&#151;v. 2b.</li>	<li>God restored the light to divide the light from the darkness, calling the light Day and the darkness Night, on the first day&#151;vv. 3-5.</li>	<li>God made the firmament in the midst of the waters to divide the waters under the firmament from the waters above the firmament; God called the firmament Heaven, on the second day&#151;vv. 6-8.</li>	<li>God gathered the waters under the heavens together unto one place and caused the dry land to appear; God called the dry land Earth and the gathering together of the waters Seas, on the third day&#151;vv. 9-10.</li>	<li>God caused the earth to put forth grass, herbs, and fruit trees, on the third day&#151;vv. 11-13.</li>	<li>God restored the lights in heaven to divide the day from the night, for signs, for seasons, for days and years, and for lights in heaven to give light upon the earth: two great lights&#151;the greater to rule the day and the lesser to rule the night&#151;and stars, on the fourth day&#151;vv. 14-19.</li>	<li>God caused the waters to swarm with swarms of living creatures, and birds to fly above the earth in heaven and multiply on earth, on the fifth day&#151;vv. 20-23.</li>	<li>God caused the earth to bring forth living creatures: cattle, creeping things, and beasts of the earth, on the sixth day&#151;vv. 24-25.</li>	</ol><li>Creating man&#151;Gen. 1:26&#151;2:25:<br>God's history in time with man objectively<br>Gen. 1:26&#151;Mal. 4:6</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>God created man in His image, after His likeness, on the sixth day&#151;Gen. 1:26-31:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To express Him in person&#151;vv. 26a, 27.</li>		<li>To represent Him in office&#151;vv. 26b, 28.</li>		</ol>	<li>Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground (for man's body) and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life (for man's spirit); and man became a living soul&#151;Gen. 2:7.</li>	<li>Jehovah God put man in the garden of Eden in front of two trees&#151;Gen. 2:8-9:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The tree of life, signifying God in Christ as life to man, to be taken by man&#151;Rev. 2:7b; 22:2, 14, 19.</li>		<li>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil, signifying Satan as the origin of death (Heb. 2:14), to be prohibited from being eaten by man&#151;Gen. 2:17; 3:3.</li>		</ol>	<li>With a river, in the flow of which are gold, bdellium, and onyx stone&#151;Gen. 2:10-12.</li>	<li>Jehovah God built a woman with the rib of Adam as his wife to match him as his counterpart, signifying that the church was constituted with the resurrection life of Christ to be His counterpart&#151;Gen. 2:18-24; Eph. 5:23-32.</li>	<li>God rested on the seventh day after He finished all His work which He created and made&#151;Gen. 2:1-3.</li>	</ol></ol><P>The more you read a book like Genesis, the more you must admit that the Bible is really a record of God's movements; it is the history of God. You cannot say that the record in Genesis is merely a record of mankind. While it is a record of mankind, it is not primarily such. Genesis is primarily a record of God, then of man. Without God there would be no way for man to be here. God is the Initiator; He is the beginning. Then man came into existence from God. Therefore, if Genesis is a record of man, it must certainly be even more the record of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S INTENTION TO HAVE MAN FOR HIS EXPRESSION</H2><P>In the last message we saw God in eternity. That was the origin of His history. He did not come from anywhere, because He is self-existing. We have no human words to explain this. He has no parents, no genealogy, no origin (Heb. 7:3). But when He was there in eternity past, He began to move. We saw in message one that He firstly began to form an economy, to make an arrangement, according to His heart's desire for His good pleasure. That was the beginning of His move. Then, in that move there was a council among the three of the Godhead, among the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and a strong determination was made. He wanted to have mankind so that He could have an organism to express Him, represent Him, and even be one with Him. This organism would be His enlargement, His increase. The Bible shows us that eventually after God moves so much throughout all the centuries, the New Jerusalem will come forth. The New Jerusalem is God's enlargement, as Eve was Adam's enlargement. Since God as the very substance of the New Jerusalem is embodied in Christ the Lamb and since the New Jerusalem is called the wife of the Lamb (Rev. 21:9), it is absolutely right to say that the New Jerusalem is the enlargement of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD ENTERING INTO TIME THROUGH CREATION</H2><P>After God formed His economy and determined to create man and to have Christ, the Second of the Trinity, die an all-inclusive, vicarious death, God walked out of eternity and entered into time by means of creation. Creation is a matter in time. This was God's first step into time. Time began with God's creation.</P><P>When God created, He created the heavens with the angels, the stars, and the heavenly bodies first. He also created the earth with all the things upon it. Then one of His creatures, the chief archangel, became rebellious, and God judged him. This angel became God's enemy. Hence, in God's history which exists in time, God first had an enemy due to a rebellion. Because there was a rebellion, the heavens and the earth were polluted, and therefore God judged not only Satan but also the heavens and the earth. The heavens and the earth became devastated, and the whole universe became darkness.</P><P>This is what is mentioned in Genesis 1:2. Verse 1 concerns the preadamic age, but our age begins in verse 2. Genesis 1:2 says, "And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep." The word and at the beginning of verse 2 indicates that verse 2 is an additional event. It does not mean that verse 2 is an explanation of verse 1. Verse 1 includes all the matters that we have covered in the previous messages. Then after verse 1 more things happened: "And the earth was without form, and void." A better translation of the word was here is became: "And the earth became waste and void." Isaiah 45:18 says that God did not create the earth as a waste, but here in Genesis 1:2 we read that the earth became waste and void. This indicates that after the earth was created, it was judged by God. The judgment came because of Satan's rebellion. Genesis 1:2 also says that darkness was upon the face of the deep. The deep indicates deep water; hence, darkness was upon the deep water. In the Bible darkness and death frequently go together (Job 10:21-22; Isa. 9:2; Luke 1:79). We may even say that darkness is a sign of death. This was the situation of our earth under God's judgment. It became waste and void, and darkness, implying death, was upon the deep water.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF GOD BROODING<br>OVER THE DEEP TO PRODUCE LIFE</H2><P>Then there is another and in this verse, indicating that something more happened: "And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters." The Hebrew word for moved means brooded or hovered, as when a mother bird broods over her eggs to bring forth life. This indicates that after God's judgment God did something to bring forth life. The situation was really waste and void, and there was darkness upon the depth of the water. Then the Spirit of God came in to brood, to hover, over the situation in order to produce life.</P><P>Following this, from Genesis 1:3 to the end of chapter two, there is a long record of how life was brought forth through the brooding of the Spirit. These two chapters are full of striking significances. Every detail of these two chapters has some significance. You should not merely read the letters in black and white; rather, you must know the significance of what you read. In Genesis 1:2 we read about the Spirit. What is the significance of the Spirit here? In the Bible the Spirit always signifies life. What is the significance of the waste, void, darkness, and deep water? All these signify a disaster, and even death. These are all negative things. Then all of a sudden something good came, that is, the Spirit. The Spirit came not to rebuke, not to condemn, but to brood, as a mother bird broods over the eggs. The "eggs" are just the waste, void, darkness, and deep water. These are all terrible things, yet these terrible things came under the brooding of the "mother hen"; hence, they all became "eggs."</P><P>We also were under this brooding. We are out of Adam, and Adam was out of the dust, which was there under the brooding. The dust, which is the earth, was the first thing that came out of the brooding of the Spirit. First, there was the Spirit; then, after the Spirit there was light (vv. 3-5); and after the light the firmament was made (vv. 6-8), which is the air. Then the resurrection of the buried earth came up on the third day, the day of resurrection (vv. 9-10). Hence, the first thing that came up because of the Spirit's brooding is the resurrected earth. Adam was made out of this earth, and we are a part of Adam. Hence, we came out of the brooding of the Spirit. Our existence came out of the Spirit's brooding in God's history. God firstly came out of eternity and entered into time by creating the heavens and the earth. Then God's creature rebelled, and God judged him. This rebellious one became God's enemy, and the entire universe became waste, void, and darkness. Then God moved. He moved by the brooding of His Spirit, and we are included there under that brooding.</P><P>The brooding brought forth the earth. But for the earth to produce life, there is the need of light and air. Therefore, on the first day the light was recovered, and on the second day the air, the firmament, was created. Then on the third day, the day of resurrection, the buried earth came up (typifying the buried Christ resurrected), ready to produce life. The producing of life started from the lowest life. There is a sequence of life in Genesis, beginning with the lowest life, the life without any consciousness. First, we find the grasses, the herbs, and the trees (vv. 11-13). These are living things, but their life is very low and without any consciousness. These were created on the third day, immediately after the earth resurrected from the death water.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HIGHER LIGHTS BRINGING IN THE HIGHER LIFE</H2><P>The light that was restored on the first day was good only for the lowest life, that is, the plant life. It was not good for the higher life forms. Life depends upon light, and the higher the light, the higher the life. The first day light was a general kind of light; hence, the light bearers needed to be recovered on the fourth day (vv. 14-19). These are the solid lights, not light in general. These bodies bear the light and give location to the light. The light bearers, or luminaries, are the sun, the moon, and the stars. These three made the light definite and solid. The general light of the first day was good for producing the lowest life, the plant life without consciousness. But God wanted something more. He wanted not only the plant life but also the animal life. For the animal life, which is a higher life, there was the need of higher light, of solid light. So on the fourth day the sun, the moon, and the stars were recovered. Although the sun, the moon, and the stars had been created before Adam, they were judged by God. In judging them, God stopped their function. This is why the universe became darkness.</P><P>On the fourth day the solid lights were recovered to give more light for the producing of higher life. First, there are the fish, which is the lowest life among the animals. Then there are the birds in the air, whose life is a little higher (vv. 20-23). Then comes the cattle life (vv. 24-25). The animal life became higher and higher on the earth.</P><P>The fish, the birds, and the cattle all reproduce their young differently, and this indicates the levels of life. In English we say that fish lay eggs, but what they lay is not like the eggs that birds lay. What fish lay are something almost like seeds. Birds, however, are higher. Birds lay eggs that have a hard shell. Furthermore, fish lay countless seedlike eggs, but birds lay a small number of eggs. This also shows that the bird life is higher. Cattle, such as oxen, cows, sheep, and goats, do not lay seedlike eggs or eggs with a shell, but have wombs from which their descendants are brought forth. They deliver their young alive at birth. They have a higher life. It is clear then that there are various levels of life. There are the vegetable life, the fish life, the bird life, and the cattle life.</P><P>The plant life came out of the shining of the general light of the first day, but the animal life came out of the shining of the higher lights, the solid lights, of the fourth day. The universe was so bright with both the general light and the solid light of the three light bearers, and the earth was full of vegetation and animals. All of these are quite beautiful. But these are not the highest life with the highest consciousness. Man has the highest created life and is full of consciousness. No animal can do mathematics or develop computers. But man continues to progress in matters like these. Moreover, Genesis 1 tells us that the plants come forth after their own kind (vv. 11-12), as do the animals (v. 21). But man's life is not according to man's kind. Man's life is according to God's kind because man was created in God's image and after His likeness. Man bears His image. Man resembles God, man expresses God, and man will eventually represent God. Therefore, because man is after God's kind, he is very close to God.</P><P>These are the steps, the actions, in God's history. God produced life by brooding as the Spirit upon the waste, void, darkness, and deep water. His goal in brooding upon this devastated situation was to bring forth man. Yet for man to exist, the life in different levels is needed. The cattle, birds, and fish are needed, and the plant life is needed. Furthermore, for all this life to grow on earth, there is the need of the air of the firmament and of the rain from the heavens to water the earth. There is also the need of light, even lights, in the heavens. With these the earth can produce all the things needed by man for his existence, and man was created fully for God. In God's restoring of the judged universe, His goal was to produce man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CREATION OF MAN</H2><P>Genesis 1 and 2 are very strange, wonderful, and mysterious in the revelation of God's creation of man. This is a marvelous step in God's history. God's creation of the universe, with the heavens, the earth, and millions of items, is not as strange, wonderful, or mysterious as His creation of man. We need to consider a number of the mysteries related to God's creation of man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God Creating Man in His Image<br>and after His Likeness</H2><P>First, God created man in His image and after His likeness (Gen. 1:26). This means that God made a duplication of Himself. He made a copy of Himself. He took a "photo" of Himself. We need a definite and accurate definition of God's image and God's likeness. God's image refers to God's inner being, and God's likeness refers to God's outward form. Since God is invisible, how could He have a form? This is very mysterious.</P><P>In Genesis 18 God appeared to Abraham in the form (likeness) of man. Three men came to Abraham, two of whom were angels, but the third One was Jehovah (vv. 1-2, 22; 19:1). Even at Abraham's time, long before His incarnation, God came in the form of man. Abraham talked to God, and God had a meal with Abraham. That meal was cooked by Abraham's wife Sarah. Abraham even served water to this wonderful Man for Him to wash His feet. God was there in the form of a man. According to our "legal" mind, we would wonder how this could happen. God did not become incarnated to be a man until much later, as recorded in John 1:14. But about two thousand years before Christ's incarnation, God appeared to man in the form of man already. This is a mystery. This shows us that no one can thoroughly understand the person of God in His Divine Trinity, but we can see all the points concerning Him in the divine record.</P><P>God has an inner being and an outward form. His inner being is actually His image constituted with all His divine attributes. God is love; God is light; God is holiness; God is righteousness; God is many items. All these items are the divine attributes. Man was made according to the inner image of God's attributes. Even after the fall, we human beings still have the image of all the attributes of God.</P><P>God's likeness is His outward form. Abraham saw God in the form of a man. Ezekiel and Isaiah also saw Him in such a form, sitting upon the throne (Ezek. 1:26; Isa. 6:1). God appeared in the form of man. Man's form is a copy of God's form. God's form is the original, and man's form is the duplication, the xerox copy, of God's form.</P><P>This is a part of the history of God, with which man is involved. In God's history, He made a duplication of Himself, a copy of Himself. This duplication of God is for the expression of the invisible God. Genesis 1 and 2 are not merely the story of man's creation, but a full record of God's history in making Himself a duplication.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Form of Man</H2><P>When God created man, He first made a form for man. This was the body of man made of dust (Gen. 2:7). The body is the form of man. Never forget that God made man with a form and that this form is a "photo" of God's form. Man is in the form, the likeness, of God (1:26). The form of our body is marvelous. Besides God Himself, the most beautiful item in the whole universe is man's form. Consider your eyes, your eyebrows, your nose, your lips, your ears, and even your cheeks. Man is God's masterpiece.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Breath of Life</H2><P>Then God breathed the breath of life into man's form (Gen. 2:7). God did not breathe into any other created thing, but to create man, He breathed into man the breath of life. This breath of life was not God Himself, not the Spirit of God, but it was something out of God, something very close to God's intrinsic being. When this breath of life got into man's form, man became a living soul, a living, animate being with life. This is a part of God's history.</P><P>God made a duplication of Himself with a dusty form and the inward breath of life. That breath of life became the human spirit. In Hebrew the word for breath in Genesis 2:7 is translated spirit in Proverbs 20:27. Thus, God's breath of life becomes the spirit of man. The breath of life came into the body of dust, and man became a living soul with a spirit.</P><P>God was not within the man He created, but something within man, that is, the spirit of man, is very close to God. The outward form of man is of the dust, but the inner spirit is very close to God. This is why we say that man was made after God's kind. God is a Spirit, and God made a spirit for man to contact Him (John 4:24). Because we have a part that resembles God, we can contact God through that part. God is Spirit, we have a spirit, and these two spirits are of the same kind.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Creating Man with Many Virtues</H2><P>In addition, God created man with many virtues. These virtues are copies of God's attributes. God has many attributes, but love, light, holiness, and righteousness are the four main attributes of God. God is love, God is light, God is holiness, and God is righteousness. When God created man, He made a copy of all these attributes in man's spirit. Therefore, man is a creature with virtues. The lions and the dogs do not have virtues. Only we men have virtues. We love. We like to be in the light and not in the darkness. We also like to be separated. We do not like to be common. We like to be righteous. These virtues were all damaged by man's fall, yet they are still here. They are the means for us to express God's attributes.</P><P>God's attributes eventually became the reality of man's virtues. The attributes are the real thing; the virtues are the outward form. This may be likened to a glove and a hand. The hand, like God's attributes, is the real thing; the glove, like the virtues, is the outward form, the covering of the hand. At our regeneration, when we were born of God, the elements of God's attributes were born into our being, mostly into our spirit, so that we may express God in love, in light, in holiness, and in righteousness. These are God's attributes manifested as our virtues lived out from our spirit.</P><P>Even the teachings of Confucius recognized that the highest learning develops the spirit. Man should not behave himself according to his flesh or even according to his soul or his mind. Therefore, the Bible tells us that we must walk according to our spirit (Rom. 8:4). In bodily form we resemble God because we have His likeness, and in our spirit we resemble God because we were created in His image of His attributes. Outwardly we have God's form, and inwardly, in our spirit, we have God's image, yet in our created state we still do not have God. God's desire is for the man created by Him to receive Him as the tree of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Placing Man before Two Trees</H2><P>After God made man as a duplication of Himself, He put this duplication, a living being with a spirit, soul, and body, before two trees&#151;the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The tree of life signifies God, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan. According to Genesis 2:9, all the trees in the garden were pleasant to the sight, but one among these trees was particular, the tree of life. The tree of life was good for food. God warned man not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for in the day that he ate of it, he would die (v. 17). This is also a part of the history of God in creating man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Flowing River and Three Precious Materials</H2><P>By the side of the tree of life in Genesis 2, there was a flowing river, and this flow issued in three precious materials: gold, bdellium, and onyx stone (vv. 10-12). Bdellium is a kind of pearl produced from the resin of a tree. Onyx stone is a most precious stone. We cannot fully understand the significance of these three precious materials until we read through the Bible and come to its end.</P><P>Exodus reveals that gold was the base of the breastplate of the high priest, and this breastplate was full of precious stones (28:15-21). In Matthew 13 we can see precious material once again. In this chapter the Lord Jesus first spoke of the wheat that produces the meal, the fine flour. This is good for the making of a loaf, which signifies the church, the Body of Christ. But that meal was leavened (v. 33), so the Lord followed in Matthew 13 to speak of the treasure (v. 44) and the pearls (vv. 45-46). This treasure must consist of gold or precious stones, the materials for the building of the church and the New Jerusalem (1 Cor. 3:12; Rev. 21:18-20). Pearls are also material for the building of the New Jerusalem (v. 21a).</P><P>In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul said, "You are God's cultivated land, God's building" (v. 9). The cultivated land, the farm, becomes the building through transformation. The believers, who have been regenerated in Christ with God's life, are God's cultivated land, a farm in God's new creation to grow Christ that precious materials may be produced for God's building. As God's farm we need the watering (v. 6). This watering causes us to grow and be transformed into precious materials. Paul also said that God's building should be built with gold, silver, and precious stones (v. 12).</P><P>In his first Epistle, Peter said that the Lord is a living stone and that we are the living stones who are built up as a spiritual house (2:4-5). Eventually, at the end of the book of Revelation, the three materials&#151;gold, pearls, and precious stones&#151;are built up into a city. In the beginning of the Bible in Genesis 2, the materials are only existing there, but at the end of the Bible in Revelation 21, the materials have become a building.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Producing of a Couple</H2><P>Merely to have a tree with a river flowing issuing in three kinds of materials to illustrate God's purpose in creating man is not adequate. Following this the divine record speaks of God's producing a couple (Gen. 2:18-24). For the reproduction and continuation of man, there is the need of the female. God produced the female in a different way. He did not form a female person from the dust of the ground as He did with Adam. God put Adam to sleep, opened up his side, took a rib, and built a woman with that rib (vv. 21-22). When Adam awoke and saw the woman, he said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh" (v. 23). She was one with Adam as his counterpart, his match, his mate. Jehovah God built a woman with the rib of Adam as his wife to match him as his counterpart, signifying that the church was constituted with the resurrection life of Christ to be His counterpart (Eph. 5:23-32). This is the completion of God's creation of man.</P><P>Is this the story of man or of God? We may have the concept that this is the story of man. But actually this is not merely man's story of how he was created, but God's story of how He created man. This is God's history in creating man.</P><P>This short part of the history of God in Genesis 1 and 2 is a miniature of the entire Bible. In Genesis 2 there are three materials to be built up into something. Then there is a couple, a husband and a wife. At the end of the Bible, there is a built-up city with three precious materials&#151;gold, pearls, and precious stones. This building is the wife (Rev. 21:2), and the Builder is the Husband (Heb. 11:10). This built-up city at the conclusion of the divine revelation is not a material, lifeless city but a corporate living person as the wife, having Christ, such a wonderful person, as her Husband.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S HISTORY IN TIME<br>GEN. 1:1&#151;REV. 20:15</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SAVING MAN FROM HIS FALL</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gen. 3</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Realizing the fall of man&#151;vv. 1-8, 22-24:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The fall was through the deceiving of the serpent, the embodiment of the devil, Satan the tempter, who is the enemy of God&#151;vv. 1-6; 1 Tim. 2:14; Rev. 12:9; Matt. 4:3; 13:39a.</li>	<li>In man's eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, to forsake God as the tree of life in His economy&#151;v. 6.</li>	<li>The issue of man's fall:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Satan entered into man to be man's indwelling sin&#151;Rom. 7:17, 20-21.</li>		<li>Sin entered into mankind&#151;Rom. 5:12a.</li>		<li>Sin brought death to mankind&#151;Rom. 5:12b.</li>		<li>Sin brought vanity and the slavery of corruption to all the creation&#151;Rom. 8:20-21.</li>		<li>Man was constituted inwardly a sinner, with the soul corrupted, the body changed in nature, and the spirit deadened&#151;Rom. 5:19a; Gen. 3:7.</li>		<li>Man was condemned outwardly&#151;Rom. 5:18a; Gen. 3:8.</li>		<li>Man attempted to cover himself and hide himself from God&#151;Gen. 3:7-9.</li>		<li>God would not permit man to eat the tree of life until his fallen nature would be dealt with&#151;v. 22.</li>		<li>God drove man out of the garden of Eden and closed to man the way to the tree of life&#151;vv. 23-24.</li>		</ol>	</ol><li>Saving man from his fall&#151;vv. 8-21:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>God came to seek the lost sinner&#151;vv. 8-13:</li>			<ol class="decimal">		<li>God cursed the tempting serpent above all cattle and beasts, saying that he shall go upon his belly and eat the dust&#151;v. 14.</li>		<li>God will greatly multiply the woman's pain and her conception; in pain she shall bring forth children; and her desire shall be to her husband, and he shall rule over her (1 Tim. 2:15)&#151;v. 16.</li>		<li>God cursed the ground so that it will bring forth thorns and thistles, whereby man shall in toil (in Heb. the same word as pain in v. 16) and the sweat of his face (1 Pet. 4:1b-2) eat of the ground all the days of his life until he returns (his body dies) unto the dust&#151;vv. 17b-19.</li>		</ol>	<li>God promised that Christ as the Son of God will come as "the seed of woman":</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To bruise the head of the deceiving "serpent" for man&#151;v. 15; 1 John 3:8b.</li>		<li>To release man from the fear and slavery of death&#151;Heb. 2:14-15.</li>		<li>In this promise of God Adam believed and called his wife Eve because she was the mother of all living&#151;v. 20.</li>		</ol>	<li>God redeemed man by the shedding of the blood of Christ (typified by the slain sacrifice&#151;Heb. 9:22; Matt. 26:28) and justified man by Christ as righteousness to man (typified by the coats of the skins of the slain sacrifice&#151;1 Cor. 1:30; Gal. 2:17a)&#151;v. 21.</li>	</ol></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. DEALING WITH THE FALL OF MAN</H2><P>In the past term of our full-time training, we studied the Christian life quite much. In this term we have begun to continue the study of the Christian life according to the Scripture from another angle. We have seen that the Holy Scripture is not only a record of stories of man but also a record of the history of God in His union with man. In the last message, we saw that God in His history in time restored the judged universe and created man. Right after God's creation of man, man became fallen, so God had to come in to save man from his fall. In this message we want to see God's history in time in His dealing with man's fall.</P><P>In God's carrying out of His eternal economy, God's adversary Satan caused two great frustrations: one was Satan's rebellion, which polluted and devastated the creation of God, and the other was his seducing of man to transgress against God. Thus, God had to deal with these two frustrations caused by His adversary.</P><P>We have seen in message two that God dealt with Satan by judging him and declaring God's verdict on him. Now in this message we want to see how God dealt with the problem of man's fall. According to the record of the Scriptures, before God dealt with the fall of man, He was fully aware of it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Its Initiation</H2><P>The fall of man was initiated by Satan through the deceiving of the serpent (Gen. 3:1-6). The subtle serpent was the embodiment of Satan the devil (Rev. 12:9a). As the enemy of God (Matt. 13:39a) and the tempter of man (Matt. 4:3), Satan deceived man not directly but through man's wife (1 Tim. 2:14) by causing her to doubt the sure word of God. In this way he lured the woman into his snare, and through her he caused man to fall in man's transgression against God's clear word (Job 31:33).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Its Nature</H2><P>Because the fall of man was consummated by man's eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 3:6), the nature of man's fall was not a matter of a transgression that only affected man's outward condition before God. It was both a matter of an offense that caused man to be condemned by God to remain under the condemnation of God (Rom. 5:18a) and a matter of disobedience that caused man to be constituted a sinner in the eyes of God (Rom. 5:19a). Man's eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil indicates that man had forsaken God as the tree of life in His economy. This resulted in a case of offending God outwardly and of damaging man inwardly. By eating the evil fruit of the tree of knowledge, Adam built a case of transgression, of disobedience, which caused him to be condemned by God. By this eating, Adam also accomplished a wrong action which poisoned him in his nature, causing him to be constituted a sinner. Hence, through this one fall, Satan caused Adam to be condemned according to the commandment of God and constituted a sinner in the nature of man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Its Issue</H2><P>The issue of man's fall is terrifyingly great. It implies mainly the following eight items.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Satan Entering into Man<br>to Be Man's Indwelling Sin</H2><P>Satan as the evil one (Matt. 6:13) entered into man through man's eating of his evil fruit from the tree of knowledge. Through this, Satan's evil nature surely became the evil element added into man's nature. Romans 7:17-21 unveils that something evil as an evil law dwells in man to be the very sin that dwells in man, causing man to do things that man does not will. What is this evil to be the indwelling sin in man's fallen nature? It must be the evil one, Satan, who dwells in our fallen nature. This issue of man's fall is too, too terrifying!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Sin Entering into Mankind</H2><P>Since Satan, who is the substantial element of sin, has entered into man, sin spontaneously entered into man with Satan. Since this entering of sin into man was its entering into Adam, the forefather of man, sin entered into all of mankind, the world (Rom. 5:12a), through this one entering. Today all of mankind, the whole world, has sin in their fallen nature to make them sinners in their constitution.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Sin Bringing Death to Mankind</H2><P>The very sin which dwells in man is productive. It issues in death. Death is the wages of sin (Rom. 6:23a) and was brought into man through sin (Rom. 5:12b). Hence, Satan, sin, and death, three terrifying and damaging factors, entered into man, even mankind, through man's fall.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Sin Bringing Vanity and the Slavery<br>of Corruption to All the Creation</H2><P>Sin not only brought death to all mankind but also brought vanity and the slavery of corruption to all the creation (Rom. 8:20-21). Today due to man's fall, all the creation is subjected to vanity and the slavery of corruption. Everything in God's creation is being corrupted under a kind of slavery and is becoming vanity. Hence, the whole creation is groaning together, and there is no joy in the universe today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Man's Soul Being Corrupted,<br>Man's Body Being Changed in Nature,<br>and Man's Spirit Being Deadened</H2><P>There was another issue of man's fall which very seriously affected man's being. Due to the fall of man, man's soul was corrupted, man's body was changed in nature, and man's spirit was deadened. In the fall of man Satan saturated man's soul with his evil word and thought (Gen. 3:1-5) to corrupt man's soul. Through the fall of man, Satan as the substantial element of sin entered into man's body to cause man's body to be changed in nature to become the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3) full of lusts (Gal. 5:16b). Also through the fall of man, man's spirit was deadened by sin (Eph. 2:1). Hence, man's whole being was devastated by man's fall as a very subjective issue to man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Man Attempting to Cover Himself<br>and Hide Himself from God</H2><P>Another issue of the fall of man was that it affected man's self-consciousness and his relationship with God. After man became conscious of his nakedness due to his fall, he attempted to cover himself in his nakedness and to hide himself from God in his contact with God (Gen. 3:7-9). To cover his nakedness is man's doing and pretense. Fallen man is used to endeavoring to do something to cover his sinfulness and pretend to be something in falsehood. For man to hide himself from God is to keep himself away from God in his fellowship with God. This is the issue of man's fall that makes man false and void of God's presence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. God Not Permitting Man to Eat the Tree of Life</H2><P>Due to the corruption in man's nature through his fall, God would not permit man to eat the tree of life (Gen. 3:22) until his fallen nature would be dealt with. This indicates that God would not let His eternal life be received by man without man repenting of his sin and without the dealing with man's corrupted nature.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. God Driving Man Out of the Garden of Eden<br>and Closing to Man the Way to the Tree of Life</H2><P>The last issue of man's fall was that God drove man out of the garden of Eden and closed to man the way to the tree of life (Gen. 3:23-24). This was to execute God's prohibition of man from eating the tree of life. This prohibition was taken away by Christ's full redemption through His death which cut a new and living way for the believers of Christ to enter into the Holy of Holies to receive God as their eternal life (Heb. 10:19-20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. SAVING MAN FROM HIS FALL</H2><P>Man became fallen to such a miserable state. Surely such a fallen man could do nothing to help himself out of such a fallen state. Only the wise and almighty God could afford a full and dynamic salvation to the man created by Him and spoiled by His adversary. Furthermore, He, as the unchanging and everlasting God, could not have any change in annulling His eternal economy which He made in His Divine Trinity in eternity past and for eternity future. He had to rescue the man whom He had created for His unchanging purpose, and He did it!</P><P>Furthermore, what God created for His purpose according to His good pleasure was a wonderful, excellent, marvelous, and precious man. In the eyes of God, man in his original created state was most excellent, marvelous, and precious. We may even say that in Genesis 2 man became God's pleasure. Hence, God loved man (John 3:16)! He would save him at any cost, even at the cost of sacrificing His only begotten Son!</P><P>This is why even in eternity past Christ as the Second of the Divine Trinity was preparing to come into time (Micah 5:2) to die for fallen man according to the divine determination made in the council of the Divine Trinity in eternity past (Acts 2:23 and note 1; 1 Pet. 1:19-20).</P><P>Thus, God came in to save man from his fall. Genesis 3 tells us that God came to visit the man whom He had created and who had become fallen and lost. When God came to Adam after his fall, He called to Adam, saying, "Where are you?" (v. 9). It was as if God were saying, "Where are you? You have become lost, so I have come to seek you. You have become fallen, so I have come to rescue you." That was God's visitation to Adam. This was the first case of "door knocking" in the whole universe. God was knocking on Adam's door to visit Adam. Man had not yet invented physical dwelling places, so there was not a physical door on which God could knock. But God came to knock on the door of Adam's heart. He came to seek Adam because Adam had become lost.</P><P>When God found Adam, He had a kind of gospel conversation, gospel talk, with him. The first gospel talk is recorded in Genesis 3. The first lesson for those who intend to visit people with the gospel is in Genesis 3. We should learn how to talk to a fallen man.</P><P>The first thing God uttered was, "Where are you?" Adam responded by saying, "I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself" (v. 10). This indicates that when we talk to the sinners whom we visit, we have to spend some time to help them realize where they are. We need wisdom to do this. The way is not to tell them where they are but to let them tell us. God was very clear where Adam was, but God would not say anything. Instead He asked, "Adam, where are you?" Adam told his story to God. Then God preached the gospel.</P><P>The first thing in the preaching of the gospel is to condemn the serpent. The serpent was cursed by God in Genesis 3. God said to the serpent, "Thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life" (v. 14). This indicates that formerly Satan, the serpent, was standing and walking. Now he is cursed to go upon his belly along the earth and cursed to eat the dust. Now he is altogether something belonging to the earth. In God's condemnation of Satan, He gave Satan a limitation: he cannot move above the earth, and he cannot eat anything except dust.</P><P>God also assigned a certain amount of suffering to the woman and the man (vv. 16-19). The suffering assigned to the woman was in the conceiving and delivery of a child. The delivery of a child is a great suffering assigned by God to fallen sinners. In Genesis 3 God assigned man to labor with sweat (vv. 17, 19). As fallen sinners we all need God's assignment of suffering. The human life today after man's fall is a life of suffering. The less suffering a person has, the deeper he can become involved with sin. Those who are wealthy and self-indulgent are more involved with sin. People who are poor and who have to labor all the time to eat have no time to think about worldly amusement, entertainment, and the pleasures of this life, all of which are mostly involved with sin.</P><P>In the beginning of the book of Job, we can see that Job was very rich. All of his children were enjoying a rich life until one day a great wind came and destroyed the house where they were eating and drinking wine. The house fell upon them and they died (1:18-19). If they had been laboring in the field, this might not have happened. We should be warned by this. Job was very rich and comfortable, but God assigned a certain amount of suffering to him. In the midst of our suffering, though, we can enjoy God as our Savior and rest.</P><P>This is all a part of the gospel, but we need to see the main item in this gospel. In God's curse of the serpent, the gospel was announced. This announcement was that the seed of the woman would come to bruise the head of the serpent (Gen. 3:15). To bruise the head of the serpent is to put the serpent to death. The serpent, the tempter, the deceiver of man, was to be put to death by the seed of woman. This was not only the gospel but also a great prophecy that one day the very God would become a human seed. The top gospel is that God became a human seed to destroy Satan, putting him to death.</P><P>Satan spoiled man, poisoned man, causing man to become the flesh. But God became a man, became flesh, and died in this flesh to put Satan to death. Hebrews 2:14 says that Christ shared in man's blood and flesh "that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil." Genesis 3:15 has been fulfilled in Hebrews 2:14. The incarnated God put on man's flesh and in this flesh He died a death that put Satan to death. This is the top gospel.</P><P>The death of this human seed, on the one hand, put Satan to death, destroying him, and on the other hand, accomplished redemption for fallen man. God prepared this redemption through the shedding of the blood of Christ (typified by the slain sacrifice&#151;Heb. 9:22; Matt. 26:28). This was a vast event God consummated in the universe for the completion of His economy in redeeming His chosen people.</P><P>Eventually, through the death of this human seed, God made Christ a covering to cover the naked, shameful, and sinful man so that this human seed could be man's righteousness before God (1 Cor. 1:30) for God's justification of man (Rom. 3:22-24). This is typified by God clothing man with the coats of the skins of the slain sacrifice (Gen. 3:21). The incarnated God put on the human flesh to die in order to destroy Satan and to accomplish redemption. Such a death makes Him the very righteousness that the fallen man can wear before God, not only to be redeemed but also to be justified.</P><P>All of this is much more than the story of man. It is the story of God, the history of God in saving the fallen man. It is also the contents of the preaching of the gospel. This gospel preaching tells us how God, the Creator of man, became man's Savior after man's fall. He became man's Savior by becoming a seed of humanity, a human seed. The creating God, because of the fall of man, became a human seed to destroy the tempter, to redeem fallen man, and to be made man's righteousness before God to cover fallen man's sinfulness and nakedness. This is really a history of God.</P><P>At the beginning of God's gospel, God said, "Adam, where are you?" Now after wearing the human seed as his clothing, Adam could say, "Now, God, I am in this dear One who has become my clothing. Through His death I'm here." This is the story of God in His acting to rescue man, to become man's redemption, and to become man's clothing, man's covering, man's righteousness, so that man can be in God to become one with God.</P><P>Genesis 3 reveals that after man's fall, God came to visit sinners. He became a human seed to die so that Satan could be destroyed and the redemption of man could be accomplished. Then He became our righteousness that we could wear to cover us. Eventually, the result is that we fallen sinners who have been redeemed and justified can be in Him to be one with Him. Is this not a top gospel? Such a gospel is the history of God. Our gospel preaching, our gospel conversation with sinners, should be with this high gospel of the history of God.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S HISTORY IN TIME<br>GEN. 1:1&#151;REV. 20:15</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(4)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>WORKING ON HIS SAINTS FROM ABEL TO NOAH<br>AND<br>JUDGING THE WORLD FROM CAIN TO BABEL</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gen. 4:4-5, 10-22, 25-26; 5:21-24; 6:1-22; 8:20&#151;9:27; 11:1-9</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Working on His saints from Abel to Noah:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>After saving Adam, God continued to work on some of his descendants who took God's way of life based upon the principle of the tree of life and became God's saints according to God's election:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>God had respect unto Abel and his offering&#151;Gen. 4:4.</li>		<li>God appointed Seth to replace Abel&#151;Gen. 4:25.</li>		<li>God began to have His name called upon by Enosh&#151;Gen. 4:26.</li>		<li>God prophesied concerning the deluge through Enoch naming his son Methuselah, which means "when he is dead, it (the deluge) shall be sent"&#151;Gen. 5:21.</li>		<li>God gained Enoch to walk with Him for three hundred years and took Enoch away from the earth before the deluge&#151;Gen. 5:22-24.</li>		<li>God gained Noah to walk with Him and to prepare the ark for the salvation of him and his whole family from the corrupted age through the deluge&#151;Gen. 6:9-22.</li>		<li>God was pleased with the sweet savor of Noah's burnt offerings to keep the earth with its systems and to covenant with Noah and his descendants and with all the living creatures that they all would not be destroyed anymore by a flood but would be multiplied and replenish the earth&#151;Gen. 8:20&#151;9:17.</li>		<li>God prophesied through Noah concerning his three sons that Ham's son Canaan would be a slave to Shem and Japheth, that Shem would have God as his God, and that Japheth would be enlarged by God and dwell in the tents of Shem&#151;Gen. 9:18-27.</li>		</ol>	<li>The above are the works God did before His calling of Abraham.</li>	</ol><li>Judging the world from Cain to Babel:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>While working on His chosen saints positively, God was judging negatively the rest of Adam's descendants who took Satan's way of death based upon the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and became the world under God's condemnation:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>God had no respect unto Cain and his offering&#151;Gen. 4:5.</li>		<li>God judged Cain, causing him to become a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth to invent the human, godless culture&#151;Gen. 4:10-22.</li>		<li>God judged the corrupted world, composed of men who had become flesh, by the deluge to terminate the age of Cain&#151;Gen. 6:1-7, 11-13.</li>		<li>God judged at Babel the world, which had abandoned Him and had joined Satan as one, to terminate the race of Adam&#151;Gen. 11:1-9.</li>		</ol>	<li>God's judgment on the world is a strong evidence that the God-created yet rebelling world is still under His sovereign ruling.</li>	</ol></ol><P>We want to continue to see God's history in time in the book of Genesis. We have seen that in time God worked to restore the judged universe and create man (Gen. 1:2&#151;2:25). Then He saved man from his fall (Gen. 3). In this message we will see how God worked on His saints from Abel to Noah and judged the world from Cain to Babel. The record of this history is from Genesis 4 through the first part of Genesis 11. This portion of the Word is only about seven and a half chapters, but all of the items recorded in this short part of the holy Word are very, very crucial. My burden is to help us to know, to realize, to enter into, and to experience the Christian life. Actually, this line on the history of God in His union with man is still on the Christian life.</P><P>If we do not know what God did with Abel, with Seth, with Enosh, with Enoch, with Methuselah, and with Noah, we still do not know what the Christian life is. All of these persons lived the Christian life. We may ask, "Was Abel a Christian?" He was not a Christian, but the life he lived was a Christian life. His life was a model, a type, of the Christian life. Abel was a shepherd of sheep, and sheep at Abel's time were used for sacrifices. They were not used for food because at that time, God had not ordained that people eat animal meat (Gen. 1:29). It was not until after the flood that God said that man could eat meat (Gen. 9:3). Sheep at Abel's time were not for food but for offerings to God.</P><P>Have you ever realized that the first full-time co-worker was Abel? He raised up sacrifices for God's offering. This was his job, his work. This was also his kind of living. Abel was a person doing nothing on this earth but offering to God. Genesis 4:4 says that God had respect unto Abel and his offering. How good it was that Abel was a full-timer doing nothing but living for God! He was not in the line of good and evil. He was in the line of the tree of life, living for God and living to God.</P><P>Those of us who are serving the Lord full time should compare our full-time service with Abel's. When we compare ourselves with Abel, we probably need to say that we are part-timers, not full-timers. Abel was living a life that was absolutely for God. His living was for God, not for food, for eating. His elder brother Cain was the opposite. Cain was living for his daily necessity, for food.</P><P>Abel lived on God in a spiritual sense, and he lived on what God did, on what God provided, in a physical sense. If we are full-timers we should live as Abel did. We should not live on anything worked out by ourselves. Cain was different from Abel because he lived on what he did. He was a farmer producing food for himself. Thus, we can see that it is not too much to say that Abel lived a Christian life. If we live the Christian life merely according to what the New Testament teaches, that is not adequate. We have to come back to the Old Testament to see the first typical full-timer for God&#151;Abel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. WORKING ON HIS SAINTS FROM ABEL TO NOAH</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. After Saving Adam, God Continuing<br>to Work on Some of His Descendants<br>Who Took God's Way of Life</H2><P>After saving Adam, God continued to work on some of his descendants who took God's way of life based upon the principle of the tree of life and became God's saints according to God's election. These particular descendants of Adam were separated people, sanctified unto God according to God's election, God's choosing.</P><P>We saw in the previous message that Genesis 3 reveals that God works to save lost and fallen sinners. Following that, God continues to work on His saints who take His way of life. Abel lived a model of the Christian life as a full-timer who was absolutely for God. But do you believe that without God's moving on and with Abel, Abel could have been a person who was living God full time? He could be such a person only because God moved and worked on him, through him, and with him. He was a fallen person, a fallen descendant of Adam, yet he could live such a life. It would have been impossible for him to do this by himself without any kind of support. Abel's doing was not by himself; it was God who worked on him and made him such a person.</P><P>We cannot serve the Lord as full-timers by ourselves. In ourselves and by ourselves we cannot make it. In ourselves and by ourselves we would already have given up long ago. Paul said, "By the grace of God I am what I am" (1 Cor. 15:10). Paul was what he was because of the sufficient grace of Christ (2 Cor. 12:9). It is the grace of Christ that has made us what we are in Him. If Abel were here today, he would say that the very God whom he worshipped made him such a person. This is God's work. God produced people who would take His way of life based upon the principle of the tree of life. Otherwise, God would have no testimony on this earth. The beginning of the Bible shows us a person named Abel who can be considered as the first full-timer on this earth to live God. This was God's work to produce such a person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God Having Respect<br>unto Abel and His Offering</H2><P>God had respect unto Abel and his offering (Gen. 4:4). The word respect is a weighty word. If we respect someone, this means a lot. God, the Creator, gave respect to a person, His creature. If the President of the United States has respect for a person, this is an honor to him. Genesis shows us God's work in giving respect to Abel, one of His creatures. Such a fallen person received the salvation and the sustaining power from God to be a person living for Him. Abel was the first person to be honored and respected by God. At that time he was the most glorious person on earth. All of us should aspire to be like Abel. All of the full-timers should be Abels.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God Appointing Seth to Replace Abel</H2><P>God appointed Seth to replace Abel (Gen. 4:25). This is the only thing the Bible says concerning God's work on Seth. Abel did not live long. He was martyred, so there was the need of a continuation. Right away God came in and appointed Seth. The word appointed is a strong word. For God to appoint Seth to replace Abel means that Seth was the same as Abel. This was also God's work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. God Beginning to Have His Name<br>Called Upon by Enosh</H2><P>God began to have His name called upon by Enosh (Gen. 4:26). We also need to give the credit for this to God. Do we think calling on the name of God was initiated by Enosh? Actually, it was not initiated or motivated by Enosh. God moved Enosh to call on Him. The name Enosh means frail, mortal man. Enosh was very frail, weak, and fragile, so he realized he had nothing to trust in. At that juncture God came in to motivate him to call spontaneously, "O Jehovah. O Jehovah." Calling on the Lord's name started in this way.</P><P>Some people oppose the truth and practice of calling on the name of the Lord. But we have to realize that all real Christians, when they feel they are so weak and fragile, would spontaneously call, "O Lord." Even before we knew the truth concerning calling on the Lord's name, many of us practiced it. Whenever we got into trouble, whenever we felt so weak, fragile, and helpless, we spontaneously called, "O Lord."</P><P>Actually, when we felt so weak and helpless, God the Spirit motivated us from within to call, "O Lord, help me." This was not only the practice of calling upon the name of the Lord but also God's working. All the positive doings we see in the Bible are always something motivated by God. We human beings actually are not inventors but imitators. God is the unique Inventor. God invented everything, so He is the One who motivates, who invents. We are those who follow His motivation.</P><P>After we were saved, there were a number of times when we could not manage our situation, so we called upon Him and exercised our whole being to trust in Him. In mainland China during the Second World War, I was put into prison by the invading Japanese army. While I was there I spontaneously called on the Lord and exercised my whole being to trust absolutely in Him. At that time it was a small thing for the invading Japanese army to kill people, and I was under their hand. They could have killed me at any time. If I had not trusted in the Lord, in whom could I have trusted? He motivated me to trust in Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. God Prophesying concerning the Deluge<br>through Enoch Naming His Son Methuselah</H2><P>God prophesied concerning the deluge through Enoch naming his son Methuselah, which means "when he is dead, it (the deluge) shall be sent" (Gen. 5:21). This is the first prophecy after God prophesied concerning Christ as the seed of the woman in Genesis 3:15. Enoch brought forth a son and named his son Methuselah. This means that when Methuselah died, God would send the deluge to judge the world.</P><P>Methuselah lived nine hundred sixty-nine years (5:27). When he had lived one hundred eighty-seven years, he begot a son named Lamech (v. 25). When his son Lamech lived one hundred eighty-two years, he begot a son by the name of Noah (vv. 28-29). At that time Methuselah was three hundred sixty-nine years old. Then when Noah had lived up to six hundred years of age, Methuselah died, and the deluge came (7:11). That was exactly nine hundred sixty-nine years after the birth of Methuselah. Enoch's naming of his son was actually God's prophesying of the coming deluge.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. God Gaining Enoch to Walk with Him<br>for Three Hundred Years and Taking Enoch Away from the Earth before the Deluge</H2><P>At the age of sixty-five Enoch begot Methuselah. Afterward, he still lived for three hundred years, and during these three hundred years, he walked with God (5:22-24). This implies that God also walked with Enoch. God took Enoch away from the earth before the deluge. It was a great thing for God to walk with a person on this earth for three hundred years. Walking implies living. God and Enoch lived together and walked together for three hundred years.</P><P>Enoch and God surely conversed with each other during that time. Enoch could have said, "God, look at the world today. All the people have become flesh, and the world is totally evil and corrupted." God could have responded, "Enoch, be at peace. One day I'll send the flood to judge this world. But you should not worry. Before that time, I'll take you away from this earth." I believe that Enoch and God should have conversed in this way. The book of Jude tells us that Enoch as the seventh from Adam also prophesied concerning the Lord coming with myriads of His saints (v. 14). Enoch lived with God. He walked with God. He and God were together for three hundred years. This was part of God's working in His history in time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. God Gaining Noah to Walk with Him<br>and to Prepare the Ark for the Salvation<br>of Him and His Whole Family</H2><P>God went on to gain another person named Noah (Gen. 6:9-22). Noah was a great-grandson of Enoch. Enoch begot Methuselah, Methuselah begot Lamech, and Lamech begot Noah. Noah's great-grandfather walked with God, and Noah followed him to also walk with God. God gained Noah not only to walk with Him but also to prepare the ark for the salvation of him and his whole family from the corrupted age through the deluge. It was Noah who made the ark, but it was God who motivated him. It was God who charged Noah to do this. This was again something of God's work, of God's move among men on this earth as a part of the history of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. God Being Pleased with the Sweet Savor<br>of Noah's Burnt Offerings</H2><P>God was pleased with the sweet savor of Noah's burnt offerings to keep the earth with its systems and to covenant with Noah and his descendants and with all the living creatures that they all would not be destroyed anymore by a flood but would be multiplied and replenish the earth (8:20&#151;9:17). This was all God's doing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. God Prophesying through Noah<br>concerning His Three Sons</H2><P>God also prophesied through Noah concerning his three sons (9:18-27). Noah was a godly man, but he became loose. When we become successful and happy, it is easy for us to become loose. Noah planted a vineyard, drank of the wine, became drunk, and was uncovered within his tent. One of his three sons exposed his failure, but the others covered the nakedness of their father. When Noah awoke, God prophesied through him.</P><P>First, God cursed the son of the one who exposed his father's failure. Canaan, Ham's son, was cursed to be a slave to Shem and Japheth (9:25). Ham is also the father of Cush (10:6) and Cush is the forefather of the Ethiopians. Cush later begot Nimrod (v. 8), who built up both Assyria with Nineveh as its capital and Babylon with Babel as its capital (vv. 8-11; Micah 5:6). Assyria and Babylon became the primary nations opposing God's people. The first nation that invaded Israel was Assyria, and that nation was built up by Nimrod.</P><P>Canaan, the son of Ham, was cursed, but Shem and Japheth received the blessing (Gen. 9:26-27). Japheth is the forefather of the Europeans. God gave him the blessing of being enlarged. The Europeans, especially in the last five centuries since the time of Columbus, have been enlarged, spreading throughout the whole world. But regardless of how much Japheth has been enlarged, God said that he would dwell in the tents of Shem. A tent is a place where people may dwell, rest, and have peace and enjoyment. Japheth's tent is with his brother Shem.</P><P>All of the Jews are of Shem. Shem received the blessing of having God. God became his blessing, and this God is the rest to man, the peace to man, the enjoyment to man, and the salvation to man. All the Europeans today are strong and enlarged, but they must dwell in the tents of Shem. If they are going to worship God, they must believe in the God of the Jews, receiving rest, peace, enjoyment, and salvation in the Jewish tent.</P><P>The Old Testament was written by the Jews. The New Testament was also written by the Jews except for one Gentile, Luke. But Luke got all the teachings from the Jews. Eventually, the New Jerusalem bears the names of the twelve tribes and of the twelve apostles, all of whom were Jews (Rev. 21:12-14). Thus, the New Jerusalem bears the names of the Jews. Furthermore, all the Gentile and Jewish believers in Christ, as the new creation, are the real Israel of God (Gal. 6:16).</P><P>Today we are in the tent of Shem. The Lord Jesus, one of Shem's descendants, was the tabernacle, a tent (John 1:14). Eventually, the New Jerusalem is the ultimate tent of Shem, the tabernacle of God with men for eternity (Rev. 21:3). What a great blessing it is to be in the tent of Shem! All the Europeans, regardless of how strong they are, have to take the Jewish God. They have to enjoy their salvation in the Jewish tent, the tent of Shem.</P><P>This prophecy concerning Shem and Japheth is part of God's marvelous work. Today we have gone to Russia to bring the descendants of Japheth into the tent of Shem. They are homeless, but we are bringing them into the tent of the Jews, the tent of Shem. Now many of them are in this tent, and they are happy and restfully enjoying God in Christ. Thus, we can see that God prophesied through Noah concerning his three sons that Ham's son Canaan would be a slave to Shem and Japheth, that Shem would have God as his God, and that Japheth would be enlarged by God and dwell in the tents of Shem. This is also a part of God's history. (I would encourage us to read Message Thirty-three of Life-study of Genesis, pp. 439-450, for a more thorough view of this part of God's history.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Above Being the Works God Did<br>before His Calling of Abraham</H2><P>Before God called Abraham, God worked on His saints from Abel to Noah, the forefathers of God's chosen people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. JUDGING THE WORLD FROM CAIN TO BABEL</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. God Judging the Rest of Adam's Descendants<br>Who Took Satan's Way of Death</H2><P>While working on His chosen saints positively, God was judging negatively the rest of Adam's descendants who took Satan's way of death based upon the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and became the world under God's condemnation. The world is a negative term, referring to fallen mankind. Fallen mankind is the world under God's condemnation. While God is working positively on His chosen ones, He is also working negatively on the rest of mankind who take Satan's way of death. Fallen mankind has become the corrupted, rotten world under God's condemnation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God Having No Respect unto Cain<br>and His Offering</H2><P>God had respect unto Abel and his offering, but He had no respect unto Cain and his offering (Gen. 4:5). God rejected Cain, judging him because he did not take God's way of life. Instead of offering the God-ordained sacrifice to God, he offered the produce of the earth to God. He forsook God's way of salvation and offered according to his own concept and opinion. Cain did not take the way of God, so God judged him by rejecting him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God Judging Cain, Causing Him to Become<br>a Fugitive and a Wanderer on the Earth<br>to Invent the Human, Godless Culture</H2><P>After Cain murdered his brother Abel, God judged Cain even further. This judgment caused Cain to become a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth to invent the human, godless culture (4:10-22). The first culture invented by man was the culture under Cain. Cain built a city for his self-existence (v. 17). His descendants then invented cattle-raising for making a living, music for amusement, and weapons for defense (vv. 20-22). Human culture is the same in principle today. The primary thing in human culture is man taking care of his living. The second item of human culture is amusement. The United States today is filled with worldly amusement and entertainment. The third item is the making of weapons. Today on earth people are consumed with these three things: what to eat, how to have amusement, and how to fight, how to build up the national defense to protect themselves. These are the contents of human culture invented by the descendants of Cain. This was Cain's culture.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. God Judging the Corrupted World,<br>Composed of Men Who Had Become Flesh,<br>by the Deluge to Terminate the Age of Cain</H2><P>God judged the corrupted world, composed of men who had become flesh, by the deluge to terminate the age of Cain (6:1-7, 11-13). The first age of human culture was the age of Cain, and that age, that part of the world, was terminated by the flood.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. God Judging at Babel the World, Which<br>Had Abandoned Him and Had Joined Satan<br>as One, to Terminate the Race of Adam</H2><P>God judged at Babel the world, which had abandoned Him and had joined Satan as one, to terminate the race of Adam (11:1-9). The judgment of the flood terminated the age of Cain. Then the judgment of Babel terminated the race of Adam. The race of Adam was through with God because they had abandoned God and had joined Satan as one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. God's Judgment on the World Being a Strong Evidence That the God-created yet Rebelling World Is Still under His Sovereign Ruling</H2><P>God's judgment on the world is a strong evidence that the God-created yet rebelling world is still under God's sovereign ruling. This is God's work on the negative side to judge the world from Cain to Babel. This is also a negative part of God's history.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S HISTORY IN TIME<br>GEN. 1:1&#151;REV. 20:15</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(5)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>WORKING ON HIS ELECT<br>FROM ABRAHAM TO JOSEPH</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>WORKING ON ABRAHAM<br>AND<br>JUDGING SODOM AND GOMORRAH</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gen. 11:31; 12:1-4; Acts 7:2-4; Gen. 22:16-18</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Working on Abraham:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Calling him:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The first time&#151;Gen. 11:31; Acts 7:2-4a:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>By appearing to him as the God of glory.</li>			<li>Through his father Terah.</li>			<li>With his nephew Lot and his wife Sarai.</li>			<li>Out of Ur of the Chaldees and from his relatives.</li>			<li>Into Canaan.</li>			<li>Stopped at Haran.</li>			</ol>		<li>The second time&#151;Gen. 12:1, 4:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>After the death of his father Terah.</li>			<li>Out of his country, from his kindred, and from his father's house.</li>			<li>Unto the land that Jehovah would show him.</li>			<li>Going with his nephew Lot at seventy-five years of age.</li>			</ol>		</ol>	<li>Promising him&#151;Gen. 12:2-3:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To make of him a great country.</li>		<li>To make his name great.</li>		<li>To bless him and make him a blessing to others.</li>		<li>All the families of the earth to be blessed in him; announcing the gospel beforehand to Abraham (Gal. 3:8).</li>		</ol>	<li>Appearing to him the third time and promising him that He would give the land of Canaan to his seed&#151;Gen. 12:7.</li>	<li>Saving him from Pharaoh's insulting of his wife &#151;Gen. 12:10-20.</li>	<li>Promising to give to him and his seed all the land which he saw, northward, southward, eastward, and westward, and to make his seed as the dust of the earth&#151;Gen. 13:14-17.</li>	<li>The priest of God, as God Most High, blessing Abraham, saying, Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth&#151;Gen. 14:19.</li>	<li>Speaking in a vision to Abraham that He is his shield and his exceeding great reward; only he that shall come forth out of his own bowels shall be his heir; his heirs will be as many as the stars in heaven; he believed in Him, and He reckoned it to him for righteousness; and his seed shall be sojourners in Egypt, serve the Egyptians, be afflicted by them for four hundred years, and in their fourth generation return to Canaan; in that day He made a covenant with him to give to his seed the land, from the river of Egypt to the Great River, Euphrates&#151;Gen. 15.</li>	<li>Not speaking to Abraham for thirteen years because he took Hagar as his concubine, who brought forth for him a son, Ishmael, when he was eighty-six years old&#151;Gen. 16.</li>	<li>Appearing the seventh time to Abraham when he was ninety-nine years old and making with him the covenant of circumcision so that he would be the father of a multitude of nations, and changing his name from Abram to Abraham and his wife's name from Sarai to Sarah, of whom Abraham would have a son, Isaac&#151;Gen. 17.</li>	<li>Appearing the eighth time to him by the oaks of Mamre, fellowshipping with him as with His friend (2 Chron. 20:7; Isa. 41:8; James 2:23)&#151;Gen. 18.</li>	<li>Saving his wife from Abimelech, king of Gerar&#151;Gen. 20.</li>	<li>Giving him Isaac, a son of Sarah, and casting out Ishmael, his son of Hagar&#151;Gen. 21:1-14.</li>	<li>Speaking to him the tenth time to prove him by asking him to offer his son Isaac as a burnt offering to Him and he passing His proving; speaking to him the eleventh time to stop him from offering his son Isaac and he replacing Isaac with a ram (typifying Christ&#151;John 1:29) for a burnt offering; and speaking to him the twelfth time to promise him that He would multiply his seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand on the seashore, and in his seed (Christ&#151;Gal. 3:16; Matt. 1:1b) all the nations of the earth would be blessed&#151;Gen. 22:1-19.</li>	<li>Blessing him and leading his old servant to secure Rebekah as wife to his son Isaac&#151;Gen. 24.</li>	</ol><li>Judging Sodom and Gomorrah:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To burn Sodom and Gomorrah and all the Plain with brimstone and fire&#151;Gen. 19:24-25.</li>	<li>Because of their grievous sin&#151;Gen. 18:20.</li>	<li>Because of Abraham God sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow&#151;Gen. 19:29, 12-22.</li>	<li>Lot's wife became a pillar of salt by looking back&#151;Gen. 19:26.</li>	</ol></ol><P>Thus far, we have seen God's history in eternity past. We have also seen His history in time in creating the universe, in judging Satan and the universe, and in restoring the judged universe and creating man. Even the creating of man is part of the real history of God. Genesis does not merely tell us a story of how man was created. God's creation of man is actually a marvelous part of God's history in this universe.</P><P>Genesis 1:26 says that God created man in His own image and after His own likeness. The model, the prototype, for man's creation was God Himself! Of course, God is almighty, but I believe that before creating man, God should have had much consideration. Carpenters who make furniture spend much energy to make designs before they actually make a piece of furniture. In His creation of the universe, God spoke things into being. He spoke and it was (Psa. 33:9). God said, "Let there be light," and there was light (Gen. 1:3). Why would God not say, "Let there be man," and there was man? God did not create man by speaking him into being. He created man in a marvelous way.</P><P>Genesis 2:7 says that God made man with a form. God then breathed the breath of life into this form, and that breath became man's spirit. The result was that man became a living soul. Then God put this man in a particular place, a garden. On this earth there was a garden, and this garden was full of trees that were pleasant to the sight and good for food to nourish man. But among those many trees were two trees&#151;the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 2:9). By the side of the tree of life was a flowing river, and at the flow of the river there were three precious materials&#151;gold, bdellium, and onyx stone (vv. 10-12). Genesis 2 says that God caused man to sleep, opened up his side, and took out a rib of that man. God used that rib as the material to build up a building, and that building was a female (vv. 21-22). We have to enter into the significance of all of these things. Actually, Genesis 1 and 2 are not a history of Adam but a history of the Creator, of the wise Architect, God. The first two chapters of Genesis are a part of God's history.</P><P>We have seen that Genesis 3 reveals how God saved man from his fall. Then we saw how God dealt with Abel, Seth, Enosh, Enoch, Methuselah, and Noah. With these men we can see the history of the acting God on the positive side. Then on the negative side, God judged those who forsook Him and took the way of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the way of death.</P><P>For us to study the Bible by viewing it as the history of God gives us an entirely new view. The Bible is an old book, but we have a new way to study it. The most crucial point in taking a photo, is the angle at which you take it. If you do not have the proper angle, you cannot have a proper photo. If we take a picture of someone, and it is a photo of his feet, this means that we took the picture at the wrong angle. We need to view the Bible from the angle of the history of God to have a proper and complete view of the divine revelation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. WORKING ON ABRAHAM</H2><P>In this message we want to see God's history in the life of Abraham. When we look at Abraham's life, we need to see it from the proper angle, the angle of the history of God. When I was with the Brethren, they stressed that Abraham had two kinds of descendants. One was likened to the stars of heaven (Gen. 15:5), and the other was likened first to the dust of the earth (13:16) and second to the sand on the seashore (22:17). These three expressions involve the heaven, the earth, and the sea. There are the stars in the heaven, the dust of the earth, and the sand on the seashore. We need to consider the significance of these expressions.</P><P>Genesis 13 tells us that God came to visit Abraham after his nephew Lot left him. God was a real friend to Abraham. He realized that Abraham was lonely, so He came to Abraham. The servants of Lot had been fighting with the servants of Abraham, and this fighting was due to the shortage of land. Then Abraham said to Lot, "Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left" (v. 9). Lot looked at the land around them, and he chose the plain toward Sodom because that was fertile. That plain was well watered and was like the garden of the Lord and the land of Egypt (v. 10). Lot chose the best part of the land, and he departed from Abraham.</P><P>Then the Lord spoke to Abraham and said, "Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever" (vv. 14-15). Northward was toward Lebanon, southward was toward Egypt, eastward was toward the Euphrates, the Great River, and westward was toward the Mediterranean Sea, the Great Sea. As much as Abraham could see in these directions, God would give to him and to his seed. Furthermore, God told him that He would make his seed as the dust of the earth (v. 16).</P><P>In Genesis 13 there was a quarrel over the land, and Lot chose his portion, which was the best portion. Then in chapter fourteen there was a war, and in that war the very place chosen by Lot, Sodom, was defeated and taken, and Lot, his family, and all their possessions were captured. When Abraham found out about this, he armed his trained servants, three hundred eighteen men, and he defeated the invaders to deliver Lot and his family. Thus, Lot, his family, and his possessions were all recovered (14:14-16).</P><P>Lot was recovered back into safety, but Abraham may have wondered what he would do if the four kings whom he had defeated would return again to fight against him. At that juncture, God came in. This time God asked him to look up at the heavens. God said, "Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be" (Gen. 15:5). This implies that God was training Abraham. Abraham's earthly descendants could be captured but not his heavenly descendants. It was as if God said, "Abraham, I, the almighty God, Jehovah, am not only giving you descendants from the earth. I am also giving you descendants from the heavens. Your enemies can deal with your descendants from the earth, but they cannot do anything with your heavenly descendants."</P><P>In Genesis 22 God tried Abraham by asking him to offer his son Isaac as a burnt offering. Abraham was obedient to God's desire, and he was charged to offer Isaac on Mount Moriah (v. 2). Mount Moriah eventually became Mount Zion, the place where the temple was built in Jerusalem (2 Chron. 3:1). When Abraham was about to sacrifice his son, God intervened. Then Abraham saw a ram caught in a thicket and he offered that ram up for a burnt offering instead of his son (Gen. 22:13). God prepared this ram as a substitute for Isaac. This ram typified Christ. Before Christ was crucified, He was typified as the crucified One on Mount Moriah. Because Abraham did not withhold his only son in obeying God, God promised him that He would multiply his seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand on the seashore, and that in his seed all the nations of the earth would be blessed (vv. 16-18).</P><P>In Genesis 22:17 Abraham's seed is likened to the stars and the sand, not the dust. We have to consider why the Bible likens Abraham's earthly descendants to dust and then sand. Actually, the sand comes from the dust. When the dust on the seashore is scoured, washed, with water, what is left is the sand. The children of Israel first were dust. Then the "waves of the Great Sea" came upon them again and again. What are these waves? We saw in our life-study of the book of Joel that four kinds of locusts came to devastate Israel (1:4; 2:25). All those locusts were like the waves from the Mediterranean Sea. They came up like waves to scour Israel as the dust again and again. Eventually, what was left was the sand on the seashore of the Mediterranean. Thus, the dust and the sand are eventually one. This fits the historical record. Throughout the centuries, the waves of Babylon, of Medo-Persia, of Greece, and of Rome came upon Israel again and again. The issue of this was the sand. Thus, Abraham had only two kinds of descendants: one is the New Testament believers, who are likened to the heavenly stars, and the other is the Jews, who are likened to both the dust and the sand.</P><P>Now we need to consider the significance of Abraham in the divine revelation. What does he signify? The Bible begins to speak of Abraham from the second part of Genesis 11 through Genesis 24. Then Genesis 25 begins to speak about Abraham's son Isaac. There are many persons, matters, and things in Genesis which signify something. Abraham is a sign, but what does he signify?</P><P>Abraham is a sign of God's chosen people. We are God's chosen people, but how can we know what kind of people we should be? God prepared a sign in Genesis 11&#151;24 to show us, and this sign is Abraham. Abraham is a sign prepared and provided by God for us to see. As God's chosen people, we all need to be Abrahams. In a sense, our name should be Abraham. All of us keep the name of our father and forefathers. Lee is my forefathers' name, so my name is Lee today. In this sense, all of us are Abrahams, since he is our forefather (Rom. 4:12). Abraham is a sign signifying what kind of people we should be. In other words, he is a model, a sign, of the Christian life. What is the Christian life? The Christian life is the life that Abraham lived.</P><P>This life of Abraham, which became a sign, was altogether motivated and initiated by God. It was not anything of Abraham by and in himself. Nearly everything he did in a positive way was motivated by God. One thing he did, however, which was absolutely not motivated by God was his taking of Hagar as his concubine. That was proposed, motivated, and stirred up altogether by his wife (Gen. 16:2-3). The issue of Hagar was a son named Ishmael, but Ishmael was rejected by God (Gen. 17:18-19; 21:10-12a).</P><P>The sign of Abraham shows us that in the Christian life nothing should be of us. Instead, everything should be motivated, stirred up, and initiated by God. Our being saved surely was not motivated by us. We became Christians and entered into the church life because God motivated us. God is the Motivator in our Christian life. In the church life, there are people of every color from many different countries. Who collected us together? It was God who motivated us and gathered us together into the church life. We need to realize that whatever is motivated by us will be a calamity. If you motivate your marriage life, be assured that your marriage will sooner or later be a calamity. We Christians should not motivate anything. God should be the Motivator of everything in our lives. Whatever we motivate will be a calamity, a suffering.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Calling Him</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The First Time</H2><P>God motivated Abraham by calling him. He called Abraham the first time by appearing to him as the God of glory (Gen. 11:31; Acts 7:2-4a). God called Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldees and from his relatives into Canaan. On the one hand, Abraham received God's call, but on the other hand, he was not so willing to carry out God's call. Abraham came out of Chaldea, but instead of going into Canaan, he went with his father Terah and his nephew Lot and stopped at Haran. No doubt, Abraham was not willing to leave his nephew, his relative. Probably he proposed to his father to bring Lot with them. God motivated his calling, but he was not willing to carry it out absolutely. Thus, Abraham came out of Ur of the Chaldees with Terah, Lot, and his wife Sarai. They all came out of Chaldea, the country full of idols. At that time mankind had become joined with Satan, making themselves one with Satan, so God had given them up. God then came to another person to motivate something, to get a new race. This person was Abraham.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Second Time</H2><P>God called Abraham the second time after the death of his father Terah (Gen. 12:1, 4; Acts 7:4b). He called him out of his country, from his kindred, and from his father's house into the land that Jehovah would show him. Thus, Abraham went with his nephew Lot at seventy-five years of age.</P><P>Abraham left Chaldea, but he became stuck at Haran. This may have been motivated by Abraham's father, and this displeased God. Eventually, Terah died at Haran, and this should have been taken by Abraham as a warning. At that time God came again to motivate him further. That was his second calling by which he was motivated and led by God into the land of Canaan.</P><P>When Abraham responded to this second call, God undoubtedly was very happy. I believe that God was happier with Abraham as the one called by Him and sent by Him than He was with Adam as the one created by Him. Do you prefer to be a descendant of Adam or a descendant of Abraham? Abraham is much more pleasant to God than Adam is. Abraham is a wonderful sign of the Christian life. The Christian life should be and could be a pleasant matter to God. It is always a pleasant thing to God for us to live the Christian life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. God's Promise to Abraham</H2><P>God promised Abraham to make of him a great country, to make his name great, and to bless him and make him a blessing to others (Gen. 12:2-3). Eventually, Abraham became a blessing to all the earth. In the previous message, we saw Noah's prophecy concerning his three sons (Gen. 9:24-27). According to this prophecy, the sons of Japheth, the strong ones, would dwell in the tent of Shem. That means that Shem is a blessing to all these strong ones on this earth. In one sense, when we believed into the Lord, we confessed and admitted that we were weak persons. But in another sense, everyone who has believed into Christ is a strong one. If we were not strong, we could have never believed into Christ. Many of us are the descendants of Japheth who have entered into the tent of Shem. This tent is the blessing.</P><P>Galatians 3:8 says, "And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles out of faith, announced the gospel beforehand to Abraham: 'In you shall all the nations be blessed.'" Here Paul said that the promise God gave to Abraham, "In you shall all the nations be blessed," was the gospel. That was the preaching of the gospel beforehand to Abraham. Eventually, Genesis 22:18 reveals that this blessing actually is not Abraham himself but his descendant, his seed. This seed of Abraham is Christ (Gal. 3:16). Christ has become the biggest blessing to the whole earth, and Christ came out of Abraham. The Christian life is a life always motivated by God in everything so that we can be blessed with Christ and become a blessing in Christ to others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Appearing to Him the Third Time</H2><P>God appeared to Abraham the third time and promised him that He would give the land of Canaan to his seed (Gen. 12:7). God appeared and spoke to Abraham altogether twelve times.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Saving Him from Pharaoh's<br>Insulting of His Wife</H2><P>Genesis 12:10-20 shows how God saved Abraham from Pharaoh's insulting of his wife.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Promising to Give Him and<br>His Seed All the Land Which He Saw</H2><P>God promised to give to Abraham and his seed all the land which he saw, northward, southward, eastward, and westward, and to make his seed as the dust of the earth (Gen. 13:14-17). God was telling Abraham that he would get as much as he could see. Northward was surely up to Lebanon, the northern border of the good land. Southward was to the river of Egypt, the Nile. Eastward was to the Great River, the Euphrates. Westward was to the seashore of the Mediterranean. Abraham saw the boundaries of the good land.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Priest of God,<br>as God Most High, Blessing Abraham</H2><P>The priest of God, as God Most High, blessed Abraham, saying, "Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth" (Gen. 14:19, ASV). This was something apparently not motivated by God but motivated by Melchisedec, the King of Salem and the priest of God. Abraham was the victor who had defeated the enemies of God. Through Abraham God could be declared as the Possessor of heaven and earth. In other instances in the Bible, God could be called only the God of heaven (2 Chron. 36:23; Neh. 1:5; 2:4, 20) because of the lack of someone standing with God on earth to defeat God's enemies and gain the victory for God. But when Melchisedec came to bless Abraham, he could refer to God as the Possessor of heaven and earth. This means that there was a victor, an overcomer, on earth who stood with God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Speaking in a Vision to Abraham That He<br>Was His Shield and His Exceeding Great Reward</H2><P>In Genesis 15 God spoke in a vision to Abraham that He was his shield and his exceeding great reward (v. 1). The Lord was both Abraham's protection and his reward. God rewarded Abraham because Abraham was victorious over all of God's enemies.</P><P>God also told Abraham in Genesis 15 that only the one who would come forth out of Abraham's own bowels would be his heir (v. 4). In Genesis 16 Hagar became Abraham's concubine through the motivation of Abraham's wife Sarah. Sarah proposed this to Abraham and Abraham agreed. But God denied and rejected the son produced through Hagar. God told Abraham that his heir must be one out of his own bowels and that his heirs would be as many as the stars in heaven (15:5).</P><P>Abraham believed in God, and God reckoned it to him for righteousness (v. 6). Romans 4 develops this point strongly by saying that Abraham was a forefather of all the ones who are justified by God through believing into Jesus Christ. Abraham was a pattern, a model, a sign. Thus, the model of the Christian life is one who is first called by God and then justified by God. After being called you must be justified by God. Being justified by God means that you are in harmony with God. In other words, between you and God there is nothing contradicting and there is a harmonious situation and condition. This means that you are righteous according to God's righteousness. When you are justified, your righteousness matches God's righteousness. Abraham entered into a situation which was absolutely in harmony with God.</P><P>In Genesis 15 God told Abraham that his descendants would be as the stars in heaven. Genesis also reveals that his earthly descendants would be as the sand on the seashore. We pointed out that the oppressing nations were like the waves out of the Mediterranean Sea coming upon Israel again and again to make Israel as the sand of the seashore. Actually, the first wave of water came from Egypt. God told Abraham in Genesis 15 that his seed would be sojourners in Egypt, serve the Egyptians, and be afflicted by them for four hundred years (v. 13). In their fourth generation, they returned to Canaan. God also made a covenant with Abraham in the day that He spoke to him in Genesis 15 to give to his seed the land, from the river of Egypt to the Great River, Euphrates (v. 18).</P><P>Two things are very prominent in the life of Abraham. First, God made Abraham's descendants as the stars in the heaven. These are the New Testament believers as his heavenly descendants. Second, He would make Abraham's earthly descendants as the sand on the seashore. The remnant of Israel as the dust of the earth pass through wave after wave of tribulation. Eventually, in the millennium the remnant of Israel, who have passed through the scouring waters, will become as the sand on the Mediterranean seashore.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Not Speaking to Abraham for Thirteen Years</H2><P>God did not speak to Abraham for thirteen years because he took Hagar as his concubine, who brought forth for him a son, Ishmael, when he was eighty-six years old (Gen. 16). Abraham offended God, his Friend. Thus, God would not fellowship with Abraham for thirteen years. Genesis 16:16 says, "And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram." Then Genesis 17:1 says, "And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram..." This shows that for thirteen years there was not any communication, fellowship, or speaking between God and Abraham.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Appearing the Seventh Time to Abraham<br>When He Was Ninety-nine Years Old</H2><P>God appeared the seventh time to Abraham when he was ninety-nine years old and made with him the covenant of circumcision so that he would be the father of a multitude of nations. He also changed his name from Abram to Abraham and his wife's name from Sarai to Sarah, of whom Abraham would have a son, Isaac (Gen. 17). The covenant of circumcision is a sign. All the chosen ones of God should be circumcised, meaning that they should cut off, crucify, their flesh (Gal. 5:24). The body of the flesh should be cut off, crucified (Col. 2:11), to regenerate us and renew us, making us a new person. Abraham was living a model of the Christian life, because the covenant of circumcision signifies that he was crucified, regenerated, and renewed. This was so that he would be the father of a multitude of nations.</P><P>Furthermore, his name and his wife's name were changed from Abram and Sarai to Abraham and Sarah. Because the person is changed, the name should also be changed. Eventually, Sarah gave birth to Isaac. This means that after we have been crucified and regenerated, we will bring forth the real seed. Otherwise, we will produce Ishmael. If we are not crucified, regenerated, and renewed, we cannot produce Isaac. We will produce false Christians, not the real believers. We can produce the real believers only by being circumcised, that is, by being crucified, regenerated, and renewed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Appearing the Eighth Time<br>to Him by the Oaks of Mamre</H2><P>God appeared the eighth time to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre, fellowshipping with him as with His friend (Gen. 18; 2 Chron. 20:7; Isa. 41:8; James 2:23). In the past I wondered why God came with two angels to visit and stay with Abraham. God conversed with Abraham. Abraham served Him water for Him to wash His feet, and Abraham's wife made a meal for Him. God talked with Abraham as a friend. Abraham saw God, conversed with God, and walked with God. Then God was forced to tell him what He was about to do to Sodom. God indicated that He could not hide this from Abraham because Abraham was His intimate friend. Actually, God's purpose and intention in coming to visit Abraham was for Lot's sake.</P><P>God told Abraham what He was about to do to Sodom with the intention that Abraham would intercede. God was motivating Abraham to pray for Lot. Actually, God and Abraham, as close friends, were speaking of Lot but they did not mention Lot's name. Eventually, Lot was saved from Sodom, meaning that God answered Abraham's prayer. Genesis 19:29 says that when God destroyed Sodom, He remembered Abraham and sent Lot out. That means He answered Abraham's intercession. This shows that our living the Christian life must be to the extent that we become God's friend and God becomes our Friend.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Saving His Wife from Abimelech, King of Gerar</H2><P>Genesis 20 shows how God saved Abraham's wife from Abimelech, king of Gerar. This was like the trouble which Abraham had regarding Sarah with Pharaoh in Genesis 12. First, Abraham was in trouble with the king of Egypt because of his wife. Then he was in trouble with the king of Gerar because of her. Both times God came in to save him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. Giving Him Isaac and Casting Out Ishmael</H2><P>God gave Abraham Isaac, his son of Sarah, and cast out Ishmael, his son of Hagar (Gen. 21:1-14). This is a part of God's history. God's giving of Isaac to Abraham and His casting out of Ishmael are also signs, signifying that everyone who is born of grace through faith is a real son of Abraham. Anyone who is taking the law as the source, according to the tree of knowledge of good and evil, is a descendant rejected by God. These two sons with two mothers are an allegory of the grace of the New Testament and the law of the Old Testament. This is fully developed in Galatians 4.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>M. Speaking to Him the Tenth,<br>Eleventh, and Twelfth Times</H2><P>God spoke to Abraham the tenth time to prove him, to try him, by asking him to offer his son Isaac as a burnt offering to Him. Abraham passed God's proving. Then God spoke to him the eleventh time to stop him from offering his son Isaac and he replaced Isaac with a ram (typifying Christ&#151;John 1:29) for a burnt offering. God spoke further to Abraham the twelfth time to promise him that He would multiply his seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand on the seashore. God told Abraham that in his seed (Christ&#151;Gal. 3:16; Matt. 1:1b) all the nations of the earth would be blessed (Gen. 22:1-19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>N. Blessing Him and Leading His Old Servant<br>to Secure Rebekah as Wife to His Son Isaac</H2><P>Genesis 24 shows that God blessed Abraham and led his old servant to secure Rebekah as wife to his son Isaac. The last thing God did for Abraham was to help him get a daughter-in-law.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. JUDGING SODOM AND GOMORRAH</H2><P>The negative side of God's history during the life of Abraham was God's judging of Sodom and Gomorrah. The positive side was God's motivating, stirring up, and initiating the divine things in Abraham's life, which is a sign of the Christian life. On the negative side, God judged Sodom and Gomorrah.</P><P>He burned Sodom and Gomorrah and all the Plain with brimstone and fire (Gen. 19:24-25) because of their grievous sin (Gen. 18:20). Because of Abraham God sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow (Gen. 19:29, 12-22). This is also a part of God's history. When God judged the evil world, God remembered His friend's talk with Him concerning Lot, even though they did not mention Lot. When Lot and his family were fleeing, Lot's wife became a pillar of salt by looking back (Gen. 19:26). Her lingering look back at Sodom indicated that she loved and treasured the evil world that God was going to judge and utterly destroy.</P><P>We can see that Abraham suffered from two sources&#151;from his wife Sarah and from his nephew Lot. In Genesis 13 Abraham had to solve the problem with Lot over the shortage of land. Then in Genesis 14 Abraham had to fight for Lot. Eventually, by the time of Genesis 18 and 19, Lot had entered into Sodom, the center of sin, which was condemned and judged by fire from heaven. Lot escaped from God's judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah to the mountains. But his two daughters made him drunk and committed incest with him. The children they had by this incest were Moab and Ammon. The Moabites and Ammonites were rejected by God even to their tenth generation (Deut. 23:3). This record of Lot should be a warning to us.</P><P>Through our fellowship in this message, we can see that Abraham is a sign of the life of God's chosen people. He is a sign of the Christian life. We all are the descendants of Abraham. He is our forefather and a sign to us. We should live according to the model of his life.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S HISTORY IN TIME<br>GEN. 1:1&#151;REV. 20:15</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(6)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>WORKING ON HIS ELECT<br>FROM ABRAHAM TO JOSEPH</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE GOD OF ABRAHAM<br>SEEN IN HIS DEALINGS WITH ABRAHAM</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Exo. 3:15; Acts 7:2; Gen. 12:7; 17:1; 18:1</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The God of Abraham (Exo. 3:15) seen in His dealings with Abraham as follows:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The God of glory, in His first appearing with His first calling and His first speaking to Abraham, as the vast magnet and the great motivation to Abraham that moved him to come out of the country of satanic idolatry&#151;Gen. 11:31; Acts 7:2-4a.</li>	<li>The God of blessing, in His second calling with His second speaking to Abraham, promising him that He would make of him a great country, make his name great, and make him a blessing to others, and that all the families of the earth would be blessed in him; this attracted Abraham to go into the good land of the divine promise&#151;Gen. 12:1-4.</li>	<li>The God of the earth, in His second appearing with His third speaking, in promising Abraham that He would give the land of Canaan to his seed&#151;Gen. 12:6-7.</li>	<li>The God of secret care for His elect, in saving Abraham from Pharaoh's insulting of his wife&#151;Gen. 12:10-20.</li>	<li>The God of comfort and encouragement, in His fourth speaking, after Lot left Abraham, in promising to give to Abraham and to his seed the land of Canaan as far as he could see in four directions, and to make his seed as numerous as the dust of the earth&#151;Gen. 13:14-17.</li>	<li>The God Most High, the Possessor of heaven and earth, in His divine supply with His blessing to Abraham through His priest Melchisedec after Abraham fought the battle against the four kings&#151;Gen. 14:17-20.</li>	<li>The God of shield and great reward, in His fifth speaking (this time in a vision) to Abraham, when he was afraid of the four kings' avenging, in pointing to Abraham that his heavenly seed in their divine nature would be as many as the stars in heaven who could never be touched by anyone on earth; Abraham believed in Jehovah and Jehovah reckoned it to him for righteousness&#151;Gen. 15:1-6.</li>	<li>The God of faithfulness, in foretelling to Abraham, in His sixth speaking to him in his deep sleep, that his earthly seed in their human nature would be sojourners in Egypt, serve the Egyptians, be afflicted by them for four hundred years, and in their fourth generation return to Canaan; and in making a covenant with him that He would give to his seed the land from the river of Egypt to the Great River, Euphrates&#151;Gen. 15:12-21.</li>	<li>The God of silence, due to the fact that Abraham listened to his wife Sarah and married Hagar to get a son by the exercise of his flesh when he was eighty-six years old (Gen. 16:1-4, 15-16). Then God became silent to Abraham for thirteen years, until he became ninety-nine years old, and God appeared to him again (Gen. 17:1).</li>	<li>The God of all-sufficiency, in His third appearing with His seventh speaking to Abraham, in being the God of circumcision to cut off His chosen people's natural man in the flesh that they may become God's new creation, signified by Isaac who was born by God's grace, not by Ishmael who was born by Abraham's flesh&#151;Gen. 17:1-21; Gal. 4:22-31.</li>	<li>The God with His human friendship, in His coming (in His fourth appearing with His eighth speaking to Abraham) as a man, in the form of a man, to visit Abraham as His friend (2 Chron. 20:7; Isa. 41:8; James 2:23) on the level of humanity, with whom Abraham walked and who conversed with Abraham as a human friend with a human friend, concerning His judgment of Sodom, where His friend's nephew Lot and his family lived&#151;Gen. 18&#151;19.</li>	<li>The God with friendship in humanity, in sending Abraham's nephew and his two daughters out from the overthrow of Sodom, for the remembrance of Abraham as His intimate friend&#151;Gen. 19:29, 12-22.</li>	<li>The almighty God with His friendly care, in saving His close friend Abraham, with His almighty power, from the loss of his wife to Abimelech, king of Gerar&#151;Gen. 20.</li>	<li>The God of changelessness in keeping the principle of His grace, in recognizing Isaac, his son of Sarah, as his only son, in His ninth speaking to Abraham&#151;Gen. 21:1-12.</li>	<li>The God with His trial, in proving Abraham, His intimate human friend, by asking him to present his only son, whom he loved, for a burnt offering to Him, in His tenth speaking to Abraham&#151;Gen. 22:1-10.</li>	<li>The Triune God of provision, in providing a ram to replace Isaac for a burnt offering to Him (as the Angel of Jehovah&#151;Christ), in His eleventh speaking to Abraham&#151;Gen. 22:11-14.</li>	<li>The Triune God of blessing, in His twelfth (last) speaking to Abraham, promising him that He (as the Angel of Jehovah&#151;Christ) would bless him and multiply his seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand upon the seashore, and in his seed (Christ) would all the nations of the earth be blessed&#151;Gen. 22:15-18.</li>	<li>The God of friendship on the human level, in leading the old servant of His friend Abraham to secure a wife for his son Isaac&#151;Gen. 24.</li>	</ol><li>As a whole, the God of Abraham being the God of speaking in appearing, with calling, in a vision, and in the human friendship, to unveil to His intimate friend on the earth what He aspired for him to be and what He wanted him to do according to His heart's desire for the accomplishment of the eternal economy for the Divine Trinity.</li></ol><P>In the previous message, we saw God's history in His working on Abraham. Now we want to see not only the history of God but also God Himself in Abraham's life. In the Bible we cannot see another person whom God contacted, appeared to, and spoke to as much as Abraham. In His dealings with Abraham, God unveiled what kind of God He is. In Exodus 3:15 God declared that He is the God of Abraham, but without any details. It was in so many dealings of God with Abraham that the details of what God is were unveiled.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE GOD OF GLORY</H2><P>The God of Abraham is the God of glory. Stephen told us that when Abraham was called by God in Ur of the Chaldees, God appeared to him in glory as the God of glory (Acts 7:2-4a). God's glory is God Himself expressed. If God hides Himself, there is no glory. If God appears, if God is expressed, that is glory. God's glory in His appearance might imply a kind of splendor, bright and shining. </P><P>The God of glory in His first appearing to Abraham with His first calling and His first speaking was as a vast magnet and great motivation to Abraham, which moved him to come out of the country of satanic idolatry (Gen. 11:31). No one could stand against such an appearing, calling, and speaking.</P><P>Abraham was attracted, but Genesis shows us that he did not answer God's call in an absolute and willing way. It was not Abraham that took the lead to initiate leaving the world of idolatry. His father took the lead, and he followed. Actually, though, God was the magnet and motivation which moved Abraham to come out of the country of satanic idolatry. Abraham would not have made this move if God had not come to him as the God of glory. That drew him, attracted him, and motivated him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE GOD OF BLESSING</H2><P>God is also seen as the God of blessing in His second calling with His second speaking to Abraham (Gen. 12:1-4). God not only called him but also promised to make of him a great country and make his name great. Today in human history Abraham is a great name. Furthermore, God promised to make him a blessing to others. God not only blessed him but also made him a blessing to others. This blessing is the blessing of the New Testament gospel (Gal. 3:9, 14).</P><P>Abraham was a descendant of Shem, and we have seen that according to Noah's prophecy, God would be the God of Shem, and Japheth would dwell in the tents of Shem. Japheth received the blessing of being enlarged (Gen. 9:26-27). According to history, the Europeans as the sons of Japheth have expanded and spread all over the earth. The whole world has become the dwelling place of the Europeans. Five hundred years ago it was not like this. But after Columbus discovered the Western world and through the development of transportation, the Europeans have spread everywhere. But they have to dwell in Shem's tent, which becomes a blessing to them. God made Abraham, a descendant of Shem, a blessing to others. This blessing is in the tent of Shem. Many people throughout the whole earth are enjoying the blessings of God in Shem's tent.</P><P>Every person needs a tent in which he can rest and enjoy life. God's blessing to Abraham which made him a blessing to others implies the tent of Shem. When the Lord Jesus came as a seed of Abraham and a descendant of Shem, He became the tent, the tabernacle (John 1:14), which will consummate in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2-3). The New Jerusalem will be God's eternal tabernacle, His eternal tent, in which numerous Old Testament saints and New Testament believers from all the nations will dwell to participate in the eternal blessing of the eternal life. This is all implied in the blessing God gave to Abraham. God's second calling with His second speaking as the God of blessing attracted Abraham to go into the good land of the divine promise.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE GOD OF THE EARTH</H2><P>God is revealed as the God of the earth, in His second appearing with His third speaking, in promising Abraham that He would give the land of Canaan to his seed (Gen. 12:6-7). In His first appearing, God called Abraham. In His second appearing, He promised Abraham that He would give the land of Canaan to his seed. Abraham's seed, generally speaking, refers to his earthly descendants, the Jews, Israel. But narrowly speaking, the seed refers to Christ (Gal. 3:16).</P><P>Even until today, the Jews have not fully inherited the land. They will not fully inherit it until the time of restoration when Christ returns. Christ will return as the unique seed of Abraham and will inherit the good land from the Great Sea, the Mediterranean, to the Great River, the Euphrates. There have been disputes and conferences about the boundaries of the nation of Israel for years, but when Jesus comes back as the unique seed of Abraham, He will clear up the situation and inherit the good land.</P><P>God gave this land to Abraham's seed because God is the God of the land, the God, the Owner, of the earth. The earthly governments may think that their respective territories belong to them, but actually the entire earth belongs to Jehovah God (Psa. 24:1). The God of Abraham is the God of the land. As the Possessor and Owner of the land, He has the right to give it to His friend's descendants.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE GOD OF SECRET CARE FOR HIS ELECT</H2><P>The God of Abraham is seen as the God of secret care for His elect in saving Abraham from Pharaoh's insulting of his wife (Gen. 12:10-20). God exercised His hidden care, His secret care, to save His friend Abraham and his wife. He is the God of secret care for His elect to rescue His elect from their troubles.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE GOD OF COMFORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT</H2><P>God is seen as the God of comfort and encouragement in His fourth speaking to Abraham after Lot left him. In His speaking God promised to give to Abraham and to his seed the land of Canaan as far as he could see in four directions and to make his seed as numerous as the dust of the earth (Gen. 13:14-17). Abraham and Lot both became rich. They had many flocks, herds, and tents, and the land was too small for them to dwell together. Then Abraham asked Lot to choose the part of the land that he desired, and Lot left him.</P><P>Abraham was left in a lonely state. His father was dead, and his nephew Lot departed. Then God came to comfort and encourage him in promising to give him and his seed the land of Canaan as far as he could see and to make his seed as numerous as the dust of the earth. No one can count how many descendants God has given to Abraham, because they are innumerable. Many of his descendants were killed by the four kinds of locusts in Joel 1:4, signifying the Gentile governments with their invading armies. These locusts were like the waves from the Mediterranean Sea, which came to scour Israel as the dust. But regardless of how much the water washed away the dust, there was still some sand left. This is why in Genesis 22:17, Abraham's descendants are not likened to the dust but to the sand on the seashore. Some of Abraham's descendants are in the heavens as the stars. Some are the dust, but many of them were scoured away. The ones who remain after the scouring are as the sand on the seashore of the Mediterranean. Through our fellowship, I hope we can realize that in God's eyes and in God's heart, Abraham was a special person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE GOD MOST HIGH</H2><P>The God of Abraham is seen as the God Most High, the Possessor of heaven and earth, in His divine supply with His blessing to Abraham through His priest Melchisedec after Abraham fought the battle against the four kings (Gen. 14:17-20). He is not only the God of the heaven but also the God of the earth, so He is the Most High. Abraham took three hundred eighteen of his trained servants to defeat the four kings who captured Lot (v. 14). In that victory he recovered Lot and his family with their possessions (v. 16). At that time Abraham needed some supply and refreshment. The priest of God came to serve him with bread and wine as a kind of refreshment, and that refreshment resembled the Lord's table (Matt. 26:26-28). In the Lord's table, He supplies us and refreshes us, the tired, weary sinners.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE GOD OF SHIELD AND GREAT REWARD</H2><P>The God of Abraham is revealed as the God of shield and great reward in His fifth speaking (this time in a vision) to Abraham (Gen. 15:1-6). A vision is a kind of divine scenery, not a physical scenery. In that vision God spoke to Abraham. After defeating the four kings, Abraham may have been afraid of their avenging. Thus, God came in to tell Abraham that He would be a shield to protect him. He would also be Abraham's reward for his rescue of Lot. God was concerned for Lot, and Abraham cooperated with God to rescue him. This was a real credit to Abraham before God, so God rewarded him for this. This shows us that God is very fine in taking care of His people.</P><P>In His fifth speaking in a vision to Abraham, God also promised Abraham that his heavenly seed in their divine nature would be as many as the stars in heaven who could never be touched by anyone on earth. Abraham believed in Jehovah, and Jehovah reckoned this believing to him for righteousness (vv. 5-6). In Romans 4 Paul considered this as the example of justification. God is the shield, God is the great reward, and God is also the Justifier. God's justifying of Abraham meant that God became happy with Abraham and that Abraham was altogether in harmony with God. He was altogether acceptable to God, having no problem with God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE GOD OF FAITHFULNESS</H2><P>God is revealed as the God of faithfulness in His sixth speaking to Abraham in his deep sleep. In 15:1-6 God spoke to Abraham in a vision. In 15:12-21 God went on to speak to him when he was in a deep sleep. God spoke to Abraham in a dream, foretelling that his earthly seed in their human nature as "the dust of the earth" (13:16) would be sojourners in Egypt. They would be aliens in a foreign country and live there, serve the Egyptians, be afflicted by them for four hundred years, and in the fourth generation return to Canaan. Because of His faithfulness in keeping His promise, He also made a covenant with him to assure him of His faithfulness in His promise that He has given to his seed the land from the river of Egypt, the Nile, to the Great River, Euphrates. Such a covenant was a confirmation of God's promise to Abraham in 12:7; 13:14-17.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. THE GOD OF SILENCE</H2><P>God is also seen as the God of silence to Abraham. This was due to the fact that Abraham listened to his wife Sarah and married Hagar to get a son by the exercise of his flesh when he was eighty-six years old (Gen. 16:1-4, 15-16). That offended God to the uttermost. Then God became silent to Abraham for thirteen years, until he became ninety-nine years old, and God appeared to him again (Gen. 17:1). </P><P>After Abraham was called out of Haran and went into Canaan, "Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said, Unto your seed will I give this land" (Gen. 12:7). This word spoken to Abraham was God's promise to him, indicating that God would give a seed to him to inherit the land of Canaan as his possession.</P><P>When Abraham's nephew Lot was separated from him, leaving him lonely with no heir to inherit his possession, God said to him, "All the land which you see, to you will I give it, and to your seed forever. And I will make your seed as the dust of the earth" (Gen. 13:15-16). This was to repeat the promise to Abraham in 12:7, with a strong confirmation of God's unchangeable promise to make his seed as numerous as the dust of the earth.</P><P>When Abraham was afraid that the four kings might come to seek vengeance, after he had recovered his nephew Lot and his family from the four capturing kings, at this point in Genesis 15 God spoke to Abraham in a vision. God promised him that his seed would be as many as the stars in heaven (v. 5), and made a covenant with him. In Genesis 12 God spoke a word as a promise to Abraham. In Genesis 13 God repeated that promise and confirmed it. In Genesis 15 God made a covenant with Abraham (vv. 8-12, 18) to reconfirm that promise.</P><P>In spite of God's repeated promise and His confirming covenant, in Genesis 16 Abraham's wife proposed that he take Hagar her maid to bear a child for her (vv. 1-3). Abraham took, by exercising his flesh, Hagar and she bore a son by the name of Ishmael. This was a real offense to God! And God became silent to Abraham for that long time of thirteen years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. THE GOD OF ALL-SUFFICIENCY</H2><P>When Abraham was ninety-nine years old, God came in to reconfirm His covenant, which became a covenant of circumcision (Gen. 17:9-14). In God's third appearing with His seventh speaking to Abraham, He is the God of all-sufficiency in being the God of circumcision to cut off His chosen people's natural man in the flesh that they may become God's new creation, signified by Isaac who was born by God's grace, not as Ishmael who was born by Abraham's flesh (Gen. 17:1-21; Gal. 4:22-31).</P><P>Circumcision is the cutting off of the flesh, signifying that the flesh of our fallen man, our natural man, has to be cut off, ended, terminated. The apostle Paul said that the physical circumcision in the Old Testament was a full type of the crucifixion of Christ in dealing with the flesh of our body (Col. 2:11). Christ's death on the cross, His crucifixion, is our real circumcision which cuts off our flesh with its passions and its lusts (Gal. 5:24).</P><P>Even after God had made the covenant of circumcision with Abraham, he still did not want to give up Ishmael (Gen. 17:18). He asked God to let Ishmael remain, but God told him that He would establish His covenant only with Isaac (v. 19). God would recognize only Abraham's seed which was brought forth by Sarah. According to Galatians 4, Isaac was a type of one born of grace, and grace is typified by Sarah (vv. 22-31). Only one that is born of God's grace will be counted by God as a legal seed, a legal heir, to inherit what God has promised to Abraham and what God has covenanted with Abraham.</P><P>Circumcision indicates that God wants our natural man to be cut off. Then God wants us to be reborn by His grace in resurrection, typified by Isaac. Thus, Genesis 17 reveals Christ's crucifixion and resurrection. The crucifixion is to cut off the old man; the resurrection is to bring forth, or to beget, the new man, and the new man is signified by Isaac.</P><P>The birth of Isaac is a sign of Christ's resurrection. God would recognize only the people brought forth by Christ's resurrection as the legal seed of Abraham (Gal. 3:29). In Genesis 17 Christ's crucifixion is signified by circumcision, and Christ's resurrection is signified by Sarah begetting Isaac. First Peter 1:3 says that we all have been regenerated by the resurrection of Christ. Christ's crucifixion is a termination, and His resurrection is a germination. Christ's death terminated our old man, and Christ's resurrection germinated our new man to make us the new creation.</P><P>Isaac was born of the free woman, born of grace. He was a pattern of the New Testament believers. We, the New Testament believers, are all born of the free woman, the grace of God. Thus, Isaac as Abraham's seed typifies both Christ (Gal. 3:16) and all of the New Testament believers (v. 29). Christ is the Head and the believers are His Body. Isaac was not born by the flesh of the old man but by God's grace in resurrection.</P><P>In Genesis 17:1 God appeared to Abraham and declared to him that He is the God of all-sufficiency. Most of the versions translate this as "the Almighty God," but the Hebrew word here indicates all-sufficiency. Genesis 17 actually covers the new covenant, the new testament. God's economy in the New Testament is all-sufficient. In the New Testament we have everything. We have the death of Christ to cut off our old man, and we have the new birth through Christ's resurrection. Through Christ's death and resurrection, we have everything in the New Testament. Philippians 1:19 indicates that the Spirit of Jesus Christ has a bountiful supply that is all-sufficient.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XI. THE GOD WITH HIS HUMAN FRIENDSHIP</H2><P>From this point God acted as a friend to Abraham. God with His human friendship came (in His fourth appearing with His eighth speaking to Abraham) as a man, in the form of a man, to visit Abraham as His friend (2 Chron. 20:7; Isa. 41:8; James 2:23) on the level of humanity (Gen. 18&#151;19).</P><P>The first time God visited man was when He visited Adam. Adam became fallen and God came to seek him. God asked Adam, "Where are you?" (Gen. 3:9). With Abraham, God's visit was different. He came to visit Abraham as His friend on the level of humanity, not on the level of divinity. God did not appear to Abraham as a divine being but as a human being. As a man God came to talk to Abraham, and Abraham gave Him water for Him to wash His feet. Abraham also served this One a meal prepared by his wife. This is all on the human level.</P><P>God's appearing to Moses was different from this because it was on the level of divinity. In Isaiah 6 God appeared to Isaiah as the One on the throne in the heavens. That was also His appearing on the level of divinity. But here in Genesis 18 the appearing of God was on the level of humanity. Abraham walked with God, and God conversed with Abraham as one human friend to another. I believe that Abraham's walking with God was different from Enoch's walking with God (Gen. 5:24). I do not believe that Enoch walked with God as with a man. But Abraham walked with God as with a man, and God conversed with Abraham as a human friend. He spoke to Abraham concerning His judgment of Sodom, where Abraham's nephew Lot and his family lived. God came to His friend to rescue His friend's nephew. Again, we can see God's hidden care, His secret care, for Lot as one of His elect.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XII. THE GOD WITH FRIENDSHIP IN HUMANITY</H2><P>The God with friendship in humanity is revealed in His sending of Abraham's nephew and his two daughters out from the overthrow of Sodom, for the remembrance of Abraham as His intimate friend (Gen. 19:29, 12-22). The God of Abraham is a God of human friendship, and Abraham's God is our God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIII. THE ALMIGHTY GOD</H2><P>Genesis 20 shows us the almighty God with His friendly care, in saving His close friend Abraham, with His almighty power, from the loss of his wife to Abimelech, king of Gerar. God caused that king's family to lose the capacity to beget children (vv. 17-18). That was God's exercise of His almighty power. Then God told that king that Abraham would pray for him. Abraham later prayed for him, and the women of his house were healed. God exercised a friendly care for Abraham by His almighty power.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIV. THE GOD OF CHANGELESSNESS</H2><P>God is also the God of changelessness in keeping the principle of His grace, in recognizing Isaac, Abraham's son of Sarah, as his only son, in His ninth speaking to Abraham (Gen. 21:1-12). The God of Abraham is the God of changelessness in keeping His word, His promise.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XV. THE GOD WITH HIS TRIAL</H2><P>Genesis 22:1-10 reveals the God with His trial, in proving Abraham, His intimate human friend, by asking him to present his only son, whom he loved, for a burnt offering to God, in His tenth speaking to Abraham.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVI. THE TRIUNE GOD OF PROVISION</H2><P>Genesis 22:11-14 reveals the Triune God of provision, in His providing a ram to replace Isaac for a burnt offering to God (as the Angel of Jehovah&#151;Christ). This was God's eleventh speaking to Abraham. The One who spoke to Abraham was Jehovah, yet this was the Angel of Jehovah. Therefore, in Genesis 22 we see Christ in two aspects. Christ is typified as a ram and is seen as the Angel of Jehovah. The ram is the substitute for sinners, and the Angel of Jehovah is the One who serves Jehovah in taking care of God's friend.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVII. THE TRIUNE GOD OF BLESSING</H2><P>The Triune God of blessing, in His twelfth (last) speaking to Abraham, promised him that He (as the Angel of Jehovah&#151;Christ) would bless him and multiply his seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand upon the seashore, and in Abraham's seed (Christ) all the nations of the earth would be blessed (Gen. 22:15-18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVIII. THE GOD OF FRIENDSHIP ON THE HUMAN LEVEL</H2><P>The God of Abraham is seen as the God of friendship on the human level, in leading the old servant of His friend Abraham to secure a wife for his son Isaac (Gen. 24). Though this was not directly motivated by God, it was carried out by God. Abraham charged his old servant to find Isaac a wife, and his old servant did it by following God's leading.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIX. THE GOD FOR THE ETERNAL ECONOMY</H2><P>As a whole, the God of Abraham is the God of speaking in appearing, with calling, in a vision, and in the human friendship, to unveil to His intimate friend on the earth what He aspired for him to be and what He wanted him to do according to His heart's desire for the accomplishment of the eternal economy for the Divine Trinity. What God did was in His friendship with a human friend, but this was for the accomplishment of God's economy. This is because God wanted this friend to have a seed and that seed is Christ, who is the centrality and universality of God's eternal economy. Thus, in the life of Abraham we see the beginning, the foundation, of the accomplishment of God's eternal economy. For the accomplishment of His economy, God dealt with Abraham in the way of human friendship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XX. THE GOD OF THE NEW TESTAMENT BELIEVERS<br>AND THE GOD OF JESUS CHRIST</H2><P>The way God worked on Abraham is the way He works on the believers in the New Testament. The first one justified by faith was Abraham (Gen. 15:6). Paul said that Abraham is the father of all those who are justified by faith, so Abraham is the father of all the New Testament believers (Gal. 3:6-7). Our father's God should be our God.</P><P>On the morning of His resurrection the Lord Jesus told His disciples that He was ascending to His Father and our Father and to His God and our God (John 20:17). Thus, the God of Abraham and the God of Jesus Christ (Eph. 1:17a) both are the God of the New Testament believers. In the relationship between God and us, the Bible puts us on the same standing not only as Abraham but also as Jesus Christ. O, what a wonder! Since we are the sons of Abraham in Christ (Gal. 3:29), his God is our God, and since we are one with Christ (Gal. 3:27), His God is also our God. To explain this fully, the entire New Testament from Matthew 1 to Revelation 22 is needed.</P><P>The God of Abraham is the God of crucifixion, signified by circumcision, and the God of resurrection for the new birth of God's elect by God's grace. Hence, this God is the God of His New Testament with His New Testament blessing for His New Testament economy. Today we are enjoying the New Testament blessing in Christ. Faith in Christ brings us into the blessing that God promised to Abraham, which is the promise of the all-inclusive Spirit, who has the bountiful supply (Phil. 1:19), as the New Testament blessing (Gal. 3:9, 14). We can never forget that, as the seed of Abraham, we have his God as our God, in whom we participate for our divine enjoyment, nor can we disregard that, as the members of Christ, we have His God as our God, who is our eternal portion in His eternal life.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S HISTORY IN TIME<br>GEN. 1:1&#151;REV. 20:15</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(7)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>WORKING ON HIS ELECT<br>FROM ABRAHAM TO JOSEPH</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>WORKING ON ISAAC AND JACOB<br>WITH JOSEPH</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gen. 17:19;

In this message we want to see how God worked on Isaac and Jacob. Because the Bible considers Joseph as a part of Jacob, we want to see God's history in the life of Jacob with Joseph.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. WORKING ON ISAAC</H2><P>We should not forget that we are studying the history of God, not merely the history of man. Now that we have seen the history of God in Abraham, we want to see the history of God in Isaac.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Raising Him as the Unique Heir to Abraham</H2><P>God raised Isaac as the unique heir to Abraham to inherit God's promise to Abraham and God's covenant with Abraham (Gen. 17:19; 21:10-12; 26:3-4). Some consider that Isaac was a good person, a meek person, and a person of prosperity. This is a superficial understanding. Actually, he was raised up to inherit the promise God gave to his father and the covenant God made with his father. God's promise and God's covenant are two great things inherited by Isaac.</P><P>Paul said that the unbelieving Gentiles were strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no participation in God's promise (Eph. 2:12). Today, however, in Christ we inherit all of God's promises and God's covenant. God's covenant with Abraham eventually became a new covenant promised to the people of Israel in Jeremiah 31:31-34, and that covenant was fulfilled when the Lord Jesus enacted it at His table (Matt. 26:26-30). Therefore, the real covenant of God to His elect actually is only one, and that one covenant is altogether concerning Christ. Christ is the centrality and universality of God's covenant with His elect, and this covenant is the new covenant, the new testament.</P><P>Today we are destined by God to inherit His promise and His covenant. His promise is a precursor of His covenant, and His covenant is with Christ as the reality. What we inherit is Christ Himself. Isaac's inheriting God's promise to Abraham and God's covenant with Abraham means that he inherited Christ. This is a part of God's history.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Making Him a Type of Christ<br>as the Son of Abraham</H2><P>God's working on Isaac made him a type of Christ as the son of Abraham. Matthew 1:1 says that Christ is the son of David and the son of Abraham. God promised Abraham that the whole earth would be blessed in his seed. Then Paul said in Galatians 3 that this seed of Abraham, not many seeds, is Christ (v. 16). Therefore, Isaac was a person who is a type of Christ as the son of Abraham, the one who inherits the promise and blessing God gave to Abraham (Gen. 22:17-18; Gal. 3:16, 14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. As the Only Begotten Son of the Father</H2><P>Isaac was also a type of Christ as the only begotten Son of the Father (John 1:14b; 3:16a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Given by the Father All That the Father Has</H2><P>Isaac is a type of Christ as the One who was given by the Father all that the Father has (Gen. 25:5; John 3:35; 13:3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Offered to God for God's Satisfaction<br>and Resurrected from the Dead</H2><P>Isaac as a type of Christ obeyed his father even unto death and was resurrected from death (Gen. 22:9-10; Heb. 11:19). In like manner, Christ was offered to God for God's satisfaction, obeyed His Father even unto death, and was resurrected from death. Isaac was put on the altar, and right at the time Abraham was about to kill him, God intervened, providing a ram as his substitute. This meant that Isaac was resurrected from death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Gaining the Gentile Church as His<br>Counterpart through the Holy Spirit</H2><P>God gained Rebekah to be Isaac's wife, his counterpart, through Abraham's old servant who typified the Holy Spirit as God's servant sent by God. Isaac took Rebekah, a Gentile woman, as his wife (Gen. 24). This was a type of Christ taking the church as His bride out of the Gentiles. He is gaining the Gentile church as His counterpart through the Holy Spirit.</P><P>We can now see that Isaac is a type of Christ in four aspects: the unique only begotten Son, the Son who inherits all the Father has, the Son who was offered to be the burnt offering and resurrected, and the One who gains a corporate Rebekah for His counterpart through God's sending of the Holy Spirit to the Gentile world.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Putting Him under His Rich Blessing</H2><P>God raised Isaac as the unique heir of Abraham, God made him a type of Christ, and God also put him under His rich blessing (Gen. 25:11a; 26:24b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Given by His Father All That He Had</H2><P>Abraham, his father, gave all that he had to Isaac (25:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Given by God Two Sons as Twins</H2><P>Isaac was also given by God two sons as twins by the names of Esau and Jacob (25:21-26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. God Appearing to Him and Promising Him</H2><P>God also appeared to Isaac and promised to be with him and bless him, to give him and his seed the land, to establish the oath He swore unto Abraham his father, to multiply his seed as the stars of heaven, and to cause all the nations of the earth to be blessed in his seed (26:2-4). The whole life of Isaac was a life in which God was with him and in which God blessed him. God would multiply his seed as the stars of the heaven. The stars in the heaven cannot be touched by earthly things. We, the New Testament believers, are the stars in the heaven. Eventually, all the nations of the earth would be blessed in Isaac's seed, that is, in Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Prohibited by God from Going Down to Egypt</H2><P>Isaac was prohibited by God from going down to Egypt and was also protected secretly with his wife by God (26:2, 6-11). Egypt is a type of the world. Going down to the world is a big temptation to the believers. For Abraham's descendant to go down to Egypt signifies the believers in Christ going down to the world.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Having Waxed Great and<br>Having Grown More and More</H2><P>Isaac waxed great and grew more and more until he became very rich, having flocks, herds, and a great household. He became much mightier than others, and God made room for him that he might be fruitful in the land (26:12-22). The prosperity of Isaac was not for himself but for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. God Appearing to Him Again<br>and Promising Him</H2><P>God appeared to Isaac again and promised as the God of Abraham to be with him, to bless him, and to multiply his seed for the sake of His servant Abraham (26:24-25).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. God Making Him an Heir</H2><P>As a whole, God made Isaac an heir to inherit all that his father had and blessed him all the way in peace and prosperity. Isaac was a person of inheritance and of a pleasant, enjoying life. The only trouble he experienced was due to his wife, but God protected him with his wife secretly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. WORKING ON JACOB WITH JOSEPH</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Having Loved and Chosen Him</H2><P>God loved Jacob and chose Jacob (Mal. 1:2b; Rom. 9:10-13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Raising Him as an Heir<br>to Abraham and to Isaac</H2><P>God raised Jacob as an heir to Abraham and to Isaac to inherit God's promise to them and God's covenant with them (Gen. 28:13-14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Having Destined Him<br>to Live a Struggling Life All His Days</H2><P>God destined Jacob to live a struggling life all his days. His life was absolutely different from the life of Isaac. Isaac's life had no struggle, just enjoyment. But Jacob's life was full of troubles.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Struggling from His Mother's Womb<br>to Be the Firstborn</H2><P>Even from his mother's womb, he struggled to be the firstborn of the twins (25:22-26a). Even before he was brought forth in birth, he struggled with his brother. Jacob wanted to be the first.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Struggling to Receive<br>the Blessing of the Firstborn</H2><P>He also struggled to receive the blessing of the firstborn son through his deceiving according to his mother's device (27:1-29). Rebekah told Jacob to pretend that he was Esau so that he could receive his father's blessing. After Jacob stole his father's blessing from Esau, Esau purposed in his heart to kill Jacob. Thus, Rebekah told Jacob to flee to her brother Laban. Rebekah's device ushered Jacob into trouble. As a young man he was forced to leave his father's home to flee from his brother. Furthermore, his staying with Laban brought him much hardship.</P><P>Because of his deceiving, Jacob received Isaac's blessing, the blessing of the firstborn son. Isaac blessed Jacob by telling him that God would give him of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and new wine (v. 28). Peoples would serve him and nations would bow down to him. Jacob would be lord over his brethren, and his mother's sons would bow down to him (v. 29a). Then Isaac told Jacob, "Cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee" (v. 29b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Forced to Leave His Parents<br>and Go to His Uncle Laban</H2><P>Jacob struggled for the blessing of the firstborn son, and because of this, he had to suffer. He was forced by his brother's hatred and his mother's partial love and natural wisdom to leave his parents and go to his uncle Laban (27:41&#151;28:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Suffering Loneliness and Homelessness<br>in the Journey to His Uncle</H2><P>Jacob suffered loneliness and homelessness in the journey to his uncle (28:10-11). While he was on his journey, he had to sleep in the open air. No doubt, he was lonely and even fearful of being attacked by wild beasts or robbers. In that situation God appeared to him to comfort him (vv. 12-19).</P><P>God promised Jacob that He, as the God of Abraham his father and the God of Isaac, would give to him and his seed the land whereon he lay (v. 13). He also promised Jacob at Bethel that his seed would be multiplied as the dust of the earth, spreading to the west, east, north, and south. He told Jacob that all the families of the earth would be blessed in him and in his seed (v. 14). In Jacob's seed, Christ, the whole earth would be blessed. Finally, God promised Jacob that He would be with him, keep him wherever he went, bring him again into his father's land, and not leave him until He had done that of which He had spoken to him (v. 15).</P><P>Jacob's response to God's comforting promise was to vow a vow to God as his terms to this promise. Jacob made God's promise a kind of business transaction with terms. In his vow he said, "If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God: and this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee" (vv. 20-22). These were Jacob's terms. If Jehovah did not fulfill them, Jacob would not take Him as his God. This transaction was absolutely according to the nature of Jacob. He was born this way. Jacob is a full type of us. We are today's Jacobs.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Arriving at His Uncle Laban's Home<br>by Suffering a Long, Lonely Journey</H2><P>Jacob eventually arrived at his uncle Laban's home by suffering a long, lonely journey, indicated by his weeping to his cousin Rachel (29:1-14). When he reached his uncle's land, his uncle's daughter Rachel met him. He wept before her, indicating that his journey was very unpleasant. He surely suffered through his long journey to Laban's home.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Marrying Four Wives and Begetting Eleven Sons</H2><P>Eventually, Jacob married four wives and begot eleven sons by fourteen years of hard labor and much grinding under his wives (29:15&#151;30:24). Jacob wanted to marry Rachel, but Laban deceived him and gave him his older daughter, Leah. Then Laban said that if he wanted Rachel, he would have to serve with him seven more years. Rachel and Leah were competing with each other, so they gave their maids to Jacob to give them more children.</P><P>Jacob came to Laban as a young, single man, but he left Laban with four wives and eleven children. His wives and children caused him to be greatly burdened and troubled. We may think that this was because of Jacob's mistakes, but we should not forget that Jacob was loved by God. Surely he was in the hand of God. God allowed him to have four wives and eleven sons because God destined him to live a struggling life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Endeavoring to Become Rich<br>by Deceiving His Uncle Laban</H2><P>Jacob also endeavored to become rich by deceiving his uncle Laban with his subtle skill (30:25-43). On the one hand, Jacob deceived his uncle, but on the other hand, his uncle deceived him. Laban changed Jacob's wages ten times (31:7, 41). Actually, Laban was more subtle than Jacob, but Jacob was more benefited. When Jacob left Laban, he left with four wives, eleven sons, and many flocks and herds.</P><P>We will see in the next message that Jacob had to struggle to leave Laban. Laban pursued him and overtook him, and he had to face Laban (31:14-55). Eventually, he had to face his brother Esau (33:1-17). Before he faced Esau, he saw God face to face and even wrestled with God (32:24-32). He struggled with God, so God made him lame and changed his name to Israel, a prince of God.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S HISTORY IN TIME<br>GEN. 1:1&#151;REV. 20:15</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(8)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>WORKING ON HIS ELECT<br>FROM ABRAHAM TO JOSEPH</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(4)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>WORKING ON ISAAC AND JACOB<br>WITH JOSEPH</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gen. 32:24-32; 35:1-15; 47:7, 10-12, 27-31; 48:8-9, 15-16, 20; 49:28; 41:39-44, 55-57</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>Working on Jacob with Joseph:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="3">	<li>Having destined him to live a struggling life all his days:</li>		<ol class="decimal" start="8">		<li>To escape from his uncle Laban according to the indication of the complaint of Laban's sons and the attitude of Laban, and according to God's instruction&#151;31:1-21.</li>		<li>To face the trouble of Laban's pursuing and overtaking him while he was under the secret care and protection of God as the Angel of God&#151;Christ (31:10-13)&#151;31:22-55.</li>		<li>To face the trouble of his brother Esau's dealing with him&#151;32:1-23; 33:1-17.</li>		<li>To wrestle even with God, who changed his name from Jacob to Israel, indicating that God would transform him from a supplanter (Jacob) to a wrestler with God or a prince of God (Israel), and who made him limp&#151;32:24-32.</li>		<li>To face the trouble of the case of his daughter Dinah&#151;ch. 34.</li>		<li>To be purified with his family from the foreign gods and their ornaments which they loved, according to God's commandment, that they might serve God with an altar built at Bethel, where God changed his name from Jacob to Israel and promised him that:</li>				<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>He as the all-sufficient God would make him fruitful and multiplied; a nation and a company of nations would be of him, and kings would come out of his loins.</li>			<li>He would give to him and his seed the land He gave to Abraham and Isaac&#151;35:1-15.</li>			</ol>		<li>To take care of the burial of Deborah, his mother Rebekah's nurse, without seeing his mother&#151;35:8.</li>		<li>To suffer the death of Rachel at the birth of Benoni (the son of my sorrow, named by Rachel while dying at his birth), Benjamin (the son of the right hand, named by Jacob the father)&#151;35:16-20.</li>		<li>To suffer his son Reuben's incest with his concubine Bilhah&#151;35:22.</li>		<li>To suffer the loss of his beloved son Joseph&#151;ch. 37.</li>		<li>To suffer the danger of losing his son Simeon and his youngest son Benjamin&#151;42:18&#151;43:15; 44:9-34.</li>		</ol>	<li>Releasing him from all his sufferings:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To see his beloved son Joseph again in his honor and glory&#151;45:1&#151;47:12.</li>		<li>To enjoy a rich and peaceful life with the worship to God at his old age&#151;47:11-12, 27-31.</li>		</ol>	<li>Causing him:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To be transformed from a supplanter (Jacob) to a prince of God (Israel)&#151;35:9-10.</li>		<li>To be matured to bless all people whom he contacted:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>To bless Pharaoh&#151;47:7, 10.</li>			<li>To bless Joseph with his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh&#151;ch. 48.</li>			<li>To bless all his twelve sons&#151;49:1-28.</li>			</ol>		</ol>	<li>Causing him, with Joseph:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To go through a long period of suffering&#151;37:4-36; 39:1-23; 40:12-15, 21-23; 41:9-37.</li>		<li>To be exalted as the sovereign ruler&#151;41:39-44:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>To rule over all of Egypt&#151;45:8b-9a.</li>			<li>To supply all the earth with food&#151;41:55-57; 42:5-6.</li>			</ol>		</ol>	</ol></ol><P>In the previous messages, we saw God's working on Abraham and Isaac, and we began to see His working on Jacob with Joseph. In order for us to understand the book of Genesis thoroughly, we have to know the life of Jacob even more than the life of Abraham. The experiences of Abraham are not as subjective as those of Jacob. The book of Genesis has fifty chapters, and the last twenty-six chapters speak of Jacob's life. Jacob's history begins in Genesis 25 and is wrapped up with two persons&#151;his father Isaac and his son Joseph. Jacob needed such a father and such a son to complete his life.</P><P>Genesis 25 shows us Jacob's birth and his gaining the birthright from Esau. Even from his mother's womb, Jacob was struggling to be the firstborn of the twins (vv. 22-26a). Genesis 27 shows us how Jacob struggled to receive the blessing of the firstborn son through his deceiving according to his mother Rebekah's device (vv. 1-29). Rebekah caused trouble for her husband and her two sons. Isaac, in a sense, lived a peaceful life, but in another sense, he did not because his second son was forced to leave him. From the time that Rebekah devised to send Jacob away to her brother Laban, she never saw Jacob again. This shows that if we exercise our natural, human wisdom and device, we will suffer.</P><P>We have seen that in God's working on Jacob, He loved Jacob and chose him before the foundation of the world (Mal. 1:2b; Rom. 9:10-13). It was the same with us. Ephesians 1:4 and 5 say that in eternity past before the foundation of the world God chose us and predestinated us. The phrase "in love" is in Ephesians 1:4. Just as He loved and chose Jacob, God chose us because of His love (1 Thes. 1:4).</P><P>Then God raised Jacob as an heir to Abraham and to Isaac (Gen. 28:13-14). God loved him, chose him, and ordained that he would be Abraham's and Isaac's heir. Jacob did not need to struggle to get the birthright, to be the heir, because God had already destined him for this. God was doing everything to raise Jacob up so that he could inherit God's promise to Abraham and Isaac and His covenant with them. Eventually, Jacob obtained the birthright, apparently because of his endeavoring. But we need to see that if God had not destined Jacob to receive the birthright, he could have never obtained it no matter how much he endeavored.</P><P>The history of Jacob is mostly a history of treachery, deceit, falsehood, and struggling. From the womb of his mother, he tried to come out first, but he did not make it. He was a person who was always deceiving, striving, and struggling with others. Through his cunning, he gained much cattle from his uncle Laban (30:31-43). Later, when he was about to confront the threatening situation with his brother Esau, he sent nine droves of cattle to him as a present (32:13-21). This present was actually a bribe. Jacob did not have a sincere, loving heart toward his brother. His present to Esau did not issue out of a heart of love but out of a heart of fear. Then as he was approaching Esau, Jacob put the handmaids and their children foremost, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph last (33:1-2). The ones whom he loved the most were kept at the rear for their protection. This shows that he was still striving and struggling according to his self-effort.</P><P>God destined that Jacob should live a struggling life all his days. From his mother's womb to the end of his life, he was struggling. In the previous message we saw seven points concerning Jacob's life of struggling. First, he was destined from his mother's womb to struggle to be the firstborn of the twins (25:22-26a). Second, he struggled to receive the blessing of the firstborn son through his deceiving according to his mother's device (27:1-29). Third, he was forced by his brother's hatred and his mother's partial love and natural wisdom to leave his parents and go to his uncle Laban (27:41&#151;28:5). Fourth, he suffered loneliness and homelessness in the journey to his uncle (28:10-11). Fifth, he arrived at his uncle Laban's home by suffering a long, lonely journey, indicated by his weeping to his cousin Rachel (29:1-14). Sixth, he married four wives and begot eleven sons by fourteen years of hard labor and much grinding under his wives (29:15&#151;30:24). Seventh, he endeavored to become rich by deceiving his uncle Laban with his subtle skill (30:25-43). Now we want to see eleven more points in Jacob's life of struggling.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Escaping from His Uncle Laban</H2><P>Jacob escaped from his uncle Laban according to the indication of the complaint of Laban's sons and the attitude of Laban and according to God's instruction (31:1-21). Jacob stayed with Laban and worked for Laban for twenty years, and within this time Laban changed Jacob's wages ten times (v. 41). The first fourteen years of his labor were his service to Laban so that he could gain Leah and Rachel as his wives. Jacob loved Rachel and told Laban that he would serve him seven years for her. Laban agreed to this, but when these seven years were completed, Laban tricked him and gave him Leah. Then he told Jacob that he would give him Rachel for another seven years of his service. Jacob agreed and Laban then gave him his daughter Rachel (29:18-28). Jacob served Laban for a total of twenty years. Although Laban was so subtle and even changed Jacob's wages ten times, Jacob was eventually the winner. He came to Laban's house as a young bachelor, but he left Laban's house with four wives, eleven sons, and many herds of cattle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Facing the Trouble of Laban's<br>Pursuing and Overtaking Him</H2><P>Jacob faced the trouble of Laban's pursuing and overtaking him while he was under the secret care and protection of God as the Angel of God&#151;Christ (31:10-13, 22-55). Laban was not an easygoing person. Jacob with his four wives did not say goodbye to him when they left. They stole away and fled from Laban (v. 20). When Laban realized this, he took his men to pursue them and he eventually overtook them. Laban rebuked Jacob, but Jacob in turn rebuked Laban more strongly. That subdued Laban (vv. 25-44). Eventually, he and Laban made a covenant of peace with each other. Then Laban kissed his daughters and grandchildren, blessed them, and returned to his place (v. 55). This account is a good example of human diplomacy.</P><P>Actually, though, Jacob faced the trouble from Laban while he was under the secret care of God as the Angel of God&#151;Christ. The first time we see Christ as the Angel of Jehovah to serve God's people is in the book of Exodus. Exodus 3:2 says that the Angel of Jehovah appeared to Moses in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. Exodus 14 shows that when Pharaoh's army came to overtake Israel, Christ as the Angel of Jehovah was going before them and was also taking care of them from behind to protect them (v. 19). Jacob was under the secret care of Christ as the Angel of Jehovah.</P><P>After Laban departed from Jacob, Genesis 32:1 and 2 say that "Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim." Mahanaim means two hosts, two camps, two armies. As Jacob was on his way, he was probably thinking about how he would face Esau. Much to his surprise, two hosts of the angels of God met him, indicating that they would protect him. Afterward, Jacob divided his family into two camps, two armies (v. 7). Jacob was under God's protection because his preservation was vital to God's New Testament economy. Out of Jacob eventually came Mary, of whom Christ was born (Matt. 1:2, 16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. Facing the Trouble of Esau's Dealing with Him</H2><P>After dealing with the trouble from his uncle, Jacob had to face the trouble of his brother Esau's dealing with him (Gen. 32:1-23; 33:1-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. Wrestling with God</H2><P>The night before Jacob confronted Esau, he wrestled with God until the break of day, and God changed his name from Jacob to Israel, indicating that God would transform him from a supplanter (Jacob) to a wrestler with God or a prince of God (Israel). Jacob was such a strong wrestler that he even overcame God. Eventually, however, while Jacob was wrestling with God, God touched his thigh and made him limp (32:24-32). From that time Jacob became a lame person (v. 31).</P><P>We need to realize that although Jacob was touched by God, he was not yet a transformed person. After his being touched by God in chapter thirty-two, we see in chapter thirty-seven that Jacob still loved his son Joseph, the son of his beloved wife Rachel, more than his other sons. Because of Jacob's preferential love, his other sons hated Joseph (vv. 3-4). This proves that Jacob was not transformed but still living in the natural life. When God changed his name to Israel, this indicated that God would eventually transform him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. Facing the Trouble of His Daughter Dinah</H2><P>In Genesis 34 Jacob had to face the trouble of the case of his daughter Dinah. The Lord used the circumstance with her to deal with Jacob in a further way. Jacob had twelve sons and one daughter. He experienced trouble with each of his children. This was because God had destined him to live a struggling life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>13. Being Purified and Returning to Bethel</H2><P>After the trouble related to the situation with his daughter Dinah, the Lord charged Jacob to go back to Bethel. Jacob and his family were then purified from the foreign gods and their ornaments which they loved, according to God's commandment, that they might serve God with an altar built at Bethel (35:1-3). When God appeared to Jacob at Bethel in Genesis 28, Jacob made a deal with God (vv. 20-22). Now God was reminding Jacob to fulfill his terms to God's promise.</P><P>After Jacob and his family purified themselves from their foreign gods and ornaments, they returned to Bethel to serve God with an altar. Bethel was the place where God changed Jacob's name to Israel. At Bethel God promised Jacob that He as the all-sufficient God would make him fruitful and multiplied, that a nation and a company of nations would be of him, and that kings would come out of his loins. God also promised that He would give to him and his seed the land He gave to Abraham and Isaac (35:1-15). This was the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham and to Isaac. Eventually, that unique promise became a threefold promise to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>14. Taking Care of the Burial of Deborah</H2><P>Jacob had to take care of the burial of Deborah, his mother Rebekah's nurse, without seeing his mother (35:8). God did not allow Jacob to see his mother, but he had to take care of the funeral of his mother's nurse. This, no doubt, was a suffering to him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>15. Suffering the Death of Rachel</H2><P>Jacob later had to suffer the death of Rachel (35:16-20). Rachel was the wife of his choice, the one whom he loved the most. She died while she was delivering Benjamin. While she was dying, she called his name Benoni, which means the son of my sorrow. But Jacob immediately called him Benjamin, which means the son of the right hand. This became a prophecy in typology. Christ in His incarnation, on the one hand, was the Son of sorrows from His birth through His human life on the earth (Isa. 53:3). Then through His resurrection and in His ascension, He became the Son of the right hand of God. Thus, "from Benoni to Benjamin" is the story of Christ accomplishing His redemption from His incarnation through His ascension. Benjamin represents God's accomplishment of His complete redemption through Christ, first as a Man of sorrows and second as the One at the right hand of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>16. Suffering His Son Reuben's Incest<br>with His Concubine Bilhah</H2><P>Jacob had to suffer his son Reuben's incest with his concubine Bilhah (Gen. 35:22). What a shameful thing this was for Jacob! Because of Reuben's defilement, he lost the birthright, which was then given to the sons of Joseph (49:3-4; 1 Chron. 5:1-2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>17. Suffering the Loss of His Beloved Son Joseph</H2><P>Genesis 37 speaks of Jacob's suffering the loss of his beloved son Joseph. Jacob's sons conspired to do away with Joseph, and then they lied to Jacob about what had happened. For many years Joseph was separated from Jacob, who thought that he had died.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>18. Suffering the Danger<br>of Losing Simeon and Benjamin</H2><P>Because of the famine in the land, Jacob was forced to send his sons to Egypt to buy grain. As a result, he had to suffer the danger of losing his son Simeon and his youngest son Benjamin (42:18&#151;43:15; 44:9-34). When Jacob's sons returned from Egypt with the grain, Jacob learned that Simeon had been detained there (42:24), and he also learned the sad news that Benjamin had to go to Egypt. After he heard this, he said, "Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me" (v. 36). Although Reuben promised to bring Benjamin back, Jacob did not listen to him. Rather he said, "My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave" (v. 38). Eventually, due to the severity of the famine, Jacob was forced to send his youngest son with his brothers to Egypt to buy grain (42:4, 36; 43:1-15). What a suffering this was to Jacob!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Releasing Him from All His Sufferings</H2><P>Eventually, near the end of his life, Jacob was released from all his sufferings to see his beloved son Joseph again in his honor and glory (45:1&#151;47:12) and to enjoy a rich and peaceful life with the worship of God at his old age (47:11-12, 27-31).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. God's Causing Him<br>to Be Transformed and Matured</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Being Transformed from a Supplanter<br>to a Prince of God</H2><P>God caused Jacob to be transformed from a supplanter, Jacob, to a prince of God, Israel (35:9-10). The Hebrew word for Israel can bear two meanings&#151;a wrestler with God and a prince of God. In chapter thirty-two Jacob was surely a wrestler with God. But from this time to the end of Malachi, the name Israel bears the meaning of a prince of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Being Matured to Bless<br>All People Whom He Contacted</H2><P>Jacob was eventually matured to bless all people whom he contacted. At the end of his life, Jacob's job, his profession, was to bless. He blessed Pharaoh (47:7, 10), he blessed Joseph with his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh (ch. 48), and he blessed all his twelve sons (49:1-28). According to Hebrews 7:7, the lesser is blessed by the greater. Thus, Jacob's blessing of Pharaoh indicates that he was greater than Pharaoh. Even Pharaoh the king of Egypt was under him and under his blessing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Causing Him, with Joseph,<br>to Go through a Long Period of Suffering<br>and to Be Exalted as the Sovereign Ruler</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Going through a Long Period of Suffering</H2><P>God caused Jacob, with Joseph, to go through a long period of suffering (37:4-36; 39:1-23; 40:12-15, 21-23; 41:9-37). Joseph was actually a part of Jacob. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are a sign of the Triune God. God the Father was expressed in Abraham, God the Son was expressed in Isaac, and God the Spirit was expressed in Jacob. In other words, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph should be considered as one saint of God. This is why the Bible tells us that God is the God of only these three persons: the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Thus, Joseph should be considered only as a part of Jacob.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Being Exalted as the Sovereign Ruler</H2><P>Eventually, God caused Jacob with Joseph to be exalted as the sovereign ruler (41:39-44) in order to rule over all of Egypt (45:8b-9a) and supply all the earth with food (41:55-57; 42:5-6). Apparently, this was done by Joseph. Actually, however, what Joseph did was a part of Jacob's life.

In Exodus 3:15 this divine title was spoken by God Himself when He told Moses, "Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations" (cf. vv. 6, 16; Matt. 22:31-32).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. JEHOVAH ELOHIM</H2><P>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is Jehovah Elohim (Gen. 2:4-22; Exo. 3:15). Genesis 1 uses only the title Elohim for God, not Jehovah. In Genesis 2 God's title became Jehovah Elohim. Elohim means the faithful mighty One. God is faithful and mighty. Jehovah means He who was, who is, and who is to be. Genesis 2:4-22 repeatedly mentions Jehovah Elohim, a divine title indicating God's relationship with His elect.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Self-existing and<br>Ever-existing Triune God</H2><P>Jehovah as the great I Am is the self-existing and ever-existing Triune God (Exo. 3:13-14). He is self-existing, without beginning, and ever-existing, without ending. The beginning and ending in the whole universe is God. God is the beginning, the Alpha, and He is the ending, the Omega (Rev. 22:13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Triune God Who Was,<br>Who Is, and Who Is to Be</H2><P>Revelation 1:4 speaks of "Him who is and who was and who is coming." In the past He was; in the present He is; and in the future He is to be. From eternity to eternity Jehovah is the One who exists, so He is the One who was, who is, and who is to be.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Great Eternal I Am,<br>the I Am That I Am</H2><P>Jehovah Elohim, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, is the great eternal I Am, the I Am That I Am (Exo. 3:14; John 8:24, 28, 58). As the I Am, He is eternal. In John 8 the Lord Jesus mentioned three times that He is the I Am. In John 8:24 He said, "Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins." In verse 28 He said, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am." Finally, in verse 58 He said, "Before Abraham came into being, I am." Strictly speaking, the English grammar in verse 58 is wrong. To keep the correct grammar, the Lord should have said, "Before Abraham came into being, I was," but the Greek text uses the present tense. Christ is the great I Am who, as the eternal, ever-existing God, was before Abraham. He is the eternal I Am, the I Am That I Am.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Complete Triune God of the Three Sections<br>of the Life of a Corporate Person</H2><P>The book of Genesis reveals the complete Triune God of the three sections of the life of a corporate person. Genesis does not consider Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as three separate persons but as one complete corporate person with three sections.</P><P>Our God is the God of three particular persons&#151;the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. In the final chapters of Genesis, another person is mentioned by the name of Joseph. Among the elect of God, four persons are covered in Genesis&#151;Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, but the Bible does not consider Joseph as a separate person. His life was actually the continuation and consummation of Jacob's life. Jehovah is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God the Father Loving Man and<br>Choosing Man, in the Section of Jacob</H2><P>We see God the Father loving man and choosing man in the section of Jacob (Mal. 1:2; Rom. 9:10-13). Jacob is the last of the three, yet he is used by God to signify the Father in His loving and choosing man. Malachi 1:2 says that God loved Jacob, and Romans 9:10-13 says that God selected Jacob, choosing him even before he was born.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God the Father Calling Man, Justifying Man, and Equipping Man to Live by Faith and Live in Fellowship with Him, in the Section of Abraham</H2><P>In the section of Abraham, we see God the Father who calls man, justifies man, and equips man to live by faith and live in fellowship with Him (Gen. 12:1; 15:6; ch. 17; ch. 18; 19:29; 21:1-13; 22:1-18). Genesis 12:1 shows us the Father's calling and 15:6 reveals His justification. Chapter seventeen shows us how God equipped Abraham to live a life by faith. Then chapter eighteen reveals how God made Abraham to live a life in fellowship with Him. It is a chapter of fellowship between God and His human friend, Abraham.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. God the Son Blessing Man with<br>the Inheritance of All His Riches, with a Life<br>of the Enjoyment of His Abundance, and<br>with a Life in Peace, in the Section of Isaac</H2><P>The section of Isaac represents God the Son, the Second of the Triune God, who blesses man with the inheritance of all His riches, with a life of the enjoyment of His abundance, and with a life in peace (Gen. 25:5; 26:3-4, 12-33).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. God the Spirit Working in All Things<br>for the Good of His Lovers, Transforming<br>Man, and Making Man Mature in the Divine Life<br>That Man May Be Able to Bless All the People,<br>to Rule over All the Earth, and to Satisfy All<br>the People with God the Son as the Life Supply,<br>in the Section of Jacob with Joseph</H2><P>In the section of the life of Jacob with Joseph, we see God the Spirit who works in all things for the good of His lovers. This is based upon Romans 8:28, which says, "All things work together for good to those who love God." According to the context of this verse, the good here is not related to physical persons, matters, or things. It refers to our gaining more of Christ, to our having Him wrought into our being, that we may be transformed metabolically and may eventually be conformed to His image, the image of the firstborn Son of God (v. 29), that is, that we may be brought into the full sonship.</P><P>Romans 8:28 says that all things work together for our good, but we need to see that it is actually the Spirit who works in all things. In the church in Shanghai many years ago, I gave an illustration of how the Spirit works in all things for our good. This illustration was concerning a sister who loved her long gowns much more than she loved God. One day she dressed herself with the best long gown, but right after she went out the door, a dog came by, splattered mud on her gown, and the gown was spoiled. The dog surely did not know the time that she was coming out with the best long gown, but the Spirit knew. The Spirit can direct anything in our environment and work in all persons, all matters, and all things to cause them to work together for good to us that we may be transformed and conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God.</P><P>Brother Watchman Nee called this the discipline of the Spirit (see chapter fifteen of Watchman Nee: A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age, pp. 115-116). We are daily passing through the discipline of the Spirit. All persons and situations related to us are being arranged by the Spirit of God to match His work within us that we may be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God. The Spirit as the Third of the Divine Trinity works in all things for the good of His lovers. The sister with the long gown loved God, but she loved her long gowns more than God. Thus, the Spirit worked in her environment to discipline her that she might be transformed and matured.</P><P>In the life of Jacob with Joseph, we see that the Spirit transforms man and makes man mature in the divine life that man may be able to bless all the people, to rule over all the earth, and to satisfy all the people with God the Son as the life supply (Gen. 27:41; 28:1&#151;35:10; chs. 37, 39&#151;49; Rom. 8:28-29). Without Joseph, the life of Jacob could have never been completed. The life of Joseph was the completion of the life of his father. It was in his old age that Jacob blessed all the people, and his old age was at the time when his son Joseph was ruling in power. Jacob lived in such a way in his old age because of his son Joseph. Whatever Jacob did and whatever Jacob was in his old age were fully due to his son Joseph. Jacob with Joseph blessed all the people, ruled over all the earth, and supplied the whole earth with food. This is in typology. In actuality this refers to God in Christ. God in Christ is the food supply to all the earth. Joseph distributed this food supply, but Joseph was the reality of his father. Thus, Jacob did this with Joseph. The end of Jacob's life with Joseph shows us the maturity in the divine life through the working of God the Spirit.</P><P>In the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as a corporate person, we can see someone who was loved, chosen, called, and justified by God and made to enjoy all the riches of Christ. Also this one was destined to live a struggling life, a suffering life. Lastly, through all these sufferings this one was transformed by the Spirit and matured in the divine life. When he was old, he knew only to bless people, to reign for God, and to distribute God as the life supply.</P><P>Every day we are suffering ones and enjoying ones. On the one hand, we are enjoying Christ. On the other hand, we are experiencing sufferings. Christ is ministering all His riches to us, whereas the Spirit is always working in all things to discipline us. If we do not behave in the Spirit, the things we have can become instruments used by the Spirit to deal with us. If a brother has many suits and loves these suits more than he loves God, these suits can be used by the Spirit to trouble him. In a physical sense, it is more convenient for a brother to have a number of suits so that he can dress appropriately. But if he does not behave in the Spirit, these suits can become more instruments used by the Spirit to deal with him. Whatever we have can be used by the Spirit to trouble us. This works together for our good, the good of being conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God.</P><P>The many things which Jacob had were used to trouble him. Jacob had four wives, and these wives became a suffering to him. The married brothers know that even to have one wife is sufficient for being troubled by the Spirit. The Spirit uses the wives to trouble the brothers for their transformation. All persons, all matters, and all things related to us are the means of the Holy Spirit to work good for us so that we can be "loaded with good" (Psa. 68:19a), with the Triune God Himself. This is the way the Holy Spirit transforms us, and this is the way we can become mature in the divine life. Eventually, through the transforming work of the Spirit to make us mature, we will be those who bless others. Today God uses all persons, things, and matters to trouble us so that we can become mature in the divine life to bless all the people.</P><P>Eventually, we will not be those who are complaining and condemning others. We will know only how to stretch out our hands to bless others as Jacob did in his old age (Gen. 47:7, 10; ch. 48; 49:1-28). When Jacob became old, his unique job was to bless people. Blessing people was his profession. When you can bless people, surely you have the scepter, the authority, to rule. Then when you can rule, you will be able to distribute all the riches of God as the food supply to others. In Jacob's old age, we see the maturity of one of God's elect. The book of Genesis selected three persons to be one complete person with three sections to reveal the complete Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE TRIUNE GOD'S PREPARATION FOR<br>THE CARRYING OUT OF HIS ETERNAL ECONOMY</H2><P>The entire Old Testament was the Triune God's preparation for the carrying out of His eternal economy. We may wonder why there are so many stories and events recorded in the Old Testament. The events in the life of Jacob are very peculiar. He and his twin brother Esau were struggling with each other even within their mother's womb (Gen. 25:22-23). Then Jacob struggled with his brother to come out of the womb as the first, and he was holding his brother's heel at birth (vv. 24-26). Later, he bought the birthright from his brother for a bowl of soup (vv. 27-34). Then he cheated his father to obtain the blessing of the firstborn son (ch. 27). Because of the threatening of Esau, he was forced to leave his father, his loving mother, his home, and his country. Then as he traveled to his uncle Laban's house, he was forced to sleep in the open air.</P><P>When he arrived at his uncle Laban's home, his cousin Rachel met him and he wept due to his long, lonely journey (29:1-14). He had to serve under an uncle who was always trying to deceive him. Laban promised Jacob that if he would serve him for seven years, he would give him his daughter Rachel. But when his seven years were completed, he gave Jacob his daughter Leah. He made Jacob agree to serve another seven years so that he could marry Rachel. Eventually, Jacob took the handmaids of Leah and Rachel as his wives. He married four wives and begot eleven sons by fourteen years of hard labor and much grinding under his wives (29:15&#151;30:24). Laban was subtle, but Jacob was even more subtle. Jacob eventually became rich by deceiving his uncle Laban with his subtle skill (30:25-43). Later, Jacob wrestled with God (32:24-32).</P><P>Many things related to the life of Jacob are very strange. When we read the strange occurrences in the life of Jacob, we may wonder why they are recorded in the holy Word. We need to realize that the life of Jacob was part of the Triune God's preparation for the carrying out of His eternal economy. Without all these things that happened in the Old Testament, Christ could never have been born; God could never have become flesh to be a man through His incarnation. The history in the entire Old Testament is God's preparation for the carrying out of His eternal economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Initiating It in a Man</H2><P>This preparation for the carrying out of God's eternal economy was initiated in a man (Adam&#151;Gen. 1:1&#151;11:26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Issuing in Three Persons</H2><P>This initiation eventually issued in three persons&#151;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Gen. 11:27&#151;50:26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Resulting in One People</H2><P>These three persons resulted in one people&#151;Israel (Exo.&#151;Mal.). In the Triune God's preparation for the carrying out of His eternal economy, there was first one man, then three persons, and finally a collective people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. To Bring Forth Christ, the God-man</H2><P>This preparation was for bringing forth Christ the God-man, the complete God mingled with the perfect man (Matt. 1). The thirty-nine books of the Old Testament are not books of waste. They are books which reveal the preparation to bring forth Christ the God-man. Matthew 1 speaks of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham (v. 1). Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers (v. 2). Eventually, Jesus who is called Christ was born of Mary, who was betrothed to Joseph (v. 16). The God-man was brought forth for the accomplishment of God's New Testament economy. The incarnation was the start of the New Testament, the first step of God's actual move on this earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. For the Producing of the Body of Christ</H2><P>The bringing forth of Christ was for the producing of the Body of Christ (Eph. 1&#151;4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. As the Organism of the Processed<br>and Consummated Triune God</H2><P>This Body of Christ is the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God (Eph. 3:17-19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Consummating in the New Jerusalem</H2><P>The Body of Christ as the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God will consummate in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:1-23). This consummation, the New Jerusalem, is the eternal enlargement (cf. John 3:30) of Christ the God-man. Then this enlargement is the eternal mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man and also the mutual dwelling of God and man. The redeemed will be the tabernacle for the dwelling of God (Rev. 21:3), and the redeeming God will be the temple for the dwelling of the redeemed (v. 22) to express the processed and consummated Triune God in His nature and glory (vv. 18b, 21b, 10-11, 23) in the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man for eternity (vv. 12-21a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE GOD OF THE TABERNACLE</H2><P>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is the God of the tabernacle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</H2><P>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob each lived in a tent (Gen. 12:8; 13:18; 18:1; 26:17, 25; 33:18; 35:21; Heb. 11:9). It is significant that the Bible does not say that Joseph lived in a tent. This shows that Joseph was a part of the life of Jacob. While Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were living in tents, they were eagerly waiting for the eternal tabernacle of God, the city of New Jerusalem (Heb. 11:10; Rev. 21:2-3). The tent in which they lived was a type of the New Jerusalem as the coming reality, the eternal tent. They were living in a type, eagerly waiting for the reality, the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Triune God Embodied in the Son Being<br>Incarnated to Be His Tabernacle on the Earth</H2><P>The Triune God embodied in the Son was incarnated to be His tabernacle on the earth. The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (John 1:14). That man was a tabernacle. He was God becoming a man, a God-man. By His incarnation He mingled God with man. This person as the mingling of God with man is God's tabernacle. By incarnation God eventually became our dwelling, making us His dwelling, a mutual abode of God and man.</P><P>The tabernacle of God was first the individual God-man Jesus (Matt. 1:21-23). The individual God-man Jesus as the tabernacle of God consummates in the corporate New Jerusalem. This corporate New Jerusalem will be the fulfillment of the Feast of Tabernacles in the millennium (Lev. 23:34, 39-43; Rev. 2:7b). The Feast of Tabernacles was the last feast of the year for the Israelites. In the millennium Christ will be the reality of that feast as the full enjoyment of the processed and consummated Triune God in eternity (Rev. 22:14, 19). Christ in eternity will be such a full enjoyment for us to enjoy God as our eternal portion.</P><P>In eternity future, the New Jerusalem will be the enlargement of Christ, the eternal mingling of God with man, and the mutual abode of God and man. Revelation 21 says that the New Jerusalem will be the tabernacle of God for God to dwell in and that God will be the temple for His elect to dwell in. Therefore, the upcoming New Jerusalem will be a mutual abode for the redeeming God and for His redeemed to express the processed Triune God mingled with the regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man. This is the ultimate consummation of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ELEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S HISTORY IN TIME<br>GEN. 1:1&#151;REV. 20:15</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(10)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>WORKING ON HIS ELECT<br>THROUGH MOSES</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>DELIVERING ISRAEL OUT OF EGYPT<br>AND<br>BRINGING THEM INTO THE WILDERNESS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Exo. 1:8-22; 3:8; 12:1-20; 15:22</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Coming down to deliver Israel out of Egypt&#151;Exo. 3:8:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Through Moses:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>From the Egyptian slavery and tyranny&#151;1:8-14, 15-22.</li>		<li>Dealing with Pharaoh and smiting Egypt with ten plagues:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>All waters becoming blood&#151;7:17-25.</li>			<li>Waters bringing forth frogs&#151;8:2-15.</li>			<li>Dust becoming lice&#151;8:16-19.</li>			<li>Swarms of flies&#151;8:20-24.</li>			<li>Pestilence upon all the cattle&#151;9:1-7.</li>			<li>Boils upon man and beast&#151;9:8-12.</li>			<li>Hail, mingled with fire, upon the land&#151;9:13-25.</li>			<li>Locusts devouring the land&#151;10:12-20.</li>			<li>Thick darkness over all the land&#151;10:21-24.</li>			<li>Killing of their firstborn sons&#151;11:4-6; 12:29-30.</li>			</ol>		</ol>	<li>Through the Passover&#151;12:1-20:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Redeeming them from the death-judgment by their striking the blood of the lamb&#151;vv. 7,  13.</li>		<li>Delivering them from the house of bondage (13:3, 14) by their eating the meat of the lamb with the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs&#151;12:8-11.</li>		</ol>	<li>Through the Angel of Jehovah (Christ) and the pillar of cloud and of fire (the glory of God) over Israel to protect them from the front to the rear of their army&#151;14:19-20.</li>	<li>Through God's mighty power to divide the Red Sea for Israel to go through and to close the sea over Pharaoh and his army to destroy them&#151;14:6-8, 21-31.</li>	</ol><li>Bringing them into the wilderness&#151;Exo. 3:18:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Israel fallen into Egypt&#151;the world of easy living and pleasure&#151;for four hundred years.</li>	<li>Predicted by God to Abraham&#151;Gen. 15:13-14.</li>	<li>Prohibited from serving God and suffering the affliction of the Egyptian tyranny&#151;Exo. 1:15-22; Heb. 11:23.</li>	<li>God bringing them into the wilderness&#151;Exo. 15:22:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Into a place outside the world, free from worldly occupations in anxiety of life, pleasures, persecution of religion, etc.</li>		<li>Through three days' journey&#151;through the resurrection of Christ.</li>		<li>To serve God with sacrifices&#151;Christ as the offerings.</li>		</ol>		</ol></ol><P>In the previous message, we saw the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The Triune God's preparation for the carrying out of His eternal economy was initiated in Adam and issued in three persons&#151;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. These three persons revealed in the book of Genesis resulted in one people, Israel. God's history with the people of Israel is covered from Exodus to Malachi.</P><P>Through God's preparation in the Old Testament with Israel, Christ was brought forth in the New Testament. Matthew 1 shows us the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham (v. 1). This genealogy is an abstract of the entire Old Testament. Five women are recorded in Christ's genealogy. These are Tamar (v. 3), Rahab, Ruth (v. 5), Bathsheba, who had been the wife of Uriah (v. 6), and Mary, of whom Christ was born (v. 16). Tamar committed incest with her father-in-law, Judah (Gen. 38:6-30). Rahab was a prostitute (Josh. 2:1). Ruth belonged to the tribe of Moab (Ruth 1:4), the fruit of Lot's incestuous union with his daughter (Gen. 19:30-38). Bathsheba committed adultery with David (2 Sam. 11:3, 26-27). Matthew 1:6 says that David begot Solomon "of her who had been the wife of Uriah." David murdered Uriah and robbed him of his wife, Bathsheba. Only one of the five women in Christ's genealogy was a chaste virgin&#151;Mary, a descendant of the chosen race. Of her, Christ was directly born (v. 16). Such a record in the genealogy of Christ indicates that Christ is the kingly Savior of typical sinners.</P><P>The genealogy of Jesus Christ in Matthew is a brief and accurate abstract of the entire Old Testament. If we want to know the details of the genealogy of Christ, we have to read the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament. I began to study this genealogy in 1925, and this study issued in my writing a book in 1936 entitled Gleanings of the Genealogy of Christ, published by Brother Watchman Nee's book room.</P><P>When we look at this genealogy with the view that the entire Old Testament was the Triune God's preparation for the carrying out of His eternal economy, we can see how consistent the Bible is. The entire Bible was written by over forty writers spanning about fifteen hundred years. Within such a long period of time, they wrote one book with one subject, with one center, and with one goal. Today by the Lord's mercy, the entire sixty-six books of the Bible have been opened up to us.</P><P>The issue of the history in the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament was the bringing forth of Christ, the God-man. Thus, the opening word of the New Testament reveals that Christ was brought forth as the issue of forty-two generations of people in the Old Testament. Christ being brought forth was for the producing of the Body of Christ as the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God. This organism will eventually consummate in the New Jerusalem, which is the eternal enlargement of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ was the tabernacle of God (John 1:14), and this tabernacle was a model, a prototype, which will eventually consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal tabernacle of God (Rev. 21:3).</P><P>The New Jerusalem will be the eternal mingling of the Triune God and the tripartite man. This mingling is indicated by the number twelve. In the New Jerusalem are the twelve foundations, inscribed with the names of the twelve apostles (v. 14); the twelve gates, which are the twelve pearls, inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes (v. 12); and the twelve fruits of the tree of life (22:2). With regard to space, the city proper is twelve thousand stadia, one thousand times twelve, in each of its three dimensions (21:16), and its wall is one hundred forty-four cubits, twelve times twelve, in height (v. 17). Twelve is three multiplied by four. Multiplication indicates mingling. The city is a square with four sides, and on each of the four sides are three gates. Three is the number of the Triune God, and four is the number of the creature, man. The Triune God signified by the three gates is mingled with man signified by the number four. Therefore, the number twelve signifies that God in His eternal administration is mingled with His creature, man.</P><P>The New Jerusalem will be the mutual dwelling of God and man. The redeemed of God will be the tabernacle for the dwelling of God (Rev. 21:3), and the redeeming God will be the temple for the dwelling of the redeemed (v. 22). This is for the expression of the processed and consummated Triune God in His nature and glory (vv. 18b, 21b, 10-11, 23) in the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man for eternity (vv. 12-21a). This is the consummation of the history of God in His union with man.</P><P>In the previous messages, we saw God's history in the book of Genesis. Now we want to go on in the book of Exodus to see God's working on His elect through Moses. In this message we want to see how God delivered Israel out of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.</P><P>Exodus shows us that God took a big step in His move by coming down to deliver Israel out of Egypt (Exo. 3:8) and bring them into the wilderness (v. 18). Egypt typifies the world where people are occupied with making a living and where people can enjoy a life with pleasures. The world is a place of easy living and pleasure and also a place of sin and idolatry. Today the entire world is the real Egypt, full of sin.</P><P>The children of Israel coming under Egyptian slavery and tyranny was foretold to Abraham by God in Genesis 15. God came to comfort and encourage Abraham, promising Abraham that He would give him a son (vv. 1-6), and then He made a covenant to confirm this promise (v. 18). God's speaking to us is in three stages. First, we have His word; His word becomes a promise; and then His promise becomes a covenant. The covenant confirms the promise. God spoke to Abraham in his deep sleep and a great darkness fell upon Abraham (v. 12), indicating that the history of his seed would not always be bright in that they would be under a dark time of tyranny and affliction under the Egyptians for four hundred years (vv. 13-14). In telling Abraham the future history of his descendants, God was confirming to him that he would surely have a son, an heir.</P><P>Eventually, after Joseph died, the book of Exodus says that a new Pharaoh rose up in Egypt who did not know Joseph (1:8). At that time the children of Israel began to come under the persecution, tyranny, and slavery of the Egyptians. Because of the increasing multiplication of the Israelites, Pharaoh charged the people to kill all the newborn males among the Israelites (vv. 15-16, 22). He also forced the Israelites to make bricks to build up his treasure cities (vv. 11-14). Exodus shows us the children of Israel suffering all kinds of afflictions under Egyptian slavery and tyranny.</P><P>Eventually, Moses was raised up by God for their deliverance. He became the adopted son of Pharaoh's daughter. He lived in the palace of Pharaoh, was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was powerful in his words and works (Acts 7:21-22). Then he spent forty years in the wilderness to be tested, to be perfected, by God. When Moses was eighty, God called him and said, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians" (Exo. 3:7-8). In order to rescue, to deliver, the Israelites out of the Egyptians' hand, God needed to come down. God came down first to the wilderness where Moses was in order to call him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. COMING DOWN TO DELIVER ISRAEL OUT OF EGYPT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Through Moses</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. From the Egyptian Slavery and Tyranny</H2><P>We have to remember that we are not merely studying the history of Israel but the history of God. God is the Deliverer who came down to deliver Israel out of the slavery and the tyranny of the Egyptians through Moses. Moses was the means of their deliverance from the Egyptian slavery and tyranny (1:8-14, 15-22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Dealing with Pharaoh and<br>Smiting Egypt with Ten Plagues</H2><P>Through Moses, God dealt with Pharaoh and smote Egypt with ten plagues. Pharaoh was considered as God by his people. He was the top king, and Egypt was the biggest and most powerful nation on the earth at that time. But God sent one person without any weapon in his hand to deal with this top king on earth.</P><P>Moses told Pharaoh, "Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness" (5:1). Because of Pharaoh's continued resistance and the hardening of his heart, God smote the land of Egypt with ten plagues to force Pharaoh to let the Israelites go. First, God caused all the waters in Egypt to become blood (7:17-25). The second plague was the waters bringing forth frogs (8:2-15). The third plague was the dust becoming lice (8:16-19). The fourth plague was swarms of flies throughout the land of Egypt (8:20-24). The fifth plague was a pestilence upon all the cattle throughout Egypt (9:1-7). The sixth plague was boils breaking out upon both man and beast (9:8-12). The seventh plague was hail, mingled with fire, upon the land (9:13-25). The eighth plague was locusts devouring the land (10:12-20). The ninth plague was thick darkness over all the land (10:21-24). The tenth and final plague was the killing of their firstborn sons (11:4-6; 12:29-30). Pharaoh surely would not let Israel go easily. The plague of the killing of all the firstborn sons caused Pharaoh to release the children of Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Through the Passover</H2><P>The Passover was for redeeming and delivering the children of Israel (12:1-20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Redeeming Them from the Death-judgment</H2><P>God redeemed them from the death-judgment by their striking the blood of the lamb (vv. 7, 13). God told them to slay a lamb and strike the blood upon the lintel and the posts of the door. He said, "For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast...And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt" (vv. 12-13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Delivering Them from the House of Bondage</H2><P>God delivered the children of Israel from the house of bondage (13:3, 14) by their eating the meat of the lamb with the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs (12:8-11). The blood of the lamb was for redeeming the children of Israel out of God's death-judgment, and the meat of the lamb was for strengthening Israel to get out of Egypt. They also had to eat unleavened bread, indicating that from that day they should not live in sin, that is, should not live a sinful life. They also had to eat the lamb with bitter herbs, indicating that they should experience a bitter taste regarding sinful things. The bitter herbs were a reminder of the bitter taste of the sinful things of Egypt.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Through the Angel of Jehovah (Christ) and<br>the Pillar of Cloud and of Fire (the Glory of God)</H2><P>God came down to deliver Israel out of Egypt through Moses and through the Passover. He also delivered them through the Angel of Jehovah (Christ) and the pillar of cloud and of fire (the glory of God) over Israel to protect them from the front to the rear of their army (14:19-20). The glory of God always goes together with Christ. Where Christ is, there is the glory of God, and where the glory of God is, there is Christ as the Angel of Jehovah to serve God's people.</P><P>After Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt, Pharaoh and his army pursued them. The Red Sea was in front of them and Pharaoh and his armies were behind them. They had no way out. Christ as the Angel of Jehovah was in front of the children of Israel, facing the sea. But at the rear the Egyptian army was coming, so Christ turned from the front to the rear. The glory of God followed Christ from the front of the army of Israel to the rear to protect them. That glory, which was the pillar of cloud in the day becoming the pillar of fire in the night, became a wall to separate Israel's army from the Egyptian army. Christ with God's glory became a great protection to the children of Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Through God's Mighty Power<br>to Divide the Red Sea for Israel</H2><P>God delivered Israel out of Egypt through His mighty power by dividing the Red Sea for Israel to go through and by closing the Red Sea over Pharaoh and his army to destroy them (14:6-8, 21-31). Exodus 14:22 says, "And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left." When Israel got over to the other side of the sea, God's power closed the sea over Pharaoh and his armies. Through this miracle by God's mighty power, God delivered Israel out of Egypt.</P><P>We can see the manifestation of God's power in His working to deliver Israel out of Egypt and bring them into the wilderness. God gave His orders to the frogs, the lice, the flies, and the locusts to plague Egypt. These all became His armies. The flies and locusts were like the air force, the frogs were like the navy, and the lice from the dust were like the army. God sent three forces of His military power, and the Egyptians had no way to do anything against them.</P><P>Furthermore, the three of the Divine Trinity were working for Israel's deliverance. The "I Am" who sent Moses to Pharaoh was the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (3:6, 14). The Angel of God was Christ, and the pillar of cloud and of fire was the Spirit. God the Spirit is God's glory.</P><P>God brought Israel out of Egypt through their observance of the Passover. The children of Israel had to kill a lamb, to strike the blood, and to eat the meat of the lamb in haste with their loins girded, with their shoes on their feet, and with their staff in their hand (12:11). Without eating, they would not have had the energy to get out of Egypt. This picture shows us that the eating of the lamb was for moving out of Egypt to carry out God's redemption and God's salvation. The redeeming blood was for God's redemption, and the satisfying and strengthening meat of the lamb with the unleavened bread was for God's salvation to deliver them by enabling them to cooperate with God. They received the strength to move out of Egypt by eating the meat of the lamb and the unleavened bread.</P><P>God was very fine in His working to deliver the children of Israel in His using of Moses, the Passover, the Angel of God, the glory of God, and His mighty power to divide the Red Sea for Israel and to close it over Pharaoh and his army. This part of God's history helps us to know what kind of God He is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. BRINGING THEM INTO THE WILDERNESS</H2><P>God brought the children of Israel out of Egyptian tyranny and bondage into the wilderness (Exo. 3:18). In the wilderness there was nothing of the Egyptian world for them to enjoy. The only thing for Israel to do in the wilderness was to meet with God. The story of the children of Israel in Exodus is a type. The way in which God worked to redeem and save Israel is a picture of how He redeems and saves people today. God's dynamic salvation based upon His complete redemption should be like this.</P><P>The children of Israel had been serving under Egyptian tyranny and in slavery for four hundred years. Suddenly within a brief period of time they were brought into the wilderness to meet with God. When we were saved, we also were immediately transported out of the world to be with God. Right after we applied the blood of Christ and took Christ into us as our life, the whole world immediately became the wilderness to us where there was only God. Every saved person must be saved to such an extent that he is fully transported out of the world and left with God alone.</P><P>In Exodus 3:18 God said to Moses, "Thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God." Three days' journey by walking could have taken them one hundred miles from Egypt. In ancient times one hundred miles was a long distance. Moses led them far away from everything of the Egyptian world. Around them in every direction, there was nothing worldly to distract them or occupy them. There was no Egyptian food for them to taste. There was only God. This is the real delivery, the real salvation, the dynamic salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Israel Fallen into Egypt</H2><P>Israel had fallen into Egypt, which typifies the world of easy living and pleasure, for four hundred years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Predicted by God to Abraham</H2><P>As we have seen, Israel's fall into Egypt was predicted by God to Abraham (Gen. 15:13-14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Prohibited from Serving God</H2><P>When they were in Egypt, they were prohibited from serving God and had to suffer the affliction of the Egyptian tyranny (Exo. 1:15-22; Heb. 11:23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. God Bringing Them into the Wilderness</H2><P>God then brought them into the wilderness (Exo. 15:22), into a place outside the world, free from worldly occupations in anxiety of life, pleasures, persecutions of religion, etc. God brought them into the wilderness through three days' journey&#151;through the resurrection of Christ. When we were baptized, we were baptized into His death and resurrected to walk in newness of life (Rom. 6:3-5). Then we were out of the world and in the wilderness with God. The children of Israel were brought out of Egypt into the wilderness to serve God with sacrifices, typifying Christ as the offerings.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWELVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S HISTORY IN TIME<br>GEN. 1:1&#151;REV. 20:15</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(11)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>WORKING ON HIS ELECT<br>THROUGH MOSES</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>BEARING THEM THROUGH THE WILDERNESS<br>AND<br>BRINGING THEM TO HIMSELF AT MOUNT SINAI</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Exo. 15:22-27; 16:13-18; 17:1-16; 19:1-8</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Bearing them through the wilderness:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>As on eagles' wings&#151;Exo. 19:4.</li>	<li>Changing the bitter waters into sweet waters for them by casting a tree (typifying the healing cross of Christ&#151;1 Pet. 2:24) into the waters at Marah, signifying that Jehovah heals them from the Egyptians' diseases&#151;Exo. 15:22-26.</li>	<li>Providing them with twelve springs of water (signifying the all-inclusive Spirit of Christ&#151;John 7:38-39) and seventy shading palm trees (signifying the overshadowing Christ&#151;2 Cor. 12:9) at Elim&#151;Exo. 15:27.</li>	<li>Feeding them with manna, the heavenly food (typifying Christ as the bread from heaven&#151;John 6:50-51; 1 Cor. 10:3)&#151;Exo. 16:13-18.</li>	<li>Quenching them with the living water (1 Cor. 10:4a), typifying the overflowing Spirit (John 7:37-39), out of the cleft rock, typifying the crucified Christ (John 19:34; 1 Cor. 10:4b)&#151;Exo. 17:1-6.</li>	<li>Defeating the Amalekites (signifying the flesh of the believers&#151;Gal. 5:16-24) for them&#151;Exo. 17:8-16.</li>	<li>Establishing them as a kingdom (Exo. 19:6) with authorities (Moses typifying Christ as the head authority, and the captains of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens as deputy authorities) to keep their condition in a good order&#151;Exo. 18:13-26.</li>	</ol><li>Bringing them to Himself at Mount Sinai&#151;Exo. 19:1-4:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Making them His own peculiar possession above all the peoples, a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&#151;19:5-6.</li>	<li>Exposing them by giving them the law as His testimony (Psa. 19:7), that they might know that they were sinful in nature and evil in deeds and that they had no ability to keep His law&#151;Exo. 20 &#151;23; cf. 19:8.</li>	<li>Revealing to them the way to partake of the Triune God as their portion for their enjoyment&#151;Exo. 25 &#151;27, 30, 36 &#151;38, 40:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To get them washed in the laver, typifying the cleansing Spirit, from the dirt of the earth&#151;Exo. 30:17-21; 40:11-12, 30-32.</li>		<li>To get them redeemed from their sins through the offerings (typifying Christ&#151;John 1:29) and to offer them with Christ to God at the altar, typifying the cross of Christ&#151;Exo. 27:1-8; 38:1-7; 40:6.</li>		<li>To enter into the tabernacle as the dwelling of the Triune God on earth, typifying Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God among men (John 1:14)&#151;Exo. 26; 36:8-38; 40:2, 17-28, 33-34.</li>		<li>To feed on the table of the bread of the Presence, typifying Christ as the believers' life supply (John 6:48, 51)&#151;Exo. 25:23-30; 37:10-16; 40:4a, 22-23.</li>		<li>To be enlightened by the lampstand, typifying Christ as the light of life to the believers (John 1:4; 8:12)&#151;Exo. 25:31-39; 37:17-24; 40:4b, 24-25.</li>		<li>To be accepted by God in prayer with Christ as the fragrance (cf.

Genesis shows us God's history in His working through eight positive persons&#151;Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph. The history of the Triune God in Genesis was initiated in Adam and issued in three persons&#151;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. From Exodus to Malachi is the history of God in one race, a particular race, a chosen race, the race of Israel.</P><P>In the previous message, we saw how God came down to deliver Israel out of Egypt and bring them into the wilderness by four means. These four means of deliverance help us to see what kind of God we have. He delivered Israel out of Egypt through Moses with ten plagues of miracles (Exo. 3:8, 14-20), through the Passover (12:1-20), through the Angel of Jehovah, Christ, with the pillar of cloud and of fire, the glory of God (14:19-20), and through His mighty power to divide the Red Sea and destroy the Egyptian army (14:6-8, 21-31). Through a man by the name of Moses and a feast which is called the Passover, God rescued His chosen people. Then Christ as the all-inclusive One with the divine glory became another means by which God rescued Israel. Lastly, the divine mighty power of God was exercised to bring Israel out of Egypt into the wilderness.</P><P>The feast of the Passover as a type is great in its spiritual significance. It typifies God's salvation, including His redemption, in a detailed way. Redemption is a basic part of God's salvation, and the feast of Passover is a full type of the salvation of God. We need to see God's history in the type of the Passover. God redeemed the nation of Israel from the death-judgment by the blood of the lamb (12:7, 13). The blood of the lamb is for redemption, and redemption is for salvation. Redemption is the first step of God's salvation. God's full salvation continues with the washing away of sins, reconciliation, justification, regeneration, renewing, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification.</P><P>In the feast of the Passover, the Israelites struck the blood of the lamb, and they also ate the meat of the lamb with the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs (vv. 8-11). John 6:4 says, "Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near." Verse 4 indicates that John 6 is a chapter on the reality of the Passover. The Passover recorded in Exodus 12 was in typology, not in reality. The reality of the Passover is recorded in John 6.</P><P>In John 6 the Lord said that His blood is drinkable and His flesh is eatable (v. 54). Then verse 57 says that not only His flesh but also His entire being is eatable. In this verse the Lord Jesus said, "As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me." Here it says, "He who eats Me," indicating that not only His flesh but also His entire being is eatable. Jesus said that His blood was drinkable, that His flesh was eatable, and that He in totality was eatable.</P><P>According to Exodus 12, the Israelites ate the meat of the lamb (v. 8) but they also ate the lamb with its head, legs, and inwards (v. 9). To eat the Passover lamb with the head, legs, and inwards is to take Christ as a whole, in His entirety. In order to enjoy God's salvation in, through, and with Christ, we must learn how to strike His blood for our redemption, and we must learn how to eat Him for our salvation.</P><P>On the evening of the feast of the Passover, they were charged to eat the lamb in haste with their loins girded, with shoes on their feet, and with a staff in their hand (v. 11). Their eating of the lamb in such a way was their preparation to move out of Egypt. They had the blood on their houses to cover them and to protect them from the death-judgment. Now they needed to eat the lamb for the strength to move out of Egypt. Their energy for moving out of Egypt came from the meat of the lamb, typifying Christ Himself. We have to eat Jesus for our strength to move out of Egypt and become His army (v. 51) to fight against the enemy.</P><P>We have a long way to walk in following God to fight against the enemy and to live a sinless life. Therefore, just to eat the meat of the Lamb is not sufficient. The children of Israel also had to eat the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs. When we eat Jesus, we eat Him not only as the Lamb but also as the unleavened bread with the bitter herbs. To eat the unleavened bread means to eliminate all sinful things. To eat bitter herbs means that we need to regret and repent, to experience a bitter taste regarding sinful things.</P><P>When we received the Lord as our Savior and our life, we decided to follow God, to endeavor to defeat Satan with the world, and to endeavor to stay away from sin, to live a sinless life. Whenever we sinned, we were full of regret. We felt bitter, not sweet. When we were saved, we not only struck the blood of the Lamb for our redemption but also ate Christ in His entirety as the Lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs for our salvation. This part of the history of God in the race of Israel reveals the redeeming God. He would never neglect the matter of sin. He would prepare a part of His salvation to us as redemption. Then He would afford us with all the strength to follow Him, to defeat Satan with his world, to live a life without sin, and to regret whenever we sin. We need Christ as our strength in these four aspects.</P><P>He is also a God who is the Angel of Jehovah, taking care of His saved people in His glory, and the almighty God who can miraculously deliver His people from Egypt and bring them into the wilderness. God gave His orders to the frogs, the lice, the flies, and the locusts to plague Egypt. He sent the frogs as the submarines, the lice as an army, and the flies and the locusts as the planes to defeat Pharaoh and the Egyptians. He also divided the Red Sea by His mighty power for Israel to pass through, and then He closed the sea upon Pharaoh and his army to destroy them. He did many wonderful things by His mighty power. We need to see the history of God as the saving One in the beginning of the book of Exodus.</P><P>In this message we want to go on to see how God bore the children of Israel through the wilderness and brought them to Himself at Mount Sinai.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. BEARING THEM THROUGH THE WILDERNESS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. As on Eagles' Wings</H2><P>God delivered Israel out of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness. The wilderness is very positive here. It is very good to be saved by God out of the noisy world to a place where there is only the heavens and the earth and God, nothing else. But for the long run, the wilderness was not a good place. Thus, they had to be brought by a long journey through the wilderness.</P><P>In Exodus 19:4 God said, "Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself." God considered that He was a big eagle who bore all the children of Israel upon His two wings. When I was in mainland China, I intended to evangelize Inner Mongolia, but God in His sovereignty bore me on His wings to the United States. God put all the children of Israel upon His wings and bore them through the wilderness to bring them to Himself at Mount Sinai.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Changing the Bitter Waters into Sweet Waters</H2><P>God changed the bitter waters into sweet waters for them by casting a tree (typifying the healing cross of Christ&#151;1 Pet. 2:24) into the waters at Marah, signifying that Jehovah heals them from the Egyptian diseases (Exo. 15:22-26). They were not only rescued out of Egypt and out of the tyranny of the Egyptians but also delivered from all kinds of Egyptian diseases by the cross of Christ. First Peter 2:24 says that the cross is the tree.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Providing Them with Twelve Springs of Water<br>and Seventy Shading Palm Trees</H2><P>God also provided them with twelve springs of water (signifying the all-inclusive Spirit of Christ&#151;John 7:38-39) and seventy shading palm trees (signifying the overshadowing Christ&#151;2 Cor. 12:9) at Elim (Exo. 15:27). The springs of water and the shading palm trees in the wilderness were a real enjoyment. God gives us the living waters and the shade to take care of us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Feeding Them with Manna</H2><P>In God's history He also fed the children of Israel with manna (Exo. 16:13-18), the heavenly food, typifying Christ as the bread from heaven (John 6:50-51; 1 Cor. 10:3). John 6 is a fulfillment of both the Passover and the heavenly manna.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Quenching Them with the Living Water</H2><P>God quenched them with the living water (1 Cor. 10:4a), typifying the overflowing Spirit (John 7:37-39), out of the cleft rock (Exo. 17:1-6), typifying the crucified Christ (John 19:34; 1 Cor. 10:4b). The rock in the wilderness was a moving rock following them in the wilderness. This rock typifies the crucified Christ in resurrection. He was crucified, but now He is living in resurrection as the source of the overflowing Spirit for our supply.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Defeating the Amalekites</H2><P>On the way in the wilderness, there were also enemies, the Amalekites. God defeated the Amalekites (signifying the flesh of the believers&#151;Gal. 5:16-24) for them (Exo. 17:8-16). The first enemy that frustrates us from following the Lord is our flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Establishing Them as a Kingdom<br>with Authorities</H2><P>Eventually, after all of God's provisions and loving care, He established them as a kingdom (Exo. 19:6) with authorities (Moses typifying Christ as the head authority, and the captains of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens as deputy authorities) to keep their condition in a good order (18:13-26). These captains were the deputy authorities among the children of Israel. Through these deputy authorities, they were kept in good order.</P><P>By God's bearing them through the wilderness, the children of Israel were supplied with all kinds of divine provisions and also established as a nation. Eventually, this nation became a kingdom. In Exodus 19:6 God said that He chose the children of Israel to make them a kingdom of priests.</P><P>Thus, we can see the bitter waters changed into sweet waters in Exodus 15, the manna in chapter sixteen, the living water out of the cleft rock in chapter seventeen, the defeat of the Amalekites in chapter seventeen, the establishment of the children of Israel as a nation in chapter eighteen, and their being called a kingdom in chapter nineteen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. BRINGING THEM TO HIMSELF AT MOUNT SINAI</H2><P>By bearing the nation of Israel through the wilderness, God brought them to Himself at Mount Sinai (Exo. 19:1-4). Exodus 19 shows that God was at Mount Sinai waiting for the children of Israel to come. Mount Sinai in the Bible is called the Mount of God. They were brought to God at Mount Sinai because God was there. They were borne by God on His wings to God Himself.</P><P>Two mountains on this earth are very significant in God's history on this earth. One is Mount Sinai and the other is Mount Zion. We have seen that Psalm 68 reveals God's move on this earth from Mount Sinai to Mount Zion (see Life-study of the Psalms, Messages Twenty-seven and Twenty-eight). Now we need to see what God did at Sinai.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Making Them His Own Peculiar Possession</H2><P>At Mount Sinai, God made the children of Israel His own peculiar possession above all the peoples, a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (Exo. 19:5-6). As God's peculiar possession, they were a beautiful people particularly belonging to God as God's heart's desire. Jeremiah 2 tells us that God had a very affectionate feeling toward the children of Israel. At that time Israel's love toward God was a bridal love (v. 2). This relationship was very sweet. After being brought out of Egypt to the wilderness and borne through the wilderness to Mount Sinai, to God Himself, God made Israel a peculiar possession to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Exposing Them by Giving Them<br>the Law as His Testimony</H2><P>God exposed the children of Israel by giving them the law as His testimony (Psa. 19:7) that they might know that they were sinful in nature and evil in deeds and that they had no ability to keep His law (Exo. 20 &#151;23; cf. 19:8). In Exodus 19:8 they said, "All that the Lord hath spoken we will do." They did not know themselves, so that forced God to decree the law. The law is a picture, a photo, a testimony, of what God is. God is a holy, righteous, bright, and loving God. He hates killing, fornication, stealing, lying, and coveting. The law as God's testimony showed that Israel was not like God. Israel was sinful in nature and evil in deeds.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Revealing to Them the Way<br>to Partake of the Triune God</H2><P>God also revealed to them the way to partake of the Triune God as their portion for their enjoyment (chs. 25&#151;27, 30, 36&#151;38, 40). This was the purpose for which God bore the children of Israel to Himself at Mount Sinai.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Get Them Washed from the Dirt<br>of the Earth in the Laver</H2><P>They were washed from the dirt of the earth in the laver, typifying the cleansing Spirit (30:17-21; 40:11-12, 30-32). The brass laver was where all the serving ones of God washed away all the dirt from their earthly contact. This was a type of the cleansing of the Spirit, who sanctifies us before the sprinkling of the blood of Christ as unveiled in 1 Peter 1:2.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Get Them Redeemed from Their Sins<br>through the Offerings</H2><P>God redeemed them from their sins through the offerings (typifying Christ&#151;John 1:29). These offerings were presented with Christ to God at the altar, typifying the cross of Christ (Exo. 27:1-8; 38:1-7; 40:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. To Enter into the Tabernacle<br>as the Dwelling of the Triune God on Earth</H2><P>They entered into the tabernacle as the dwelling of the Triune God on earth (Exo. 26; 36:8-38; 40:2, 17-28, 33-34), typifying Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God among men (John 1:14). The tabernacle was God's embodiment, and that tabernacle was enterable. The children of Israel could enter into God, embodied by the tabernacle. This indicates that the very God in His history is enterable, that we can enter into Him to enjoy Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. To Feed on the Table<br>of the Bread of the Presence</H2><P>After you enter into God, God is eatable. After entering into the tabernacle, they fed on the table of the bread of the Presence (Exo. 25:23-30; 37:10-16; 40:4a, 22-23), typifying Christ as the believers' life supply (John 6:48, 51). Our food is God's presence. God in His presence is our available food.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. To Be Enlightened by the Lampstand</H2><P>After eating the bread of the Presence, they were enlightened by the lampstand (Exo. 25:31-39; 37:17-24; 40:4b, 24-25), typifying Christ as the light of life to the believers (John 1:4; 8:12). When we receive the life supply by eating the bread, we will be enlightened. When we receive the provision of life, the supply of life, we will have the light of life. The life is the light of men.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. To Be Accepted by God in Prayer</H2><P>They were then accepted by God in prayer with Christ as the fragrance (cf. Rev. 8:3-4) at the golden altar (Exo. 30:1-10; 37:25-29; 40:5, 26-27). This altar is different from the brass altar. The brass altar is in the outer court, outside the tabernacle, and the golden altar is inside the tabernacle, close to the Holy of Holies. At the golden altar, the incense altar, the priests could offer their prayer to God to be accepted.</P><P>The content of our prayer is the resurrected and ascended Christ. Christ offered Himself on the cross, typified by the brass altar on the earth, for our redemption. Now He is in the third heaven before God. As the resurrected and ascended One, He is the sweet and fragrant incense, in which God extends to us His well-pleasing acceptance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. To Meet God through the Propitiatory Blood<br>on the Propitiation Cover of the Ark</H2><P>Finally, they were able to meet God through the propitiatory blood on the propitiation cover of the ark (typifying Christ as the center of God's dwelling&#151;Rom. 3:25) in the Holy of Holies (Exo. 25:10-22; 37:1-9; 40:3, 20-21). The blood shed outside the tabernacle at the brass altar was brought into the tabernacle and sprinkled on the cover of the ark. On Christ as the propitiatory cover, we can contact God, commune with God, and have fellowship with God. It is here that God becomes everything to us for our enjoyment.</P><P>By means of the tabernacle, the children of Israel were able to be in the presence of God. Through the laver and the brass altar in the outer court, they could enter into the very God embodied as the tabernacle. In the tabernacle were the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, the incense altar, and the ark. The tabernacle is the embodiment of God, and related to this embodied God are six items: the laver to wash us, the brass altar to redeem us, the table to feed us, the lampstand to enlighten us, the incense altar to accept us, and the ark for us to stay with God to enjoy Him.</P><P>Now we should be able to see why we need the Old Testament. Regardless of how good, how rich, and how excellent the New Testament teaching is, we cannot find there the details of God's history which are revealed in the typology of the Old Testament. In God's history we can see that He is the providing God for us to enter into Him and to stay with Him for our perpetual enjoyment of Him in the way of washing, redeeming, feeding, enlightening, accepting, and communion. Today we are in the embodied Triune God to enjoy His washing at the laver, His redeeming at the brass altar, His feeding at the table, His enlightening at the lampstand, His accepting at the incense altar, and His communion at the ark. Once we were in Egypt, but we passed through the Red Sea and were borne through the wilderness to be brought to God. Now we are in God enjoying Him in His washing, redeeming, feeding, enlightening, accepting, and communion.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S HISTORY IN TIME<br>GEN. 1:1&#151;REV. 20:15</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(12)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>WORKING ON HIS ELECT<br>THROUGH MOSES</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TRAINING THEM TO WORSHIP<br>AND PARTAKE OF GOD AND TO LIVE<br>A HOLY, CLEAN, AND REJOICING LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Leviticus</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Training them to worship and partake of God:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>With the offerings&#151;Christ in all aspects:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The burnt offering&#151;Lev. 1:3-9:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Typifying Christ in His absoluteness for God's satisfaction.</li>			<li>Being the qualification for the sin offering.</li>			</ol>		<li>The meal offering&#151;Lev. 2:1-3:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Typifying Christ in His human living and daily walk.</li>			<li>A part to be burned on the altar to God as an offering by fire for food to God&#151;v. 2; Num. 28:2, 8.</li>			<li>The rest to be food to the priests&#151;v. 3.</li>			</ol>		<li>The peace offering&#151;Lev. 3:1-6:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Typifying Christ as the peace between God and His people.</li>			<li>For the enjoyment of God with His people in fellowship.</li>			</ol>		<li>The sin offering&#151;Lev. 4:13-21:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Typifying Christ as the sin offering for the sin of God's people.</li>			<li>The whole offering to be burned outside the camp&#151;v. 21.</li>			</ol>		<li>The trespass offering&#151;Lev. 5:1-6:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Typifying Christ as the trespass offering for the sins, the trespasses, of God's people.</li>			<li>The trespass offering being also considered as a sin offering&#151;v. 6.</li>			</ol>		</ol>	<li>Through the priests&#151;Lev. 1:5-8; 2:2; 3:2; 4:5, 10; 5:8:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Typifying Christ as God's Priest&#151;Heb. 5:5-6.</li>		<li>Offering Himself to God for us&#151;Heb. 9:14, 26; 10:10.</li>		</ol>	</ol><li>Training them to live a holy, clean, and rejoicing life:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Living a holy life&#151;Lev. 18&#151;20:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Putting off the old life and putting on the new&#151;cf.

The entire book of Leviticus shows that God trained His elect to worship and partake of God and to live a holy, clean, and rejoicing life.</P><P>The history of God as seen in the books of Genesis and Exodus consummated in the children of Israel as a nation. In the previous message we saw how God brought His people, His elect, through the wilderness. God moved with them and brought them to Mount Sinai. Sinai represents God's presence. God brought His people to Himself at Sinai and stayed with them. The children of Israel remained at Sinai with God for about eleven months (Exo. 19:1; cf. Num. 10:11). God stayed with His people day and night there, so God trained them.</P><P>At Mount Sinai God gave them the law and the pattern for the tabernacle. On the one hand, God regulated them by the law, and on the other hand, He encouraged them by the tabernacle. After the decree of the law and the building up of the tabernacle at Sinai, God gave them all the chapters of Leviticus to train them to worship and partake of God and to live a holy, clean, and rejoicing life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. TRAINING THEM TO WORSHIP AND PARTAKE OF GOD</H2><P>God trains His people to worship Him and also to partake of Him, to participate in Him, for their enjoyment. We need to be trained to worship God in the way of partaking of Him to enjoy Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. With the Offerings&#151;Christ in All Aspects</H2><P>God's people were instructed to worship Him with the offerings, typifying Christ in all aspects. The aspects of Christ in all of His riches are untraceable and unsearchable (Eph. 3:8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Burnt Offering</H2><P>The burnt offering (Lev. 1:3-9) typifies Christ in His absoluteness for God's satisfaction. The burnt offering was the qualification for the sin offering. The sin offering was to be slaughtered in the place where the burnt offering was slaughtered. This indicates that the sin offering is based upon the burnt offering, and it signifies that Christ is the sin offering for us based upon His being the burnt offering. For Jesus Christ to be the sin offering, He had to be the burnt offering. His being the burnt offering was His qualification for Him to be the sin offering.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Meal Offering</H2><P>The meal offering (Lev. 2:1-3) typifies Christ in His human living and daily walk. A part of the meal offering was to be burned on the altar to God as an offering by fire for food to God (v. 2; Num. 28:2, 8). The rest of the meal offering was to be food to the priests (Lev. 2:3). Thus, Christ as the meal offering is food to God and food to us, the New Testament priests.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Peace Offering</H2><P>The peace offering (Lev. 3:1-6) typifies Christ as the peace between God and His people for the enjoyment of God with His people in fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Sin Offering</H2><P>The sin offering (Lev. 4:13-21) typifies Christ as the sin offering for the sin of God's people. Sin here is not the outward sins in our conduct, in our behavior, but the inward sin in our nature. The whole sin offering was to be burned outside the camp (v. 21). Nothing of the sin offering was for God or for God's serving ones to eat because it was absolutely for dealing with the sin in the nature of God's people. Christ as the sin offering suffered reproach outside the Jewish religion&#151;a human organization (Heb. 13:11-13). He was crucified outside Jerusalem which was considered a camp representing the Jewish religious organization.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Trespass Offering</H2><P>The trespass offering (Lev. 5:1-6) is very difficult to study because it is hard to differentiate sin from sins. They are of one family. The sin within is in our nature and the sins without are in our behavior. Christ is the reality of the trespass offering for the sins, the trespasses, of God's people.</P><P>The trespass offering was also considered as a sin offering (v. 6). This signifies that Christ's redemption for our sin resolves the problem of sin in its two aspects&#151;sin in our inward nature and sins in our outward conduct. These two aspects of sin make up the totality of sin. John 1:29 says, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world." Sin here denotes the totality of sin, comprising both the inward sin and the outward sins.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Through the Priests</H2><P>God's elect people were trained to worship and partake of God through the priests (Lev. 1:5-8; 2:2; 3:2; 4:5, 10; 5:8). The priests typify Christ as God's Priest (Heb. 5:5-6) offering Himself to God for us (Heb. 9:14, 26; 10:10).</P><P>To worship God is a matter in Christ and through Christ. Christ is both the offerings and the Priest. It is impossible to render the true worship to God without Christ. Among most Christians there is not the thought of enjoying Christ, partaking of Christ, and participating in the riches of Christ. To enjoy Christ, to partake of Christ, and to participate in all the riches of Christ is new terminology picked up by us over the last forty years. Christ is the way to worship God and the way to partake of God.</P><P>If someone asked us how to enjoy Christ, what would we say? We should be able to give a brief, definite, and accurate answer concerning how to enjoy Christ. In order to enjoy Christ, we first have to realize who and what Christ is. Christ today is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Then we need to realize where Christ is. He is in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). In order to enjoy Christ we have to realize that He is the Spirit dwelling in our spirit, so we have to exercise our spirit to call on Him&#151;"O Lord Jesus!" This is very simple.</P><P>If we do not call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we cannot enjoy Him. To the feeling of many Christians, Christ is objective and far away from them. The way to enjoy Christ is to call, "O Lord Jesus!" When we call upon Him, we have the inward sensation that He is present with us. In the New Testament, the teaching concerning calling on the Lord is very great (see Acts 2:21 and note 1&#151;Recovery Version). Romans 10:12 says that the Lord is "rich to all who call upon Him." He is rich to us if we call on Him. His riches can be enjoyed by us only by our calling on Him.</P><P>The proper worship to God is with Christ as His embodiment for our enjoyment of God in all His riches. Who could invent such a worship, but God?! If there were no Christ, there would be no worship to God and no enjoyment of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. TRAINING THEM TO LIVE<br>A HOLY, CLEAN, AND REJOICING LIFE</H2><P>In the book of Leviticus we also see how God trained His people to live a holy, clean, and rejoicing life. A holy life is a life which is like God, a godly life. Here we mention a clean life, not a pure life. To be pure is not to be mixed. To be clean is not to be dirty. We do not realize how dirty we human beings are. Leviticus tells us that even our birth is dirty (ch. 12) and that every little discharge out of us is dirty (ch. 15). We need to live a clean life, a life which is not dirty.</P><P>According to the Old Testament type, we have to contact God through the offerings of the bronze altar and through the laver. Paul told us that we are cleansed by the washing (lit., laver) of the water in the word (Eph. 5:26). In the word of Christ there is the water of life to cleanse us. This is typified by the laver situated between the altar and the tabernacle (Exo. 38:8; 40:7). The laver is the place where we wash away our earthly defilement and are made clean.</P><P>We also need to live a rejoicing life, a happy life. We all have to be "hallelujah people," who rejoice in the Lord always (Phil. 4:4). Sometimes the most restful thing is to sing a hymn. Singing a hymn fills us with joy and helps us to enjoy Christ as our rest. The chorus of Hymns, #308 says: "This is my story, this is my song,/Praising my Savior all the day long." A rejoicing life is a life of enjoying God in Christ as everything; this enjoyment makes us happy and causes us to exult all the day. The Christian life should be a rejoicing life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Living a Holy Life</H2><P>In order to live a holy life, Leviticus shows us that we need to put off the old life and put on the new (cf. Eph. 4:17&#151; 5:14). The people of Israel were charged to put off the former Egyptian conduct (Lev. 18:3a). God also charged them not to walk in the customs of the Canaanites (v. 3b) and to have God's holy living according to His holy nature (19:2; 20:7, 26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Living a Clean Life</H2><P>In order to be kept in a clean life, we need to contact the clean people (Lev. 11; Acts 10:11-15). Our contact with the wrong people can cause us to become contaminated. Leviticus 12 shows us the cleansing from the human impurity by birth. Even our birth is not clean. The source is dirty.</P><P>Leviticus 13 and 14 speak of being cleansed from leprosy. Sins such as fornication, adultery, the worship of idols, stealing, etc., are included in man's leprous situation. Leprosy always comes from rebellion and signifies the serious sin issuing from within man, such as willful sin, presumptuous sin, and opposing God with determination.</P><P>Leviticus 15 shows that we need to be cleansed from all unclean discharges from the human being. Anything discharged out of us, including our words, is unclean. This is why we need the cross of Christ to end our old life and the resurrection of Christ to have a new beginning. Also we need the water of life, which is the washing, cleansing Spirit of life embodied in the word. Whenever we come in our spirit to the word, we touch something within the word that washes us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Living a Rejoicing Life</H2><P>Leviticus reveals that we need to live a rejoicing life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Weekly Sabbath</H2><P>The weekly Sabbath (Lev. 23:1-3) was the principal denotation of all the annual feasts. All the annual feasts were a Sabbath, which was for God's redeemed people to rest with God and with one another.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Monthly New Moon Feast</H2><P>The monthly new moon feast (Num. 10:10; 28:11-15) signifies that we can experience a new beginning in Christ as our joy and enjoyment with light in darkness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Annual Feasts</H2><P>There were not only weekly and monthly feasts but also annual feasts (Lev. 23:2, 4-44). In our Christian life, we need a weekly, monthly, and annual enjoyment of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Feast of the Passover</H2><P>The Feast of the Passover (Lev. 23:4-5; Exo. 12:2-14) typifies Christ as our Passover (1 Cor. 5:7) for our initial and foundational salvation. This feast signifies the beginning of our regenerated life (Exo. 12:2). Our initial salvation was a time of rejoicing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Feast of Unleavened Bread</H2><P>After the Passover, we are keeping the Feast of Unleavened bread without sin (Lev. 23:6-8; Exo. 12:15-20). This feast lasted for seven days, typifying the entire course of our Christian life as a feast without sin. We cannot rejoice with sin. Christ is our strength to live a life without sin in our entire Christian life for our enjoyment and rest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Feast of the Firstfruits</H2><P>The Feast of the Firstfruits (Lev. 23:9-14) typifies the resurrected Christ (1 Cor. 15:20) for our enjoyment as a feast in His resurrection. Very few are enjoying Christ in this way because they do not know His resurrection power.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Feast of Pentecost&#151;of the Fiftieth Day</H2><P>The Feast of Pentecost (Lev. 23:15-21) typifies the enjoyment of the outpouring of the Spirit for the formation of the church in two sections, the Jewish and the Gentile, typified by the two loaves offered to God on that day (v. 17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. The Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets</H2><P>The Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets (vv. 23-25) typifies God's calling together of His scattered people, the dispersed Israelites (Matt. 24:31), to be fulfilled at Christ's coming back (Matt. 24:30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. The Feast of Propitiation</H2><P>The Feast of Propitiation (Lev. 23:26-32) typifies the enjoyment of God's propitiation for the whole house of Israel after they will be gathered together by God (Rom. 11:25-27; Zech. 12:10-14). This will be fulfilled at the very time of Christ's descending from the heavens to the Holy Land in His second coming (Rev. 1:7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. The Feast of Tabernacles</H2><P>The Feast of Tabernacles (Lev. 23:33-44) typifies the enjoyment of the age of restoration (Matt. 19:28) to be fulfilled in the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6) on the restored earth, not in the new heaven and new earth yet.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Sabbath Year</H2><P>The Sabbath year (Lev. 25:1-7, 18-22), the seventh year, typifies Christ as our rest in full for the land to rest and for the people with their servants, their maids, their hired servants, and their strangers, and with their cattle and the beasts in their land to enjoy food without laboring (vv. 4-7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Jubilee</H2><P>The jubilee, the Pentecostal year, the fiftieth year (Lev. 25:8-17), was a time of shouting in rejoicing. The jubilee typifies Christ as our full release, rest, and joy by His redeeming back what we have lost in our rights and what we have sold in ourselves. This is for us to enjoy Christ in His resurrection in the fullest way forever and ever.</P><P>Leviticus shows us the weekly enjoyment, monthly enjoyment, and seven annual feasts. Then it speaks of the Sabbath year and the jubilee. All of these items typify the New Testament enjoyment. As New Testament believers, we should be a holy people, a clean people, and a happy people who are always rejoicing. In God's history among His people, He trained them to worship and partake of Him and to live a holy, clean, and rejoicing life.</P><P>The rich enjoyment of Him in the weekly Sabbath, in the monthly new moon, in the seven annual feasts, in the Sabbath year, and in the jubilee, the fiftieth year Sabbath, for the greatest, highest, and deepest enjoyment of God to its fullest extent, makes His elect happy all the time so that they may become a rejoicing people on the earth. Who could invent all these most wonderful feasts, but God?! Leviticus, as a record of God's training to His elect, is also a part of God's history, showing us what kind of God our God is.</P><P>In another series of messages entitled The Move of God in Man, we will go on to the New Testament to see God's move in man as the concluding part of the history of God in His union with man.</P></body></html>
