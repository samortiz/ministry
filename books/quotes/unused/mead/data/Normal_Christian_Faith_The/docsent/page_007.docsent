   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHANCE EVENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What are the characteristics of things that come about by chance?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we know that they are unorganized.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the most they can be partially integrated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They can never be totally organized.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One can achieve a specified goal by chance once, but he can never achieve a specified goal by chance all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Anything that comes together by chance can only be integrated partially, never totally.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, if I throw this chair to the other side of the room, by chance it may come to rest at a perfect angle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If I do the same with a second chair, it may also lie neatly beside the first one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But this will not keep on happening with the third and the fourth and so on.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Chance can only provide partial organization.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It does not guarantee total integration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, all random interactions are aimless, disorganized, and purposeless.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are without order and structure; they are loose, formless, disorderly, and not directed toward any meaningful purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Briefly, we can say that the characteristics of chance events are disharmony, irregularity, inconsistency, purposelessness, and insignificance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will write down these four characteristics on our list.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>CONSISTENCY AND ORGANIZATION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now let us compare the things in the universe with these characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Take, for example, the human being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is carried in his mother's womb for nine months and delivered; he grows up and eventually dies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This cycle is repeated for every single individual.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Consistency can be observed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not a wild game of chance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Again, look at the sun above your head.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It does not exist purposelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, it has its purpose and significance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Look at the moon, the stars, and the myriads of galaxies through your telescope.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some stars have their own planets.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They all follow definite tracks and patterns.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They are all organized.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their manner of motion can be calculated and predicted.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The calendar in your hand is derived from them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even next year's calendar can be printed before this year is past.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All these show that the universe is organized, consistent, and purposeful.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>MICROORGANISMS</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let us turn to the micro-world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Take a thin slice of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Put it under a microscope and observe its grain and structure, all meticulously regular and rhythmic.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even a blade of grass and the petal of a flower are finely fashioned.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nothing is unorganized or confused.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everything is disciplined and functional.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All these things witness one fact to you: the universe, with its macro and micro aspects, is purposeful and meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Can you say that all these came into existence by chance?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Surely you cannot.</S>
