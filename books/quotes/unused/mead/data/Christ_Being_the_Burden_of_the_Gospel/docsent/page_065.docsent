   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE Scripture Reading: John 15:5; 1 John 2:27</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Gospel of John and the first Epistle of John contain numerous references to abiding in the Lord John 15:4-7; 1 John 2:24, 27-28; 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since John s writings are focused on life, we must be clear about the matter of abiding in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Abiding in the Lord is the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we speak of electricity, we often use the word flow, which is a good description of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although a room may have many lights, there is only one electrical current.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every light in a room shares the same electrical current as the other lights.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that an electrical current is flowing through all the lights.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The same is true of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Christ there is only one life, and the life within one believer is the life within another believer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our life is the very life that is in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even though there are many believers, we all have only one life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we must know the mutual flow, the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This fellowship is the fellowship in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>An electric light shines because it has fellowship with a power generator, and there is an electrical current abiding in the power plant.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The same is true of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even though a Christian lives on the earth, he has fellowship with the heavenly Christ, and even though he lives on earth, he is in the heavenly Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although a Christian lives on the earth, the heavenly, divine life within him can flow when he abides in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Lights shine when electricity is transmitted to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The same is true of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All Christians are connected to the heavenly Christ, and when we abide in the heavenly Christ, the fellowship of life flows.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>LIFE BEING CONNECTED TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When I was working in Chefoo in 1943, China and Japan were still in a state of conflict.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Japanese military disliked the church, and they suspected that I had a special political assignment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At that time there were over one hundred brothers and sisters who were preparing to migrate to the northwest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This aroused even more suspicion from the Japanese.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In my briefcase I had contact addresses and letters from Canton, Chengtu, Chungching, and even places in Southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These items were always with me and never left my side.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Forty to fifty days after my activities caught the attention of the Japanese, a brother came from Beijing to distribute toothbrushes to me and to the responsible brothers in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I piled the toothbrushes on the table in order to distribute them according to the names on my contact list.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I took the name list from my briefcase and gave it to a brother so that the toothbrushes could be distributed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A day later, as I was meeting with the brothers about our work, Japanese agents intruded unexpectedly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They seized my briefcase and interrogated me carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During this time I was exercised to be in the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eventually, they could not find anything and left, and I was full of praise and worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The divine life within us is connected to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, there can be barriers to our fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, we need to continuously contact the Lord, live in His light, and abide in the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we obey the teaching of the anointing within us, the fellowship of the divine life flows within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The most important matter for a Christian is to maintain the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this fellowship we have rest and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is possible, however, that there can be an interruption in the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is especially true if we do not care for the teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, we must learn to obey the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must consider every matter in the light of our fellowship with God, not according to our own view or even the views of others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No matter how good our view or the views of others are, we should not do anything without fellowshipping with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to learn to obey the Lord, learning to do all things according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is also possible for our fellowship to not be fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If our fellowship is not fresh, we need to consecrate ourselves again and deal with every hindrance, whether the hindrance is within us or outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we do this, the fellowship of the divine life within us will be restored, and the divine life will begin to flow again.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we have fellowship with God, we surely have fellowship with the brothers and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we avoid contact with God s children, contact with the church, and contact with the Word, something is wrong with our fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When an electrical light is not connected to the source of electricity, it will not shine.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In order to abide in the Lord, Christians must live in the fellowship of life.</S>
