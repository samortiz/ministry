<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>We have seen that in the progressing stage, the stage of transformation, in God&rsquo;s full salvation, we experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. In this stage we continuously experience God&rsquo;s redemption and the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation. This lesson continues from level 3, volume 3 and goes on to present how we corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. BY ENTERING INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD</h2>
<p>In the New Testament, God&rsquo;s salvation and the kingdom always go together. Many pay close attention to God&rsquo;s salvation but neglect the kingdom, considering that the kingdom is a matter related only to the future. Nevertheless, the kingdom is part of God&rsquo;s salvation that we obtain today. If we have been saved, we are in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>According to the natural and religious concept, the purpose of repentance and regeneration is to obtain salvation. However, according to the New Testament, the purpose of repentance and regeneration is to provide us with an entrance into the kingdom of God. John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, preached the gospel of repentance for the kingdom, saying, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (Matt. 3:2). Later, when the Lord Jesus began His ministry, He continued the preaching of John the Baptist, also saying, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (4:17). In John 3 the Lord Jesus also said to Nicodemus, &ldquo;Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God&rdquo; (v. 5). When we believe into the Lord, we are regenerated, and through regeneration we enter into the kingdom of God. Thus, the kingdom is present, and every regenerated believer in Christ has entered into the kingdom. The New Testament reveals that repentance and regeneration, through believing in the Lord, are primarily for the kingdom, not salvation; moreover, God&rsquo;s salvation and the kingdom are mutually related.</p>
<p>Some Bible teachers have said that the kingdom is a matter related only to the future. They teach that Christ brought the kingdom with Him and presented it to the Jewish people and that it has been suspended and postponed because the Jewish people rejected it. Therefore, these teachers think that the present age is not the age of the kingdom but the age of the church. They completely separate the kingdom from the church. Nevertheless, the New Testament clearly shows that where salvation is, there the kingdom is also. Moreover, the New Testament reveals that where the church is, there is the kingdom. Romans 14:17 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The context of this verse is the church life; therefore, this verse is strong proof that the church in the present age is the kingdom of God. Furthermore, in Revelation 1:9 John writes, &ldquo;I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus.&rdquo; This verse indicates that John and other believers were already in the kingdom because of their exercise in tribulation and endurance. These verses in the Scriptures reveal that the kingdom exists in this age. The kingdom, which includes God&rsquo;s salvation and the church, is present today.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Being Regenerated into the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God (John 3:3, 5). To be regenerated is to enter into the kingdom of God. We have repented, believed into the Lord Jesus, and been regenerated into the kingdom of God. All the believers in Christ have entered into the kingdom of God through regeneration. In John 3:3 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo; Then in verse 5 He continues, &ldquo;Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo; These verses clearly show that regeneration is the unique entrance into the kingdom of God. To enter into the kingdom of God we need to be regenerated; apart from this, there is no way to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>The kingdom of God is the reign of God. It is a divine realm to be entered into, a realm that requires the divine life. Only the divine life can realize the divine things. Hence, for one to see, or to enter into, the kingdom of God requires that he be regenerated with the divine life. This clearly demonstrates that the kingdom is a matter related to life. The vegetable kingdom is related to the vegetable life, and the animal kingdom is related to animal life. In order for us to share in the kingdom, we need to have the life of the kingdom. If we do not have the human life, we cannot enter into the human kingdom. Likewise, without the divine life, the life of God, we could never enter into the kingdom of God. To enter into the divine kingdom, we must have the divine life. We have received the divine life, the life of God, through regeneration; therefore, to be regenerated is to enter the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>The kingdom of God is not only the reign of God but also a divine realm or sphere. To participate in the reign of God and to be in the divine realm, we need the divine life. Only those who have the divine life can be in the divine realm and participate in the divine kingdom. Regardless of how good, clean, and pure our human life might be, it is not able to realize the things in the divine realm, and it is not qualified to enter into the divine kingdom. Only the divine life is qualified to be in the divine realm. We were all born into the human kingdom. No one has ever been &ldquo;naturalized&rdquo; into the human kingdom. The principle is the same in regard to the kingdom of God. The divine life brings us into the kingdom of God. This is the reason the Lord Jesus said that we must be born into the kingdom of God. We cannot enter into the kingdom of God by learning or by naturalization. We can enter into the kingdom of God only by being regenerated.</p>
<p>Colossians 1:13 says that God &ldquo;delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love.&rdquo; We have been transferred into the kingdom of God through regeneration, and we are now in the kingdom of God. After we believed into the Lord Jesus and called upon His name, the divine Spirit entered into us and regenerated us, thereby causing us to be born into the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Entering Richly into the Eternal Kingdom<br />
of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>After we enter into the kingdom of God through regeneration, we need to continue to enter richly into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We have entered into the kingdom, yet we still need to enter richly. The initial entrance into the kingdom of God is through regeneration, but the rich entrance into the kingdom is through the full development of our experience in the divine life, that is, the development revealed in 2 Peter 1.</p>
<p>Second Peter 1:11 says, &ldquo;In this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly and bountifully supplied to you.&rdquo; The bountiful supply that we enjoy through the development of the divine life and nature will bountifully supply us a rich entrance into the kingdom of our Lord. It will also enable and qualify us to enter into the coming kingdom by all the riches of the divine life and divine nature as our excellent virtues (energy) unto the splendid glory of God.</p>
<p>The eternal kingdom spoken of in this verse refers to the kingdom of God, which was given to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (Dan. 7:13-14) and which will be manifested at His coming back (Luke 19:11-12). This kingdom will be a reward to His faithful believers, who pursue the growth in His life unto maturity and the development of the virtues of His nature so that in the millennium they may participate in His kingship in God&rsquo;s glory (2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 20:4, 6). Thus, to enter into the eternal kingdom of the Lord is related to entering into God&rsquo;s eternal glory, to which God has called us in Christ Jesus (1 Pet. 5:10; 1 Thes. 2:12).</p><h2 class="head3">1. Receiving from God&rsquo;s Divine Power<br />
All Things Which Relate to Life and Godliness</h2>
<p>We are able to richly enter into the eternal kingdom of our Lord because we have received from God&rsquo;s divine power all things which relate to life and godliness. Second Peter 1:3 says, &ldquo;His divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness.&rdquo; In this verse, <em>divine</em> denotes the eternal, unlimited, and almighty divinity of God. Hence, the divine power is the power of the divine life, which is related to the divine nature. <em>Granted</em> means &ldquo;imparted, infused, and planted into.&rdquo; All things which relate to life and godliness have been imparted, infused, and planted into us by the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who regenerates us and indwells us (2 Cor. 3:6, 17; John 3:6; Rom. 8:11).</p>
<p><em>All things which relate to life and godliness</em> are the various aspects of the divine life, typified by the riches of the produce of the good land in the Old Testament. They are the substance of our faith&rsquo;s substantiation allotted to us by God as our portion for our inheritance (2 Pet. 1:1). Life is within, enabling us to live, and godliness is without, as the outward expression of the inward life. Life is the inward energy, the inward strength, to bring forth the outward godliness, which leads to and results in glory.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Receiving Precious and<br />
Exceedingly Great Promises That through These We Might Become Partakers of the Divine Nature</h2>
<p>Our rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of the Lord is also related to our receiving precious and exceedingly great promises through which we partake of and enjoy the nature of God. Second Peter 1:4 says, &ldquo;He [God] has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature.&rdquo; According to this verse, God has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises for a specific purpose. His purpose is that through these promises we might become partakers of His divine nature. Through the precious and exceedingly great promises, we, the believers in Christ, have become partakers of the divine nature in an organic union with Him. To partake of the divine nature is to enjoy all that God is. In order that we may enjoy all that He is, God has done many things for us according to His promises. This enables us to enjoy His nature, His being.</p>
<p>To partake of God&rsquo;s nature is to partake of the elements, the ingredients, of God&rsquo;s being. God&rsquo;s nature denotes the riches of what God is in His nature. Hence, when we partake of the nature of God, we partake of the riches of God. For example, when we partake of His righteousness, holiness, kindness, love, and mercy, we partake of the constituents of God&rsquo;s nature. God&rsquo;s purpose in granting to us precious and exceedingly great promises is that we may become partakers of His divine nature. As believers in Christ, we have the position, the ability, and the provision to become partakers of the divine nature. As we enjoy God&rsquo;s nature, His holy nature becomes our holiness, and the nature of His virtues, such as humility, love, and kindness, becomes ours. These excellent virtues eventually consummate in glory. As 2 Peter 1:5-11 reveals, the enjoyment of the divine nature and development of the excellent virtues provide us a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Second Peter 1:5 says, &ldquo;For this very reason also, adding all diligence, supply bountifully in your faith virtue; and in virtue, knowledge.&rdquo; <em>Adding</em> literally means &ldquo;bringing in beside.&rdquo; Beside, along with, the precious and exceedingly great promises given to us by God, we should bring in all diligence to cooperate with the enabling of the dynamic divine nature for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s promises to have a rich entrance into the kingdom of the Lord.</p>
<p>In verse 5 the apostle Peter urges us to supply bountifully in our faith virtue. What the divine power has given us in verses 3 through 4 is developed in verses 5 through 7. To supply virtue in faith is to develop virtue in the exercise of faith. This principle applies to all the other items. The word <em>supply</em> in verse 5 actually means &ldquo;develop.&rdquo; Here, Peter is telling us to develop what we already have. We have faith, and now in our faith we need to develop virtue. This faith is the equally precious faith allotted to us by God as the common portion of the New Testament blessing of life for the initiation of our Christian life (v. 1). Faith needs to be exercised so that the virtue of the divine life may be developed and reach maturity.</p>
<p>Faith in 2 Peter 1 may be compared to a seed. In 1 Peter 1 the seed is the word with the life of Christ as its content (v. 23). In 2 Peter 1 this seed becomes our faith, which is the equally precious faith. This faith is one with Christ as the seed. After a seed has been sown into the soil, it needs to develop. The principle is the same in regard to the development of the seed of faith. We need to develop our faith with virtue. Literally, the Greek word for <em>virtue</em> means &ldquo;excellency.&rdquo; It denotes the energy of the divine life, which issues in vigorous action. If faith is regarded as a seed, virtue may be considered as a root that grows out of the seed.</p>
<p>The word <em>virtue</em> in verse 5 refers to the virtue mentioned in verse 3, in which Peter speaks of the One &ldquo;who has called us by His own glory and virtue.&rdquo; Furthermore, virtue is related to the divine nature, which denotes the riches of what God is. The virtue spoken of in verse 5 is the issue of the experience of the divine nature. When we partake of the divine nature, the different aspects of the riches of what God is, these riches become our virtues. For example, God is love, light, holiness, righteousness, and kindness. All these are God&rsquo;s attributes. Each divine attribute is also a virtue. When we enjoy what God is, we enjoy His holiness. His holiness then becomes a virtue in us and with us. The principle is the same with the enjoyment of all the other divine attributes.</p>
<p>The essence or element of virtue is contained in faith as a seed. This seed is actually Christ Himself, and Christ is God in all that God is. Because all that God is, is in Christ, Christ is the embodiment of God. It is this Christ who has become our inheritance. The response to, or reflection of, this embodiment within us is faith. All the divine attributes, all the riches of what God is, are included within faith as a seed. Because we possess the seed of faith with the divine nature, we must go on to develop this seed. The first result of the development of this seed is virtue.</p>
<p>In verse 5 Peter also tells us to supply &ldquo;in virtue, knowledge.&rdquo; Virtue, the vigorous action of the divine life, needs the bountiful supply of the knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord (vv. 2-3, 8) regarding all things that relate to the divine life and godliness and the partaking of the divine nature (vv. 3-4) for our enjoyment of the development described in verses 5 through 7. The knowledge that we should develop in our virtue includes the knowledge of our God and Savior, of God&rsquo;s economy, of faith, and of the divine power, glory, virtue, nature, and life. Actually, this knowledge is the knowledge of all things related to life and godliness. Without such knowledge, we have no way to have the development described in verses 5 through 7. Therefore, we must develop this knowledge in our virtue. This knowledge is the primary root that develops out of the seed of faith. Both virtue and knowledge indicate the growth of the seed.</p>
<p>Second Peter 1:6 continues, &ldquo;And in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control, endurance; and in endurance, godliness.&rdquo; Self-control, or temperance, is the exercise of control and restraint over the self in its passions, desires, and habits. This needs to be supplied and developed in knowledge for the proper growth in life. Once we have acquired knowledge, it is easy for us to become proud. For this reason, we need to develop in our knowledge self-control. Self-control implies restriction. Along with the development of virtue and knowledge, we need the restriction that comes with self-control.</p>
<p>Then in our self-control we need to develop endurance. Self-control is related to the self, but endurance is related to others and to our circumstances. In order to live a proper Christian life, we need endurance to bear with those around us and also with our environment and circumstances.</p>
<p>Following this, in our endurance we need to develop godliness. Godliness is a living that is like God and expresses God. As we exercise control over the self and bear with others and with circumstances, godliness needs to be developed in our spiritual life so that we may be like God and express Him. The Christian life should be a life that expresses God and bears God&rsquo;s likeness in all things.</p>
<p>In verse 7 Peter concludes, &ldquo;And in godliness, brotherly love; and in brotherly love, love.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;brotherly love&rdquo; is <em>philadelphia,</em> composed of <em>phileo,</em> &ldquo;to have affection for,&rdquo; and <em>adelphos,</em> &ldquo;a brother&rdquo;; hence, it is brotherly affection, a love characterized by delight and pleasure. In godliness, which is the expression of God, this love needs to be supplied for the brotherhood (1 Pet. 2:17; 3:8; Gal. 6:10), for our testimony to the world (John 13:34-35), and for the bearing of fruit (15:16-17).</p>
<p>The Greek word for <em>love</em> in verse 7 is <em>agape,</em> the word used in the New Testament for the divine love, which God is in His nature (1 John 4:8, 16). This love is nobler than human love. It adorns all the qualities of the Christian life (1 Cor. 13; Rom. 13:8-10; Gal. 5:13-14). It is stronger in ability and greater in capacity than human love (Matt. 5:44, 46), yet a believer who lives by the divine life (2 Pet. 1:3) and partakes of the divine nature (v. 4) can be saturated with it and express it in full. Such love needs to be developed in brotherly love to govern it and flow in it for the full expression of God, who is this love. Faith can be considered the seed of life, and this nobler love, the fruit in its full development (v. 8). The six steps of development in between are the stages of its growth unto maturity.</p>
<p>In verses 5 through 7 we have the development from faith to love. This development includes virtue, knowledge, self-control, endurance, godliness, and brotherly love. Eventually, there is the full development and maturity from the seed of faith, through the roots of virtue and knowledge, the trunk of self-control, and the branches of endurance and godliness, to the blossom of brotherly love and the fruit of love.</p>
<p>In verse 8 Peter goes on to say, &ldquo;For these things, existing in you and abounding, constitute you neither idle nor unfruitful unto the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The words <em>these things</em> refer to all the virtues covered in verses 5 through 7, from faith to love. The Greek word for <em>existing</em> denotes that certain things exist in and belong to a person from the beginning, thus becoming his rightful possession to the present. This indicates that all the virtues mentioned in verses 5 through 7 are the possession of the believers and exist in them eternally through their experience of partaking of the divine nature in all its riches.</p>
<p>The divine virtues not only exist in and are possessed by the believers but also abound and multiply in them in the development and growth of the divine life. All the virtues already exist in the seed, and now they are waiting for the opportunity to abound. In order for the virtues in the seed to abound, the seed needs to be sown into the soil and then to grow and develop until it blossoms and bears fruit. If these virtues exist and abound in us, they shall constitute us neither idle nor unfruitful unto the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. This indicates that the virtues of the divine life, the divine virtues, are the constituents, the elements, of our spiritual constitution, our spiritual being, that constitute us persons who do not have the element of idleness and unfruitfulness. Idleness and unfruitfulness are constituents of our fallen being; working, the energizing of life, and fruitfulness are the constituents of our being as we grow in the divine life. Peter&rsquo;s use of the word <em>unfruitful</em> in verse 8 indicates that what is covered in verses 5 through 7 is the development of the growth of the divine life unto its maturity.</p>
<p>Second Peter 1:9-10 says, &ldquo;For he in whom these things are not present is blind, being shortsighted, having forgotten the cleansing of his past sins. Therefore, brothers, be the more diligent to make your calling and selection firm, for doing these things you shall by no means ever stumble.&rdquo; To be diligent is to develop the spiritual virtues in the divine life, to advance in the growth of the divine life. This makes God&rsquo;s calling and selection of us firm.</p>
<p>If we are diligent to develop the virtues mentioned in verses 5 through 7 and are constituted with these virtues, we shall confirm, verify, our calling and selection. Hence, we shall never doubt that we have been called and selected by God. Furthermore, in developing these virtues we will not stumble, because we will have been thoroughly constituted with them.</p>
<p>Verse 11 indicates that the development of the divine seed unto its maturity will bountifully supply us a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. In this eternal kingdom we will not be subjects; rather, we will be kings. To be kings in the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we need maturity in life.</p>
<p>According to Peter&rsquo;s word in verses 5 through 11, to grow unto maturity is to develop what we have already received. We have been allotted equally precious faith, and this faith is an all-inclusive seed. All the divine riches are in this seed, but we must be diligent to develop them into virtue. Then we need to develop in our virtue knowledge; in knowledge, self-control; in self-control, endurance; in endurance, godliness; in godliness, brotherly love; and in brotherly love, love. By developing these virtues, we grow and eventually reach maturity. As a result, we shall be full of Christ; that is, we shall arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13). Then we shall be qualified and equipped to be kings in the coming kingdom; that is, we shall have a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Our corporate experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity begins by our entering into the kingdom of God. The New Testament shows that repentance and regeneration through believing in the Lord are not primarily for salvation but for the kingdom; moreover, God&rsquo;s salvation and the kingdom are mutually related. The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is the reign of God. It is a divine realm for us to enter into, a realm that requires the divine life. Having received the divine life through regeneration, we can be in the divine realm and participate in the divine kingdom.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after we have entered into God&rsquo;s kingdom through regeneration, we need to continue to enter richly into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The initial entrance into the kingdom of God is through regeneration, but the rich entrance is by the full development of our experience in the divine life as revealed in 2 Peter 1:5-11. We can enter into the eternal kingdom of our Lord because we have received from God&rsquo;s divine power all things related to life and godliness. We have also received the precious and exceedingly great promises for us to partake of and enjoy the nature of God. God&rsquo;s nature denotes the riches of what God is, that is, what God is in His nature. Therefore, when we partake of the nature of God, we partake of the riches of God. Because of this, the apostle Peter urges us that along with receiving the precious and exceedingly great promises given to us by God, we should be diligent to cooperate with the enabling of the dynamic divine nature by supplying bountifully in our faith virtue, that is, by developing virtue in the exercise of faith. This faith may be compared to a seed, and this seed contains Christ as the word of life. This seed becomes our faith, which is the equally precious faith.</p>
<p>In our faith we need to develop virtue&mdash;all things that relate to the divine life, to godliness, and to partaking of the divine nature. In knowledge we need to develop self-control&mdash;the exercise of control and restraint over the self in its passions, desires, and habits. In self-control we need to develop endurance, which is related to others and to our circumstances. In endurance we need to develop godliness&mdash;a living that is like God and expresses God. In godliness we need to develop brotherly love&mdash;a brotherly affection, a love characterized by delight and pleasure. Finally, in brotherly love we need to develop love&mdash;referring to the divine love, which God is in His nature. In this way we can reach full development and maturity in the divine life. Thus, all these virtues become our possession and exist in us eternally. Moreover, these virtues will abound and multiply, constituting us neither idle nor unfruitful unto the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, making our calling and selection firm so that we shall by no means ever stumble. The result is that we will be richly and bountifully supplied an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>We have seen that in the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the believers corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity by entering into the kingdom of God. In this lesson we will see that because we have entered into the kingdom of God, we need to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 5&mdash;7). If we desire to develop in the divine life to have a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we need to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Living in the Reality<br />
of the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2>
<p><em>The kingdom of the heavens</em> is a term used exclusively in the Gospel of Matthew, indicating that the kingdom of the heavens differs from the kingdom of God, which is mentioned in the other three Gospels. The kingdom of God is God&rsquo;s general reign from eternity past to eternity future. The kingdom of the heavens is a specific section within the kingdom of God, a section composed only of the church today and the heavenly part of the coming millennial kingdom. Hence, in the New Testament, the kingdom of the heavens, a section of the kingdom of God, is also called &ldquo;the kingdom of God&rdquo; in the other three Gospels.</p>
<p>According to Matthew, there are three aspects concerning the kingdom of the heavens: the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the inward content of the kingdom of the heavens in its heavenly and spiritual nature, as revealed in chapters 5 through 7. The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the outward state of the kingdom of the heavens in name, as revealed in chapter 13. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the practical coming of the kingdom of the heavens in power, as revealed in chapters 24 and 25. Both the reality and the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens are with the church today. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the proper church life (Rom. 14:17), which exists in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, known as Christendom. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the heavenly part of the coming millennial kingdom, which is referred to as the kingdom of the Father in Matthew 13:43. In the heavenly part of the millennial kingdom, which is the kingdom of the heavens manifested in power, the overcoming saints will reign with Christ for a thousand years (Rev. 20:4, 6). Today, as believers in Christ, we need to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens by entering into the kingdom of God for the corporate experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>Matthew 5 through 7 describes the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. The words spoken by the Lord Jesus in these chapters, as the revelation of the spiritual living and heavenly principles of the kingdom of the heavens, consist of seven sections (5:1-12, 13-16, 17-48; 6:1-18, 19-34; 7:1-12, 13-29). We will now briefly look at these sections to see the living of the believers in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><h2 class="head3">1. In the Heavenly Nature of the Kingdom People</h2>
<p>If we would live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, we must live in the heavenly nature of the kingdom people. Matthew 5:1-12 describes this nature in relation to nine blessings. Those who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens are poor in spirit, mourning for the present situation, meek in suffering opposition, hungry and thirsty for righteousness, merciful toward others, pure in heart, peaceful toward all men, suffering persecution for righteousness, and bearing reproach and evil speaking on behalf of the Lord.</p>
<p>Verse 3 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; The word <em>spirit</em> refers not to the Spirit of God but to our human spirit, the deepest part of our being, the organ by which we contact God and realize spiritual things. To be poor in spirit is not only to be humble but also to be emptied in our spirit, in the depth of our being, not holding on to the old things of the old dispensation but unloaded to receive new things, the things of the kingdom of the heavens. We need to be poor in this part of our being so that we may realize and possess the kingdom of the heavens. If we are poor in spirit, the kingdom of the heavens is ours; we are in its reality now in the church age, and we will share in its manifestation in the kingdom age.</p>
<p>In verse 4 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.&rdquo; The entire situation of the world is negative toward God&rsquo;s economy. Satan, sin, self, darkness, and worldliness predominate among all the people on earth. God&rsquo;s glory is insulted, Christ is rejected, the Holy Spirit is frustrated, the church is desolate, the self is corrupt, and the whole world is evil. God wants us to mourn over such a situation. If we mourn according to God and His economy, we will be comforted by being rewarded with the kingdom of the heavens. We will see God&rsquo;s heavenly ruling over the entire negative situation.</p>
<p> Verse 5 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.&rdquo; Verse 3 speaks of being poor in spirit, verse 4 speaks of mourning, and verse 5 speaks of being meek. To be meek does not mean simply to be gentle, humble, and submissive. To be meek means not to resist the world&rsquo;s opposition but to suffer it willingly. To be meek means not to fight or resist. If we are meek, willing to suffer the world&rsquo;s opposition in this age, we will inherit the earth in the coming age, as revealed in Luke 19:17, 19 and Hebrews 2:5-8.</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:6 the Lord said, &ldquo;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.&rdquo; <em>Righteousness</em> here denotes our being right in our behavior. We need to hunger and thirst for this righteousness, to seek after such righteousness, that we may enter into the kingdom of the heavens (vv. 10, 20). This righteousness is related to what we are inwardly, which is indicated by the fact that we are told to hunger and thirst for righteousness so that we may be satisfied. If we hunger and thirst for righteousness, God will grant us the very righteousness we seek, that we may be satisfied.</p>
<p>In verse 7 the Lord continued, &ldquo;Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be shown mercy.&rdquo; To be righteous is to give one what he deserves, whereas to be merciful is to give one what he does not deserve. For the kingdom of the heavens, we need to be not only righteous but also merciful. To receive mercy is to receive what we do not deserve. If we are merciful to others, the Lord will grant us mercy (2 Tim. 1:16, 18), especially at His judgment seat (James 2:12-13). If we judge our brother without mercy today, we will not receive any mercy at the judgment seat of Christ. However, if we have mercy on our brother, the Lord will have mercy on us at His judgment seat. Thus, we should be strict in dealing with ourselves but merciful in dealing with others. This also is a matter related to our inward being.</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:8 the Lord continued, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.&rdquo; To be pure in heart is to be single in purpose, to have the single goal of accomplishing God&rsquo;s will for God&rsquo;s glory (1 Cor. 10:31). This is for the kingdom of the heavens. Our spirit is the organ by which we receive Christ (John 1:12; 3:6), whereas our heart is the ground where Christ as the seed of life grows (Matt. 13:19). For the kingdom of the heavens we need to be poor in spirit, empty in our spirit, so that we may receive Christ. We also need to be pure, single, in our heart so that Christ may grow in us without frustration. If we are pure in heart in seeking God, we will see God. Seeing God is a reward to the pure in heart. This blessing is both for today and for the coming age.</p>
<p>Verse 9 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God.&rdquo; Satan, the rebellious one, is the instigator of all rebellion. For the kingdom of the heavens, under its heavenly ruling, we must be those who make peace among men (Heb. 12:14). The sons of the devil make trouble, but the sons of God make peace. As the Son of God, the Lord Jesus made peace with God and with man. Now, as the sons of God, we must follow Him to make peace. Our Father is the God of peace (Rom. 15:33; 16:20), having a peaceful life with a peaceful nature. As those born of Him, if we would be peacemakers, we must walk in His divine life and according to His divine nature. In this way we will express His life and nature and be called the sons of God.</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:10-11 the Lord Jesus spoke of the believers being persecuted and reproached. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; The whole world lies in the evil one and is filled with unrighteousness (1 John 5:19). If we hunger and thirst for righteousness, we will be persecuted for the sake of righteousness. For the sake of the kingdom of the heavens, we need to pay a price for the righteousness that we seek. If we are righteous, we shall be condemned, opposed, and persecuted. If we seek righteousness at a cost, the kingdom of the heavens is ours; we are in its reality now, and we will be rewarded with its manifestation in the coming age.</p>
<p>The Lord concluded His words concerning the nature of the kingdom people in Matthew 5:11, saying, &ldquo;Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me.&rdquo; The persecution in verse 10 is for the sake of righteousness, because of our seeking for righteousness, whereas the persecution in verse 11 is directly on account of Christ, because of our following Him. When we live a life for the kingdom of the heavens, in the spiritual nature of the kingdom and according to the heavenly principles of the kingdom, we are reproached, persecuted, and evilly spoken of, mostly by the religious people, who hold to their traditional religious concepts.</p>
<p>In verse 12 the Lord Jesus spoke an encouraging word to those who are persecuted for His sake: &ldquo;Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.&rdquo; This reward indicates that all the results of the foregoing blessings are also rewards. This reward is great and is in the heavens; it is a heavenly reward, not an earthly one.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Being the Salt of the Earth<br />
to Restrict the Corruption of the Earth<br />
and Being the Light of the World<br />
to Enlighten the World</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus, in speaking of the believers&rsquo; influence on the world, said that we are the salt of the earth and the light of the world (vv. 13-14). There is a difference between the earth and the world. The earth was created by God, whereas the world came into being through the corruption of the earth. We are salt to the God-created earth and light to the Satan-corrupted world.</p>
<p>The first part of verse 13 says, &ldquo;You are the salt of the earth.&rdquo; Salt, by nature, is an element that kills and eliminates the germs of corruption. To the corrupted earth the believers who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens are such an element, keeping the earth from being fully corrupted. This means that the believers exercise influence over the God-created earth. The believers, as salt with its killing and preserving function, bring the earth back to its original condition and preserve it in that condition. Hence, the function of the believers is to preserve what God has created. As the salt of the earth, we have the function of killing germs and eliminating rottenness, that is, of preserving things in their original condition or of bringing them back to their God-created condition. Eventually, when the millennial kingdom comes, all the germs on the earth will be utterly killed, and the whole earth will be regained by Christ and brought back to its God-created condition. In this age, wherever the believers are, they should exercise a salting influence over those around them.</p>
<p>Regarding the earth, there is the need of salt; regarding the world, there is the need of light. Darkness is not related to the earth but to the world. The world refers to human society, Satan&rsquo;s system. The dark human society of the world, the satanic system, needs light. Therefore, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;You are the light of the world&rdquo; (v. 14a). The believers are the light that effaces the world&rsquo;s darkness.</p>
<p>In verses 14 and 15 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;It is impossible for a city situated upon a mountain to be hidden. Nor do men light a lamp and place it under the bushel, but on the lampstand; and it shines to all who are in the house.&rdquo; Here the Lord spoke regarding the believers&rsquo; outward and inward shining. The light as a city on a mountain shines outwardly upon those outside, whereas the lighted lamp on the lampstand shines inwardly to those who are in the house. As the city, the light shines upon people, but as the lamp in the house, the light shines into people. This indicates that our influence over others should not merely be outward but also inward. The outward shining is general, but the inward shining is particular. A city situated on the mountain has a general outward shining, but a lamp on a lampstand has a particular inward shining. This inward shining penetrates the inward being of others and convinces them.</p>
<p>Eventually, both aspects of our shining will give glory to the Father. Verse 16 says, &ldquo;In the same way, let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in the heavens.&rdquo; Good works constitute the behavior and living of the believers who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. Through such works men can see God and be brought to Him. Our shining glorifies the Father because it expresses God. Glory is God expressed. When we express God in our behavior and good works, men see God and give the glory to God. If we are such a shining light, God will be expressed in our shining, and all those around us will see glory, God expressed. When others see God in our shining, it is a glory to God. As a city without and as a lamp within, we shine to express God, to let God have the glory in the eyes of others.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Practicing the Higher Law<br />
of the Heavenly Kingdom and<br />
Having the Surpassing Righteousness</h2>
<p>The believers who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens practice the higher law of the kingdom of the heavens and have the surpassing righteousness. In 5:17-48 the Lord Jesus decreed the law of the kingdom people. As the children of our Father, we must now fulfill this new law, the higher law, through the resurrection life, the eternal life of the Father.</p>
<p>In verse 20 the Lord said, &ldquo;I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; <em>Righteousness</em> does not refer only to objective righteousness, which is the Christ whom we receive when we believe in Him and thus are justified before God (1 Cor. 1:30, Rom. 3:26); it refers even more to subjective righteousness, which is the indwelling Christ lived out of us as our righteousness that we may live in the reality of the kingdom today and enter into its manifestation in the future. This subjective righteousness, which is according to the new law of the kingdom, surpasses the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees. It is impossible for our natural life to gain this surpassing righteousness; it can be produced only by a higher life, the resurrection life of Christ.</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:48 the Lord said, &ldquo;You therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.&rdquo; For us to be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect means that we are perfect in His love. We are the Father&rsquo;s children, having the Father&rsquo;s divine life and divine nature. Hence, we can be perfect as our Father is perfect. The demand of the new law of the kingdom can be met only by the Father&rsquo;s divine life, not by the natural life. The kingdom of the heavens is the highest demand, and the divine life of the Father is the highest supply to meet that demand.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Doing Righteous Deeds<br />
and Contacting God in Secret,<br />
without Making a Show</h2>
<p>Matthew 6:1-18 speaks concerning the righteous deeds of the kingdom people. The Lord said, &ldquo;Take care not to do your righteousness before men in order to be gazed at by them; otherwise, you have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens&rdquo; (v. 1). Righteousness here denotes righteous deeds. Man&rsquo;s flesh, seeking to glorify itself, always wants to do good deeds before men in order to gain men&rsquo;s praise. However, the kingdom people, who live in an emptied and humbled spirit and walk in a pure and single heart under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, are not allowed to do anything in the flesh to gain the praise of men but must do all things in the spirit in order to please their heavenly Father. Their doing righteous deeds is not to gain man&rsquo;s glory but to receive the Father&rsquo;s reward.</p>
<p>The believers should live by the Father&rsquo;s divine life and walk according to their spirit. Hence, they are required to do good things in secret, not in public (vv. 3-4). Public exhibition does not correspond with the mysterious, hidden nature of the divine life.</p>
<p>In all His illustrations, regarding giving alms, praying, and fasting, the Lord Jesus used the word <em>secret</em> (vv. 4, 6, 18). We must do our righteous deeds in secret, for our Father is in secret. As children of the heavenly Father, we must live in the presence of the Father and care for the Father&rsquo;s presence. The Father sees in secret whatever we do in secret for the Father&rsquo;s kingdom. The Father&rsquo;s seeing in secret is an incentive for doing our righteous deeds in secret. Eventually, the Father will repay us. This may take place in this age (2 Cor. 9:10-11) or in the coming age as a reward (Luke 14:14).</p><h2 class="head3">5. Not Loving or Serving Mammon,<br />
but Loving and Serving God</h2>
<p>In Matthew 6:19-34 the Lord Jesus spoke regarding dealing with material riches. In this portion of the Word the Lord told us not to love or serve mammon but to love and serve God. In verse 20 He said, &ldquo;Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven.&rdquo; To store up treasures in heaven is to give material things to the poor (19:21) and to take care of the needy saints and the Lord&rsquo;s servants (Acts 2:45; 4:34-35; 11:29; Rom. 15:26; Phil. 4:16-17).</p>
<p>In Matthew 6:21 the Lord said, &ldquo;Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.&rdquo; We must send our treasure to heaven so that our heart can also be in heaven.</p>
<p>In verse 22 the Lord continued and said, &ldquo;The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light.&rdquo; Our two eyes can focus on only one thing at a time. If we endeavor to see two things at once, our vision will be blurred. If we focus our eyes on one thing, our vision will be single and our whole body will be full of light. If we store up our treasure in heaven and on earth, our vision will be blurred. For our vision to be single, we must store up our treasure in only one place.</p>
<p>In verse 24 the Lord told us that we cannot serve two masters: &ldquo;No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.&rdquo; The word <em>mammon</em> is an Aramaic word signifying wealth, riches. Mammon stands in opposition to God, indicating that wealth, or riches, is the opponent of God, robbing God&rsquo;s people of their service to Him. As people who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, we should not let mammon replace God in our living. Instead of loving and serving riches, we should love and serve God. This is an aspect of living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>In verse 33 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.&rdquo; The Father&rsquo;s kingdom is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today, the reality of the church life today, and will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the coming age. The Father&rsquo;s righteousness is the righteousness expressed by keeping the new law of the kingdom. This righteousness is Christ lived out by the kingdom people. If we seek first the kingdom of our Father and His righteousness, not only will His kingdom and His righteousness be given to us, but also all that we need will be added to us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Dealing More with Ourselves Than with Others</h2>
<p>As those who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, we should deal more with ourselves than with others (7:1-12). The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Do not judge, that you be not judged. For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you&rdquo; (vv. 1-2). Living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, we should always judge ourselves, not others. Under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, the believers will be judged with what they judge others. If we judge others with righteousness, the Lord will judge us with righteousness; if we judge others with mercy, we will be judged with mercy by the Lord.</p>
<p>Matthew 7:3-5 says, &ldquo;Why do you look at the splinter which is in your brother&rsquo;s eye, but the beam in your eye you do not consider? Or how can you say to your brother, Let me remove the splinter from your eye, and behold, the beam is in your eye? Hypocrite, first remove the beam from your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the splinter from your brother&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo; In these verses we see that as people living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, we must consider the beam in our own eye whenever we look at a splinter in our brother&rsquo;s eye. A splinter in our brother&rsquo;s eye must remind us that we have a beam in our own eye. Then we will deal with ourselves more than with others. We must deal more strictly with ourselves than with others.</p><h2 class="head3">7. Walking on the Way That Leads to Life<br />
and Receiving Christ&rsquo;s Words<br />
as the Foundation of Our Living and Work<br />
So That We May Do the Father&rsquo;s Will</h2>
<p>Finally, if we live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, we need to walk on the way that leads to life and receive Christ&rsquo;s words as the foundation of our living and work so that we may do the Father&rsquo;s will. In 7:13-14 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Enter in through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it. Because narrow is the gate and constricted is the way that leads to life, and few are those who find it.&rdquo; In verse 13, <em>destruction</em> does not refer to the perishing of the person himself, but to the destruction of a person&rsquo;s deeds and works (1 Cor. 3:15). In Matthew 7:14 <em>life</em> refers to the ever-blessed condition of the kingdom, which is filled with the eternal life of God. This life is in the reality of the kingdom today and will be in the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age (19:29; Luke 18:30).</p>
<p>The gate is narrow and the way is constricted because the new law of the kingdom is stricter and the demand of the kingdom higher than the law and the demand of the old covenant. The narrow gate deals not only with outward conduct but also with inward motive. The old man, the self, the flesh, the human concept, and the world with its glory are all excluded; only that which corresponds with God&rsquo;s will can enter in. If we would live in the reality of the kingdom, we first need to enter in through such a narrow gate and then to walk on such a constricted way. To enter in through the narrow gate is simply to begin walking on the way, a way that is lifelong.</p>
<p>We should not only walk on the way that leads to life but also receive the words of Christ as the foundation of our living and work. Everything we do in our living and work must have the word of Christ as its foundation. The Lord said, &ldquo;Everyone therefore who hears these words of Mine and does them shall be likened to a prudent man who built his house upon the rock&rdquo; (Matt. 7:24). <em>Rock</em> does not refer to Christ but to His wise word, the word that reveals the will of His Father. Our living and work must be founded on the word of Christ for the accomplishing of the will of the heavenly Father. To take Christ&rsquo;s words as the foundation of our living and work is to enter the narrow gate and walk on the constricted way that leads to life.</p>
<p>Concerning the house built upon the rock, the Lord said, &ldquo;The rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and they beat against that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock&rdquo; (v. 25). The rain, which descends from the heavens, is of God; the rivers, which come from the earth, are of man; and the winds, which blow from the air, are of Satan. All these will test our living and work. Although the rain may descend, the rivers may come, and the winds may blow, the house built upon the rock will not fall because it is built according to the constricted way, the way of doing the will of the Father. The house built on the rock, a house that does not fall, is like the work that is built with gold, silver, and precious stones, a work that can stand the testing fire (1 Cor. 3:12-13). However, the house built upon the sand of our human concepts and natural ways will surely fall (Matt. 7:26-27). If we do not receive the words of Christ as the foundation of our life and work, eventually all that we have done will be destroyed.</p>
<p>To do the will of the Father, we must walk on the way that leads to life and receive the words of Christ as the foundation of our life and work. In verse 21 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens.&rdquo; To enter into the kingdom of the heavens, we need to do two things: call on the Lord and do the will of the heavenly Father. To call on the Lord suffices for us to be saved (Rom. 10:13), but to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, we also need to do the will of the heavenly Father. Since entering into the kingdom of the heavens also requires doing the will of the heavenly Father, it is clearly different from entering into the kingdom of God through regeneration (John 3:3, 5). The latter entrance is through being born of the divine life; the former is through the living of that life.</p>
<p>If we live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, we will do the will of the Father who is in the heavens. We are not here to do anything other than the will of the Father. In order to do the will of the Father, we need to walk on the constricted way, the way that leads to life. Our Father has a will to accomplish, but we can accomplish it only by His life. Hence, we need to live in and by the life of the heavenly Father. Such a living is for the doing of the Father&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>Matthew 16 reveals that the Father&rsquo;s will is to build the church upon the Son as the rock. This is fully developed in the Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation. The New Testament reveals that God&rsquo;s divine and eternal will is to build up the church. The believers who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, corporately experiencing the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, walk on the way that leads to life and receive the words of Christ as the foundation of their living and work so that they can do the Father&rsquo;s will, which is to build up the church as the corporate expression of the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>As believers in Christ, we need to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens by entering into the kingdom of God to corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. Matthew 5 through 7 describes the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, revealing the spiritual life and the heavenly principles related to the kingdom of the heavens; these chapters consist of seven sections. Since we have entered into the kingdom of God, we need to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens according to what is portrayed in these sections. First, we must be in the heavenly nature of the kingdom people. Matthew 5:1-12 describes the heavenly nature of the kingdom people in relation to nine blessings, including being poor in spirit, mournful of the present situation, meek in suffering oppositions, hungry and thirsty for righteousness, merciful toward others, pure in heart, peaceful toward all men, suffering persecution for righteousness, and bearing reproach and evil speaking on behalf of the Lord. Second, we must be the salt of the earth to restrict the corruption of the earth and be the light of the world to enlighten the world. Third, we need to practice the higher law of the heavenly kingdom and have the surpassing righteousness. In 5:17-48 the Lord Jesus decreed the law of the kingdom people. As children of our Father, we now need to fulfill this new law, the higher law, through the divine life, the eternal life of the Father. Fourth, we need to do righteous deeds and contact God in secret without making a show. Whatever we do in secret for the Father&rsquo;s kingdom, whether it is giving alms, praying, or fasting, the Father sees in secret and will repay us. Fifth, we need to not love or serve mammon but to love and serve God. When we seek first the kingdom of our heavenly Father and His righteousness, not only will His kingdom and His righteousness be given to us, but also all that we need will be added to us. Sixth, we need to deal more with ourselves than with others. Living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, we always judge ourselves and not others. Seventh, we need to walk on the way that leads to life and accept the words of Christ as the foundation of our living and work so that we may do the will of the Father. In order to do the will of the Father, we need to walk on the constricted way, the way that leads to life, for the building up of the church as the corporate expression of the Triune God.</p>

<p>In this lesson we will go on to look at the matter of the believers&rsquo; corporate experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity through entering into the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Living the Kingdom Life<br />
in the Church</h2>
<p>As believers in Christ, we are living the kingdom life in the church life because the church is the kingdom of God in the present age (Matt. 16:18-19; 1 Cor. 6:10; Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5). In one sense, the church is God&rsquo;s family, God&rsquo;s home (2:19; 1 Tim. 3:15); in this home we enjoy grace and receive the life supply. In another sense, the church is also a kingdom. The church is a family, a home that is full of grace and life, yet the church is also a kingdom, a government. The church is our home, and the church is the kingdom. In our home we have the enjoyment of love, the supply of grace, and the riches of life. In the kingdom we have rule, exercise, and discipline.</p>
<p>Romans 14:17 is strong proof that the church is the kingdom of God: &ldquo;The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Here the apostle does not say <em>will be;</em> rather, he uses the present tense <em>is</em> in reference to the kingdom of God. Romans 14 speaks of receiving the believers; hence, according to the entire context, the kingdom is the church life. The reality of the church life is the kingdom. Romans 12 speaks of the Body life, and Romans 14 speaks of the kingdom life. This indicates that in the book of Romans the kingdom life is the reality of the Body life.</p>
<p>Romans 14 says that the kingdom of God is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. When the authority of the kingdom of God is operating within us, righteousness, peace, and joy become the characteristics of our daily living. Righteousness, peace, and joy mean a great deal; these items are the expression of Christ. When Christ is expressed, He is our righteousness toward ourselves, our peace toward others, and our joy before God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Righteous toward Ourselves</h2>
<p>When the believers live the kingdom life in the church, they live a life that is righteous toward themselves. This means that in the practical kingdom life in the church today, we must be strict with ourselves and make no excuses for ourselves. Toward ourselves we must be strict and righteous in everything we do.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Peaceful toward Others</h2>
<p>Furthermore, in living the kingdom life in the church, the believers live a life of peace toward others. This means that our relationship with others must have the characteristic of peace. Toward others we must endeavor to pursue peace, continually seeking to be at peace with them. We must be careful to maintain peace with everyone related to us. This peace is in actuality Christ lived out from our being. Hebrews 12:14 says, &ldquo;Pursue peace with all men.&rdquo; Ephesians 4:3 tells us to be &ldquo;diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.&rdquo; Peace and righteousness are always related to one another. Without righteousness, we cannot have peace. Righteousness must come first; then peace follows. If we deal with ourselves in righteousness, we will have peace with others.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Joyful toward God in the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Lastly, to live the kingdom life in the church we need to live a joyful life toward God in the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a Spirit of joy. If we have no joy, this indicates that we have failed and are not in the Holy Spirit. If we truly live the kingdom life, we will be joyful toward God and praise Him. If our living is righteous toward ourselves and peaceful toward others, we will have joy toward God in the Holy Spirit. Then the kingdom will be manifested in our daily life in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Working for the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>In Colossians 4:11 the apostle Paul told the saints in Colossae that his co-workers were fellow workers for the kingdom of God. This indicates that their work in the gospel for the establishing and building up of the churches was for the kingdom of God. This means that the reality of the kingdom of God is the reality of the church in the present age and that what the apostle and his co-workers did was to establish and build up churches.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Partaking of the Kingdom</h2>
<p>Revelation 1:9 says, &ldquo;I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus.&rdquo; This verse clearly indicates that today we are partakers of the kingdom. John knew that he was in the kingdom. To him, the kingdom was not only for a future age but was a present reality. Thus, he could say that he was a fellow partaker in the kingdom. This kingdom is the kingdom that we have entered through regeneration (John 3:3, 5). Without being regenerated into God&rsquo;s kingdom, we would have no way to be fellow partakers in the kingdom. Having been regenerated into the kingdom, we should remain in it, partaking of the kingdom by accepting the heavenly ruling of the divine nature. Furthermore, in Revelation 1:9, in regard to the kingdom, John said that he is our &ldquo;brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus.&rdquo; This indicates that for tribulation and the kingdom, endurance is needed. To endure the tribulation related to the kingdom, we need the endurance in Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. In Tribulation</h2>
<p>In Matthew 5:10-12 the Lord Jesus said that His believers would suffer persecution for the sake of the kingdom. If we suffer for the sake of righteousness, we are in the kingdom. The more we are in the kingdom, the more we will suffer and be persecuted. Therefore, being in the kingdom today is not a matter of glory but a matter of bearing reproach and persecution. Although we are fellow partakers in the kingdom of Jesus, we are not yet co-kings with Christ. When He comes back, we shall be His co-kings in the kingdom of Christ. That will be the time of glory. However, today is not a day of reigning but a day of suffering. At present, we are not in the reigning aspect of the kingdom but in the suffering aspect.</p>
<p>For this reason Paul and Barnabas told the disciples, &ldquo;Through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God&rdquo; (Acts 14:22). The tribulations they spoke of were mainly due to persecution from the Jewish religion. All believers in Christ experience persecution from religion. If there were no religion in the world today, we would not suffer much persecution. Most trouble, persecution, and opposition can be traced back to one source&mdash;religion. While we suffer, we are in the kingdom, a realm in which we are being exercised, trained, and prepared so that we may be qualified to reign in the kingdom of Christ as His co-kings.</p>
<p>The kingdom of God was the main subject of the apostles&rsquo; preaching in Acts (8:12; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31). The kingdom of God is not a material kingdom visible to human sight but a kingdom related to the divine life. The kingdom of God is the spreading of Christ as life in His believers, forming a realm in which God rules through His life. The kingdom of God is actually Christ Himself (Luke 17:21) as the seed of life sown into His believers (Mark 4:3, 26) and developing into a realm that God rules as His kingdom through the divine life. To enter into the kingdom of God is to enter into the full enjoyment of Christ as the kingdom. However, the whole world opposes God&rsquo;s people entering into the full enjoyment of Christ as the kingdom. Throughout the centuries religion, in particular, has been utilized by God&rsquo;s enemy to keep God&rsquo;s people from entering into the full enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ as the kingdom of God. For this reason we must experience many tribulations to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>We should expect opposition and be prepared for it. Nevertheless, in all the tribulations we must endeavor to enter into the realm of the full enjoyment of the resurrected and ascended Christ as the kingdom of God. When we have the enjoyment of such a Christ, we will be under the divine rule. In this way, we will become the kingdom of God, which is the proper church life. The kingdom of God is the church life, and the church life is the realm of the enjoyment of the resurrected and ascended Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">2. In Endurance</h2>
<p>We partake of the kingdom not only in tribulation but also in endurance. For both tribulation and the kingdom we need endurance. If we lack endurance, we will only be able to withstand persecution for a limited time. However, as we live in Christ, we partake not only of His life and holiness but also of His endurance. When we abide in Christ, we partake of His endurance and acquire the endurance to bear suffering and opposition. The Lord&rsquo;s word is even called the word of endurance (Rev. 3:10). The word of the Lord&rsquo;s endurance is the word of the Lord&rsquo;s suffering. The Lord today is still bearing rejection and persecution through His endurance. We are fellow partakers not only of His kingdom but also of His endurance. Hence, His word to us is the word of endurance. To keep His word of endurance, we must bear His rejection and persecution.</p>
<p>The world opposes and rejects the Lord Jesus, but He does not resist or fight back. He simply endures. As we have fellowship with Him and abide in Him, we partake of His endurance. As His followers, we must follow Him with endurance (Heb. 12:1). In this way we can also endure persecution and opposition. This is strong proof that we are waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. We are waiting for His coming back by being fellow partakers in His kingdom, tribulation, and endurance.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Inheriting the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>If we live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and partake of the kingdom, we will inherit the kingdom of God (1 Cor. 6:9-10; Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5). Inheriting the kingdom of God is different from entering into the kingdom of God through regeneration. We have already been regenerated into the kingdom, and now we need to grow and develop in the divine life. The issue of our growth and development will be our inheritance of the kingdom of God. Unless we grow to maturity in the proper development of the divine life, we will have no way to inherit the kingdom.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 6, Galatians 5, and Ephesians 5 all speak of inheriting the kingdom of God. In 1 Corinthians 6:9 Paul asks, &ldquo;Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?&rdquo; To inherit the kingdom of God in the next age is a reward to the saints who seek righteousness (Matt. 5:10, 20; 6:33). The unrighteous believers cannot inherit the kingdom of God. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew, we must be absolutely righteous in order to inherit the coming kingdom as a reward. The Lord even says that our righteousness must surpass that of the Pharisees (5:20). Because God&rsquo;s kingdom is established upon righteousness, we must be righteous in order to inherit it.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 6:9-10 speaks of various kinds of persons who cannot inherit the kingdom of God. To enter into the kingdom of God, we need only to be regenerated (John 3:3, 5), but to inherit the kingdom of God, we need to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today. No sinful person or unrighteous person has any part in the coming kingdom of God. The word <em>inherit</em> in 1 Corinthians 6:9 implies enjoyment. To inherit something is to enjoy it. Thus, to inherit the coming kingdom means to enjoy the kingdom. The coming kingdom will be a joyful inheritance to the overcomers. Moreover, according to Matthew, the manifestation of the kingdom will be a reward to the overcoming saints as their enjoyment with the Lord. Therefore, to inherit the kingdom is not only to enter the kingdom; it is to receive the kingdom for our enjoyment as a reward. This should be an incentive for us to live an overcoming life, a life that is sinless and righteous. By living a righteous life we shall be qualified to inherit the coming kingdom.</p>
<p>Concerning the works of the flesh, in Galatians 5:21 Paul says, &ldquo;Those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.&rdquo; The inheritance of the kingdom of God refers to the enjoyment of the coming kingdom as a reward to the overcoming believers. This is not a matter of a believer&rsquo;s salvation. The believers who practice the works of the flesh listed in Galatians 5:19-21 will not inherit the coming kingdom as a reward.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 5:5 Paul again speaks of those who have &ldquo;no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.&rdquo; The kingdom of Christ is the millennial kingdom (Rev. 20:4, 6; Matt. 16:28) and also the kingdom of God (13:41, 43). The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God (John 3:3, 5), and they are in the church life, living in the kingdom of God today (Rom. 14:17). Only the overcoming ones, not all believers, will participate in the millennial kingdom. In the coming age the unclean, defeated ones will have no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</p>
<p>According to John 3, all the regenerated ones are in the kingdom of God. Romans 14:17 also indicates that the church life is the kingdom of God today. However, the kingdom will be more manifest in the millennium than in the church life today. Only in the millennium does the kingdom of Christ also become the kingdom of God. Therefore, the term <em>the kingdom of Christ and of God</em> does not refer to the kingdom as realized in the church life today but to the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming millennial kingdom. Presently all believers are in the kingdom of God, but not all of them will have an inheritance in the coming millennial kingdom. In the church as the kingdom of God there are both those who are defeated and those who are overcoming. However, only the overcoming ones will inherit the kingdom during the millennium.</p><h2 class="head2">H. Saved into the Heavenly Kingdom of the Lord</h2>
<p>Shortly before his martyrdom, Paul indicated that he firmly believed that the Lord would bring him into the heavenly kingdom. Therefore, he said to his spiritual son Timothy, &ldquo;The Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will save me into His heavenly kingdom&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:18). The heavenly kingdom is &ldquo;the kingdom of their Father&rdquo; (Matt. 13:43), &ldquo;the kingdom of My Father&rdquo; (26:29), &ldquo;the kingdom of Christ and of God&rdquo; (Eph. 5:5), and &ldquo;the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ&rdquo; (2 Pet. 1:11), which will be a reward to the overcoming saints. It equals the crown of righteousness in 2 Timothy 4:8 and is an incentive to the believers to run the heavenly race. Paul had the assurance to triumphantly declare that he would be saved into this heavenly kingdom.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation and the kingdom are mutually related. Salvation is a matter of enjoyment and supply. We live the kingdom life by God&rsquo;s salvation with its enjoyment and supply; however, the kingdom life in this age also involves exercise and discipline. Nevertheless, we live the kingdom life by God&rsquo;s salvation with its enjoyment and supply. In His salvation, God gives us enjoyment, but in the kingdom, He disciplines us. In the kingdom, we apply what God gives us in His salvation so that we may be exercised according to the nature of the kingdom and the development of the divine life. Today the kingdom is an exercise and a discipline to us, but the coming kingdom will be a reward to the faithful believers who walk on the Lord&rsquo;s way. To those who deviate from and leave the central line of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, it will be a punishment. As a future reward, the kingdom is an incentive, encouraging us to be faithful to take the way of the Lord. As a punishment, the kingdom is a warning, cautioning us not to be disobedient to the vision we have seen.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus comes back, the indifferent and unfaithful believers will not receive the same reward as those who are faithful. If the Lord were to give the same reward to both the faithful and the unfaithful, He would be unrighteous. Paul realized that the Lord is the righteous Judge; hence, he said, &ldquo;There is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, with which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will recompense me in that day, and not only me but also all those who have loved His appearing&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:8). The crown, a symbol of glory, is given as a prize, in addition to the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, to the triumphant runner of the race (1 Cor. 9:25). In contrast to salvation, which is of grace and by faith (Eph. 2:5, 8-9), this prize is of righteousness through works (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 2 Cor. 5:10). The believers will be recompensed with such a reward, not according to the grace of the Lord but according to His righteousness. Hence, it is the crown of righteousness. The Recompenser is the Lord as the righteous Judge, not as the merciful God or the gracious Redeemer. Salvation was prepared according to the Lord&rsquo;s love and grace, whereas the reward is prepared according to His justice and righteousness. For this reason, the Lord cannot give, in His righteousness, the same kind of reward to both the faithful and the unfaithful.</p>
<p>Once we are saved, we are eternally saved. Our salvation cannot be lost. However, when the Lord comes back, whether or not we will receive a reward is still a question. Paul says, &ldquo;If anyone&rsquo;s work which he has built upon the foundation remains, he will receive a reward; if anyone&rsquo;s work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:14-15). The reward is based on the believer&rsquo;s work after he is saved, whereas salvation is based on faith in the Lord and His redemptive work. The loss in verse 15 is the loss of reward, not the loss of salvation. The salvation that we have received in Christ is not by our works (Titus 3:5) and is eternal, unchangeable in nature (Heb. 5:9; John 10:28-29). Hence, those believers whose Christian works are not approved by the judging Lord and who suffer the loss of reward will still be saved. God&rsquo;s salvation as a free gift to all believers is for eternity, whereas the Lord&rsquo;s reward to those believers whose Christian works are approved by Him is for the kingdom age. This reward is an incentive for their Christian work.</p>
<p>Those believers whose Christian works are not approved by the Lord at His coming back will be saved, yet so as through fire (1 Cor. 3:15). <em>Through fire</em> surely indicates punishment. This word should be a solemn warning to us today concerning our Christian works. We have already received the Lord&rsquo;s unique, eternal, common faith (Titus 1:4), but we still need to be faithful in taking the Lord&rsquo;s way so that we may receive a reward, that is, to enter into His joy and to be co-kings with Him in the coming kingdom to rule over the nations.</p>
<p>As those who are under the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we need to live in the reality of kingdom of the heavens. We need to live the kingdom life in the church life and to develop ourselves in the divine life until we reach maturity. Then we will richly enter into the coming kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The faithful and mature ones will receive a reward from the Lord, but the unfaithful will receive dispensational punishment. The incentive of the reward and the warning concerning punishment should encourage us to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today, faithfully taking the way of the Lord and diligently growing unto maturity in the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>As the believers in Christ, we are presently living the kingdom life in the church life because the church is the kingdom of God in the present age. In Romans 14:17 we see that the kingdom of God is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. When the authority of the kingdom of God is operating within us, righteousness, peace, and joy will characterize our daily living. When we live the kingdom life in the church life, we are righteous toward ourselves, peaceful toward others, and joyful before God in the Holy Spirit. We not only live such a kingdom life but also work for the kingdom of God, practically building up the church and thereby partaking of the kingdom. We have already been regenerated into the kingdom; hence, we should remain in it, partaking of it by accepting the heavenly ruling of the divine nature.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in Revelation 1:9 John spoke concerning the kingdom, saying that he is our brother, a fellow partaker in the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance in Jesus. This indicates that for tribulation and the kingdom, endurance is needed. For us to endure tribulation for the kingdom, we need the endurance in Jesus. When we experience tribulation, we must endeavor to enter into the realm of the full enjoyment of the resurrected and ascended Christ as the kingdom of God. The world opposes and rejects the Lord Jesus, yet He does not resist or fight back. He simply endures. As we have fellowship with Him and abide in Him, we partake of His endurance to endure persecution and opposition. This is strong proof that we are waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back.</p>
<p>If we live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and partake of the kingdom, we will inherit the kingdom of God. To inherit the kingdom of God is not the same as entering the kingdom; it is to receive the kingdom as a reward for our enjoyment. This should be an incentive for us to live an overcoming life, a life that is sinless and righteous. The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God and are living in the kingdom of God in the church life. However, not all believers will participate in the millennium; only the overcomers will. The faithful and mature ones will receive a reward from the Lord, but the unfaithful will receive dispensational punishment. The incentive of the reward and the warning concerning punishment should encourage us to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today, faithfully taking the way of the Lord and diligently growing unto maturity in the divine life.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>We have seen that in the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the believers corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity through entering into the kingdom of God. Beginning with this lesson we will go on to see the believers&rsquo; corporate experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity through their living in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. BY LIVING IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>Through regeneration we have entered into the kingdom of God (John 3:3, 5), and now we are living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. This is a corporate experience and is realized through the corporate enjoyment of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. First, we corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity by entering into the kingdom of God and living in the kingdom; as a result, we corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity by living in the church life (1 Tim. 3:15-16).</p>
<p>The Christian life has two aspects: the individual aspect and the corporate aspect. The divine dispensing is first for the individual Christian life and then for the corporate Christian life. The individual Christian life is a personal matter, whereas the corporate Christian life is a matter of the church.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, the church and the kingdom are intimately related. In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus declared, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; Then in verse 19 He spoke of the kingdom of the heavens. In these verses the terms <em>the kingdom of the heavens</em> and <em>the church</em> are used interchangeably. This is strong proof that the genuine church is the kingdom of the heavens in this age. This is confirmed by Romans 14:17, in which the kingdom of God is mentioned in obvious reference to the proper church life. Hence, today the church is the kingdom.</p>
<p>Although the church and the kingdom are intimately related, the two are distinct. In the natural realm, a kingdom is a constitution of life; hence, a kingdom is life itself. For example, the animal life is the animal kingdom, and the human life is the human kingdom. In the same principle, the life of God is the kingdom of God. However, the church is not life, nor is life the church. Rather, the church is a product of life. The divine life is the kingdom, and this life produces the church. Without the kingdom as the reality of the church, there would be no way for the church to be produced and built up. The kingdom is necessary for the producing and building up of the church. The kingdom is the reality of the church.</p>
<p>Wherever there is a lack of the reality of the kingdom, there is a lack of the building up of the church. A believer who does not live in the reality of the kingdom can, at most, be a saved person; he cannot be built into the structure of the church.</p>
<p>When the New Testament gospel was first preached, people were told to repent for the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near (Matt. 3:2; 4:17; 10:7). This declaration indicated that the time had come for God to dispense Himself as life into man. The gospel brought God as life, and this life is the kingdom. The kingdom is a realm of life that allows life to move, work, rule, and govern so that life can accomplish its goal. The gospel brought in the divine life, and the divine life is a realm, which is the kingdom. Ultimately, the divine life with its realm produces the church.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament revelation, the kingdom is the reality of the church. If we do not have a proper kingdom life, we cannot live the church life. Without the reality of the kingdom, the church is empty. The reality of the kingdom is Christ as our life. Christ as life is the essence, the element, for us to live a proper life so that in this life we can be built together with other believers to bring in the genuine church life, the glorious expression of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God. This expression depends on whether or not the believers live a life in the reality of the kingdom as revealed and described in Matthew 5 through 7. These few chapters contain a complete message concerning the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens. This constitution is the reality of the kingdom life, and this reality is the real content of the church life.</p>
<p>In order to have the reality of the kingdom as the content of our church life, we need Christ to be our life and life supply. We need to experience and enjoy Christ as life through the dispensing of the Triune God into our being. Stanza 1 of <em>Hymns,</em> #841 speaks of Christ being our life for the building of the church:</p>
<p class="hbody">Thou art all my life, Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In me Thou dost live;<br />
With Thee all God&rsquo;s fulness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou to me dost give.<br />
By Thy holy nature<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sanctified,<br />
By Thy resurrection,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vict&rsquo;ry is supplied.</p>
<p>The words <em>Thou to me dost give</em> refer to the divine dispensing. All God&rsquo;s fullness has been given to us in Christ; this giving is the dispensing into us of all that the Triune God is, all that He has, and all that He does.</p>
<p>This hymn also says that we are sanctified by the Lord&rsquo;s holy nature. Sanctification does not relate to sinless perfection. Rather, sanctification comes from the holy nature being dispensed into our being. The holy nature that is dispensed into us is the holy nature of the Triune God. The dispensing of God&rsquo;s holy nature does not take place once for all; rather, it occurs daily, hourly, and continuously without interruption. The holy nature of the Triune God is being dispensed into us all the time. This dispensing causes us to be saturated with the holy essence of the Divine Trinity and thereby sanctifies us.</p>
<p>This hymn also speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection power giving us the victory. In ourselves we have no way to overcome anything, no way to be victorious. In ourselves we are sinful and even deadened in our spirit. However, we have received the resurrected Christ as our life. In His resurrection He is dispensing Himself into us. Therefore, as we enjoy Him, we enjoy the resurrection life and power. This resurrection life and power enable us to subjectively overcome all negative things and matters. Moreover, through this life, which is Christ Himself, we are able to live a life according to the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, a life that corresponds with the reality of the nature of the kingdom, which reality is the content of the church life.</p>
<p>By living in the kingdom, we corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. As we live corporately in the kingdom life, spontaneously we live the church life. Hence, the kingdom life issues in the church life.</p>
<p>According to the revelation in the New Testament, the church is the organic Body of Christ. For the church to be the organic Body of Christ, the church must be constituted with Christ as life. The church is a pure issue out of Christ as typified by Eve in Genesis. Eve was produced completely, entirely, and purely out of Adam (Gen. 2:21-24). Within Eve there was nothing other than Adam. Besides the element of Adam, there was no other element in Eve. Therefore, Eve was a complete reproduction of Adam. Adam and Eve are a type of Christ and the church (Eph. 5:31-32). This type shows the relationship between Christ and the church. The church must issue from only one element&mdash;the element of Christ. Anything other than Christ is not the church.</p>
<p>Jehovah caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and He took one of Adam&rsquo;s ribs and used the rib to build a woman (Gen. 2:21-22). In life, nature, and form, the woman was the same as the man. In like manner, God caused Christ to die on the cross. When Christ was &ldquo;sleeping&rdquo; on the cross, His side was opened, and blood and water flowed out from Him (John 19:34). The water signifies the flowing life of Christ, the eternal life, typified by the rib bone. According to John 19, not one of the Lord&rsquo;s bones was broken on the cross. This fulfilled Psalm 34:20, which says, &ldquo;He keeps all His bones; / Not one of them is broken.&rdquo; Christ&rsquo;s unbroken bones typify the indestructible eternal life. Hence, Adam&rsquo;s rib typifies Christ&rsquo;s indestructible eternal life, from which the church is built up to be the bride prepared for Christ.</p>
<p>Just as Eve and Adam had the same life and nature, so the church also has the same life and nature as Christ. Hence, the church is a part of Christ.</p>
<p>The church is produced through the flowing out of the life of the crucified Christ. This life is the source and the substance of the church. This life is Christ Himself. Christ is the element that constitutes us to be the proper church that matches Him. Therefore, if we desire to have the church life, we must have Christ as our life and living.</p>
<p>Today we have the processed Triune God with Christ as His embodiment and the Spirit as His consummation. Day by day we should open to Him, call upon Him, remain in His presence, fellowship with Him, and allow Him to work in us, to dispense all that He is, all that He has, and all that He has done and is doing into our being. The spontaneous result of this dispensing is that the kingdom life will become our church life.</p>
<p>The corporate kingdom life and the church life are the spontaneous results of the dispensing of the processed Triune God into us. In such a divine dispensing we are sanctified, spiritual, and victorious, and we grow unto maturity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Our corporate experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity takes place through our living in the church life. According to the New Testament, the church is intimately related to the kingdom. The divine life is the kingdom, and this life produces the church. Therefore, we need the kingdom for the producing and building up of the church. The kingdom is the reality of the church. If we would have the reality of the kingdom as the content of our church life, we need to have Christ as our life and life supply. We need to experience and enjoy Christ as our life through the dispensing of the Triune God into our being.</p>
<p>According to the revelation of the New Testament, the church is the organic Body of Christ. For the church to be the organic Body of Christ, the church must be constituted with Christ as life to the believers. The church is a pure issue out of Christ, as typified by Eve in Genesis. Just as Eve and Adam had the same life and nature, so the church has the same life and nature as Christ. Hence, the church is part of Christ. Christ is the element that constitutes us to be the proper church that matches Him. If we desire to have the church life, we must have Christ as our life and our living. The corporate life and the church life are the spontaneous results of the dispensing of the processed Triune God into us. In such a divine dispensing, we are sanctified, spiritual, and victorious, and we grow unto maturity.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>We have seen that the spontaneous result of the experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity is the kingdom life and that the reality of the kingdom life is the content of the church life. By entering into the kingdom and living in the church, we corporately experience the dispensing of the processed Triune God. In this lesson we will consider some matters related to living in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. As the Believers&rsquo; Family and House</h2>
<p>The church is the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15), and it is also the believers&rsquo; family and house. As members of the household of God, we are the family of God, the house of God. All believers are born of God into His house to enjoy His riches. The house and the household are one entity&mdash;the assembly of the believers (Eph. 2:19; Heb. 3:6). The reality of this house as the dwelling place of the living God is in our spirit (Eph. 2:22). God is our Father, and as the believers in Christ, we are His children. As children of God, we are the household of God. Hence, Ephesians 2:19 says that we are &ldquo;members of the household of God.&rdquo; <em>Members of the household of God</em> indicates that we are the house of God. The house here refers both to a house (a dwelling place) and to a household (a family). Ephesians 2 reveals that the house of God is the dwelling place of God. Verse 19 speaks of the house, and verse 22 says that we are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit. Hence, the house is a dwelling place.</p>
<p>Physically, household members cannot become their father&rsquo;s dwelling place; however, spiritually, God&rsquo;s children are both His family and His dwelling place. The dwelling place of God is built with His children. Hence, the family is the dwelling place. We are the family of God and the house of God. Corporately, we are God&rsquo;s house and God&rsquo;s household; we are His dwelling place and His family. Hence, living in the church is to live in God&rsquo;s dwelling place and to be part of God&rsquo;s family.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The House of the Living God</h2>
<p>First Timothy 3:15 says, &ldquo;The house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.&rdquo; As God&rsquo;s dwelling place, the church is both God&rsquo;s house and His household, His family. In the Old Testament, the temple and God&rsquo;s people, His family, were two separate things. However, in the fulfillment in the New Testament, the dwelling place and the family are one. According God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, God&rsquo;s family is His house.</p>
<p>In speaking of the church as the house of God, Paul specifically refers to God as the living God. The living God, who lives in the church, must be subjective to the church, not merely objective. An idol in a heathen temple is lifeless. However, the God who not only lives but also acts, moves, and works in His living temple, the church, is living. Because He is living, the church too is living in Him, by Him, and with Him. The living God and the living church live, move, and work together.</p>
<p>The house of God is a living composition of the many children of God who possess the Father&rsquo;s life and reality. Where the house of God is, there is the family of God, and where the family of God is, there is God the Father with His life and reality. The relationship between God the Father and the family of God is similar to that of the church as the Body of Christ. Christ is not separate from all the members of the Body, because, as the Head of the Body, Christ indwells all the members. Because Christ is in all the members of the Body, He should not be counted as a separate member of the Body. Likewise, God&rsquo;s house is God&rsquo;s family. The Father is not a separate member of the household but is in all of His children.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Pillar and Base of the Truth</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul tells us that the church of the living God is &ldquo;the pillar and base of the truth.&rdquo; The pillar supports the building, and the base holds the pillar. The church is such a supporting pillar and holding base of the truth. <em>Truth</em> refers to the real things revealed in the New Testament concerning Christ and the church according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The church is the supporting pillar and holding base of all these realities. A local church should be such a building that holds, bears, and testifies the truth, the reality, of Christ and the church. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is composed of two mysteries: Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:2) and the church as the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4). Christ and the church, the Head and the Body, are the contents of the reality of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The church as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth testifies the truth, the reality, of Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ.</p>
<p>The truth in 1 Timothy 3:15 refers to the divine realities, the realities of God. These realities are revealed particularly in John 14 through 16. According to these chapters, truth, or reality, is revealed as the truth of the Spirit, that is, the reality of the Spirit. The Spirit is the Spirit of all divine realities. Today the church is the pillar and base of the truth, holding up the realities of the Divine Being. The realities of God are testified through the church as the pillar and base of the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. God Manifested in the Flesh&mdash;<br />
the Mystery of Godliness</h2>
<p>First Timothy 3:15-16 shows that the church is also God manifested in the flesh&mdash;the mystery of godliness. God is manifested in the church, the Body of Christ, as His enlarged and corporate manifestation in the flesh. These verses say, &ldquo;The house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh, / Justified in the Spirit, / Seen by angels, / Preached among the nations, / Believed on in the world, / Taken up in glory.&rdquo; <em>He</em> refers to Christ, who was God manifested in the flesh as the mystery of godliness. The transition from <em>the mystery of godliness</em> to <em>He</em> implies that Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh is the mystery of godliness (Col. 1:27; Gal. 2:20). This mystery of godliness is the living of a proper church, and such a living is also the manifestation of God in the flesh.</p>
<p>This portion of the Scriptures implies that the manifestation of God in the flesh is not only Christ Himself as the Head but also the church as the Body. When the church grows in Christ with the growth of God (Col. 2:19), the church functions as the house and household of the living God for His move on the earth and as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth, bearing the divine reality of Christ and His Body as a testimony to the world. Thus, the church becomes the continuation of Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh. This is the great mystery of godliness&mdash;Christ lived out of the church as the enlarged manifestation of God in the flesh.</p>
<p>First Timothy 3:16 begins, &ldquo;And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness.&rdquo; The conjunction <em>and</em> indicates that in verse 15 Paul has not finished speaking about the church; it also indicates that the church is more than just the house of the living God and the pillar and base of the truth. The church is the mystery of godliness. According to the context, godliness in verse 16 refers not only to piety but also to the living of God in the church, that is, God as life lived out and expressed in the church. The church life is the expression of God. Christ and the church, the Head and the Body, are the mystery of godliness, expressing God in the flesh. This great mystery is confessed universally by the believers in Christ. The church as the manifestation of God in the flesh is a mystery&mdash;the mystery of godliness.</p>
<p>The mystery of godliness is the proper church life, and such a life is the manifestation of God in the flesh. When a church is well taken care of according to the instructions given in 1 Timothy, with the oversight of the elders and the service of the deacons fully established, the church functions as the house and household of the living God and as the pillar and base of the truth. The church also becomes the continuation and enlargement of God&rsquo;s manifestation in the flesh. This manifestation began on the earth with Christ and is now being continued in the church. Therefore, the church, as the manifestation of the invisible God, is the mystery of godliness. If, through the reality of the kingdom, we have the proper church life, God&rsquo;s manifestation that began in Christ will be continued in the church.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Respectively in the Believers&rsquo; Localities</h2>
<p>The believers are in the church in the locality where they live. For example, Acts 8:1 speaks of &ldquo;the church which was in Jerusalem.&rdquo; This was the first church established in a locality, within the jurisdiction of a city, the city of Jerusalem. It was a local church in its locality, revealed by the Lord in Matthew 18:17. It was not the universal church, as revealed by the Lord in Matthew 16:18, but only part of the universal church, which is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). The record concerning the establishing of the church in its locality is consistent throughout the New Testament (Acts 13:1; 14:23; Rom. 16:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; 2 Cor. 8:1; Gal. 1:2; Rev. 1:4, 11).</p>
<p>The second time the New Testament mentions the local churches is in Acts 13:1: &ldquo;Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers.&rdquo; In Antioch there was another local church, another local expression of the universal church. Hence, Acts 8 and 13 reveal that the church had two expressions: one in Jerusalem and the other in Antioch. All the local churches are local expressions of the same one universal church.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:2 Paul writes to &ldquo;the church of God which is in Corinth.&rdquo; This reveals that the church is not the church of any person or of any practice or doctrine but of God. The church is the church of God because it is constituted with the universal God; nevertheless, it exists on earth in many localities, one of which was Corinth. In God the church is universal in nature, but in practice the church is local and in a definite place. This indicates that the church has two aspects: the universal and local aspects. Without the universal aspect, the church has no content; without the local aspect, the church has no expression and practice. Hence, the New Testament stresses the local aspect of the church.</p>
<p>The church is of God because the church is constituted of the element of God. However, the church which is of God is also local. Therefore, both the universal and local aspects of the church are seen in 1 Corinthians 1:2. The universal aspect refers to the constitution, nature, and content of the church, and the local aspect refers to the expression and practicality of the church. If we have only the local aspect, without the aspect of the church being of God, we will have only an outward formality; we will lack the inward reality. Furthermore, if we have only the universal aspect but not the local aspect of the church, we will have the reality but not the practicality. On the one hand, the church is constituted of God; on the other hand, the church is expressed in a particular locality. The universal church is expressed and practiced in particular localities.</p>
<p>The universal church, as the Body of Christ, is expressed through local churches. Local churches as the expressions of the one Body of Christ are locally one. The book of Revelation was written to local churches: &ldquo;To the seven churches which are in Asia&rdquo; (1:4). Asia was a province of the ancient Roman Empire, and in that province there were the seven cities spoken of in 1:11. The seven churches were in seven cities respectively; they were not all in one city. Revelation 1 through 3 does not deal with the one universal church but with local churches in seven cities. The church is firstly revealed as being universal in Matthew 16:18 and then as local in 18:17. In Acts the church was practiced in the way of local churches. In regard to the Epistles, only a few were written to individuals, and all the rest were written to the local churches. Not one was written to the universal church. Without the local churches, the universal church has no practicality and actuality. The universal church is realized in the local churches. Knowing the church universally must be consummated in knowing the church locally. Our knowing and practicing the local church are a great advancement. The church is in the advanced stage in the book of Revelation, because Revelation is written to local churches.</p>
<p>In Revelation 1:11 we see that sending the book of Revelation to the seven churches equals sending it to seven cities. This clearly shows that the practice of the church life in the early days involved having one church in one city, with one city having only one church. In no city was there more than one church. The local church took the city, not a street or area, as the boundary. A local church should include the whole city in which the church is located; it should not be larger or smaller than the boundary of the city. All the believers within its boundary should constitute the one unique local church within a city. Hence, one church equals one city, and one city equals one church. This is what we call the local churches.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Obeying the Church</h2>
<p>Matthew 18:17 reveals that the believers should obey the church. If a brother sins and offends us, we need to deal with him first by ourselves in love (v. 15), then by two or three witnesses (v. 16), and finally through the church with authority (v. 17). Verse 17 says, &ldquo;If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector.&rdquo; If any believer refuses to hear the church, he will lose the fellowship of the church and will be like the Gentile (the heathen) and the tax collector (the sinner), who are outside the fellowship of the church. A Gentile or a tax collector is someone who does not have fellowship in the kingdom life or in the church life. To consider a believer as a Gentile or a tax collector does not mean to excommunicate him. It means that he is considered as one cut off from the fellowship of the church. An offending brother who does not listen to the church may not necessarily require excommunication. Nevertheless, the church must cut off fellowship with him in order that the loss of fellowship may encourage him to repent and to recover his fellowship with the church.</p>
<p>The church that the believers should obey is surely the local church, not the universal church. The church revealed in Matthew 16:18 is the universal church, which is the unique Body of Christ, whereas the church revealed in Matthew 18:17 is the local church, the expression of the unique Body of Christ in a certain locality. Chapter 16 relates to the universal building of the church, and chapter 18 relates to the local practice of the church. Both indicate that the church represents the kingdom of the heavens, having authority to bind and to loose.</p>
<p>In order to be in the kingdom of the heavens in a practical way, we need to be in a local church. According to the context of 18:17, both the reality and practicality of the kingdom are in the local church. In a chapter dealing with relationships in the kingdom, the Lord Jesus eventually spoke of the church. This indicates that today the practicality of the kingdom is in the local church. Without the local church, it is impossible to have the practicality and reality of the kingdom life. The local church is the reality both of the kingdom and of the universal church. Hence, it is crucial that the believers obey the church. The more we realize how independent our natural self is, the more we are willing to be subject to the church and obey the church. Because of our independent self, we all must learn to obey the church. The church has the authority; hence, we must listen to the church and submit to the church. If we do not submit to the church, we are finished with the kingdom, for the kingdom life is a life of submission to the church.</p>
<p>The context of Matthew 18 indicates that the reality of the church is the Lord&rsquo;s presence (v. 20). The Lord&rsquo;s presence is the authority of the church. The church must be certain that it has the presence of the Lord as its reality; otherwise, it has no genuine authority. The real and practical authority of the church is the Lord&rsquo;s presence. If a person does not listen to the church, he rebels against the Lord&rsquo;s presence. In the Lord&rsquo;s presence the church has the ground to exercise authority over any case of rebellion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Meeting with the Church</h2>
<p>If we would live in the church, we need to meet with the church. In 1 Corinthians 14:23 Paul speaks of when &ldquo;the whole church comes together in one place.&rdquo; This refers to the meetings of the church. In verse 26 Paul again speaks of the believers coming together in the church meetings. Any believer who does not meet with the church is spontaneously separated from the church life.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14 reveals that the meeting of the whole church is the church. After speaking in verse 23 of the whole church coming together in one place, Paul mentions in verse 28 the case of one who &ldquo;should be silent in the church&rdquo;; this indicates clearly that a meeting of the church is the church. When the whole church comes together in one place, that is both a meeting and the church, because the meeting is the church. Such a meeting is not only a part of the church; such a meeting is the church.</p>
<p>The proper way for the believers to meet together is either as the church or as part of the church. When the whole church meets together, it meets as the church. When we meet in small groups in our homes, we meet as parts of the one church in our locality. All the meetings of the believers in a city should constitute the unique local church in that city. This is the proper way of meeting. If we would corporately experience the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity by living in the church, we need to meet with the church either as the church or as part of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The church is both the house of God and our family and house. God is our Father, and the believers in Christ are His children. As children of God, we are members of His household, and we are also His family, His dwelling place. In speaking of the church as the house of God, Paul specifically refers to God as the living God. The God who not only lives but also acts, moves, and works in His living temple, the church, is living. The house of God is a living constitution of the many children of God who possess the Father&rsquo;s life and reality. Where the house of God is, there is the family of God, and there is also God the Father with His life and reality.</p>
<p>Moreover, the church of the living God is the pillar and base of the truth. The church is the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth, testifying of the divine realities. Thus, the church is the continuation of Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh. This is the great mystery of godliness&mdash;Christ lived out of the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh. If we have the proper church life through the reality of the kingdom, God&rsquo;s manifestation that began in Christ will be continued in the church.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in practicality, the believers are in the church in the locality where they live. The church has two aspects: the universal and the local aspects. The universal aspect refers to the constitution, nature, and content of the church; the local aspect refers to the expression and practicality of the church. Without the local churches, the universal church has no practicality and actuality. The universal church is realized in local churches. It is in local churches that we experience and enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. Therefore, we need to obey the church. The reality of the church is the Lord&rsquo;s presence, and the Lord&rsquo;s presence is the authority of the church. Since the church has the authority of the Lord, we should listen and submit to the church.</p>
<p>If we would live in the church, we also need to meet with the church. When the whole church comes together, this gathering is both a meeting and the church. The proper way for the believers to meet is to meet together as the church. If we would corporately experience the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity by being in the church, we need to meet with the church.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>The believers corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity through their living in the church life. In this lesson we will consider further aspects regarding the believers&rsquo; living in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Serving in the Church</h2>
<p>The believers should not only obey the church (Matt. 18:17) and meet with the church (1 Cor. 14:23a, 26a); they should also serve in the church. Serving in the church means serving in spirit and in coordination for the building up of the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. As Elders</h2>
<p>In the church there are some brothers who serve as elders. In the first local church, the church in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1), there were elders who took care of the administration of the church (11:30; 15:2, 4, 6, 22; 16:4; 21:18). Acts 14:23 says that elders were appointed in every church. Hence, there were elders in the church in Ephesus (20:17). Later, Paul directed Titus to &ldquo;appoint elders in every city&rdquo; (Titus 1:5). The New Testament indicates that the elders were not voted in by their congregation but were appointed by the apostles according to the elders&rsquo; maturity of life in Christ. They were charged by the apostles to care for the leadership and shepherding in their churches.</p>
<p>In 1 Peter 5:2 Peter charges the elders concerning the matter of shepherding: &ldquo;Shepherd the flock of God among you.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;flock&rdquo; is literally &ldquo;little flock.&rdquo; This refers to the church of God (Acts 20:28), which is little in number (Luke 12:32) compared to the world. In the church of God the elders are not rulers; they are shepherds. Sometimes a shepherd may have to rule the flock, but such ruling is not the ruling of a king. It is a ruling of someone who cares for the flock. Shepherding is to exercise a proper care over the flock. The flock needs to be cared for, protected, and led in the right direction. They need to be brought to a place where they can eat and drink. This is shepherding. Furthermore, Peter does not tell the elders to shepherd their own flock. He charges them to shepherd the flock of God. The flock is not the elders&rsquo; possession but God&rsquo;s possession. In a sense, the elders are employed by God to shepherd His flock.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, an elder is called an overseer (Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:2; 1 Pet. 5:1-2). The Greek word for <em>overseer</em> is composed of <em>over</em> and <em>seer,</em> hence, overseer. An overseer in a local church is an elder (Acts 20:17, 28). The two titles refer to the same person. <em>Elder</em> denotes a person of maturity, and <em>overseer</em> denotes the function of an elder. It was Ignatius who in the second century taught that an overseer, a bishop, is higher than an elder. From this erroneous teaching came the hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope. This teaching is also the source of the episcopal system of ecclesiastical government. Both the hierarchy and the system are abominable in the eyes of God.</p><h2 class="head3">2. As Deacons and Deaconesses</h2>
<p>In the church there are some brothers who serve as deacons (Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:8) and some sisters who serve as deaconesses (Rom. 16:1). The word <em>service</em> in Romans 12:7 refers to the service of the deacons and deaconesses in the local churches. Deacons are the serving ones. The deacons and deaconesses are those who serve in a local church under the direction of the overseers, the elders. The overseers take care of the church, and the deacons and deaconesses serve the church by taking care of the many practical matters. Those who serve as deacons and deaconesses should have the spirit and attitude of serving, and they should always keep themselves in such a spirit and attitude.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. As Prophets and Teachers</h2>
<p>Acts 13:1 says, &ldquo;Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers.&rdquo; This verse indicates that in the church there are some saints who have sufficient growth in life to serve as prophets and teachers. Prophets and teachers speak God&rsquo;s word to release the divine revelation and teach the saints. Prophets and teachers are very much needed, especially in the meetings of the church. In the church meetings we need proper speaking ones to speak forth a word of wisdom and a word of knowledge. The word of wisdom is mainly spoken by prophets, and the word of knowledge is mainly taught by teachers.</p>
<p>For us to understand the services of the prophets and the teachers, we need to know the difference between prophesying and teaching. In the Scripture as a whole, especially in the New Testament, the word <em>prophesy</em> does not mainly mean to predict. In both the Old and New Testaments to prophesy means: (1) to tell for, to speak for others; (2) to tell forth, to speak things forth; and (3) to foretell, to predict, to speak things before they happen. Primarily, the meaning of the word <em>prophesy</em> is &ldquo;to speak for&rdquo; and &ldquo;to speak forth.&rdquo; A prophecy is a speaking for God under His direct inspiration. In <em>Word Studies in the New Testament</em> (vol. 3, p. 156) Marvin R. Vincent says this regarding <em>prophecy:</em> &ldquo;In the New Testament, as in the Old, the prominent idea is not <em>prediction,</em> but the inspired delivery of warning, exhortation, instruction, judging, and making manifest the secrets of the heart. See 1 Cor. xiv. 3, 24, 25. The New-Testament prophets are distinguished from <em>teachers,</em> by speaking under direct divine inspiration.&rdquo; Thus, the main idea of prophecy in the Bible is not prediction but speaking for God and speaking forth God under His direct inspiration, that is, to speak according to the revelation that the Lord has imparted.</p>
<p>In the sense of speaking for God and speaking forth God, prophesying requires the adequate growth in life. In order to speak for God, we must know God and experience Christ. Without the sufficient knowledge of God and the experience of Christ, we have nothing to speak on His behalf and cannot speak Him forth. In the sense of predicting, of speaking things before they happen, prophesying is miraculous and does not require growth in life.</p>
<p>Teaching is different from prophesying. Teaching is speaking based upon prophecy. Some brothers may take what others prophesy and teach people according to what was prophesied. This is teaching. The prophets are those who speak for God and speak forth God by God&rsquo;s revelation, and who sometimes speak with inspired prediction (Acts 11:27-28). Teachers are those who teach the truths according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching (2:42) and the prophets&rsquo; revelation. Both the prophets and the teachers are needed in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. As Good Stewards of the Varied Grace of God, Ministering Such Grace to One Another</h2>
<p>In the church some saints serve as elders, deacons, deaconesses, prophets, and teachers, but all the believers should be good stewards of the varied grace of God, ministering grace to one another. First Peter 4:10 says, &ldquo;Each one, as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God.&rdquo; According to the New Testament, grace is what God is to us for our enjoyment (John 1:16-17; 2 Cor. 12:9). Grace is not mainly the work that God has done for us; grace is the processed Triune God Himself dispensed into our being for us to experience and enjoy. To put it simply, grace is the Triune God for our experience and enjoyment. The varied grace in 1 Peter 4:10, as well as &ldquo;all grace&rdquo; in 5:10, refers to the rich supply of life, which is the Triune God ministered into us in many aspects (2 Cor. 13:14). As good stewards, by means of the gift we have received, we should minister grace, not merely doctrine and vain things, to the church and to the saints. In the church we should all serve as good stewards of the varied grace of God, ministering grace to one another.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Functioning in the Meetings of the Church</h2>
<p>To corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the church, we need to function in the church meetings. The proper church life depends upon proper church meetings. Proper church meetings are unique in two matters&mdash;in mutuality and in speaking for the Lord. Whenever we meet together, we need to have mutuality in our speaking, rather than only one or two persons speaking. Every saint should have the same right and opportunity to speak of Christ, to speak for Christ, and to speak forth Christ. Depending on others to speak, to pray, and to call the hymns is a tradition that kills the church life, because it annuls the function of the members of the Body of Christ. We should not follow this traditional practice; instead, we should function in the church meetings in the way of mutuality. This will edify, improve, and develop the ability to function of all those who attend the church meetings.</p>
<p>In every meeting of the church we should keep the principle of mutuality. According to the New Testament, Christian meetings are altogether meetings in mutuality. In 1 Corinthians 14:26 each one has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, and an interpretation. All these things are done in mutuality. Not only one or a few should function; on the contrary, everyone should function in mutuality. Hebrews 10:25 encourages us not to abandon our own assembling together but to exhort one another. This indicates that Christian meetings should be carried out in mutuality. Mutuality is the basic principle of church meetings. A church meeting without mutuality is wrong. In our meetings, speaking the divine word should be done in mutuality, not individualistically. Mutuality, not individuality, should be our general practice.</p>
<p>Meeting and speaking in mutuality is the way ordained by God. God created this way, and no one can improve upon it. Hence, we must forsake the traditional practice of having only one speaker, or several speakers, and recover the way of mutuality that the Lord has ordained. We need to fully return to the way of meeting as ordained by God. Even when the entire church comes together, we must practice mutuality. First Corinthians 14:26 indicates that when the whole church comes together, there should be the practice of mutuality. The matter of speaking in mutuality is clearly revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. In the New Testament there is no hint that only one or two persons should speak in a church meeting. The meetings of the church should be open to all who attend so that all may function.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 14:26 Paul says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.&rdquo; In this verse the word <em>has</em> is very important. According to Paul, whenever we come together to meet, each of us has something. Paul does not say &ldquo;shall have&rdquo; or &ldquo;should have&rdquo;; he speaks in the present tense to emphasize the fact that each one of us has something. Furthermore, he does not say that just a few have, that many have, or that most have; he says each one has. He then speaks of five things in the following sequence: a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, and an interpretation. This list is not all-inclusive, but it is illustrative.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Having a Psalm</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 14:26 Paul first speaks of having a psalm. A psalm is somewhat equivalent to a hymn; it is for praising the Lord. The fact that Paul speaks first of a psalm indicates that in the church meetings praising the Lord is primary.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Having a Teaching</h2>
<p>After saying, &ldquo;Each one has a psalm,&rdquo; Paul goes on to speak of having a teaching. A teaching must be according to the teaching of the apostles. In the church meetings we need a word of teaching. This teaching should minister Christ with the church as His Body.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Having a Revelation</h2>
<p>One has a teaching, and another has a revelation. A revelation must bring to light something that has been hidden but is now revealed. This kind of revelation should be centered on Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ, not other things. In the church meetings, teachings come from the teachers, and revelations come from the prophets.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Having a Tongue</h2>
<p>A tongue is a proper language or dialect (Acts 2:4, 6, 8, 11) either of men or of angels (1 Cor. 13:1), not meaningless voices or sounds. The genuine and proper speaking in tongues is one of the many gifts of the Spirit (12:4), one of the many aspects of the manifestation of the Spirit (v. 7). The New Testament makes it more than clear that speaking in tongues is only one of the many gifts of the Spirit and that not all the believers have it. Furthermore, 1 Corinthians is a book that speaks of Christ as the wisdom and power of God and as the deep things of God. It also speaks of the church as the Body to express Christ and as the means to carry out God&rsquo;s administration. Based upon the context of the entire book of 1 Corinthians, the proper use of the tongue should be to speak concerning Christ and the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Having an Interpretation</h2>
<p>Finally, in 1 Corinthians 14:26 Paul says that each one &ldquo;has an interpretation.&rdquo; The interpretation of tongues is to make the unknown tongues known or understandable.</p>
<p>According to the emphasis in 1 Corinthians, all five items listed in 14:26 should focus on Christ as God&rsquo;s center for our portion and on the church as God&rsquo;s goal for our aim. A psalm should praise God for giving Christ as wisdom and power to us for our daily life and church life. A teaching from a teacher and a revelation from a prophet should teach and minister Christ and the church, which is the Body of Christ, to people. A tongue and its interpretation should also have Christ and the church as its center and content. Any emphasis on things other than Christ and the church will confuse the church and distract the church from the central lane of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. For Building Up</h2>
<p>At the end of 14:26 Paul says, &ldquo;Let all things be done for building up.&rdquo; Whatever we do in the church meetings must be for the building up of the saints and the church. In our meetings our unique purpose and goal must be to exhibit Christ and to enjoy Him for the building up of His Body.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. Prophesying</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 14 reveals that prophesying, which is mainly to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord with a word of wisdom and a word of knowledge, is the excelling spiritual gift for the building up of the church. Paul says, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy&rdquo; (v. 1). Since to prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord, that is, to minister Christ to others, which is the main focus in the church meetings, prophesying requires the divine life to fill it as its content. Love is the most excellent way to experience the divine life and make it the content of the gift of prophecy for the building up of the church. Hence, we must pursue love and desire earnestly this greater gift.</p>
<p>In verse 3 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;He who prophesies speaks building up and encouragement and consolation to men.&rdquo; Since to prophesy, to speak forth the Lord, ministers Christ to others, it builds them up and encourages and consoles them. In the last part of verse 4 Paul says, &ldquo;He who prophesies builds up the church.&rdquo; From this verse we see that to prophesy, to speak forth the Lord, not only builds up the individual saints but also builds up the church. In verse 12 Paul continues, &ldquo;Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church.&rdquo; In these verses we see that Paul was fully occupied with the consideration of building up the church. He was fully church-conscious and church-centered. Paul fully realized that prophesying is the greatest gift for the building up of the church (v. 5).</p><h2 class="head2">G. Growing in the Church</h2>
<p>Believers also grow in the church. Just as children grow in a family, so believers grow in the church life. To grow in the church is to experience the real growth in life, which is the increase of the element of God, the increase of the measure of the stature of Christ, and the gaining of ground within us by the Holy Spirit. For the element of God to increase within us means that more of God Himself is mingled with us, is gained by us, and becomes our element. The more we love Christ, seek after Christ, and let Christ live in us, the more the measure of the stature of Christ increases within us. Furthermore, the more we grow, the more we allow the Holy Spirit to gain ground within us.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 3:6 Paul says, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth.&rdquo; The believers here are signified by plants. Plants need the planting, watering, and growth. The planting and watering are carried out by the apostles, but only God, as the source of life, can cause the growth. The believers are God&rsquo;s plants, planted in the church; the church is God&rsquo;s cultivated land (v. 9). God causes the believers to grow in the church as His cultivated land. According to the first three chapters of 1 Corinthians, the life by which the believers grow in the church is the crucified and resurrected Christ. The more we experience and enjoy Christ in the church, the more we as God&rsquo;s plants grow in the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. Having Our Possessions in Common</h2>
<p>In the early church life the saints had their possessions in common. To have our possessions in common is to share what God has given to us with the fellow saints who have need. We care for each other out of love, and we also care for the general expenses of the church. Acts 2:44-45 says, &ldquo;All those who believed were together and had all things common; and they sold their properties and possessions and divided them to all, as anyone had need.&rdquo; In this portion of the Scriptures, having all things common is not merely a sign of love; it is a sign of Christ&rsquo;s dynamic salvation that saves us from greediness and selfishness.</p>
<p>Acts 2:45 tells us that the believers sold their properties and possessions and divided them to all according to need. This also is an evidence of the Lord&rsquo;s dynamic salvation, which caused the believers to overcome their earthly possessions, which occupy, possess, and usurp all fallen mankind (Matt. 19:21-24; Luke 12:13-19, 33-34; 14:33; 16:13-14; 1 Tim. 6:17). Although the dynamic salvation of God caused the believers to forget about their earthly possessions, having all things common did not become a formal practice in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Sharing Our Abundance<br />
with Those Who Lack</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 8:12-15 Paul says that we should be willing to give to others according to what we have. &ldquo;As it is written, &lsquo;He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack&rsquo;&rdquo;(v. 15). This kind of giving and receiving results in what Paul calls &ldquo;equality&rdquo;: &ldquo;At the present time your abundance for their lack that their abundance also may be for your lack, so that there may be equality&rdquo; (v. 14). <em>Equality</em> means having all things common. God&rsquo;s principle is to have equality. Even in the Old Testament there was a divine way of balancing the wealth of society. No Jewish person could sell his property for more than fifty years. In the year of jubilee, everything had to be returned to the original owner (Lev. 25:8-17). God&rsquo;s way is to maintain equality.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Those Who Gather Much Having No Excess,<br />
and Those Who Gather Little<br />
Having No Lack</h2>
<p>The principle of equality is also portrayed in the matter of gathering manna in the Old Testament (Exo. 16:18). Paul speaks of this point in 2 Corinthians 8:15, saying, &ldquo;As it is written, &lsquo;He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack.&rsquo;&rdquo; If an Israelite gathered much, God sovereignly arranged for him to have no excess. If someone gathered little, he also had no lack through God&rsquo;s sovereignty. Thus, those who were feeble and not able to gather much manna did not have any lack. For those who gathered an excess of manna, perhaps wanting to store it up for days and weeks to come, God caused the excess to be taken away (Exo. 16:20). The divine way is that those who gather little have no lack and that those who gather much have no excess. This is God&rsquo;s heavenly way of balancing the supply among His people. Concerning material riches, we should keep this principle. Those who are blessed by God with material riches should use their riches faithfully to take care of the needy saints and those who serve the Lord full time. When the saints share their excess with others, there is equality.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Strongly Showing That<br />
We Have Overcome the Usurping Power<br />
of Enticing and Deceiving Riches</h2>
<p>Having our possessions in common and keeping the principle of equality strongly shows that we have overcome the usurping power of enticing and deceiving riches (1 Tim. 6:9-10, 17-19; Matt. 13:22). Riches are very enticing and deceiving. However, through Christ in His overcoming life as our victory, we can overcome the usurping power of enticing and deceiving riches.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>We should not only obey the church in our locality and meet with the church; we should also serve in the church. The service in the church consists of four main aspects: (1) Some saints serve as elders. The elders were appointed by the apostles according to their maturity of life in Christ. These ones were charged by the apostles to care for the leadership and shepherding in their churches. (2) Some serve as deacons and deaconesses. They serve in a local church under the direction of the elders by taking care of the many practical matters. (3) Some serve as prophets and teachers. Prophets and teachers speak God&rsquo;s word to release the divine revelation and teach the saints; they are very much needed, especially in the meetings of the church. The prophets speak for God and speak forth God by God&rsquo;s revelation; the teachers speak God&rsquo;s truths according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching and the prophets&rsquo; revelation. (4) All should serve as the good stewards of the varied grace of God. In the church, all the believers should be good stewards of the varied grace of God, ministering such grace to one another. This is the way for all the believers to function in the church meetings.</p>
<p>The proper church life should be unique in two matters: in mutuality and in speaking for the Lord. The way of meeting by speaking in mutuality is the way ordained by God. The meetings of the church should be open to all who attend so that all may function. Whenever we come together, each one has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, an interpretation, and we must let all things be done for building up. These five items should focus on Christ as God&rsquo;s center for our portion and on the church as God&rsquo;s goal for our aim. Whatever we do in the church meetings should be done for the building up of the saints and the church. Prophesying, which is to speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord, that is, to minister Christ to others with a word of wisdom and knowledge, is the main focus in the church meetings. This is the excelling gift for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should also grow in the church. This is to have the real growth in life, which is the increase of the element of God, the increase of the measure of the stature of Christ, and the gaining of ground within us by the Holy Spirit. The church is God&rsquo;s cultivated land, and the believers are God&rsquo;s plants, planted in the church. The more we experience and enjoy Christ in the church, the more we grow in the divine life. Not only so, in the church life the saints should have their possessions in common. This is to share our abundance with those who lack. We should be willing to give to others according to what we have so that those who gather much have no excess, and those who gather little have no lack. This is the principle of equality, God&rsquo;s heavenly way of balancing the supply among His people. This strongly shows that we have overcome the usurping power of enticing and deceiving riches.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will cover more aspects regarding the believers&rsquo; corporate experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity through their living in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. Loving the Brothers and<br />
Loving One Another in the Church</h2>
<p>We live in the church, loving all the brothers and loving one another. Romans 12:9-21 speaks of living a life according to the highest virtues of the divine life and love. In the beginning of verse 9 Paul says, &ldquo;Let love be without hypocrisy.&rdquo; Then in the beginning of verse 10 he continues, &ldquo;Love one another warmly in brotherly love.&rdquo; This matches what Peter says in 1 Peter 1:22: &ldquo;Love one another from a pure heart fervently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In John 13:34-35 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this shall all men know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.&rdquo; This commandment is the message that John speaks of in 1 John 3:11: &ldquo;This is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.&rdquo; We should not love others in a natural, religious, and moral way by trying to imitate God&rsquo;s love. In our human nature we have a tendency to love people; however, this kind of love is moral, natural, and even cultural. In contrast, real love is the result of enjoying the processed Triune God in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. When we are in the fellowship of the divine life, that is, in the enjoyment of the Triune God, this enjoyment has a result, or an issue, which is the divine love. By means of this love, we spontaneously love others, especially those organically related to our Father who has begotten us (5:1). We have been begotten of the Father, and many other persons have also been begotten of Him. The result of our enjoying Him is that we love all His children. Therefore, loving the brothers is an issue of enjoying the Triune God. We do not need to imitate the Lord&rsquo;s love; rather, we need to be constituted with the Triune God, who is love. This One dwells within us and desires to dispense Himself into our being, to saturate us with Himself so that we may enjoy Him inwardly as love. This love needs to saturate us until it becomes the love with which we love the brothers.</p>
<p>The revelation concerning love in the New Testament is different from our natural concept. Love is the God of love dwelling in us and us dwelling in Him. First John 3:24 says, &ldquo;In this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us.&rdquo; The Spirit keeps us in an organic union with the Triune God, who is love, and causes God to be our life and even our person. Not only so, the Spirit is saturating us with the element of God, who is love. Ultimately, we will be constituted with the essence of God&rsquo;s love. This is to say that the divine love will become us, and as a result, we spontaneously love others. However, we do not love them according to our own love; rather, we love them with God as our love. There is a great difference between this kind of love and the love that people have through trying to imitate the love of God.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, all mutual love among the believers is triangular; it includes love from three sides. We are children born of God, and as such, we surely love our Father, the One who has begotten us. Since we love the Father who has begotten us, we also love those begotten of Him. Consequently, we experience a triangular love, involving God, us, and all those begotten of God. This triangular love is realized in our organic union with the Triune God, who is love.</p>
<p>The reason we as believers are able to love God and one another is that we have experienced a divine birth (John 1:12; 1 John 5:1; 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:4, 18). We have been born of God. Because of our divine birth, we are able to love one another. This triangular love is related to the divine birth. We not only love the Father who has begotten us; we also love those begotten of Him. This is the love with which the believers love one another in the church life.</p><h2 class="head2">J. Forgiving the Brothers and<br />
Forgiving One Another in the Church Life</h2>
<p>In the church life the believers need to forgive one another. Peter asked the Lord, &ldquo;How often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?&rdquo; (Matt. 18:21). The Lord answered, &ldquo;I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven&rdquo; (v. 22). Then He used a parable to explain what He meant (vv. 23-35). Verse 35 says, &ldquo;So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts.&rdquo; If we do not forgive our brother who sins against us, we will be disciplined by the Lord; only once we have forgiven him from our heart will the Lord forgive us.</p>
<p>If we do not practice the way of repenting and forgiving, the longer we remain in the church life, the more offenses will accumulate. In the end the accumulation of offenses will cause us to lose the church life. May the Lord grant us the grace that we need. If we have offended someone, we need to repent to him. If someone has offended us, we need to look to the Lord for grace to forgive him from our heart. Once we have forgiven an offense, we should forget it and never mention it again. If we practice this, we will maintain a proper church life.</p>
<p>Another verse that speaks of forgiving is Ephesians 4:32: &ldquo;Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ also forgave you.&rdquo; Only when we enjoy Christ as our joy and life supply will we be tenderhearted. If we are tenderhearted, we will forgive others.</p>
<p>In our daily life we need to forgive others and ask for others&rsquo; forgiveness. This is necessary because we are easily offended, and we easily offend others. If we offend others, we need to ask for forgiveness. If we are offended, we need to forgive, even as God in Christ also forgave us.</p>
<p>In Colossians 3:13 Paul says, &ldquo;Bearing one another and forgiving one another, if anyone should have a complaint against anyone; even as the Lord forgave you, so also should you forgive.&rdquo; The forgiving Lord is our life and lives within us; forgiving is a virtue of His life. When we take Him as our life and our person and live by Him, our forgiving of others will be spontaneous; it will become a virtue of our Christian life.</p>
<p>If we genuinely forgive someone, we should also forget the offense. Once we have forgiven someone concerning a certain matter, we should never mention it again. To mention the offense indicates that we have not released the person who offended us. According to the New Testament, to forgive is to forget and to release. We need to forget the offense and release the offender. Once we have done this, we should never mention the matter again.</p>
<p>The meaning of forgiving is to not be offended. Once we forgive someone, we are no longer offended by him. If we do not forgive, we are offended. Forgiving annuls the offense. In the church life, we should avoid offending others, and we should also avoid being offended by others. We should always be careful and watchful not to offend others, and at the same time, we should always be willing to forgive.</p>
<h2 class="head2">K. Being Built in the Church</h2>
<p>As the believers corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity by living in the church life, they are being built up in the church. In regard to Christ being the cornerstone, Paul says in Ephesians 2:22, &ldquo;In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; The word <em>you</em> refers to the saints in a particular locality, and the word <em>also</em> indicates that the building is local. According to the context, the &ldquo;dwelling place of God&rdquo; in verse 22 is local, whereas the &ldquo;holy temple&rdquo; in verse 21 is universal. In verse 22 Paul says that the local saints, the saints in Ephesus, were being built together in Christ into a dwelling place of God. Therefore, in verses 21 through 22 Paul speaks of the universal aspect as well as the local aspect of the church. <em>All the building...is growing</em> refers to the universal aspect; <em>being built together</em> refers to the local aspect.</p>
<p>In these verses Paul carefully points out that it is in Christ that local saints are built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit. They are not being built together in regulation, practice, or opinion. We can only be built together in the all-inclusive Christ, who is our peace, foundation, and cornerstone. Moreover, when we are built together, we become the dwelling place of God in spirit. The word <em>spirit</em> in verse 22 refers to the believers&rsquo; human spirit, which is indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God. God&rsquo;s Spirit is the Dweller, not the dwelling place. The dwelling place is the believers&rsquo; spirit. God&rsquo;s Spirit dwells in our spirit. Therefore, the dwelling place of God is in our spirit.</p>
<p>Verse 21 speaks of &ldquo;a holy temple in the Lord,&rdquo; while verse 22 speaks of &ldquo;a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; These verses show that the Lord and our spirit are one. To be in our spirit is to be in the Lord. Likewise, to be in the Lord is to be in spirit. &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 6:17). It is impossible to separate our spirit from the Lord. Therefore, our spirit is the place in which the church is built. The building is not in our mind, emotion, will, soul, or heart; rather, it is altogether a matter in our spirit. For this reason, if we desire to be built in a locality, our disposition and our being must be dealt with. Nothing can test the degree of our spiritual maturity like the building. Furthermore, to be built in a locality is a great help to our spiritual growth. If we are willing to be built into the church in our locality, we will greatly grow in life.</p><h2 class="head2">L. Building Up the Church</h2>
<p>We have a goal in the church life, which is to build up the church. In 1 Corinthians 14:4 Paul emphasizes this building: &ldquo;He who prophesies builds up the church.&rdquo; One who prophesies not only builds up the individual saints, but even more, he builds up the church. Then Paul continues in verse 12, &ldquo;Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church.&rdquo; These verses indicate that we should all be like Paul, who wholeheartedly cared for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>The New Testament reveals that God&rsquo;s goal is the building. Christ as life is for the building, the ministry of the gifted persons is for the building (Eph. 4:11-12), and the functioning of all the members is also for the building. Everything is for the goal of producing and building up the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The building up of the Body of Christ is not accomplished directly through the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers; the building work is accomplished directly through all the believers as members of the Body. The believers are the building members. Moreover, the work of the ministry, which is the work of building up the Body of Christ, is not only the work of the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers but also the work of all the saints. The building up of the Body of Christ is accomplished indirectly through the gifted saints; therefore, they should learn to perfect others. After the perfecting work is done, they should commit the building up of the church to all the members of the Body, allowing all the members to build up the Body directly (v. 16).</p>
<h2 class="head2">M. Being Overcomers in the Church</h2>
<p>The believers need to be the overcomers in the church. In the seven epistles written to the seven churches in Revelation, the Lord charged the saints to be overcomers (2:7, 11, 17, 26-28; 3:5, 12, 21). In chapters 2 and 3, to overcome is not mainly to overcome sins, the world, the flesh, the self, or even Satan; rather, it is to overcome the degradation of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Overcoming the Degradation of the Church</h2>
<p>Overcoming in Revelation 2 and 3 refers to overcoming the degraded situation of the church. The reason we need to be overcomers is that the church has become degraded. Today degradation is prevalent, and we need to overcome this degradation.</p>
<p>In Revelation 2:7 the Lord said, &ldquo;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.&rdquo; In this epistle to the church in Ephesus, to overcome is to recover our first love toward the Lord and to hate the works of the Nicolaitans, the hierarchy that the Lord hates (vv. 4, 6).</p>
<p>In verse 11 the Lord said to the church in Smyrna, &ldquo;He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death.&rdquo; In this epistle to overcome is to overcome persecution by being faithful unto death.</p>
<p>In verse 17 the Lord said to the church in Pergamos, &ldquo;To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna, and to him I will give a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no one knows except him who receives it.&rdquo; In this epistle to overcome is specifically to overcome the church&rsquo;s union with the world, the teaching of idolatry and fornication, and the teaching of hierarchy (vv. 14-15).</p>
<p>In verses 26 through 28 the Lord said to the church in Thyatira, &ldquo;He who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations; and he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father; and to him I will give the morning star.&rdquo; Pergamos typifies the worldly church, and Thyatira typifies the apostate Roman Catholic Church. Hence, in the letter to the church in Thyatira, to overcome is to overcome the apostate Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>In 3:5 the Lord said to the church in Sardis, &ldquo;He who overcomes will be clothed thus, in white garments, and I shall by no means erase his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.&rdquo; As a sign, the church in Sardis prefigures the Protestant church from the time of the Reformation to the second coming of Christ. Many have considered the reformed Protestant church to be living, but the Lord says that she is dead (v. 1). In this epistle, to overcome is to overcome the deadness of the Protestant churches, that is, to overcome dead Protestantism.</p>
<p>In 3:11-12 the Lord said to the church in Philadelphia, the church in recovery, &ldquo;I come quickly; hold fast what you have that no one take your crown. He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.&rdquo; The recovered church has gained the crown already. However, if she does not hold fast what she has in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery until the Lord comes back, her crown may be taken away by someone. Therefore, in this epistle to overcome is to hold fast what we have in the recovered church.</p>
<p>Finally, in the last of the seven epistles, the epistle to the church in Laodicea, which typifies the degraded recovered church, the Lord said, &ldquo;He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne&rdquo; (v. 21). In this epistle, to overcome is to overcome the lukewarmness and pride of the degraded recovered church (vv. 16-17), to pay the price to buy the needed items, indicating gold refined by fire, white garments, and eyesalve (v. 18), and to open the door so that the Lord may come in (v. 20).</p><h2 class="head4">a. By the Sevenfold Intensified Spirit of God</h2>
<p>We can overcome the degradation of the church by the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God. Revelation 1:4 speaks of &ldquo;the seven Spirits who are before His throne,&rdquo; and 3:1 speaks of &ldquo;the seven Spirits of God.&rdquo; The seven Spirits are undoubtedly the Spirit of God because they are ranked among the Triune God in Revelation 1:4 and 5. Seven is the number for completion in God&rsquo;s operation; therefore, the seven Spirits, the sevenfold intensified Spirit, are for God&rsquo;s move on the earth. In essence and existence, God&rsquo;s Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God&rsquo;s operation, God&rsquo;s Spirit is sevenfold. At the time this book was written, the church had become degraded. Therefore, the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God was needed for God&rsquo;s move and work on the earth.</p>
<p>In 1:4 and 5 the seven Spirits of God are listed second rather than third. This reveals the importance of the intensified function of the sevenfold Spirit of God. This point is confirmed by the repeated emphasis on the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking in 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 14:13; and 22:17. At the opening of the other Epistles, only the Father and the Son are mentioned in the giving of grace and peace to the receivers. In Revelation 1:4-5, however, the Spirit is included, from whom grace and peace are imparted to the churches. This too indicates the crucial need of the Spirit to counteract the degradation of the church. To be overcomers in the church, we need the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. By Eating Christ as the Tree of Life,<br />
the Hidden Manna, and a Feast</h2>
<p>The believers can become the overcomers by eating Christ as the tree of life, the hidden manna, and a feast (2:7, 17; 3:20). In the Bible the tree of life denotes Christ, the embodiment of all the riches of God (Col. 2:9), as our food (Gen. 2:9; 3:22, 24; Rev. 22:2, 14, 19). In 2:7 the tree of life signifies the crucified and resurrected Christ, who is in the church. Eating the tree of life, that is, enjoying Christ as our life supply, should be the primary matter in the church life. The content of the church life depends on the enjoyment of Christ. The more we enjoy Him, the richer the content will be.</p>
<p>In Revelation 2:17 the Lord spoke of the hidden manna. Manna is related to the matter of the Israelites&rsquo; eating in the wilderness (Exo. 16:14-16, 31). Manna is a type of Christ as the heavenly food that enables God&rsquo;s people to go His way. The open manna was for the Lord&rsquo;s people to enjoy in a public way; the hidden manna, signifying the hidden Christ, is a special portion reserved for His overcoming seekers, who overcome the degradation of the worldly church. While the church goes the way of the world, these overcomers come forward to abide in the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, where they enjoy the hidden Christ as a special portion for their daily supply.</p>
<p>In Revelation 3:20 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me.&rdquo; The Greek word <em>dine</em> denotes taking the principal meal of the day at evening. To dine is to eat not only one kind of food but to eat a rich feast. This may refer to the Israelites&rsquo; eating the rich produce of Canaan, the good land (Josh. 5:10-12).</p>
<p>The words of the Lord in Revelation 2:7, 17, and 3:20 indicate that He desires to recover God&rsquo;s people to the eating of proper food, that is, to what God has ordained, as typified by the tree of life, the manna, and the produce of the good land, all of which are types of Christ as our food in various aspects. The degradation of the church distracts God&rsquo;s people from eating Christ as food and turns them to the teaching of doctrines for knowledge. Hence, in Revelation 2 and 3 the Lord came to recover the proper eating of Him as our food supply. We need to eat Him, not only as the tree of life the hidden manna but also as a feast, full of His riches. We can be the overcomers by eating Christ as the tree of life, the hidden manna, and a feast.</p><h2 class="head4">c. By Listening to What the Spirit Says</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the believers can overcome by listening to the speaking of the Spirit (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). Revelation 2:7 says, &ldquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&rdquo; At the beginning of each of the seven epistles recorded in chapters 2 and 3, it is the Lord who speaks (2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14), but at the end of all seven epistles, it is the Spirit who is speaking to the churches. This not only indicates that the Spirit is the Lord and the Lord is the Spirit, but it also emphasizes the vital importance of the Spirit in the darkness of the church&rsquo;s degradation, as indicated by the sevenfold intensified Spirit in 1:4.</p>
<p>In Revelation 2 and 3 Christ is the speaking Spirit. If the speaker were only Christ and not the speaking Spirit, He would not be able to speak words into our spirit, and His speaking would not be as subjective and touching. In these chapters the speaker is not the objective Christ but the subjective Spirit. If we are open to Him in our spirit as we read these epistles, the Spirit will immediately speak something of Christ into us. Once we hear His speaking, something indelible is wrought into us, and nothing can take it away. Our Christ today is the speaking Spirit. We can be overcomers by listening to the speaking of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being the Man-child</h2>
<p>In the church life we can be the overcomers either as the man-child (12:5) or as the firstfruits (14:1-4). Revelation 12:5 says, &ldquo;She brought forth a son, a man-child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne.&rdquo; In the Bible, woman signifies the weaker one, and man signifies the stronger one (1 Pet. 3:7). Hence, the man-child in Revelation 12:5 signifies the stronger part of God&rsquo;s people. The man-child shepherding all the nations with an iron rod indicates that the man-child consists of the overcomers, as spoken of in 2:26-27. Moreover, <em>brought forth</em> signifies resurrection, as in Acts 13:33-34. The man-child is composed of the overcoming saints who have died and been resurrected. This is proven by the words <em>unto death</em> in Revelation 12:11. The man-child brought forth in verse 5 is composed of the brothers in verse 10; they were opposed and accused by the enemy of God, and &ldquo;they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death&rdquo; (v. 11).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Being the Firstfruits</h2>
<p>The man-child in Revelation 12 is composed of the overcomers who have died and been resurrected, but the firstfruits in chapter 14 are composed of the living overcomers, who live until the Lord&rsquo;s coming again and who are raptured to the throne of God in the third heaven before the great tribulation. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.&rdquo; The last part of verse 4 provides an explanation: &ldquo;These were purchased from among men as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.&rdquo; These living overcomers will be the first-ripe ones in God&rsquo;s field. Hence, they will be reaped before the harvest as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. The harvest will be reaped later, in verses 14 through 16. This means that the overcomers will be raptured to the heavens before the harvest, just as the firstfruits of the good land were reaped and brought into the temple of God before the harvest (Lev. 23:10-11; Exo. 23:19). The first overcomers, the firstfruits, will be raptured before the great tribulation, and the harvest, composed of the majority of the believers, will be raptured at the end of the great tribulation.</p><h2 class="head2">N. Being the Bride of Christ<br />
in the Marriage Feast of Christ</h2>
<p>Finally, the overcomers in the church will be the bride of Christ in His marriage feast (Rev. 19:7-8). The ultimate consummation of our living in the church will be our becoming the bride, the counterpart of Christ, at His coming back. At the marriage feast of Christ, we will be His bride, receiving the reward to enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, that is, to enter into the joy of the Lord (Matt. 25:21, 23) and to reign with Him for a thousand years.</p>
<p>Revelation 19:7 says, &ldquo;Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.&rdquo; The marriage of the Lamb is the issue of the completion of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. God&rsquo;s economy in the New Testament is to obtain a bride, the church, for Christ through His redemption and divine life. By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age. At that time the bride, the overcoming believers, will be ready. Moreover, according to verses 8 and 9, the wife, the bride, of Christ in verse 7 consists only of the overcoming believers during the millennium, whereas the bride, the wife, in 21:2 is composed of all the saved saints after the millennium for eternity. The readiness of the bride depends on the overcomers&rsquo; maturity in life. Furthermore, the overcomers are not separate individuals but a corporate bride. For this aspect, building is needed. The overcomers not only are mature in life but also are built together as one bride.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The believers who live in the church life should love all the brothers because they have been born of God; they should not only love the Father who has begotten them but also those begotten of Him. The believers who live in the church life should also forgive one another. Only through enjoying Christ as their joy and life supply can the believers be tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ also forgave them.</p>
<p>As the believers corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the church, they are being built in the church. The believers in their localities are being built together in the all-inclusive Christ as their peace, foundation, and cornerstone to become the dwelling place of God in spirit. This kind of building is a great help for the spiritual growth of the believers.</p>
<p>The goal of the believers&rsquo; living the church life is the building up of the church. God&rsquo;s goal is the building; the building work is done directly by all the believers as members of the Body.</p>
<p>The believers can also be overcomers in the church, not mainly in regard to sins, the world, the flesh, the self, and Satan but over the degradation of the church. Today degradation is prevalent; hence, the believers need to counteract the degradation of the church by the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God. The believers also need to recover the normal eating of Christ as the tree of life, the manna, and as a feast to be their food supply so that they might be the overcomers. Also, to be the overcomers the believers need to let Christ be wrought into them by listening to the speaking of the Spirit. Moreover, the believers can be the overcomers either as the man-child or the firstfruits. The man-child is composed of the believers who have died and been resurrected, whereas the firstfruits are the first group of overcomers who are raptured before the great tribulation.</p>
<p>Finally, the overcomers in the church will be the bride of Christ at His marriage feast, receiving the reward to enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, that is, to enter into the joy of the Lord and to reign with Him for a thousand years. For this reason, the overcomers not only need to mature in life, but they also need to be built together to become the bride of Christ.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of transformation, we corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity by entering into the kingdom of God, living in the church life, and living in the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. BY LIVING IN THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>For the believers to corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, three steps are needed. First, we need to enter into the kingdom of God and live the kingdom life. Second, we need to live in the church life by living the kingdom life. Third, we need to live in the Body of Christ by living in the church life. The sequence of these three steps is the kingdom, the church, and the Body of Christ. According to the order revealed in the New Testament, the kingdom comes first, then the church follows, and the result is the Body of Christ. This revelation indicates that one cannot live in the Body of Christ without first living in the kingdom and the church.</p>
<p>The kingdom, the church, and the Body of Christ are the framework and inward essence of our Christian living. Without the kingdom, the church, and the Body of Christ, God&rsquo;s New Testament economy would not have a framework, an organic life essence, an essence that matches God&rsquo;s being. Both the framework and organic life essence of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy are closely related to the kingdom, the church, and the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the first person to speak regarding the kingdom is John the Baptist. In Matthew 3:2 John said, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.&rdquo; In 4:17 the Lord Jesus repeated his words. Then in 16:18 He spoke of the church: &ldquo;I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; Following this, the Lord mentioned the kingdom again, saying to Peter, &ldquo;I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in the heavens&rdquo; (v. 19). Here the Lord indicated that He would give the keys of the kingdom of the heavens to Peter; thus, Peter would be able to open the door for people to enter into the kingdom so that the Lord might build them into the church.</p>
<p>In Acts there are many portions that speak of the kingdom and the church. Acts 1:3 tells us that after the Lord passed through suffering, He presented Himself alive to the apostles by many irrefutable proofs, appearing to them through a period of forty days and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God. This strongly proves that the kingdom of God was the main subject of the apostles&rsquo; preaching in carrying out their commission after Pentecost. Before the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens and poured Himself out as the all-inclusive Spirit for the building up of the church, He taught His disciples regarding the kingdom. Without any knowledge or understanding concerning the kingdom, it would have been difficult for the Lord Jesus to bring them into the church. Therefore, in Acts 1 He thoroughly taught them regarding the kingdom. As a result, the church came into existence shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>In Acts the church is first spoken of in 5:11; then 8:1 speaks of the church in Jerusalem. In the subsequent chapters the church is repeatedly spoken of (v. 3; 9:31; 11:22, 26; 12:1, 5; 13:1; 14:23, 27; 15:3-4, 22, 41; 16:5; 18:22; 20:17, 28). However, even after the church was brought in, the kingdom continued to be preached. In 8:12 Philip announced the gospel of God&rsquo;s kingdom to the people of Samaria. Then 14:22 says, &ldquo;Through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo; According to 19:8, Paul spoke boldly concerning the kingdom of God. Acts 20:25 says that he went about among the people, proclaiming the kingdom. Finally in 28:23 Paul &ldquo;expounded these matters, solemnly testifying of the kingdom of God&rdquo; to those who came to him at his lodging. These verses clearly show that the book of Acts begins and ends with the kingdom of God. Moreover, Acts also reveals that the kingdom and the church are a pair. Without the kingdom, the church life would not have a beginning, nor would it have a conclusion. The church life is closely related to the kingdom; the kingdom is the life pulse of the church. Hence, the kingdom is vitally important to the church life.</p>
<p>God first works to gain the kingdom so that the church may be built up. In this way the church becomes the organism of Christ, the Body of Christ, to express the Triune God embodied in Christ. This is the revelation of the New Testament.</p>
<p>In the New Testament Paul was the only person who spoke of the Body of Christ. He mentioned the Body of Christ in Romans, 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, and Colossians. The thought, concept, and revelation of the Body of Christ were brought in through Paul.</p>
<p>If we do not experience the church in its proper relationship to the kingdom and the Body of Christ, we will not have the framework or the life pulse revealed in the New Testament. Hence, it is vitally important for us to see the New Testament revelation and comprehend the New Testament teaching concerning the kingdom, the church, and the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>If we are serious in following the Lord Jesus in this age for the sake of His interests on earth, we will enter into the kingdom of God. We not only need to know the truth and doctrine concerning the kingdom but also the reality and practice of the kingdom. In other words, we need to live in the kingdom. In addition, we need to live in the church in reality and in practicality. This means that we need to practice the church life. We need to be a church person, living in the reality and practicality of the church according to the truth. No matter where we are, we must practice the church life. If we live in the kingdom and in the church, we will spontaneously live in the Body. If we as believers live in the kingdom, in the church, and in the Body to corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the Lord will have a way to accomplish His eternal purpose; moreover, we will receive a reward from Him at His coming back.</p>
<p>God planned to have the church for the expression of Christ. The only way for the church to be the expression of Christ is for her to be the Body of Christ. If we look at ourselves, we will realize that our body is simply our expression. Without a body, we would not be able to express ourselves. Likewise, apart from the church as His Body, Christ has no way to express Himself.</p>
<p>The church as the Body of Christ is not an organization; it is organic. The church is an organic Body composed of all the believers who have been regenerated and have the life of Christ to be the expression of Christ the Head. The Body is the fullness of the Head, and the fullness is the expression of the Head. Christ, the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:22-23), needs a large Body to be His fullness. This Body is the church as His expression.</p>
<p>The church is the Body of Christ, and Christ is the Head of the Body (Col. 1:18). Therefore, the church and Christ are one Body, a mystical and universally great man, who has the same life and nature and enjoys the same position and authority.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Being Baptized in One Spirit into One Body</h2>
<p>The first step of our living in the Body of Christ is that we are baptized in one Spirit into one Body. First Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; The Spirit is the sphere and element of our spiritual baptism, and in such a Spirit we were all baptized into one organic entity, the Body of Christ, so we should all, regardless of our race, nationality, or social rank, be this one Body. Christ is the life and constituent of this Body, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ. It is in this one Spirit that we were all baptized into one living Body to express Christ.</p>
<p>The baptism of the Spirit is not for individuals but for the Body. In 1 Corinthians 12:13 Paul clearly says, &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body.&rdquo; This Body is an organic entity. We know from Matthew 28:19 and Galatians 3:27 that we have been baptized into the Triune God and into Christ. The Triune God and Christ are organic&mdash;They are living. Romans 6:3 reveals that we have not only been baptized into Christ, but we have been baptized into His death. On the positive side, we have been baptized into the Triune God and into Christ; on the negative side, we have been baptized into Christ&rsquo;s death, having a clearance of all the negative things, such as sins, the flesh, the self, and the old creation. Therefore, the believers in Christ are baptized through water and in the Spirit into Christ, the death of Christ, the name (the person) of the Triune God, and the Body of Christ. Baptism ushers believers into an organic union with Christ and the Triune God, making them living members of the Body of Christ. The ultimate result of baptism is to put the believers into the Body.</p>
<p>We have been baptized into the Triune God, into Christ, into the death of Christ, and into the Body of Christ, but the destination of this baptism is not the Triune God, Christ, or the death of Christ; our destination is the Body of Christ. Our baptism begins with our being brought into the Triune God, but it eventually leads us to the Body of Christ. Since the Body of Christ is the destination of baptism, we need to remain in this destination. Today we are not only in the Triune God, in Christ, and in the death of Christ, but we are in the Body of Christ&mdash;the church. The Body of Christ is our destination, and we should live, move, serve, worship, grow, act, work, and have our being in the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Drinking One Spirit</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 12:13 Paul tells us that we were not only baptized in one Spirit into one Body, but we were also given to drink one Spirit. To be baptized in one Spirit is to get into the Spirit and to be lost in Him; to drink the Spirit is to take the Spirit in and to have our being saturated with Him. By these two procedures we are mingled with the Spirit. To be baptized in the Spirit is the initiation of the mingling and is once for all. To drink the Spirit is the continuation and accomplishment of the mingling and is perpetual, forever.</p>
<p>This verse also shows us where we can drink this Spirit. We drink this Spirit in the Body. If we were not in the Body, there would not be the flow, and there would be nothing to drink; the flow is in the Body. According to Revelation, in eternity the flow will be in the New Jerusalem (22:1-2); today the flow is in the Body. We were all baptized in one Spirit into one Body, and we were all given to drink one Spirit. The Spirit is in the Body of Christ. As long as we remain in the Body, in the destination of our baptism, we can drink the Spirit. Those who seek to be filled with the Holy Spirit should enter into the Body of Christ, because in the Body we were all given to drink the Spirit, who is in the Body. To be baptized into the Body is once for all, but to drink the one Spirit is perpetual. As along as we are in the Body, we are given to drink this Spirit. We have been baptized in one Spirit, and now we drink this one Spirit in the Body.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Being Constituted with Christ<br />
to Be His One Body</h2>
<p>The believers in Christ are being constituted with Christ into His one Body. Not only were we baptized into one Body; we are being constituted with Christ to become His Body. First Corinthians 12:12 says, &ldquo;Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.&rdquo; In Greek <em>Christ</em> in this verse is &ldquo;the Christ,&rdquo; referring to the corporate Christ, composed of Christ Himself as the Head and the church as His Body, of which all the believers are members. All the believers in Christ have an organic union with Him and are constituted with His life and element to be His Body, an organism to express Him. Hence, He is not only the Head but also the Body. As our physical body is one yet composed of many members, so is the Christ.</p>
<p>Only when all the members are constituted with Christ, having His life and nature, can the church become the Body of Christ. If we look at our physical body, we will realize that anything that does not have our life and nature is not and cannot be a part of our body. Just as our body is part of us, the Body of Christ, the church, is part of Christ. As members of the Body, we are part of Christ, being constituted with Christ.</p>
<p>Since the reality of Christ is the Spirit, the way for us to be constituted as His Body is to drink the Spirit. The Body has been formed through baptism in one Spirit. We have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body. Having been baptized into one Body, we have been placed in a position to drink so that we may be constituted as the Body by drinking the Spirit. By drinking the Spirit, we experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity into our being, and by drinking the Spirit, we are constituted the Body. Therefore, what the Body of Christ needs is not organization but a unique constitution composed of the divine element wrought into our inward being through our drinking of the one Spirit. The more we drink of this one Spirit, the more the divine element becomes our constituent to make us the one Body.</p>
<p>Just as the vine in John 15 is an organism, the church as the Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God. No man, matter, thing, or even the devil can damage the Body because it is an organism constituted with Christ; the Body is the constitution of God, the organism of God. In Revelation the church, the Body of Christ, as the embodiment of the Triune God is depicted by the golden lampstand; the golden lampstand typifies the embodied Triune God. The Body of Christ is a divine constitution; it is an organism constituted with the person of the Triune God. We need to see that we are constituted with Christ to be the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>For the believers to corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, three steps are needed: to enter into the kingdom and live the kingdom life, to live in the church through living the kingdom life, and to live in the Body of Christ through living in the church life. The New Testament reveals that God works to gain the kingdom so that the church can be built up to be the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God, expressing the Triune God embodied in Christ. Therefore, the believers need to live in the kingdom, in the church, and in the Body of Christ in order to corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity so that the Lord may have a way to accomplish His eternal purpose and so that they may receive a reward.</p>
<p>The first step for the believers to live in the Body of Christ is to be baptized in one Spirit into one Body, and the second step is to drink this one Spirit. The Spirit is the sphere and element of the spiritual baptism of the believers, in whom the believers are baptized into an organic entity, the Body of Christ, to express Christ. The Body of Christ is the destination of the believers; therefore, the believers should live, move, serve, and worship in the Body. In this way the believers can drink the Spirit. To be baptized in the Spirit is to get into the Spirit and be lost in Him; to drink the Spirit is for the believers to take the Spirit in and have their whole being saturated with Him. By these two procedures, the believers are mingled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>The believers in Christ are not only baptized into one Body; they are being constituted with Christ to become His one Body, which is the third step. This requires that the believers as members of Christ be constituted with Christ and have His life and nature so that the church can become the Body of Christ. The reality of Christ is the Spirit; hence, the way to be constituted with Christ to be His Body is to drink the Spirit. The more the believers drink this one Spirit, the more the divine element will become their constituent and make them the one Body. This Body is the organism of the Triune God that no man, matter, or thing can damage.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will continue to see how to corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity through living in the Body of Christ in the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Being Mingled Together with God</h2>
<p>In the Body we are being mingled together with God. First Corinthians 12:23-24 says, &ldquo;Those members of the body which we consider to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor; and our uncomely members come to have more abundant comeliness, but our comely members have no need. But God has blended the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked.&rdquo; The word <em>blended</em> has the connotation of being tempered. The Amplified New Testament supplements the word <em>blended</em> with <em>mingled,harmonized,</em> and <em>subtly proportioned the parts of the whole.</em> God has blended together the various members of the Body of Christ to be one Body. To be blended in the Body is to be mingled and blended together. Through this blending we are coordinated, balanced, and adjusted. To be blended is to be balanced by dealing with one&rsquo;s extremes. In the local churches there are many saints with different dispositions. Some are very spiritual, and some are not so spiritual. The spiritual ones need to blend with those who are not so spiritual so that the spiritual ones can be properly spiritual. There is a need for weaker ones; they test the genuineness of our spirituality. Hence, we should not expect every saint to be a spiritual giant; this is absolutely not according to the condition of the church. According to the Holy Scriptures, we all need to be blended. The hot ones need to be blended with the cold ones, the quick ones with the slow ones, and the spiritual ones with the not so spiritual ones.</p>
<p>The Body is built up through all the different members&mdash;the comely and the less honorable, the strong and the weak. The different members should not be arranged into different categories; rather, all must be blended together in the Body. When we are blended together, the uncomely ones share the comeliness of the comely ones, and the weak ones receive the nourishing and support of the stronger ones. In this way, the Body is realized.</p>
<p>If we have not been blended into the Body, it will be impossible for us to be built together and for us to coordinate with others. The quick ones have no way to coordinate with the slow ones unless both are willing to be blended. Without the blending, it is impossible for two saints to become one in reality. In our experience the blending often comes from the coordination in the work. The church life is a life of always needing to be blended. God not only places the members of Christ in the Body, He also blends the Body together.</p>
<p>In the church life there are people with different skin colors and of different races, nationalities, and social ranks; however, we are one Body. This is possible only through God blending the members of the Body together. He blends us by the inner life and through His indwelling. Everything the Lord does in the Body is a matter of His dispensing. Therefore, the blending of the Body is also a matter of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. The more God blends, adjusts, and balances us, the more He dispenses Himself into us. The balancing, adjusting, coordinating, and blending are all related to the divine dispensing, that is, the dispensing of the processed Triune God into us.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Caring for One Another</h2>
<p>If we read 1 Corinthians 12 carefully, we will see that to blend the Body is to uplift the inferior ones, to belittle the superior ones, to encourage the weaker ones, and to adorn the uncomely members with more abundant comeliness. Moreover, to blend the Body is to practice mutual care for one another. In the churches we need to uplift the inferior ones and somewhat limit the superior ones. We need to strengthen and encourage the weak ones and adorn the uncomely ones. In addition, if we practice mutual care, we will have the Body in reality.</p>
<p>God blends the Body together and gives more abundant honor to a member that lacks so that &ldquo;there would be no division in the body, but that the members would have the same care for one another&rdquo; (v. 25). In the Body life, all the different members should receive the same care. Differences in care cause division. Therefore, in the Body we need to have mutual care for one another.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Individually Members One of Another</h2>
<p>Romans 12:5 says, &ldquo;We who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another.&rdquo; The phrase <em>in Christ</em> implies that we are one with Christ organically and that we have a life union with Him. We were born in Adam, but we have been transferred into Christ. Because we have been organically united with Christ, we have been organically transferred into the Body of Christ. In Christ we have an organic union with the Body of Christ; we are organic components in the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The organic union with Christ is realized in the divine life. This life not only links us to Christ but also to all the members of the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is altogether a matter of life; this life keeps us in organic union with Christ. When we remain in this organic union, we are in the Body. However, when we do not remain in the organic union, we are outside the Body. The reality of the Body is in the organic union with Christ. If we want to live in the Body, we need to remain in an organic union with Christ. The more we remain in an organic union with Christ, the more we live in the Body of Christ in reality.</p>
<p>The Body life is a corporate life. This can be seen by looking at our physical body. Our physical body is a corporate entity composed of many members. All the members have their life and function in the body. If any member becomes separate or detached from the body, that member loses its life and function. No member of the body can be independent of the body or become individualistic. The same principle applies to the Body of Christ. As members of the Body, none of us is a complete entity; every one of us is a member of Christ. Therefore, in order to live and fulfill our function, we need to remain in the Body.</p>
<p>Romans 12 reveals the importance of practicing the Body life. In particular, verse 5 reveals that in the Body we are individually members one of another. We who are many are one Body, one entity. In the Body we are able to function and express Christ corporately. We are many members, not many separate units. As members, we need to coordinate with one another so that we may be a living and functioning Body. We are &ldquo;individually members one of another.&rdquo; The word <em>individually</em> here does not imply separation but distinction. It indicates that in the Body there are different kinds of members. Consequently, we are individually members one of another.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Through the Believers Presenting<br />
Their Bodies as a Living Sacrifice</h2>
<p>The believers live in the Body of Christ through presenting their bodies as a living sacrifice. Romans 12:1 says, &ldquo;I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service.&rdquo; To have the Body life, we need to present our bodies to the Lord and to His Body. We need to present our bodies to the Lord for His Body. In His salvation, the Lord released our bodies from the usurping hand of the enemy Satan; now in our organic union with Christ, we need to present our released bodies to the Lord for the Body life.</p>
<p>To present our bodies to God is the practical aspect of our consecration. We need to present our bodies because our existence is in our bodies. In this way, our whole being is given to God practically. Genuine consecration is to present our bodies. This is not merely to wish or to have an obedience in words; rather, it is to present ourselves to God wholly and practically.</p>
<p>In 12:1 Paul exhorts us to present our bodies as a living sacrifice. Earlier in chapter 6 he speaks of warfare and service, encouraging us to present the members of our bodies as weapons for fighting and as slaves for serving (vv. 13, 19). In the church life, presenting our bodies is a matter of sacrifice, of offering ourselves to God for His satisfaction. The Body life as a whole is an offering for the satisfaction of God. Although many bodies are presented, the sacrifice is one. The many members are one Body, and the many believers are one church. Hence, the many bodies presented to the Lord for His Body are one sacrifice.</p>
<p>Paul spoke of a living sacrifice. This is in contrast to the sacrifices of the Old Testament. The sacrifices offered in the Old Testament were all slain, but the church is not a slain offering; the church is a living offering, full of Christ as life. In Romans 8 the believers are filled with Christ as the life-giving Spirit. Then in chapter 12 the believers are encouraged to present themselves to God as a sacrifice, a living sacrifice filled with the Spirit of life. Furthermore, the sacrifice is holy, meaning that it is separate from common things and that it possesses God&rsquo;s nature. Our God is holy. He is absolutely different and separate from all other things. His holy nature has been wrought into the members of the Body. Hence, the Body is holy and unique. Nothing common can be brought into it.</p><h2 class="head2">H. Being Transformed<br />
by the Renewing of the Mind,<br />
Not Being Fashioned according to this Age,<br />
and Knowing the Will of God</h2>
<p>Romans 12 shows that after our bodies are presented to the Lord for His Body, we still need to be transformed in our soul through the renewing of our mind so that we may prove what the will of God is by producing the Body of Christ through our organic union with Him. Verse 2 says, &ldquo;Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect.&rdquo; The mind, the leading part of the soul, represents our soul. Therefore, transformation in this verse refers to the transformation of the soul for the Body life. Our bodies need to be presented, and our soul needs to be transformed. To practice the Body life, we must first present our bodies to God, and then we need to be transformed in our soul by the renewing of the mind.</p>
<p>Transformation does not merely denote an outward change; it implies that a substance is changed both in nature and form. This is a metabolic change. It is not merely an outward change; this is a change in both outward form and inward constitution. This kind of change takes place through the process of metabolism. In the metabolic process, an organic element comes into our being and produces a change in our organic life, changing our constitution from one form into another.</p>
<p>Transformation is Christ added into us and replacing our being, which causes Christ to increase and our natural life to decrease. When the process of transformation takes place in us, the old element of our natural man is gradually discharged, and the new element&mdash;the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit&mdash;is added into us, replacing our natural element. We need to have a deep impression of the fact that transformation is a metabolic process, a metabolic change related to our entire being&mdash;our life, nature, essence, element, form, and expression. Transformation is not outward correction or adjustment; rather, it is an inward, metabolic change. Therefore, transformation can be defined as a divine and spiritual metabolism, in which a new element is added to an old element, discharging the old element and producing something new.</p>
<p>According to Romans 12:2, we are transformed by the renewing of the mind. It is possible that we may have been regenerated in spirit but are still old in our mind. If we are still old in our mind, we will have no transformation in our soul and no change in our thinking. However, if our mind is renewed, our soul will be transformed. The mind in this verse is different from the mind as presented in Romans 7 and 8. In Romans 7 the mind is alone, acting independently. In Romans 8 the mind is dependent, being set on the spirit. However, the mind not only needs to be dependent and set on the spirit; it also needs to be renewed. For transformation we need a renewed mind.</p>
<p>The mind is renewed not by outward teachings but by the element of Christ being added into it. When the Lord Jesus spreads Himself from our spirit to our mind, our mind is renewed. By the renewing of our mind, our soul is metabolically changed. When our mind is renewed, we are spontaneously renewed in our emotion and will, because the mind regulates the emotion and affects the will. Moreover, if our mind is saturated and occupied by the Lord, He will take over our emotion and occupy our will. This is why the transformation of our soul is by the renewing of the mind.</p>
<p>In 12:2 Paul exhorts us to not be fashioned according to this age but to be transformed by the renewing of the mind. <em>This age</em> denotes the present, practical part of the world, which stands in opposition to the Body life and replaces the Body life. The whole world is a system of Satan, and the age is a part of this world system. We cannot contact the world unless we contact the present age of the world. To be fashioned according to this age means to adopt the modern fashions of the present age; to be transformed is to allow an organic element to be wrought into our being, thus producing an inward metabolic change. Because the present age opposes the church, we must not be fashioned according to it. If we are to live in the Body of Christ, we should not follow the present age or be fashioned according to this age.</p>
<p>We need the renewing of the mind and the transformation of the soul so that we &ldquo;may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect.&rdquo; In this verse the will of God does not refer to our personal human situation&mdash;to matters of marriage, employment, or housing. According to Romans 12, the will of God is the Body life. Through transformation by the renewing of the mind, we can prove and discern that the will of God is to obtain the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>In the Body of Christ the believers are being blended together by God; that is, they are being mingled and blended together in order to be coordinated, balanced, and adjusted. To be blended means to be balanced by having one&rsquo;s extremes dealt with. The Body is built up by means of all the different members, and these members are blended together to produce a blended Body. God not only places the members of Christ in the Body, but He also blends the Body together.</p>
<p>To blend the Body together is to practice caring for one another so that there is the Body in reality. In the Body the believers need to have mutual care for one another and be members of the Body of Christ individually. Through their transfer into Christ and their organic union with Christ, the believers enter into the Body of Christ and are joined to Christ and to all His members by the divine life. In order to live and function in the Body, the believers must remain in an organic union with Christ in practicality. The Body life is a corporate life; hence, the believers, being different kinds of members in the Body, need to be members mutually and individually.</p>
<p>The believers live in the Body of Christ by presenting their bodies as a living sacrifice. In His salvation, the Lord released the believers&rsquo; bodies from the usurping hand of the enemy; now the believers should present their bodies to the Lord for the Body as a living sacrifice, full of Christ as life. The believers not only should be filled with Christ as the life-giving Spirit; they should also present their bodies as a living sacrifice, that is, be separated from all common things and matters and to possess God&rsquo;s nature.</p>
<p>The believers then need to be transformed by the renewing of the mind, not being fashioned according to this age, so that they may know that the will of God is to obtain a Body for Christ, a Body that has been produced through their organic union with Christ. The mind is the leading part of the soul and the representative of the soul. For the Body life, they need to present their bodies and have their soul transformed, that is, to let Christ be added to them to replace their being and to allow Christ to increase and their natural life to decrease. In this way, they will prove and discern the will of God, which is to obtain the Body so that they would live the Body life.</p>

<p>In this lesson we will continue to see how we can corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity by living in the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. Not Being Slothful in Zeal,<br />
but Being Burning in Spirit, Serving the Lord</h2>
<p>Romans 12:11 says, &ldquo;Do not be slothful in zeal, but be burning in spirit, serving the Lord.&rdquo; This refers to the exercise of the human spirit, that is, the mingled spirit, for the Body life. If we want to practically live the Body life, our spirit must be set on fire and continually burning. For the Body life, we need a body that is presented, a mind that is renewed through the transformation of the soul, and a spirit that is burning. Our whole being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;is necessary for the church life. For the sake of the Body life, our body needs to be presented, our soul transformed, and our mind metabolically changed. Our mind must be renewed, not by simply being taught but by being transformed, by having the element of Christ spread into it to produce a metabolic change. If we are serious about practicing the church life, we need to present our body, have our soul transformed, and be burning in our spirit. If we have a heart for the Body life but fail to present our body to the church, we are impractical. However, even if we have presented our bodies, yet our mind is filled with old concepts, thoughts, and traditions, our unrenewed mind will be a great problem to the church. Hence, after we have presented our body, our mind needs to be renewed, and our spirit needs to be burning. If by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, our body has been presented and our mind has been renewed, yet our spirit remains cold, we will not be of much benefit to the Body life. After the presenting of our body and the renewing of our mind, we need to be burning in spirit.</p>
<p>Paul speaks of the body, the mind, and the spirit in Romans 8, a chapter that speaks of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity into the tripartite man, and in Romans 12, a chapter that speaks of the Body life. Paul&rsquo;s speaking concerning the body, the mind, and the spirit links together chapters 8 and 12. In other words, the enjoyment of the divine dispensing in chapter 8 issues in the Body life in chapter 12. This matter is very experiential. If we do not have sufficient experience of what is revealed in chapter 8 and do not enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity into our tripartite being, we will not be able to practically realize the Body of Christ. As a result, the teaching concerning the Body will be only a doctrine to us, and our speaking concerning the Body will be in vain. If, however, we experience and enjoy the divine dispensing in chapter 8, that is, the dispensing into our body, soul, and spirit, this experience and enjoyment will bring us into the realization of the Body life in chapter 12. The more we enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity into our tripartite being, the more we will desire to be in the Body. The enjoyment of the dispensing of the processed Triune God makes us living members of the Body of Christ in practicality.</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. Through the Exercise of the Different Gifts</h2>
<p>We also practice the Body life through the exercise of the different gifts. Romans 12:6-8 enumerates several different functions, or gifts: &ldquo;Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; or service, let us be faithful in that service; he who teaches, in that teaching; or he who exhorts, in that exhortation; he who gives, in simplicity; he who leads, in diligence; he who shows mercy, in cheerfulness.&rdquo; Grace refers to God in Christ as our life and enjoyment. In other words, grace is the divine element entering into our being to be our life for our enjoyment. Grace is not something outward; rather, it is the element of the divine life entering into our being and bringing with it certain skills and abilities as gifts. Therefore, the gifts, the spiritual abilities, issue from the divine element that we have enjoyed. As we enjoy God, receiving and assimilating His divine element into our being, spontaneously a skill or an ability issues out of the divine element as a gift. These gifts differ according to the divine element that we have enjoyed and assimilated into our being. Since the gifts in verses 6 through 8 are according to the grace given to us, these gifts issue from the grace of life.</p>
<p>The gifts in Romans 12 are according to grace. This means that the gifts are granted according to the measure of life. If we have enjoyed the life of God to a high degree, we will receive a higher gift. However, if our enjoyment of the life of God is limited, our gift will also be limited, for the measure of our gift is limited by the extent to which we have enjoyed the divine life as grace within us. The gifts enumerated in Romans 12 are not miraculous gifts that come to us suddenly. Rather, they are similar to the abilities of the members of our physical body. The measure of the ability of the members of our body depends upon the amount of life in our body. If our body is mature, having experienced considerable growth in life and possessing a great amount of life, it will have an abundant overflow of life. The overflow of the inner life of the body produces abilities. The development of the gifts in Romans 12, like the abilities of our body, depends upon the amount of life we have. In Romans 12 the gifts of grace in life include prophecy, service, teaching, exhortation, giving, leading, and showing mercy.</p>
<p>The first gift Paul speaks of in Romans 12 is prophecy, that is, to prophesy according to the proportion of faith. In this verse prophecy does not mainly refer to prediction. Moreover, in the entire Bible, prediction is not the main aspect of prophecy. The main aspect of prophecy is to speak for, that is, to speak for someone, and it is to speak forth, that is, to speak forth a certain matter. The main concept of prophecy in Romans 12 is not prediction; rather, it is to speak for God and to speak forth God under God&rsquo;s direct revelation.</p>
<p><em>Service</em> in verse 7 refers to the service of the deacons and deaconesses in the local churches (16:1; 1 Tim. 3:8-13; Phil. 1:1). The deacons and deaconesses are serving ones in a local church. They must have a serving spirit and a serving attitude for the practice of the Body life.</p>
<p>In the Body there is not only the gift of prophecy but also the gifts of teaching and exhortation. To prophesy is to speak for the Lord based on the direct revelation a person receives from the Lord, to teach is to instruct others based on what the prophets have spoken, and to exhort is to exhort others according to prophecy and teaching. Prophecy, teaching, and exhortation are three kinds of speaking that build up the Body. They minister the life supply so that the saints may grow together by God&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>Moreover, the ability to give in simplicity is also a gift of grace in life. This denotes a giving that supplies and takes care of the needy ones in the church. In the Body life we need those who are able to give material possessions to help the needy ones, to speed the Lord&rsquo;s work, and to care for the practical needs of the church.</p>
<p><em>He who leads</em> in Romans 12:8 refers to the leading brothers in the church. The first quality of leadership is diligence. A leading brother, that is, an elder, needs to be diligent in everything and in every way all the time. The elders&rsquo; ability, function, and gift in taking the lead depend upon their diligence. Furthermore, the ability in life to show mercy is also a gift. To show mercy in cheerfulness is a quality that is formed in us by transformation. When we grow in the life of Christ and come to love the Lord more, a certain quality will be formed in us, and we will be burdened to take care of others and show mercy to the unworthy ones. This is not a characteristic of our natural birth but a quality developed in us by our growth in life through the process of transformation.</p>
<p>The gifts spoken of in verses 6 through 8 are all necessary in the practice of the Body life. In the Body life we first need to speak for God under His direct revelation. Based upon the speaking of revelation, we have teaching, and based on the prophecy and teaching, we have exhortation. In addition to these, there is the leading of the elders and the service of the deacons. Furthermore, there are some who are able to give material possessions to the church, to help the needy ones, and to care for the Lord&rsquo;s work. Finally, there are those who show mercy to people. These seven gifts are fitting for the practice of the Body life.</p><h2 class="head2">K. Through Living a Life of the Highest Virtues<br />
of the Divine Life and Love</h2>
<p>Finally, the believers live the Body life through living a life of the highest virtues of the divine life and love (vv. 9-21). In the Body life we must first have love toward others. Verse 9 says, &ldquo;Let love be without hypocrisy&rdquo;; then verse 10 says, &ldquo;Love one another warmly in brotherly love.&rdquo; In order to practice love toward others, we need the Holy Spirit to work in us and give us a certain amount of transformation in love. Love is not merely an outward act; it is an expression of life. Without the supply of life, it is useless to try to love others. To love others, we need the supply of life and transformation in life. Our natural life is not the life of God&rsquo;s love. We need transformation in life so that we may have the nature of God&rsquo;s love to love others.</p>
<p>Verse 10 says, &ldquo;Take the lead in showing honor one to another,&rdquo; and verse 13 says, &ldquo;Contribute to the needs of the saints; pursue hospitality.&rdquo; In the matter of showing honor we must move quickly and be the first to show honor to others. Furthermore, we need to contribute to the needs of the saints and to pursue hospitality.</p>
<p>Verse 15 says, &ldquo;Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep.&rdquo; We must be transformed before we can rejoice and weep with others. This indicates that in the Body life we need to have a proper emotion to be able to rejoice and weep with others. Verse 16 admonishes us, saying, &ldquo;Be of the same mind toward one another, not setting your mind on the high things but going along with the lowly; do not be wise in yourselves.&rdquo; We should not be so high; rather, we need to go along with the lowly.</p>
<p>Apart from the virtues we need toward others, Romans 12 also speaks of the virtues we need toward ourselves. Verse 12 says, &ldquo;Rejoice in hope; endure in tribulation; persevere in prayer.&rdquo; We believers should be a rejoicing people because we always have the enjoyment of the Lord. If we enjoy the Lord in His riches, we will not only be joyful inwardly, but we will be rejoicing outwardly. Even in times of trouble we should and can rejoice in hope. By rejoicing in hope we can endure any kind of tribulation. However, in order to endure tribulation we also need to be persevering in prayer. Perseverance in prayer enables us not only to endure tribulation but to remain in the enjoyment of the Lord, in His presence, and in His will.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, as God&rsquo;s holy people, we must &ldquo;abhor what is evil&rdquo; (v. 9), &ldquo;conquer evil with good&rdquo; (v. 21), and &ldquo;cling to what is good&rdquo; (v. 9). We, who have been separated to God, must maintain the highest standard of behavior, a standard above that of moral and ethical people. In relation to our persecutors and enemies, we must live a life of the highest virtues of the divine life and love. Verse 14 says, &ldquo;Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.&rdquo; Regardless of how bad people may be toward us, our mouth should only express blessing, not cursing. How the Lord blessed us when we were His enemies! We should bless our enemies and persecutors in the same way.</p>
<p>The first half of verse 17 says, &ldquo;Repay no one evil for evil.&rdquo; Under the law it was an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. Today we are not under law but under grace. We must not repay evil for evil but rather repay good for evil as the Lord has done to us. Verse 19 continues, &ldquo;Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to the wrath of God, for it is written, &lsquo;Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the Lord.&rsquo;&rdquo; While we are practicing the Body life in love with the highest virtues in the divine life, we should not avenge ourselves in any way. On the contrary, we should be willing to suffer people&rsquo;s wrongdoings, including the loss of everything. We should leave the whole situation in the sovereign hand of the Lord and give Him the place to do whatever He likes according to His sovereignty.</p>
<p>Verse 20 says, &ldquo;If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing this you will heap coals of fire upon his head.&rdquo; This is what it means to love our enemies. Our loving them will heap coals of fire upon their heads, causing them to turn to the Lord.</p>
<p>Verse 18 says, &ldquo;If possible, as far as it depends on you, live in peace with all men.&rdquo; As far as it depends on us, we need to live in peace with all men. Sometimes it is not possible to live in peace with all men because others are not willing to have a life of peace. In such a situation there is nothing we can do. Therefore, Paul says that &ldquo;if possible&rdquo; we should live in peace with all men. In the second half of verse 17 Paul gives a general word: &ldquo;Take forethought for things honorable in the sight of all men.&rdquo; We must be very thoughtful to consider what is honorable before all men. Our thoughtfulness must take place beforehand. In order to keep from offending people, we should not oppose anything that is honorable. Since we are not only living before God but also before men, we need to take forethought for things honorable in the sight of men.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>If a believer desires to live the Body life in practicality, he needs to present his body and be renewed and transformed in his mind. He also needs to not be slothful in zeal, but be burning in spirit, serving the Lord. Therefore, the believer&rsquo;s entire tripartite being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;is necessary to live the Body life. The more a believer enjoys the dispensing of the Divine Trinity into his tripartite being, the more he becomes a living member of the Body of Christ in practicality and the more he desires to be in the Body.</p>
<p>The believers practice the Body life through the exercise of their different gifts. When the divine element enters into the believers to be their life and to be enjoyed by them, this is grace; grace brings forth certain skills and abilities as gifts. The measure of a believer&rsquo;s gift is limited by the level of his enjoyment of the divine life as grace. The gifts enumerated in Romans 12:6-8 are like the abilities of our human body; they are the gifts of grace in life and include prophesying, serving, teaching, exhorting, giving, leading, and showing mercy.</p>
<p><em>Prophecy</em> refers to speaking for God and speaking forth God under God&rsquo;s direct revelation, not to predicting. <em>Teaching</em> refers to teaching based on what the prophets have spoken. <em>Exhortation</em> refers to exhorting others based on the prophecy and teaching. These three kinds of speaking build up the Body. They minister life to the saints and enable them to grow together through the word of God. <em>Service</em> refers to the service of the deacons and deaconesses in the local churches. <em>Giving in simplicity</em> refers to the giving in order to supply and take care of the needy ones in the church. <em>Those who lead</em> refers to the leading brothers in the church, whose characteristic is diligence; <em>showing mercy</em> is a disposition formed in the believers through transformation, giving them the burden to take care of others and to show mercy to those who are not worthy. All seven kinds of gifts mentioned above are needed for the practice of the Body life.</p>
<p>Finally, the believers live in the Body of Christ through living a life of the highest virtues of the divine life and love. Such a living requires that the believers be transformed in life so that they may have the nature of God&rsquo;s love to love others. As a result, with regard to others, to themselves, to the expression in life, and even to their relationship with their persecutors and enemies, they maintain the highest standard and remain in the enjoyment of the Lord, in His presence, and in His will.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>We have seen that the believers corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity through entering into the kingdom of God, through living in the church life, and through living in the Body of Christ. In this lesson we will see that in the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation the believers also corporately experience this dispensing through putting on the new man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THROUGH PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>The believers corporately experience the dispensing of the processed Triune God through putting on the new man (Eph. 4:22-24). The new man is of Christ. It is His Body, created in Him on the cross (2:15-16). It is not individual but corporate (Col. 3:10-11).</p>
<p>Ephesians reveals that the church is the Body of Christ (1:22-23), the kingdom of God, the household of God (2:19), a holy temple in the Lord, and a dwelling place of God in spirit (vv. 21-22). Furthermore, 4:24 reveals that the church is the new man. This is the highest aspect of the church. In its initial aspect, the church is an assembly of the called-out ones. From this initial aspect, Paul goes on to speak of being fellow citizens of the kingdom of God and members of the household of God. Then he advances to speak of an even higher aspect of the church&mdash;the Body of Christ. Ultimately, he speaks of the church as the new man. Thus, the church is not just an assembly of believers, a kingdom of heavenly citizens, a household of God&rsquo;s children, or even the Body of Christ. In its ultimate, uttermost aspect, the church is the new man for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life, and as the new man, the church needs Christ as its person. This new corporate person should live a life like Jesus lived on earth, that is, a life of reality that expresses God and causes God to be realized as reality by man.</p>
<p>Christ, the One who worked God&rsquo;s nature into humanity, is the element with which the new man was created. The creation of the new man was a new act, a new creation. God did not impart His nature into any creature in the old creation, not even into man. However, in the creation of the one new man, God wrought his nature into man; thus, His nature was mingled with humanity to produce one entity&mdash;the one new man. In Ephesians 2:15 the phrase <em>in Himself</em> denotes that Christ is not only the Creator of the one new man, the church, but also the sphere in which it was created and the element with which it was created. The new man, the church, is corporate and universal. Although there are many believers, there is only one new man in the universe. All the believers are the constituents of this one corporate and universal new man.</p>
<p>All the saved and regenerated ones must put off the old man and put on the new man. Although the new man has already been created, we still need to put off the old man and put on the new man, which was created in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Putting Off the Old Man with<br />
Its Corrupted Living in the Lusts of the Deceit</h2>
<p>We put on the new man by putting off the old man with its corrupted living in the lusts of the deceit. Ephesians 4:22 says, &ldquo;Put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit.&rdquo; The old man is of Adam, who was created by God but became fallen through sin. This old man was crucified with Christ (Rom. 6:6) and was buried in baptism (v. 4). In Ephesians 4:22 the article <em>the</em> before the word <em>deceit</em> is emphatic and indicates that the word <em>deceit</em> is personified. Hence, <em>the deceit</em> refers to the deceiver, Satan, from whom come the lusts of the corrupted old man. The old man is corrupted according to the lusts of the devil, the deceiving one. Outwardly, the manner of life of the old man is a walk in the vanity of the mind (v. 17). Inwardly, the old man is corrupted according to the lusts of the devil, the lusts of the deceit.</p>
<p>To put off the old man is not merely to put off the old nature; it is to put off the old manner of life, the former manner of life. Our old manner of life is not merely an individual manner of life; it also refers to our former social life. No one is able to be totally individualistic and independent. Therefore, to put off the old man specifically refers to putting off our worldly social relationships. A believer who continues to live in his old social relationships continues to live the life of the old man. The living of the old man is mainly related to social relationships. Hence, to put off the old man does not mean to merely put off the self of the old man but to also put off the worldly social relationships.</p>
<p>Today the Lord desires not only to gather us together but that we would also put off the living of the old man. We not only need to put off our old nature; we also need to put off our former manner of life. Our manner of life should be altogether new in its nature, fashion, and practice. The church life is the daily living of the new man in the new nature and the new manner of life.</p><h2 class="head2">B. By Being Renewed<br />
in the Spirit of the Mind</h2>
<p>The believers put on the new man by being renewed in the spirit of their mind. Ephesians 4:23 says that we are renewed in the spirit of our mind. To be renewed is for being transformed to the image of Christ (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18). The spirit in Ephesians 4:23 is the regenerated spirit of the believers mingled with the indwelling Spirit of God. Such a mingled spirit spreads into our mind, becoming the spirit of our mind. It is in such a spirit that we are renewed for our transformation. In this way our natural mind is conquered, subdued, and subjected to the spirit. This implies a process of metabolic transformation. As this process takes place, the mingled spirit spreads into our mind, takes over our mind, and becomes the spirit of our mind. By the spirit of our mind we are renewed to fulfill in experience what was accomplished in baptism&mdash;the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man. The putting off of the old man and the putting on the new man are accomplished facts. However, we need to experience and realize these facts by being renewed in the spirit of our mind.</p>
<p>The way to put on the new man is to allow our mingled spirit&mdash;the Spirit mingled with our spirit&mdash;to become the spirit of our mind. Our mind controls and directs our entire being. For the spirit to become the spirit of our mind means that the spirit guides, controls, directs, and possesses our mind. When the spirit guides our mind, it regulates our whole being. Thus, our entire being is under the control of the spirit. In the spirit of our mind we are renewed, and through such a spirit we put on the new man experientially.</p>
<p>We need to see that the new man has been created and that it has been placed in our spirit through regeneration. Hence, our spirit needs to be the part that directs our being. In other words, our spirit, which is mingled with the Spirit of God, must become the spirit of our mind. If our spirit is the spirit of our mind, then our living will be one that is according to the spirit, and whatever we do will be according to the spirit. The spirit of our mind will then become a renewed spirit. Through the renewing of the spirit, we put on the new man.</p>
<p>How much we experientially put on the new man depends upon how much we are led by our spirit. Therefore, as far as experience is concerned, the putting on of the new man does not happen once for all. This is a perpetual matter throughout our life. It is a continual and gradual process that takes place throughout our entire Christian life. At the time of our regeneration, the new man, created with Christ as the divine element, was placed in our spirit. Now we daily need to put on this new man by letting the spirit control our being and renew our mind. Every time a part of our being is renewed, we put on more of the new man. Therefore, the more we are renewed through the spirit that controls our mind, the more we put on the new man. Ultimately, this process of putting on the new man will be completed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. According to God, Who Created the New Man<br />
in His Own Image in Righteousness<br />
and Holiness of the Reality</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:24 says, &ldquo;Put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.&rdquo; The old man was created according to the image of God outwardly but without God&rsquo;s life and nature (Gen. 1:26-27), whereas the new man was created according to God Himself inwardly, having God&rsquo;s life and nature (Col. 3:10). Because the new man is created according to God in Christ and with Christ, it bears the image of God. Ultimately, the new man bears the image of God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.</p>
<p>Righteousness is being right with God and with man according to God&rsquo;s righteous way, whereas holiness is being separated unto God from anything common and being saturated with God&rsquo;s holy nature. Righteousness refers to the outward acts, whereas holiness refers to the inward nature. Outwardly everything related to the new man is righteous, and inwardly everything related to the new man is holy. Furthermore, righteousness signifies God&rsquo;s acts, while holiness signifies God&rsquo;s being. Everything God does is righteous, and all that God is, is holy. The new man was created according to God in these two aspects.</p>
<p>The righteousness and holiness of the new man are of &ldquo;the reality.&rdquo; In Ephesians 4:24 the article <em>the</em> before the word <em>reality</em> is emphatic. As &ldquo;the deceit&rdquo; in verse 22 is related to the old man and is the personification of Satan, so &ldquo;the reality&rdquo; in verse 24 is related to the new man and is the personification of God. Deceit is the devil, and reality is God. This reality was exhibited in the life of Jesus, as spoken of in verse 21. In the life of Jesus, the righteousness and holiness of the reality were always being manifested. In the righteousness and holiness of this reality, which is God realized and expressed, the new man was created.</p>
<p>Dean Alford said that the reality in 4:24 refers to the essence of God, because God is reality. This is in contrast to the lusts of the deceit in verse 22. Deceit is the essence of Satan, the deceiving one, but reality is the essence of God, who is the reality. Therefore, lusts are of Satan, the deceit, but righteousness and holiness are of God, the reality. Marvin R. Vincent points out that in this portion of the Scriptures, deceit and reality are both personified. The new man was created according to the two aspects of God&rsquo;s essence, that is, according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.</p>
<p> Colossians 3:10 says, &ldquo;The new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him.&rdquo; <em>The image</em> refers to Christ, the beloved Son of God as God&rsquo;s expression (1:15; Heb. 1:3a). &ldquo;Him who created him,&rdquo; that is, the One who created the new man in Christ (Eph. 2:15) is Christ the Creator. Christ, as the image of God in Colossians 3:10, is the righteousness and holiness of the reality in Ephesians 4:24. Christ is the image of God and the embodiment of God (Col. 1:15; 2:9). When He was on earth, He was righteous and holy, and He was full of love and light. He was the image of God manifested among man. Today the church, as the new man, has the image of God, which means that the new man possesses the righteousness and holiness of God as well as His love and light.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:24 says that the new man was created according to God, and Colossians 3:10 reveals that the new man is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of God. The new man is actually the same as God because the new man was created according to God. However, in our experience the new man needs to be renewed unto full knowledge according to the image, the expression, of Him who created him. The creation of the new man according to God has been accomplished, but in our experience the new man is being renewed little by little unto full knowledge. Thus, in our experience the new man is becoming the expression of God.</p>
<p>The more we are renewed in the spirit of our mind, the more the new man with the divine essence will spread from our spirit to our soul. This spreading within us is according to Christ, who is the image of God, the expression of God. The more the renewing takes place in our soul, the more we will have the image of Christ, and the more we will be able to express God.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Taking Christ as the One<br />
Who Is All the Members and in All the Members<br />
and Not Giving Ground<br />
to Race, Religion, Culture, or Social Rank</h2>
<p>In the new man Christ is all the members and in all the members; thus, there is no room for race, religion, culture, or social rank. After Colossians 3:10 speaks of the new man, verse 11 continues, &ldquo;Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; <em>Where</em> refers to the new man in verse 10. In the new man there are no natural persons; moreover, there is no possibility and no room for any natural person to exist. In the new man there are no Greeks, who seek philosophical wisdom, and no Jews, who seek miraculous signs (1 Cor. 1:22). Also, in the new man there is no circumcision or uncircumcision. <em>Circumcision</em> refers to those who observe the Jewish religious rituals, and <em>uncircumcision</em> refers to those who do not care for the Jewish religion. Furthermore, in the new man there is no barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free man. A barbarian is an uncultured man, a Scythian was considered the most barbarous, a slave is one who has been sold into slavery, and a free man is one who has been freed from slavery. In the new man there is room only for Christ; there is no room for any natural person.</p>
<p>In the new man &ldquo;Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; In the new man there is room only for Christ. He is all the members of the new man and in all the members. He is everything in the new man. Actually, He is the new man. In the new man He is the centrality and universality. He is the constituent of the new man, and He is all in all in the new man.</p>
<p>The word <em>all</em> in verse 11 refers to all the members who constitute the new man. Christ is all these members, and He is in all the members. If we want to experience the reality of Christ being all the members, we need to take Christ as our life and our person and live Him, not ourselves. If the living of all the saints is Christ, He will truly and practically be all the members of the new man. Christ will be all of us, that is, every member of the new man, because we all will live Christ and not ourselves.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The believers can corporately experience the dispensing of the processed Triune God by putting on the new man. The ultimate and uttermost aspect of the church is that it is the new man for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Christ, who worked God&rsquo;s nature into humanity, created the new man with Himself as the element. In the universe there is only one new man constituted with all the believers. Although the new man has already been created, the believers still need to put off the old man and put on the new man created in Christ.</p>
<p>The believers need to first put off the old man with its corrupted living in the lusts of the deceit and then put on the new man. To put off the old man is not only to put off the old nature, but even more, it is to put off the former manner of life. This is not only to put off the self of the old man; it is also to put off the old worldly social relationships. The Lord desires not only to gather believers together, but even more, He wants them to completely have the daily living of the new man, according to the new nature and the new manner of life and practice.</p>
<p>The believers also put on the new man by being renewed in the spirit of their mind. The purpose of the believers&rsquo; transformation is to be renewed into the image of Christ and for the fulfillment in experience of what was accomplished in baptism&mdash;the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man. The way to put on the new man is for the mingled spirit&mdash;the spirit of the believers mingled with the Spirit&mdash;to become the spirit of the believers&rsquo; mind. In this way the spirit is able to guide, control, direct, and possess their mind and to rule their entire being so that they may put on the new man experientially. Therefore, with regard to experience, the putting on of the new man is a continual matter that takes place throughout the entire life of the believers; it is a continual and gradual process in the life of the believers.</p>
<p>The believers&rsquo; putting on of the new man is according to God, who created the new man in His own image in righteousness and holiness of the reality so that they can express God. The new man is created inwardly according to God, having God&rsquo;s life and nature; thus, it bears the image of God in righteousness and holiness of the reality. This means that the new man possesses God&rsquo;s righteousness and holiness as well as His love and light; hence, the believers who put on the new man are able to express God.</p>
<p>In the new man, Christ is all the members and in all the members; there is no room for race, religion, culture, or social rank. In the new man there is room only for Christ; He is the centrality and the universality, and there is no room for any natural person, thing, or matter. Therefore, for the believers to experience the reality of Christ as all the members of the new man, they need to take Christ as their life and person, and they need to live Him, not themselves.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will see how the believers corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, that is, in the stage of transformation, through wrestling with the devil and his spiritual forces in the heavenlies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THROUGH WRESTLING WITH THE DEVIL<br />
AND HIS SPIRITUAL FORCES<br />
IN THE HEAVENLIES</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:1 through 6:9 speaks of the positive revelation of the church in its accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, whereas, on the negative side, 6:10-20 speaks of the church being a warrior to defeat God&rsquo;s enemy, the devil, and his spiritual forces in the heavenlies. Verse 11 speaks of &ldquo;the stratagems of the devil&rdquo;; then verse 12 explains that &ldquo;our wrestling is not against blood and flesh but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies.&rdquo; Behind men of blood and flesh are the evil forces of the devil, who oppose God&rsquo;s purpose. Hence, our wrestling, our fighting, is not against men but against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies. The rulers, the authorities, and the world-rulers of this darkness are the rebellious angels, who follow Satan in his rebellion against God and who now rule in the heavenlies over the nations of the world. <em>This darkness</em> refers to today&rsquo;s world, which is fully under the dark ruling of the devil, who rules through his evil angels. The rulers of this darkness are the princes set up by Satan to rule over the nations. Because of the work of Satan, the power of darkness, the earth with its atmosphere has become a world of darkness.</p>
<p>Verse 12 also speaks of &ldquo;the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies.&rdquo; <em>The heavenlies</em> refers to the air (2:2). Satan and his spiritual forces are in the air, but we are seated above them in the heavenlies (v. 6). Hence, Satan and his evil forces are under us and are destined to be defeated by us. We must realize that our warfare is not against human beings but against the evil angels, the spiritual powers, in the heavenlies. The warfare between the church and Satan is a battle between those who love the Lord in the church and the evil powers in the heavenlies. We must fight against these spiritual forces.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being Empowered in the Lord and<br />
in the Might of His Strength</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6:10 says, &ldquo;Be empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength.&rdquo; The word <em>empowered</em> in Greek has the same root as the word <em>power</em> in 1:19. To deal with God&rsquo;s enemy, to fight against the evil forces of darkness, we need to be empowered with the great power that raised Christ from the dead and seated Him in the heavens, far above all the evil spirits in the air (v. 20). When we are empowered with the power that raised Christ from the dead and that made Him to be the Head over all things, we realize the might and strength of God.</p>
<p>In 6:10 Paul tells us to be empowered &ldquo;in the Lord.&rdquo; In spiritual warfare against Satan and his evil kingdom, we can fight only in the Lord, not in ourselves. Whenever we are in ourselves, we are defeated.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Putting on the Whole Armor of God<br />
and Standing against the Stratagems of the Devil</h2>
<p>Verse 11 says, &ldquo;Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil.&rdquo; To fight the spiritual warfare, we need not only the power of the Lord but also the armor of God. Our weapons do not avail, but God&rsquo;s armor, the whole armor of God, avails. The whole armor of God is for the entire Body of Christ, not for any individual member of the Body. The church is a corporate warrior, and the believers are parts of this unique warrior. Only the corporate warrior, not any individual believer, can wear the whole armor of God. We must fight the spiritual warfare in the Body of Christ, not as individuals.</p>
<p>The charge to &ldquo;put on the whole armor of God&rdquo; is an imperative, a command. God has provided us with armor, but He does not put it on for us. Rather, we must put on the armor that God has provided. For this, we need to be empowered. Although God can empower us, we still must exercise our will to cooperate with Him. According to this principle, we must cooperate with God&rsquo;s command to put on the armor.</p>
<p>We need to put on the armor of God so that we may be able to stand. In Ephesians 6 the word <em>stand</em> is crucial. To sit with Christ (2:6) is to participate in all His accomplishments, to walk in His Body (4:1, 17; 5:2, 8, 15) is to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, and to stand in His power is to fight against God&rsquo;s enemy.</p>
<p>The devil is good at devising all kinds of stratagems; these stratagems are his evil plots. The devil has not only evil intentions but also deceptive stratagems to work out his intentions. To put on the whole armor of God enables us to stand against the stratagems of the devil.</p>
<p>Ephesians 6:13 says, &ldquo;Take up the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.&rdquo; In verse 11 we are told to put on the armor of God, and in verse 13 we are charged to take it up. The armor of God is prepared and provided by God for us, but we need to put it on and take it up. We need to use and apply God&rsquo;s provision. We take up some items of the armor, such as the sword and the shield, and we put on other items, such as the breastplate, the helmet, and the shoes. Whether we put on the whole armor of God or take it up, we must exercise our will in a strong way.</p>
<p>In verses 11 and 13 Paul specifically speaks of the whole armor of God, not just a part or some parts of it. In order to wage the spiritual warfare, we need the whole armor. This requires the Body of Christ. It is not individual believers who take it up. This armor is not for individual believers; rather, it is for the corporate church, the Body. Only the corporate warrior, the Body, can put on the whole armor of God. By putting on the whole armor of God, we will &ldquo;be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.&rdquo; To withstand is to stand against. In fighting, the most important thing is to stand. In this warfare we need to stand to the end. After having done all, we still need to stand.</p>
<p>According to Ephesians 6, Christ is the armor that we put on for our protection. In verses 14 through 17, we have six aspects of Christ as the armor: the girdle of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the shoes of the firm foundation of the gospel of peace, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit. Among the six items of Christ as our armor, the sword is the only one that is used for attacking the enemy; the rest of the six items are defensive.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Girding Our Loins with Truth</h2>
<p>Verse 14 says, &ldquo;Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth.&rdquo; The girding of our loins is for the strengthening of our entire being. For the purpose of standing, our entire being needs the strengthening of the truth. <em>Truth</em> refers to God in Christ as reality in our living, that is, God becoming our reality and experience in our living. This is actually Christ Himself lived out by us (John 14:6). Such truth, such reality, is the girdle that strengthens our whole being for the spiritual warfare.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Putting on the Breastplate of Righteousness</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6:14 also speaks of the breastplate of righteousness that covers our conscience, signified by the breast. In fighting against Satan who accuses us, we need a conscience void of offense. Regardless of how clear we feel our conscience is, it needs to be covered with the breastplate of righteousness. The One who covers our conscience and guards us from Satan&rsquo;s accusations is Christ Himself (1 Cor. 1:30). Therefore, Christ covers us as our righteousness. Moreover, the breastplate of righteousness is also related to the blood of Christ. In experience, we cannot separate the blood from Christ. Apart from His blood, Christ cannot not cover us. Under the cleansing of His blood, Christ becomes our righteousness, which covers our conscience.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Shodding Our Feet with<br />
the Firm Foundation of the Gospel of Peace</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6:15 says, &ldquo;Having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace.&rdquo; Our feet must be shod in order to strengthen our stand in the battle. The firm foundation of the gospel of peace means the establishing of the gospel of peace. On the cross Christ made peace for us both with God and man, and this peace has become our gospel (2:13-17). This gospel of peace has been established as a firm foundation, as a readiness with which our feet may be shod. Being thus shod, we will have a firm footing so that we may stand to fight the spiritual warfare. The peace for such a firm foundation is Christ (v. 14). We fight in peace and with peace; we fight by standing in peace. Christ is the peace for us to be one with God and to be one with the saints. This peace is the firm foundation that enables us to stand fast against the enemy.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Taking Up the Shield of Faith</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6:16 continues, &ldquo;Besides all these, having taken up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one.&rdquo; Flaming darts were used by fighters in the apostle&rsquo;s time. The apostle used this term to illustrate Satan&rsquo;s attacks on us. The flaming darts are Satan&rsquo;s temptations, proposals, doubts, questions, lies, and attacks. To quench the fiery darts of the evil one, we need to take up the shield of faith. The shield of faith is not something that we put on but something that we take up in order to protect ourselves against the attacks of the enemy.</p>
<p>Faith comes after truth, righteousness, and peace. If we have truth in our living, righteousness as our covering, and peace as our standing, we shall spontaneously have faith. Faith is a safeguard against the fiery darts of the enemy. Christ is the Author and Perfecter of our faith (Heb. 12:2).</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Receiving the Helmet of Salvation</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6:17 says, &ldquo;Receive the helmet of salvation.&rdquo; Receiving the helmet of salvation is for covering our mind, our mentality, against the negative thoughts shot at us by the evil one. Such a helmet, such a covering, is God&rsquo;s salvation. Satan injects threats, worries, anxieties, and other weakening thoughts into our mind. God&rsquo;s salvation is the covering that we take up against all these things. Such a salvation is the saving Christ whom we experience in our daily life (John 16:33).</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Receiving the Sword of the Spirit,<br />
Which Spirit Is the Word of God,<br />
by Means of All Prayer and Petition</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 6:17 Paul goes on to speak of &ldquo;the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.&rdquo; The sword is an item in the armor that is used for attacking the enemy. This verse shows that the Spirit is the word of God. Both the Spirit and the word are Christ (2 Cor. 3:17; Rev. 19:13). The Spirit is the sword itself, not the swordsman. The word of God is also the sword. The sword is the Spirit, and the Spirit is also the word. Therefore, the sword, the Spirit, and the word are one. In our Christian experience, the word and the Spirit need to be one. Christ is the Spirit and the word; He is not only the Spirit, nor is He only the word. He is both. The unique offensive weapon in our spiritual warfare against the enemy is the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>by means of all prayer and petition</em> at the beginning of verse 18 modifies the word <em>receive</em> in verse 17. By prayer we receive both the helmet of salvation and the word of God. This indicates that we need to receive the word of God by means of all prayer and petition. The modifying phrase <em>by means of all prayer and petition</em> in verse 18 is related to all six items of the armor covered in verses 14 through 17. It is by means of all prayer and petition that we gird our loins with truth, put on the breastplate of righteousness, shod our feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace, take up the shield of faith, and receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, the word of God. Prayer is the unique way to apply the armor of God. Thus, prayer is crucial and vital.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Praying in Spirit and Watching unto This<br />
in All Perseverance and Petition<br />
concerning All the Saints</h2>
<p>The believers wrestle with the devil and his evil spiritual forces in the heavenlies, not only by being empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength and by putting on the whole armor of God but also by praying in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints and the apostle. Ephesians 6:18 speaks of &ldquo;praying at every time in spirit.&rdquo; To pray at every time corresponds to Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Thessalonians 5:17: &ldquo;Unceasingly pray.&rdquo; We need to pray in our spirit, that is, to pray in our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God. This spirit is the mingled spirit, our spirit mingled with God&rsquo;s Spirit. When we are in our spirit, we are in the Holy Spirit, because our spirit is one with the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17).</p>
<p>Ephesians 6:18 goes on to speak of &ldquo;watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.&rdquo; This indicates that we need to be watchful, on the alert, regarding our prayer life. We need to be on guard in order to not be robbed of time that should be devoted to prayer. Furthermore, we need to watch unto prayer in all perseverance. To keep a prayer life we need all perseverance, a constant, persistent care. We also need to make petition concerning all the saints. We need to spend much time to pray for the saints in our locality and for the saints in other cities and countries.</p>
<p>Finally, verses 19 through 20 indicate that we also should pray for the apostle. In this portion of the Scriptures Paul asked the saints to pray for him: &ldquo;That utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known in boldness the mystery of the gospel...that in it I would speak boldly, as I ought to speak.&rdquo; Here Paul asked the believers to pray for him so that utterance might be given to him to make known in boldness the mystery of the gospel. This mystery is Christ and the church for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. This mystery refers to the entire New Testament economy. Christ is the mystery of God, and the church is the mystery of Christ. Christ and the church are for God&rsquo;s economy, which also is a mystery. All these mysteries are related to the gospel. Therefore, Paul asked the saints to pray for him that utterance might be given to him for him to boldly speak the mystery of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The believers corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity by wrestling with the devil and with his forces of evil in the heavenlies. Behind men of flesh and blood is the devil, the evil power that opposes the will of God; therefore, the warfare between the church and Satan is a battle between the believers in the church who love the Lord and the evil power in the heavenlies. Ephesians 6:10-20 reveals, on the negative side, that the church is a warrior to defeat God&rsquo;s enemy, the devil, with his forces of evil in the heavenlies.</p>
<p>To fight the enemy, the believers need to be empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength. They cannot fight in themselves, lest they be defeated. The believers also need to put on the whole armor of God and stand against the stratagems of the devil. The whole armor of God is for the entire Body of Christ; it is not for individual members. Therefore, the believers should fight the spiritual battle in the Body of Christ and never fight individually. The believers must strongly exercise their will to apply God&rsquo;s provision and put on the armor of God so that they may stand to the end.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 6:14-17 there are six aspects of Christ as the armor. First, there is the girdle of truth for the girding of the loins to strengthen the believers&rsquo; entire being; <em>truth</em> refers to God in Christ as reality and experience in the believers&rsquo; living. Truth is also Christ Himself lived out of us. Second, there is the breastplate of righteousness to cover our conscience; this breastplate is Christ Himself with His blood, cleansing, covering, and keeping us from Satan&rsquo;s accusations. Third, on the cross Christ has made peace between us and God, and this gospel of peace has been established as a firm foundation, as a readiness with which our feet may be shod. Being thus shod, we have a firm footing so that we may stand to fight the spiritual warfare. Fourth, after truth, righteousness, and peace, the believers spontaneously have the shield of faith. This faith is a safeguard against the fiery darts, that is, the temptations, proposals, doubts, questions, lies, and attacks of the enemy. Fifth, there is the helmet of salvation; this salvation is the saving Christ experienced by us in our daily living, covering our mind from negative thoughts injected into us by the evil one. Sixth, there is the sword of the Spirit with which to attack the enemy; the Spirit is the word of God, which we receive and apply by means of all prayer and petition. Prayer is the unique way to apply the armor of God.</p>
<p>We also need to fight by praying in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition for all the saints and the apostle. This indicates that we need to be on guard to maintain our prayer life, to make sufficient petition concerning all the saints, and to pray for the apostle so that the mystery of the gospel might be made known in boldness.</p>
