The church life depends mainly on the growth in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD, CHRIST, THE CHURCH,<br>AND THE LOCAL CHURCHES</H2><P>In a sense, it is easy to know about God. Even the unbelievers know about God. They know that there is an almighty Being in this universe. But it is rather hard to know Christ. In the first verse of the Bible in Genesis, God is revealed&#151;"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." The first item revealed in the Bible is God.</P><P>Later, Christ is revealed in the Bible. The Gospel of John says that in the beginning was God, the Word, and the Word became flesh to dwell among us, full of grace and reality (1:1, 14). Christ is God plus something. The revelation in the Scriptures begins with God and goes on to Christ. Many human beings know something of God. But only a small number of people, relatively speaking, know Christ. Many Jewish people know God, but they do not know Christ. We thank the Lord that we Christians know not only God but also Christ.</P><P>All the real Christians know Christ, but very few know the church. When we go on from the Gospels to Acts, there is the church. Knowing the church is not as easy as knowing Christ. After the church is revealed in the New Testament, the local churches are revealed. In Genesis God is revealed; in the Gospels Christ is revealed; in Acts the church is revealed; and in Revelation the local churches are revealed. Thus, the Bible goes from God to Christ, from Christ to the church, and from the church to the local churches. The local churches are the last point of God's divine revelation. Revelation 1:11 says, "What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea." Here there are seven local churches in seven localities. I say again that this is the last point of the divine revelation in all the Scriptures.</P><P>Those Christians who are advanced know God, Christ, and the church. But thank the Lord that by His mercy, we know God, Christ, the church, and the local churches. We are not held in Genesis, the Gospels, or Acts. We are in Revelation! I like Genesis, but I do not want to stay there. I like the biography of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels, but I do not want to stay there either. I like Acts, Romans, and Ephesians, but I do not want to remain in these books. I want to stay in the book of Revelation. Revelation will bring us into the New Jerusalem, which is revealed in its final chapters. Thus, we will never get out of the book of Revelation. We will be there for eternity.</P><P>We can get into the New Jerusalem through the local churches. In the first three chapters of Revelation, there are the local churches. Then in the last two chapters, there is the New Jerusalem. If you are in the local churches, there is no doubt that you will be in the New Jerusalem. We have to be in the beginning of the book of Revelation so that we can know the local churches.</P><P>A number of spiritual teachers know the church, but not the local churches. They talk much about the book of Ephesians, but they have not entered into the end of the divine revelation. The four main items revealed in God's divine revelation are God, Christ, the church, and the local churches. When we have the local churches, we have the church. Then we have Christ and God. This is because God is in Christ, Christ is in the church, and the reality and practicality of the church are in the local churches. If we want to find God, we must come to Christ. In order to find Christ, we must come to the church, and the reality and practicality of the church are in the local churches. Thus, if you are for the local churches, you are for everything. If you have the local church, you have the church; if you have the church, you have Christ; and if you have Christ, you have God. We all should declare, "Praise the Lord! I am in the local churches!"</P><P>In order to grow in life, we must know the local church. The local churches are the real expression of the church; the church is the real expression of Christ; and Christ is the real expression of God. In other words, God is expressed through Christ, Christ is expressed through the church, and the church is expressed through the local churches. People may talk about the universal church, but have they ever contacted it? What we can contact is the local church. Some might say that when we speak too much about the local church, we make the heavenly church earthly. But we must be clear that the local churches are the real expression of the heavenly church on the earth.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
