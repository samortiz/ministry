   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHRISTIAN LIFE ULTIMATELY BEING A MATTER OF GIVING THANKS IN EVERYTHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Apparently, we cannot find the truth of giving thanks in everything throughout the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Actually, the Bible, which is a book of mysteries, contains an untold measure of light beneath the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Among the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, only three 1 Thessalonians, Colossians, and Ephesians mention the matter of giving thanks in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All three of these books were written by the apostle Paul, and their contents show a sequence that is mysterious and wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first of these books, 1 Thessalonians, speaks of how we can be saved and how we should have a holy life so that our spirit, soul, and body may be wholly sanctified, making us ready to meet the Lord at His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This concerns a proper, general Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The second book is Colossians, which concerns Christ and which eventually speaks about experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The life of experiencing Christ is a life of giving thanks in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not only is the proper, general Christian life a life of giving thanks in everything, but also the life of experiencing Christ is ultimately a matter of giving thanks for all things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The third book, Ephesians, which is a sister book to Colossians, concerns the church, and at the end it speaks about the experience of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can have the church life only by living in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, such a church life is a matter of giving thanks in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, we can see clearly that whether it is the proper Christian life, the life of experiencing Christ, or the church life, each concludes with giving thanks in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our Christian life is of three stages: the general Christian life; the life of experiencing Christ, abiding in Christ, and living Christ; and the church life, the life of experiencing the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every stage of our Christian life involves the giving of thanks in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our Christian life becomes deformed whenever it is separated from the matter of giving thanks in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first ten years after I was saved was a life in 1 Thessalonians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a saved one, I desired to learn to be sanctified in everything and to preserve myself daily from uncleanness that my spirit, soul, and body might be preserved and I could be ready to meet the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was the initial stage of my Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As I gradually progressed, I began to study the Bible and some of the books concerning the inner life; thus, I gained more knowledge concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I began to know Christ as my life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I also began to realize that the life which God wants us to live is not merely a life of holiness that is without uncleanness but a life of being filled with and saturated by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Unless I live a life of being filled with and saturated by Christ, my living is not much different from the living based on the moral teachings of the Chinese philosophers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These philosophers taught people to develop their "bright virtue" and to be blameless and pure, yet they did not have Christ in them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We, however, have Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, Christ should be our all, and our living must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the second stage of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After experiencing Christ in a deeper way, I began to realize that the life of experiencing Christ is not for me individually but for His church and for the testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have all received Christ by grace, and the result is that we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, eventually we need to live in the church, to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the deepest stage of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All these three stages of life conclude with the matter of giving thanks in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without giving thanks in all things, we cannot live the proper Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>PRAYER AND THANKSGIVING BEING A CHRISTIAN'S SPIRITUAL FEET</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Prayer and thanksgiving are like our two feet; one foot cannot walk without the other.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Prayer without thanksgiving will not work; thanksgiving without prayer also will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, we must not only pray but also give thanks, and we must give thanks with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must do both simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It does not matter which comes first.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As long as you have both, you can conveniently walk on the pathway of your Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Likewise, when we take care of and nourish the new ones, we should teach them not only to pray but also to give thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As you walk on the spiritual pathway, do not ask whether you should start with your right foot or with your left.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually, to this day I still do not know which foot goes first when I walk.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you pay your attention to trying to decide which foot should go first, you will probably have difficulty in walking.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, in our Christian life we should pray and give thanks, and we should give thanks and pray; we should always walk this way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Perhaps before you go to bed, you pray first and then give thanks, but in the morning when you get up, you give thanks first and then pray.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Prayer and thanksgiving are the Christians' spiritual feet.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If one foot is missing, walking becomes extremely difficult; if both feet are missing, walking becomes impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If Christians do not pray and give thanks, they cannot have a proper Christian life.</S>
