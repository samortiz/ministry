   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Confession here denotes the confession of our sins, our failures, after regeneration, not the confession of our sins before regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even though we have been saved and regenerated and are under the transformation of the Holy Spirit, it is still possible for us to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since we can still sin after we are saved, we need to confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our confession is needed for God's forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such forgiveness of God for the restoration of our fellowship with Him is conditional and depends on our confession.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is faithful in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His word is the word of the truth of His gospel Eph 1:13 , which tells us that He will forgive us our sins because of Christ Acts 10:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we confess our sins, He, according to His faithfulness in His word, will forgive us.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>3 According to God's Righteousness in the Cleansing Blood of Jesus His Son</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God forgives the believers' sins not only according to His faithfulness but also according to His righteousness in the cleansing blood of Jesus His Son 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is righteous in the blood of Jesus His Son.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, if we confess our sins, He, based upon the redemption through the blood of Jesus, forgives us, because He must be righteous in the blood of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Otherwise, He would be unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because the Lord Jesus has shed His blood for us, God in His righteousness, in His justice, must forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no ground for Him not to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Old Testament way for God to forgive His people's sins was through the offerings that were types pointing to the coming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the New Testament way for God to forgive us is for Him to take the ground of Christ's death on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because the Lord has shed His blood for us, God has the ground righteously to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we confess our sins, God, in order to be righteous, must forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is His righteousness in Christ's redeeming act.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This act was accomplished on the cross and then preached to us according to God's word in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because God is righteous, He, with Christ's shed blood as the basis, must forgive us our sins. b.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The offense needs God's forgiveness, and the stain requires His cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Both God's forgiveness and His cleansing are needed for the restoration of our fellowship with Him that we may enjoy Him with a good conscience void of offense 1 Tim 1:5; Acts 24:16 .</S>
