<h2 class="head5">(2) Christ Being the Head of All Rule and Authority</h2>
<p>In 2:10 Paul indicates that the Christ in whom we have been made full is the Head of all rule and authority. As previously mentioned, the rule and authority spoken of here refer to the angelic powers, in particular the fallen angels who still occupy positions of power. According to the full revelation of the Bible, after God created the universe, He placed it under the control of an archangel and other leading angels. When this archangel rebelled against God and became Satan, many of the leading angels who assisted him in ruling the universe became the evil rulers and authorities in the heavenlies. These are described in Ephesians 6:12 as the rulers, the authorities, the world-rulers of this darkness, the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies. These angelic powers rule over the nations. For this reason, the book of Daniel mentions both the prince of Greece and the prince of Persia (10:20). (A prince here denotes one of the angelic powers or rulers.) This means that all the nations on earth today are under the rule of authorities in the heavenlies; however, not all of these are evil. Nevertheless, Christ is the Head of all rule and authority.</p>
<p>Since Christ is our perfection and completion, we do not need other rulers and authorities as objects of adoration, for He is the Head of all rule and authority. We should remember that the Colossians had been led astray to the worship of angels. Therefore, Paul told them that since Christ is the Head of all the angels and since we are in Him, there is no need for us to worship angels. We are identified with the One who is the Head of all the angels, and in Him we have been made full. If we are clear about this, we will never be deluded into worshipping angels. Rather, we will have the proper knowledge that, in a very real sense, because we are one with the Head of the angels, we are higher than they are. Actually, we are partners of the Christ who is the Head over them, and in Him we are complete. The fact that we have been made full in Christ who is the Head of all rule and authority is versus the worship of angels. Because we are one with Christ, we should never worship angels.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. In Him the Saints Being Circumcised,<br />
in the Putting Off of the Body of the Flesh,<br />
in the Circumcision of Christ, Buried Together with Him<br />
in Baptism and Raised Together with Him</h2>
<p>In Colossians 2:11 Paul says, &ldquo;In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ.&rdquo; Here Paul is dealing with Judaizers who prize and boast in their circumcision. Paul thus declares that in Christ, in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily, the saints have been circumcised. This circumcision is not merely to cut off a piece of flesh but to put off the entire body of the flesh. It is also the circumcision of Christ, that is, to be crucified with Him, buried together with Him in baptism, and raised together with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Being Circumcised with a Circumcision<br />
Not Made with Hands</h2>
<p>In verse 11 Paul speaks of a circumcision not made with hands. This certainly is different from that practiced by the Jews, which was carried out with a knife. In addition to that physical circumcision, there is another kind of circumcision, the circumcision in Christ, which is not made with hands. This is spiritual circumcision and refers to the proper baptism, which puts off the body of the flesh by the effectual virtue of the death of Christ.</p>
<p>The circumcision in Christ involves the death of Christ and the power of the Spirit. When Christ was crucified, His crucifixion was the genuine, practical, and universal circumcision. His crucifixion cut off all the negative things. These negative things include our flesh, our natural man, and the self. However, along with the death of Christ we need the Spirit as the power. If we have Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion without the Spirit as the power, we will have no means by which to apply Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion to us and to execute its effect upon us. The crucifixion of Christ becomes practical and effective by means of the Spirit. By the Spirit as the power, Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion is applied to us. Then under the power of the Spirit, we are circumcised in an actual and practical way. This is the circumcision in Christ, a circumcision not made with hands. It is a circumcision not made with hands because it was accomplished by the death of Christ, and it is applied, executed, and carried out by the powerful Spirit. This is the circumcision we have all received.</p>
<p>In Christ, on the one hand, we have been made full, and, on the other hand, we have been circumcised. Because we have been made full in Him, we are short of nothing. Because we have been circumcised in Him, all the negative things have been removed. Regarding the positive things, we are complete. Regarding the negative things, everything has been cleared up, and we have no problems. Therefore, regarding the positive things, we are not short of anything, and regarding the negative things, we are no longer troubled by anything.</p>
<p>However, we need to exercise faith and not look at ourselves. We must turn our eyes away from our feelings and from our apparent situation. According to our apparent situation, we are short of everything positive and are troubled by everything negative. But according to the facts, we are not in ourselves&mdash;we are in Christ. Because we are in Him, we have been made full positively, and we have been circumcised to clear away the negative things.</p>
