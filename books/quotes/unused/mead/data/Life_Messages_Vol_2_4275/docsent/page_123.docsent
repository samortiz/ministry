   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTY-THREE TO BE A PERSON IN SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:4, 6, 14; Eph 6:18; 1 Thes 5:17, 19; Rev 1:10a GOD'S DESIRE FOR US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God intends to work Himself into us to be both our life and our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He wants us to live Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to accomplish this intention, God created a spirit within man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then He Himself became flesh and went through death and resurrection, at which point He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, this life-giving Spirit, who is known in the New Testament as the Spirit, "was not yet" John 7:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we repent and believe in the Lord, our conscience, which is within our spirit, has effectively functioned.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We confess our sins and are cleansed by the Lord's precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our spirit is regenerated, and the Spirit comes to dwell in our spirit, so that the two become one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit" 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How glorious it is that we sinners, after being cleansed by the precious blood, can be one spirit with God!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>LIVING BY THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now He wants us to live in this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Scripture tells us that there are "those who are according to flesh" and "those who are according to spirit" Rom 8:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To walk according to flesh means to carry out whatever the flesh desires.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A fleshly person eats whatever he wants and drinks whatever appeals to him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even if what he does is illegal or harmful or sinful, he is not concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He shamelessly indulges his flesh and answers to no one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>LIVING BY THE EMOTION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Besides this kind of person who walks in the lusts of the flesh, there is the natural man, who lives according to the soul 1 Cor 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A sister, for example, may live by her emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When she expresses her opinion, it is not well reasoned; it is simply how she feels.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes she will be excited and happy; other times she is depressed and tearful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To live by the emotions is not evil like living according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But even though she may not be engaging in sinful things, there will be times when she loses her temper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then she is close to being in the lust of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Her face turns livid, her self-control vanishes, and the angry words spill out unchecked.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Afterwards, she will feel ashamed and remorseful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>LIVING BY THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A brother, on the other hand, usually lives by his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is less inclined to be bad-tempered.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When he participates in a conversation, his words are carefully chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His position on different matters is well thought out, so that he gives the impression of being intelligent, reasonable, and even wise.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This type of person we all naturally admire.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is living by the mind, but he impresses us more than the one who lives by her emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Both, however, are living according to the soul, and in our thinking we rank them higher than those who live according to the flesh, indulging themselves without restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What God wants, of course, is that man live according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who do are the highest class of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because the Lord today is the Spirit living in our spirit, for us to live according to spirit is to live according to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we live by the spirit, the Lord is living out from us, because we are one with Him in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we live according to the flesh, we cannot touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we live by the soul, the Lord cannot live out from us; we are simply living by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever we live by the spirit, however, we experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you ask me where the Lord is, I shall tell you that He is within your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not think of Him as being far away in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not look around for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is within you!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord Jesus is with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How precious and glorious this is!</S>
