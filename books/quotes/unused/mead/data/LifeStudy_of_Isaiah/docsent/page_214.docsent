   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE GLAD TIDINGS "HERE IS YOUR GOD!"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Isaiah 40:9 declares the glad tidings "Here is your God!"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is Jehovah's appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jehovah is here, and He is your God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you have God, you have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you have God, every problem will be solved, every lack will be supplied, and every shortage will be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This short word "Here is your God!" is the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should pray adequately to be filled with God, to receive the infilling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then when we come to the meeting, in a sense, we may not need to speak that much.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead we can all declare, "Here is our God!"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the second aspect of the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE LORD JEHOVAH COMING</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The third aspect of the glad tidings is the Lord Jehovah coming.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He comes as a mighty One to rule and to recompense Isa 40:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is the Ruler who comes as a mighty One to rule over us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is also the Judge.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He will either reward us or punish us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is His recompense, which is His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jesus came as the Savior, but in the four Gospels we also see Him as the Judge.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Matthew 5 the Lord spoke nine blessings for the kingdom people, but in Matthew 23 He spoke an eightfold woe to the scribes and Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He declared again and again, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is His judging.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With Him is a reward on the positive side and a punishment, which is a recompense on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He will judge us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the mighty One, the ruling and judging One, He comes to be a Shepherd Isa 40:11; Matt 9:36; John 10:2-4, 11, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In a shepherd's care for his flock, he rules over the sheep to correct them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His ruling and correcting is his shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the past, we may have been wild persons who would not listen to the gospel or to the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in His ruling, Jesus did something to regulate us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His regulating is His shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many of us were saved because of Jesus' regulating.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His regulating shepherds us to bring us into the flock, to get us on the right way, and to adjust us to the proper pace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is adjusting us not to go too fast or too slow, but to take the pace of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today He is still shepherding us by adjusting us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He directs us, stops us, and urges us on.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As the Shepherd, He also feeds His flock, gathers the lambs in His arm, carries them in His bosom, and leads those who are nursing the young.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Among us some are lambs and some are those who are nursing the young.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Jesus, our Shepherd, takes care of His entire flock.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is surely a part of the glad tidings.</S>
