   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE KEY TO THIS PORTION OF MARK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to understand 9:38-50 in the light of the vision given in 8:27 9:13 concerning Christ, His death, and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Apart from that vision, we do not have the way to understand this section of the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The key that opens these verses is Christ with His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have pointed out that in 9:38 John told the Lord Jesus that they saw someone casting out demons in His name who did not follow them, and they forbade him, because he was not following them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It seems that John was saying, This man was casting out demons in Your name, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yet, he would not follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is divisive, sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because he causes trouble, we forbade him to cast out demons in Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I told him that either he should come along with us, or he should stop casting out demons in Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this situation could John say that he was living Christ, that now it was no longer he, but Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Certainly not.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Had John been terminated by Christ s death, and had His resurrection been wrought into him?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not at all!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 9:38 John was still a natural son of thunder.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was still in himself, even in an enlarged self.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the Lord was speaking to the disciples concerning humility, John even went on in verse 38 to change the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord s reply in verse 39 must have come as a great surprise to John: Do not forbid him, for there is no one who shall do a work of power in My name and be able soon to speak evil of Me. Here the Lord Jesus was saying to John, You should not forbid him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is not against Me; rather, he is for Me. All the believers are mine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verse 41 the Lord went on to say, For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in My name because you are Christ s, truly I say to you that he shall by no means lose his reward.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here the Lord may have been saying, Instead of forbidding this one to cast out demons in My name, you should give him a cup of water to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If he serves one of you with a cup of water, this will be remembered by Me. Anyone who gives you a cup of water to drink in My name will receive a reward in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A SERIOUS WORD ABOUT STUMBLING</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 42 the Lord goes on to speak a serious word about causing to stumble those who believe in Him: And whoever stumbles one of these little ones who believe, it is better for him if a heavy millstone were hung around his neck, and he be thrown into the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How serious it is to cause to stumble those who believe in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>John may have been shocked at this word concerning the seriousness of causing another believer to stumble.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He might have said to himself, If I cause another believer to stumble, my future may be worse than that of someone who has a millstone hung around his neck and is thrown into the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verses 43 through 48 the Lord turns from the matter of causing others to stumble to causing ourselves to stumble.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He points out that we may be caused to stumble by our hand, foot, or eye.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is serious to cause another believer to stumble, and it is also serious for us to be caused to stumble by any part of our fleshly body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The seriousness of this is indicated by the fact that if we are caused to stumble by a member of our body, we may be thrown into Gehenna, into unquenchable fire.</S>
