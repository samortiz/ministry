   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>UNTIL HE COMES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter ten Paul does not say anything about participating in the Lord s table until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But in 11:26 he says, For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord s death until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord s coming will bring in God s kingdom for His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His first coming was for our redemption, but His second coming will be for God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we take of the Lord s table, we care for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But when we take of the Lord s supper, we care for His remembrance and God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord s table is for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, the Lord s supper is for His enjoyment and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, His satisfaction is dependent on God s administration carried out by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do you intend to give the Lord the best remembrance?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you do, then you must take care of the mystical Body, the means for Him to carry out God s administration on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must remember Him in this way until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do this to carry out His administration until He comes back and brings His kingdom to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>DISCERNING THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>FOR GOD S ADMINISTRATION</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have emphasized the fact that when we take the Lord s table we enjoy Him, and when we eat the Lord s supper we satisfy Him by remembering Him and caring for God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in what way do we take care of this administration?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is by discerning the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many Christians have no idea what it means to discern the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To discern the Body is first to realize that Christ has only one mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But look at the situation among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How many divisions there are!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Each denomination and group has its own bread.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some even go so far as to insist that if you have not been baptized by them in their water, you will not be allowed to participate in their bread.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we come to the Lord s supper, we must discern the Body to determine whether the bread on the table represents the unique mystical Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a matter of great importance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The unique mystical Body of Christ is the means for God to carry out His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God s eternal purpose is to have a group of saved, redeemed, and regenerated people who have become one to be an organic Body to carry out His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But Satan s subtle device is to cut the Body into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This frustrates God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As long as we are in a division, we are through with God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For this reason, today s Christianity has become useless as far as the carrying out of the divine administration is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christians may preach the gospel to save souls or teach the Bible to help others know the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But this is absolutely not adequate to carry out God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The carrying out of the divine administration needs the unique Body, the mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because we realize this, we hate division and are absolutely opposed to it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Divisions damage the mystical Body of Christ with respect to the carrying out of God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although Christians can preach the gospel and teach the Bible, there are few who care for the mystical Body of Christ for the carrying out of God s administration on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose all Christians would care for this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How marvelous this situation would be!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What an administration God could have on earth!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the divisions among Christians not only paralyze the Body of Christ; they even cause the Body to be cut in pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This makes it extremely difficult for God to accomplish anything on earth for the carrying out of His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For centuries God has not been able to carry out His administration because the unique means for this the mystical Body of Christ has been cut into pieces through division.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Throughout the years we have been deeply impressed with the significance of the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We know that Jesus physical body was given for the accomplishment of our redemption so that we may enjoy Him in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, we often pray, Lord, thank You for Your redeeming blood.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thank You for redeeming us by shedding Your blood.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Lord, we also thank You that you have given Your body on the cross to bear our sins, to die for us, and to terminate the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Lord, now we are here enjoying Your table.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You gave Yourself through death and now, in resurrection, You are on the table for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now we must also be impressed that to eat the Lord s supper is to satisfy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is to give Him our remembrance.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This implies that we are here for the carrying out of God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In order that God s administration may be carried out, we must care for the oneness of the unique mystical Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Having such a concern will preserve us in the Body and keep us from any division.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we have this understanding of the Lord s supper, we shall not be divided by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather, we shall remain in the unique mystical Body, the means for Christ to carry out His heavenly ministry for the accomplishment of the divine administration.</S>
