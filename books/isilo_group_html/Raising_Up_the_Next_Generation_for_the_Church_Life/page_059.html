<p>If, after reading these messages on Christ versus culture, Christian parents tell their children that they no longer need culture, this will be a serious mistake. Without culture, children would act like animals. Children must be raised according to the standards of culture. Before they are of a proper age to receive Christ, the children must be built up in culture. The more the children are trained according to culture, the better it will be for them. The children must be trained to honor their parents, to love their brothers and sisters, to behave properly toward their neighbors, to be good students in school, to obey all laws, and to respect their teachers and other adults. Because children are too young to behave according to Christ, they must be taught to behave according to culture. If we did not have culture, we would be barbarians.</p>
<p>Culture should be used to keep the children until they are able to receive Christ and live according to Christ. Children need to be preserved by culture while they are growing up.</p>
<p>As Moses gave the commandments to God&rsquo;s chosen people, parents must give commandments to their children. But when the children are able to realize their need for Christ and repent, we should minister the rich Christ to them and help them to receive Him. We should tell our children that the culture we gave them was only good for a certain time and that now they need to receive Christ. Hence, culture is used by God through parents to keep their children in custody until the time comes for them to receive the Lord. It is important to see this proper use of culture. (<em>Life-study of Colossians,</em> pp. 425, 426)</p>

<p>In caring for their children, Christian parents need to preach the law to them. We should not first preach grace to the children. If we give them regulations according to the law, the law will keep them in custody for Christ. Thus, we should first give them the law in a strong way. The law will expose them, guard them, and keep them, serving as a custodian to keep them for Christ. (<em>Life-study of Galatians,</em> p. 165)</p>

<p>We must not give [children] anything in a premature way. Rather, we should prepare the lessons according to their age. We should give the five- and six-year-olds one thing and the seven- and eight-year-olds something else. Premature knowledge damages children. We need some brothers and sisters who understand this principle to prepare the lessons. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, p. 504)</p>
<h2 class="head1">COMPILING TEACHING MATERIAL</h2>
<p>What material should we use to teach the children? We should begin by teaching the children how to be a proper human being. We should show them that man is different from the animals and different from the trees, plants, and flowers. After this we should speak of man&rsquo;s character and conduct. We should teach the children to honor their parents and be loving, pure, obedient, honest, and proper in their conduct. We must be careful not to give them a religious thought or concept.</p>
<p>When we speak of the difference between man and the animals, we can mention that man was created by God and also that the heavens and the earth were created by God. We can also say a little about how man was created in God&rsquo;s image. We do not need to say more than this. I do not agree with explaining all of Genesis 1 and 2 to the children. Even if we touch man&rsquo;s fall in Genesis 3, we should speak briefly and should not tell the entire story of the fall. When we speak to children, we should tell them experiential stories; we should not give them too much doctrine. It is not necessarily a benefit for the children to know too much.</p>
<p>We need to train the teachers for the children&rsquo;s meeting in such a way that they can find illustrations by themselves from practical situations. For instance, they can ask the children, &ldquo;Are you being honest if you steal candy from your older brother?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Suppose your mother saves a bigger piece of candy for your younger sister, and this makes you unhappy and jealous. Do you still love your mother and your sister?&rdquo; When we speak to the children, we must use practical examples.</p>
<p>To compile material for the teachers, we need a number of brothers who know the truth and are also skilled in writing. The material does not need to be in five or six levels. We need only three levels&mdash;elementary, intermediate, and advanced. Each level can be used for two years.</p>
<p>The material for the elementary level should be entirely from a child&rsquo;s perspective. When we speak of man, we should ask the children whether man is the same as a dog, a cat, or a tiger. We should tell them that man is not the same as the animals and explain to them why man is different. That is good enough. We should not present a doctrinal explanation but should use only practical examples.</p>
<p>Gradually, as we proceed to the intermediate level, we can give the children a little more Bible knowledge. We can convey to them a deep impression that there is a God in the universe, that man fell and committed sin, and that the Lord Jesus is our Savior. We do not have to give too much doctrine, but we should impress them with the facts in the Bible. Then when the children proceed to an advanced level, they will almost be ready to follow the messages in the big meetings. The children do not need too much doctrine; they only need a general knowledge of the truth. This requires the careful work of the brothers who compile the teaching material so that the children do not receive premature knowledge. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, pp. 312-313)</p>

<p>When many of us were young, we received too much knowledge that only damaged us. We were given many stories, but we were not given the proper verses in a practical way. Because of this, no one could speak to us, for example, about the prodigal son. We may have said, &ldquo;There is no need to talk about that. I already know what the father, the son, the robe, and the calf are. I can tell you the story.&rdquo; After hearing all the teachings and stories from the Bible, young ones become &ldquo;slippery&rdquo; so that nothing sticks to them. We must not spoil the young ones in this way. Those who have never heard the stories before are easily inspired by them. This is why we should withhold certain stories and simply help the children to know the things of humanity and of God in a practical way. Then when they are saved and begin to attend the church meetings, what they hear will be new to them.</p>
<p>When the children are young, we should simply tell them about God, His creation, and other simple things. At least by the time they are eight years old, we should help them to realize something concerning the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, and gradually after that, we can help them to know that Christ is life. We should not pass on matters such as pray-reading until they are at least ten or eleven, at which time they should know something concerning how to fellowship with the Lord. For the younger ones, illustrations and demonstrations are more helpful. If we conduct the meetings with the children in a proper way, a two-hour meeting will not be too long. On the contrary, though, to merely tell them story after story will tire them.</p>
<p>The most important matter is to build up the humanity and character of the children. This is neglected by many parents today. Having a good human character will not hinder the children in any way. The teachings of Confucius and Chinese ethics build up character according to the self with self-pride and self-confidence. The kind of character building we practice is absolutely different. We should build up the children in the way of realizing that they can do nothing in themselves, because they are fallen and need a higher life.</p>
<p>There is the need for some brothers and sisters to spend the time to prepare lessons and instructions on how to use them. There is no need to compose the lessons in full; we can simply give some guidelines, such as which week to speak concerning honoring our parents and some hints on how to illustrate this lesson. After being trained, each teacher can choose the particular illustrations he will use. We should not prepare uniform printed lessons to be read in each class. Perhaps half a page of points, illustrations, and instructions is adequate. It should be easy to prepare lessons in this way. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, pp. 505-507)</p>

<p>We should tell the children Bible stories. Use Bible stories to show them the proper standard of human life. But we have to beware of two things. First, there is the possibility of premature spiritual knowledge. Second, we can give away biblical truths too cheaply. Some teachers are too spiritual. They tell children teachings that are too high and too spiritual. For example, they may teach the children to pray, &ldquo;Help us, Lord, to deal with our flesh. May Your cross work on us.&rdquo; This gives the children premature spiritual knowledge. It will not help them. Other teachers treat spiritual things too lightly in an attempt to make the children understand. Their speaking does not do justice to the spiritual weight of their subject. This is also wrong. This gives away the truth too cheaply. We have to use the stories in the Bible to teach the children some lessons they can apply in their daily life. We have to teach them to live a normal human life. Of course, we cannot tell too many Bible stories. Otherwise, they will only go home with a bag of stories. Before children are old enough, we should never give them things that are too high or too spiritual for them.
