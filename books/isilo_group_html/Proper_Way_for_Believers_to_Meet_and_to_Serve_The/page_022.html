<h1 class="title">LEADING NEW BELIEVERS TO MEET<br />
IN THEIR HOMES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 15:16; Acts 2:41, 46-47; 5:42; 16:15, 33-34; Matt. 18:20; Acts 12:12</h1>
<p>The title of this chapter is &ldquo;Leading New Believers to Meet in Their Homes.&rdquo; These words are simple, but for two thousand years the church has neglected meeting in the homes. Christianity pays attention only to worship services in a chapel. We have changed our terminology from <em>chapel</em> to <em>meeting hall</em> and from <em>worship service</em> to <em>meeting;</em> thus, we meet in a meeting hall. Strictly speaking, we are doing the same old thing but with a new label, because we focus on meeting in a meeting hall but neglect meeting with believers in their homes. This practice is not scriptural. In John 15:16 the Lord says, &ldquo;I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain.&rdquo; The Lord committed two matters to us: going forth to bear fruit and bearing remaining fruit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN ADDITIONAL WORD<br />
CONCERNING THE LORD&rsquo;S COMMISSION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Being the True Vine</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s words in the Gospel of John are simple yet profound. In particular, chapter 15 concerning the vine is rather simple, but the mystery of life contained in this chapter is profound. In verse 1 the Lord said that He is the true vine. There are innumerable vines in the universe, but there is only one true, genuine vine that has eternal value, and this vine is the Lord Jesus Himself. He is extraordinary, for He is God and also man. The statement <em>He is God</em> is simple, but it implies that He is the embodiment of the Triune God. God became a man; He had a physical human body. As the embodiment of the Triune God, Jesus possesses divinity as well as humanity. Divinity and humanity are mingled in Him; therefore, He is both God and man. Such a One is the true vine in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Believers Being Branches</h2>
<p>As believers, we are not only the Lord&rsquo;s disciples; we are also branches in the true vine. This relationship shows that we are joined to the Lord in life. We are connected and mingled with Him as one to have the same life and the same living. The trunk and the branches of the vine have one life and one living. It is not possible for the trunk to have one way of living while the branches have another way of living. The trunk and the branches have one living, which is the outflow of the life that they possess. The practical expression of this outflow is fruit-bearing.</p>
<p>The destiny and responsibility of the branches of the vine are to bear fruit. If the branches do not bear fruit, they are useless and are not even good for fuel. The branches of the vine are good only for bearing clusters of fruit. When I was a young child, there was a vine in the courtyard of our house, and every year trellises were set up for the vine to spread and bear fruit. When there was a rich harvest of grapes, we could see clusters of grapes hanging from each of the branches on the trellises. This beautiful scene portrays the believers as branches of the Lord as the true vine bearing clusters of fruit.</p>
<p>We thank the Lord that by His mercy we believed in Him and were saved. We now attend the meetings with rejoicing. It is wonderful that we can sing, &ldquo;Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine.&rdquo; However, the Lord Jesus will ask, &ldquo;How many grapes are you bearing?&rdquo; Some of us may be bearing eight or ten grapes, but others may have only one grape, and still others may not have a single grape. This is our condition. If we were the keeper of a vineyard and noticed such a sad condition of a vine, would we not abandon it? The church is the Lord&rsquo;s vineyard, but do we have clusters of fruit? If we do not have clusters of fruit, what will the Lord do? Someone may say that he has twenty-eight grapes. Although twenty-eight seems like a large number, it is still a count of individual grapes. We should count grapes according to clusters, not individually. Is this our condition?</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Flourishing and the Decline of Christianity</h2>
<p>For the past three and a half years I have been collecting statistical data concerning Christianity in America and Great Britain. This data indicate that for a quarter of a century, from the end of World War II to the 1970s, the membership in the major Christian denominations in America and Britain has been decreasing rapidly. The statistics also show that after World War II Islam is the most prosperous major religion in the world. Four years ago it increased fivefold.</p>
<p>History shows that the spread of Christianity in the previous centuries was related to the spread of imperialism in weak and backward nations. Christianity took advantage of the situation, and the gospel was preached in those countries. In China the Western missionaries were sometimes considered to be higher than the emperors. Before the end of World War II the president of the United States, Mr. Roosevelt, proposed the abolition of all unequal treaties. Due to America&rsquo;s influence, other countries accepted this proposal. This is how many countries lost their colonies. Great Britain was known as an empire upon which the sun never set, but she lost nearly all her colonies. After some of the countries became self-governing, they closed their doors and rejected Christian missionaries. Therefore, the major denominations gradually lost their fields for overseas mission work.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the United States and in Great Britain the testimony of Christian evangelism is too poor. According to my observation, Christianity has not increased during the past twenty-six years in the United States; rather, it has been decreasing. This decline in numbers is unavoidable. Several gospel giants have been raised up, but they have not rescued the waning situation.</p>
<p>The leaders of the major denominations in America met together a couple of months ago to discuss how to evangelize the world by the year 2000. They concluded that there is a shortage of manpower. The Southern Baptist denomination has over ten million believers. There are close to sixty million believers in all the Protestant churches, and the Catholic Church has more than fifty million members. The United States has a population of approximately two hundred twenty million, and nearly half of them are Christians. Yet when the leaders came together to discuss how to evangelize the world, their conclusion was that they do not have the manpower. Where are the believers? They are going to worship services every week.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Proper Way for Believers to Meet and to Serve &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
