   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN SELECTING MATERIAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD BEING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR PEOPLE TO RECEIVE THE LIFE SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A minister of the word must pay attention to the material he uses.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The selection of material is an important matter and involves many details.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who minister the word need to understand that the ministry of the word is for the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our ministering the word also should solve people s problems and generate a feeling of need in them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It should not merely give them things to consider.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our ministering the word must supply people with life, solve their problems, and create a feeling of need in them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must follow these principles when we select material for the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>More books have been produced on the subject of Christianity than on any other subject.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The number of books on biblical exposition is especially large.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a minister of the word thinks that he does not need to use material from others publications, he is proud and foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A minister of the word may also be tempted to believe that he only needs material from books published in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such a minister has lost the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A minister of the word should not depend only on material found in books.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE BASIC MATERIAL</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>FOR THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>BEING LESSONS LEARNED PERSONALLY</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>AND BURDENS RECEIVED FROM THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The basic material for the ministry of the word should be the lessons a person has learned and the burdens he has received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may want to release a message based upon a lesson we learned and a burden we received.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may consult others for their views, explanations, and illustrations related to the lesson we learned and the burden we received.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is helpful to read reference books regularly to broaden our knowledge, but if a minister of the word compiles his messages from reference books without learning any lessons or receiving any burdens, his speaking is degraded and useless.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The ministry of the word is based upon the lessons we have learned and the burdens we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a minister of the word does not learn any lessons and never receives any burdens from the Lord, he should not speak from the podium.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this reason, those who minister the word must continually learn lessons by being dealt with by the Lord in great and small things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He should also learn to receive burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He should receive a burden to preach the gospel and to give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He must continually receive burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although the brothers and sisters fervently love the Lord, the building is lacking among us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, there is the need for us to receive the burden to lead the brothers and sisters into the feeling that they need building.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should receive such a burden from the Lord and release this burden through the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>NOT BEING PROUD BUT WATCHING OVER OUR HEART</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the ministry of the word we should not be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is foolish to be proud as we prepare, thinking that our material is better than anyone else s. Even if our material is better, when we consult with others, our knowledge will be broadened and our feeling for the word will be deepened.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, as we select material for the ministry of the word, on the one hand, we should check and see if the lessons we have learned and the burden we have received are our basis, and on the other hand, we should watch over our heart so that we are not proud.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A person s speaking is degraded and sinful if he must search for material from books because he has nothing to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The release of the word that is not based on experience or a burden received from the Lord is an offense to God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Such a careless speaking is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every message must be based on personal experience and released from a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the fundamental basis for the release of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we release the word, we should not be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should be open to using reference books and receiving help from others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, if we read a book several years ago on a particular topic, it will do no harm to read it again.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our heart and attitude at this point are to consult other material and to receive help from others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, we should not collect material indiscriminately.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the right attitude and the right heart.</S>
