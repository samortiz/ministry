Spiritual reality is nothing other than the inward life becoming the outward living. We must have the basic understanding that God has only one goal, which is to work Himself into man. The significance of salvation is that God has entered into man. This is not merely the forgiveness of sins or deliverance from hell, but the entrance of God into man. When we say that we have received life into us, it means that God has entered into us. If we are clear concerning this point, the rest will be simple. God has put Himself into you in the same way that electricity has been transmitted into the light bulb and has become the shining of the bulb.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Obeying the Operation of God Within</H2><P>God is living and omnipotent. He is living now. You may not be very impressed by this word, because, although He may be living, to you He may be sleeping. In the Bible, there is a difference between "living" and "being." To "live" is active; the Lord is not merely "being" in you, but He is "living" in you. He is moving and working, and He is very purposeful. Since the day you were saved, God has been living within you (John 15:4). What you have to do now is to go along with this moving within. Suppose a person easily loses his temper with his wife. At the time he is saved, he may not know that God is in Him. Right after he is saved, when he comes home from the meeting, his wife may provoke him again. At that instant, he would surely have a certain feeling. If he goes along with that feeling, he will be all right. However, if he does not go along with that feeling and instead loses his temper, he will feel depressed. The next time, when a similar incident occurs, he will not dare to go against that feeling again. The matter of going along with one's inner feeling may be a small thing, but it is difficult to find one person in a thousand who knows to obey it.</P><P>There were two people who were always at odds with each other. Both of them were Christians. One day, both came to me and asked for advice. I turned the question back to them and asked them if they knew what the problem was. They said that they seemed to know, yet they were not clear. In the past, when I encountered such problems, I would try my best to answer them and to list the answers one by one. I would even open up the Bible and explain to others with it. Actually, the ones that asked the questions knew the answers already. In recent years, I do not do this kind of thing any longer. When others ask me a number of questions, I would only answer, "What is your feeling within?"</P>
