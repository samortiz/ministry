   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BLESSEDNESS OF UNITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After such a wonderful Psalm as Psalm 132, we see a wonderful church life, the wonderful life of the brethren living together in unity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Psa 133:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No one can explain how truly wonderful this is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You can only come and experience it yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To hear about it is not sufficient; to read and learn of it is not adequate; you simply must "come and see."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am so very happy that nearly all the dear ones who have come and have seen have been captured.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Behold, how good!"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just behold!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you would like to know what is going on in the church in Los Angeles, you had better come and see.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments" v. 2 . The unity is like the precious ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This ointment is the Spirit, the Spirit which includes all that Christ is and all He has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It runs down from the Head to the entire Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now, praise the Lord, we are under His skirt.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since we are all His members, we are all under His skirt, under His garments.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, we all partake of the anointing ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a picture of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Another aspect of the unity is that it is like the dew of Hermon which descends upon the mountains of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hermon, a high mountain, signifies the heavens, the highest place, from which the dew descends.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The mountains are the local churches, and the dew is the refreshing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Psalm 110 we are the dew to Christ, but here in Psalm 133 Christ is the dew to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Praise the Lord, we are His refreshment, and He is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Day by day He is refreshed by us, and we are refreshed by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The refreshing element of Christ comes down upon all the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes when we are in the meetings late in the evening, we experience the refreshing dew as in the dawn of the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many times we are very tired in body, but tremendously refreshed in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We would like the meetings to continue through the entire night.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such unity is as the dew of Hermon that descends upon the mountains of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not only as ointment upon the Body of Christ, but also as heavenly dew upon the local churches for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not only a Body life, but also a local church life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hallelujah for such unity!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is here, in such a place of unity, that "the Lord commanded the blessing, even life forevermore" v. 3 . Note that it does not say "the Lord gave the blessing," but "the Lord commanded the blessing." The blessing is life, fullness of life, for evermore.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How glad we are to hear of the local churches being full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the fulfillment of Psalm 133.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Where the brethren are dwelling together in unity, the Lord commands the blessing, even life for evermore.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The beauty, the joy, and the blessing of the unity of God's people are with the Body of Christ and in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have one further Psalm of ascension, Psalm 134.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both Psalm 133 and 134 have only three verses.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are short Psalms, but how precious!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Never before have I appreciated Psalm 134 as much as I do today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Psalm 133 is a continuation of Psalm 132, and Psalm 134 is the conclusion of Psalm 133.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By the close of Psalm 132 God enters into His rest, and we obtain satisfaction in the habitation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, following that, we have the church life in Psalm 133.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Psalm 134 now is a conclusion to that wonderful church life presented in Psalm 133.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"Behold, bless ye the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord, which by night stand in the house of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the Lord" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This was the word of the people to the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the people were telling the priests, "All ye servants of the Lord, you must bless the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then the last verse of Psalm 134 is the answer, the reply, of the priests to the people: "The Lord that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God's servants bless Him in His house, and God blesses His people out of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This little Psalm means that we all must fellowship and communicate in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After a good meeting, after a rich enjoyment of Christ, some of us may say, "Bless the name of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then others may answer, "The Lord bless you out of Zion."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How blessed!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Let us try it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is a good fellowship, a good communication, a good conclusion to a meeting of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hallelujah for the church life!</S>
