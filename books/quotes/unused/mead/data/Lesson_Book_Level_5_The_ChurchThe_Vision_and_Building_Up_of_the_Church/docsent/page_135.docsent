   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After praying, we must go to disciple all the nations.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must go to them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord went forth from His throne in the heavens to come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The unbelievers do not know the address of our meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even if they knew, they may not want to come.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The best way to disciple all the nations is to preach to all the creation, to witness to all the nations, and to bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This requires us to pray and go.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the nations believe and are baptized they will be saved Mark 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They become sons of God and members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As a result the church will increase in number.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There will be more called-out ones in the assembly, more material to build up the house of God, and more members to function in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a crucial part of the church-building process.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The building work will cease if we are not faithful to disciple all the nations.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It fulfills the second half of 1 Timothy 2:4 that they may come to the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may say that you have not yet come to the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the fifth summer school of the truth you have attended.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What you have learned is not insignificant.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Most seminary students have not learned what you have already learned.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They may know many things from the Bible, but they do not know the crucial truths concerning God's full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Most of them do not know the three stages of salvation, nor do they know the truth concerning sanctification and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They may not even know the difference between justification and reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, you already have much truth to teach the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Teach them everything you know.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Learn more and teach more.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You can pray, go, baptize, and teach.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As you do these things, the processed Triune God will be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You will be able to bind Satan and loose people for God's church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>VII.</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some people desire to preach the gospel in the uttermost parts of the earth, yet they do not preach where they presently live.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are able to preach the gospel where we presently live, we will be able to preach the gospel anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you do not know how to preach, then learn by praying, fellowshipping, and practicing with your companions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you know how to preach, continue and teach others to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the meantime, study diligently, exercise properly, and develop a good character.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After you graduate from college, attend a full-time training to be fully prepared for the Master's use.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You and your companions will be trained, formed into a team, and sent out by the Lord to establish churches.</S>
