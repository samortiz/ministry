   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When a person is one with the Lord, his will becomes the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If something is not according to God's will, the Holy Spirit will intervene and give him a feeling of unrest.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If he does not stop, but insists on doing what he wants to do, he will feel ill at ease and not have any peace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God often guides a Christian by his own deliberations and will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, a brother or a sister may invite you to a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You may feel cold inside.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although you want to go, you know very well within that you cannot go.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is God's will being manifested through your will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>PAUL'S EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Consider Paul's experience in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When he went to Lystra, he met a disciple called Timothy, whose mother was a Jewish believer and whose father was a Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the brothers in Lystra and Iconium recommended him, and Paul wanted to take him along.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But because the Jews in that place knew that his father was a Greek, Paul circumcised him 16:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul felt to circumcise Timothy, and he did it right away.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The same can be seen in Paul's experience in Philippi of casting out the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A slave girl was possessed by a spirit, and followed Paul for many days, crying, "These men are slaves of the Most High God."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul did not cast out the spirit immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The spirit was cast out when Paul wanted to cast it out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When Paul became provoked, he cast out the spirit, and the spirit left vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul could have dealt with the spirit during the first few days, but there was no provocation within him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once he was provoked within, the spirit was cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From this we see that the Christian walk should not be based on outward control, but on inward control.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The will of those who are truly consecrated reflects God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul was such a man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Acts 20:16 says, "For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus..."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It does not say here that God decided but that Paul decided.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We often hear Christians say, "God's will has led me here" or "God's will has led me to do this," but Paul did not use such spiritual expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His decision matched God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How do we know?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We know because the result of his going to Ephesus was good.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul feared God and was after His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because of this his will became the manifestation of the Lord's will in him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE FORBIDDING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But this does not mean that we will never be wrong when we walk according to our own will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Acts tells us that after Paul set out from Antioch for his evangelistic work, there were very few times when the Spirit led him to do something; most of the time the Spirit was forbidding him from doing something 16:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only in the vision of the night do we see the leading of the Spirit v. 9 . We must trust in the leading of the Spirit and also trust in the forbidding of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In conclusion we can see three things: 1 God's will, 2 the Lord's will, and 3 the forbidding of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Under normal circumstances, we know the Lord's will; through our union with the Lord, His will becomes our will.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's will is manifested only during special occasions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In addition, if something is not according to God's will, the Holy Spirit will intervene.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If something is not according to God's will, we cannot force our decision or will through.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If something is not according to His will, we will not have the inward boldness to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God's will is positive, whereas the forbidding of the Spirit is negative.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's will is manifested in positive guidance, whereas the Holy Spirit's intervention is manifested in forbidding.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In contrast, the Lord's will is both positive and negative.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A MAN IN WHOM GOD TRUSTS</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Romans 14 is an important chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 23 says, "All that is not out of faith is sin."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is an important principle of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The faith spoken of here is different from the faith spoken of in other parts of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other places faith refers to the act of believing, such as: "Believe in the Lord Jesus" and "Believe in God's word."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But in verse 23 this faith is not a believer's faith in God's word or in God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is the faith that believes in what he does himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If he does things that are after God's heart, God will give him faith to assure him that he is right.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If he does things that are not after God's heart, God will condemn him and show him that he is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is this faith that helps us to experience and understand God's will, and it is this faith that helps us to follow after the Lord's light and to live before His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some Christians have reached an advanced stage, and God can put His trust in them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They have passed through the cross and gone through the dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They are abiding in the Lord, and the Lord's word is abiding in them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As such, the Lord can trust in their will and in the proposals that come from their will.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A brother from England once said, "A person who has passed through the cross does not take a passive role or wait for God's will in an outward way like many people do."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If the Lord's life is living within us, His will is spontaneously living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>May we all see that God puts His trust in those who are truly obedient and consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God's will is manifested through such ones.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>May the Lord deliver us from all kinds of passivity and foolishness so that we do not follow Him in darkness.</S>
