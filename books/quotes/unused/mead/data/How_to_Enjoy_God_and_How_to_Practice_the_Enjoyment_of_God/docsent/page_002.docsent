   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE ENJOYING GOD Scripture Reading: Psa 42:1-2; 34:8; 36:7-9; 84:1-2; 90:1; 91:1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In these messages I have a burden to speak concerning the way to enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a practical and intimate concern in the spiritual life of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We will spend some time to consider how a Christian can enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>GOD BEING ENJOYABLE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some may consider the thought of enjoying God to be unusual, but the Bible clearly says that we can taste God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Psalm 34:8 says that we should taste and see that Jehovah is good.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus also said that He is our food; He is the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because food is an enjoyment to us, His being food and bread must mean that He can be enjoyed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A sweet thought recorded in the Word of God is that God is not only near us but that He has even given Himself to us to be our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows the intimate relationship God has with us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we enjoy our meals, the food we eat enters into us and becomes a part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before we eat, the food is not a part of us, but after we take it in, it becomes our nutritional supply and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In addition, after passing through a process of metabolism, it becomes our inward element.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The food we eat becomes a part of us, and we live by it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The relationship between food and our physical body is similar to the relationship between God and our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Psalm 23 is a favorite psalm among God s children; hence, it is difficult to find a Christian who does not know the words the Lord is my Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God, however, is not merely a Shepherd who leads us, protects us, and cares for us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is more intimate than a shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If He were merely a shepherd, He could care for us and shepherd us only in an outward way; He would be unable to enter into us to become a part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He could not become us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, the Bible shows that God gives Himself to us for our enjoyment and works Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He can enter into us to be our life, our strength, our food, and our living water.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He can meet the need of every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who have experienced God know that He is truly our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can enjoy God in His sovereign arrangements and provisions, and we can enjoy Him as the varied supply to our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man is composed of a spirit within, a body without, and a soul between his spirit and body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When God is within us, He can supply the needs of our spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God can satisfy the needs of our spirit by supplying us from within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He can satisfy the needs of our soul, or our psyche, from within our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He can also satisfy the needs of our body by supplying us in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although our God is invisible, untouchable, and intangible, those who have experienced God can testify that they enjoy Him in their spirit, their soul, and even their body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What a glorious blessing this is!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since God is so intimately related to us, the Bible uses many ways to describe and illustrate our enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us briefly consider some of them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God Being Our Life</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Immediately after creating man in Genesis, God placed man in front of the tree of life 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the end of Revelation the tree of life is still present 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The tree of life signifies God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God is the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When God says that He wants man to come to the tree of life, He means that He wants man to touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God wants to enter into man to be his life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Life is something very close and crucial to man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It can even be said that life is man himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Without life, it is impossible for man to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Bible shows that God desires to be man s life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, we can say boldly that if a person does not have God within him as life, he has not come up to the standard of a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The life a person has determines the kind of person he is.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those with a lower life are lower, and those with a higher life are higher.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The life we possess in our natural constitution, our natural life, is a lower life; it is impossible for us to be a higher person with only this life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In order to be a higher person, we must have a higher kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God s life is the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, it is impossible for anyone to be a higher person if he does not receive God as the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A higher kind of man is noble, holy, loving, and patient, possessing no meanness or pettiness in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although there is a certain degree of magnanimity and tolerance in man s natural life, these virtues are limited.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order to be unlimitedly high, a person must receive the unlimited God as the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the infinite God enters into us and becomes the highest life within us, we become persons of an infinitely high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We can love what others cannot love, we can endure what others cannot endure, and we can forgive what others cannot forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We possess a nobleness and a holiness that no mere human being possesses.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Everyone who has the life of God can be unlimitedly high.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A person who has God as his life should have a standard that is infinitely high.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>While others may say that a certain matter is overwhelming, those with God as their life can bear it joyfully.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When others find a matter intolerable, those with God can gladly and willingly tolerate it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A person with God is a high person, an unlimited person.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is impossible to attain to this high living with only the natural life that man possesses.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This living can be attained only when one takes God s highest life as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This highest life is the immeasurably high God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is life, and He is also the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He not only dispenses His life into us but also enters into us to be our very life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He does not enter into us to be our life in small increments.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>On the contrary, He has fully entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Day by day and moment by moment, He is in us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, we can enjoy Him every day.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We can taste Him moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We know the importance of air to human life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A man can be without food for seven or eight days, and he can be without water one or two days.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, if he is without air for five minutes, he will cease to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Air is vital to human life, and it is the most available item for man s enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We can breathe on the street and in houses.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We can breathe in cars and in airplanes.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We breathe when we are conscious of it, and we breathe when we are not conscious of it.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We breathe while we are listening to a message and in our sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we have a measure of spiritual experience, we will realize that God is just like air to us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God is Spirit, and the Spirit is like air.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the original language of the Bible, in both Hebrew in the Old Testament and Greek in the New Testament, wind, breath, and spirit are the same word.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Spirit is breath, and breath is wind.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>God is Spirit, and God is also breath.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Bible describes the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost as a rushing violent wind, which was God Himself Acts 2:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Lord Jesus also came to the disciples on the evening of His resurrection and breathed into them, saying, Receive the Holy Spirit John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The Spirit is likened to breath.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This Spirit is also the very God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When God enters into us to be our enjoyment, He enters as the Spirit, and this Spirit is like wind and breath.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Whether we open to Him or turn away from Him, He remains our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Wherever we are and no matter the time, God as the Spirit is available to us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We can touch and taste this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When the Spirit enters into us, He becomes the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This Spirit of life, this breath of life, strengthens our spirit and spreads from our spirit to our heart, which includes the soul, and from our soul to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In this way our whole being is saturated with the Spirit as breath; that is, we are full of the presence of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is the practical way to enjoy God.</S>
