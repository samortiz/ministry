   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Having lived an excellent human life for thirty-three and a half years after His incarnation, the Lord Jesus went to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Crucifixion was the cruelest and most shameful way to die in those days.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet we should not consider the Lord's death as a sad and tragic event.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His death was the greatest and most wonderful death in the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In fact, the cross was the goal of Christ's incarnation and human living.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On one hand the Lord was crucified by men, but on the other hand He went to the cross willingly in order to accomplish God's eternal purpose John 10:15; Heb 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The cross was where He accomplished all His work of redemption so that man might be brought back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You probably know that Christ was crucified for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That is wonderful, but His death accomplished much more than that.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order to see this, we will take the next two lessons to look at five things that the Lord was when He died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible tells us that He died as the Lamb of God, the brass serpent, the last Adam, the peacemaker, and the grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I. THE LAMB OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In John 1:29 when John the Baptist saw Jesus, he proclaimed to everyone: "Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When man fell from God, God righteously had to require man to pay for those sins by the shedding of blood by giving his life .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But because of His love, God told the people they could substitute lambs and other cattle as sacrifices for their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By doing that, the people were spared from God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those Old Testament sacrifices were types symbols of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God required those sacrificial lambs to be without spot or blemish Exo 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We saw in Lesson Fifteen that He was indeed without spot or blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ came as the real Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before, the people had to offer the sacrifices over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their sins were not actually taken away; they were merely covered up Heb 10:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But behold the Lamb of God who takes away our sins!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jesus offered Himself once for all Heb 9:28; 10:10, 12 for the forgiveness of all Matt 26:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because we have committed many sins, God requires the shedding of our blood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But Christ shed His blood for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By believing in the Lord Jesus, we are completely forgiven of our sins and are freed from God's penalty of death!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's intention is that we walk in holiness, but we still sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sinning can frustrate our fellowship with the Lord, but Christ's death as the Lamb of God fully takes care of this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness" 1 John 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is absolutely righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because Christ already died for us, He must instantly forgive us when we confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Afterward, we should not feel guilty.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do, that is the Devil's lie.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should tell him, "Devil, you are a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am cleansed by the Lamb's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I can fully enjoy the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is how we can enjoy Christ's death as the Lamb of God.</S>
