<h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Charge<br />
to Disciple the Nations and Baptize Them<br />
into the Name of the Triune God</h2>
<p>At the end of the Gospel of Matthew the Lord charged His disciples, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (28:19). The way to disciple people is to help them to call on the name of the Lord (Rom. 10:12). If a person is willing to believe in the Lord Jesus, we should lead him to call on the Lord. We need to explain that Jesus is no longer the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; God but the processed God. God was processed in incarnation, human living, crucifixion, burial, and resurrection to become the Spirit. Now He is available to us. We can preach the gospel based on Romans 10:6-8, saying, &ldquo;There is no need to bring Christ down from heaven, for He has come down already in incarnation. There is no need to go into the abyss to bring Him up, for He already passed through death and resurrected. Now He is the living word, and He is in your mouth. If you would open your mouth and say from your heart, &lsquo;O Lord Jesus,&rsquo; this processed God will come into you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once a person calls on the Lord, we need to baptize him into the Triune God. Our commission from the Lord in Matthew 28:19 is to baptize people not <em>in</em> the name of the Triune God but <em>into</em> His name. To baptize someone only <em>in</em> the name of the Triune God is a religious formality. The same Greek word translated &ldquo;into&rdquo; in Matthew 28:19 is used in Romans 6:3, which says, &ldquo;All of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death,&rdquo; and in Galatians 3:27, which says, &ldquo;As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; We need to baptize people into His name (Acts 8:16; 19:5). The name denotes the person. If we call the name of a person who is real, living, near, and available, that person will come to us. If we call the name of a person who is imaginary, dead, or far away, that person will not come to us. Because Jesus is real, living, near, and available, the more we call on His name, the more we receive His person (Rom. 10:8-9). Whenever we call on the name of the Lord, His person comes into our being.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s charge in Matthew 28:19 is to baptize people into the name of the Triune God. Before the resurrection of Christ, the Bible does not reveal the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. After the Lord resurrected and was given all authority in heaven and on earth (v. 18), He told His disciples to baptize people into the name of the Triune God, because by then God had been processed. He was no longer &ldquo;raw&rdquo; but had passed through incarnation, thirty-three and a half years of human living, crucifixion, burial, and resurrection. God was fully processed and ready for man to receive Him.</p>
<p>Before the resurrection of Christ, mankind had many problems, and it was impossible for man to contact God. However, by Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion and resurrection, all man&rsquo;s problems were solved, and now God is the processed God. The Triune God is like a great meal that has been prepared and served; He is ready for man to come and enjoy. God is triune not for our doctrinal understanding but so that He could pass through a process to become available for us to enjoy. God the Father purposed, God the Son accomplished everything, and God the Spirit is the realization of all the riches of what God is and has accomplished. All that God is and has accomplished, obtained, and attained is ready for us to enjoy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Reality of Baptism</h2>
<p>Baptism is often practiced merely as an outward form. This should not be our practice. Baptism is not a formality; it is a reality. Once the Lord has entered into a person, we need to put that person into the Triune God. In the proper church life, after a person calls on the name of the Lord, the church should immediately baptize that one into the Triune God, not as a form but as a reality. I hope that all the churches have the faith and the assurance that baptism is not a formality. We need to have a living faith that we are baptizing people into the Triune God.</p>
<p>Baptism has a negative aspect and a positive aspect. Negatively, baptism is a burial to terminate people. After we believe in the Lord Jesus, our old man needs to be terminated by being buried. Positively, baptism is to put someone into the Triune God. If we compare Matthew 28:19 with Galatians 3:27, we can see that Christ equals the Triune God. To be baptized into Christ is to be baptized into the Triune God. Christ is not only the Baptizer but also the One into whom we are baptized. As the Baptizer, Christ baptizes us into Himself.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision and Experience of the Corporate Christ &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
