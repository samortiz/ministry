   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE SEVENTY-EIGHT THE MAN-SAVIOR S ASCENSION 3 Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22, 10; Col 1:18; Eph 1:23; 3:19b; Heb 4:14; 7:26, 22; 8:6; 9:15-16; Rev 1:13; 2:1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to the subjective aspect of the Man-Savior s ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not as easy to speak of the subjective aspect of the Man-Savior s ascension as it is to speak of the objective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning the Lord s ascension being subjective to us, I feel that I lack the utterance to express what the Lord has shown us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A TRANSMISSION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>FROM THE ASCENDED CHRIST TO THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have seen that in His ascension Christ was crowned with glory and honor and enthroned for God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that He shares God s throne to be the unique Administrator in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through His ascension Christ was also inaugurated to be the Lord to possess all and to be the Christ to carry out God s commission.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since all these matters are objective, how can we prove that Christ s ascension is related to us in a subjective way?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Proof is in the fact that there is a transmission from the ascended Christ to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I first used the word transmission in relation to Christ s ascension twenty-two years ago, during a message in which I was trying to speak on Ephesians 1:19-23.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 22 says that God gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The phrase to the church indicates a transmission from the ascended Christ to the church, His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>HEAD OVER ALL THINGS TO THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second part of Ephesians 1:22 and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church has been a problem for translators of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Mainly there are three ways to translate this clause.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first way is that followed by the King James Version and the New Translation of J. N. Darby; it is also the translation in the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The King James Version says, gave him to be the head over all things to the church, and Darby s version says, gave Him to be head over all things to the assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Recovery Version, quoted above, says, gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A Gift from God to Christ</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to this translation, God gave Christ to be something to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It does not mean that God gave Christ to the church as a gift; it means that God gave Christ a gift the headship over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to this understanding, a great gift was given to Christ by God, and this great gift was the headship over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To the Church</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s giving Christ to be the Head over all things is to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To the church, as we have pointed out, implies a transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What God gave Christ to be is to the church; it is transmitted to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church shares it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This corresponds to the word His power toward us in verse 19.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The phrase toward us is a key, for it also indicates a transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God s power in the heavens is toward us; that is, His power is transmitted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The transmission of electricity from the power plant to our homes is an illustration of the transmission of God s power from the heavens to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The current of electricity flows from the power plant through wires into our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This current of electricity is its transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the lights are on, we know that this transmission is taking place.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we go to the meter, we shall see a clear indication that the current of electricity is flowing, that there is transmission of electricity from the power plant into our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a similar way, there is a transmission of the heavenly current of the divine electricity from the power plant in the third heaven to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As the church, we are the building into which the divine electricity is being transmitted.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, God s power is toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that the divine electricity is being transmitted from the heavens to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Ephesians 1:19 says that the transmission of God s power toward us is according to the operation of the might of His strength.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The phrase according to indicates that a track is needed for the transmission of the divine electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This track may be compared to the tracks on which a locomotive runs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without a railroad track a locomotive has no way to move properly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Likewise, the heavenly, divine electricity is being transmitted into us according to a track.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As used in verse 19, the phrase according to also indicates a model or pattern, showing us how this great power is transmitted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God s power is transmitted according to the operation of the might of His strength.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Here Paul, seemingly exhausting the vocabulary of the Greek language, speaks of power, operation, might, and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul uses all these words to convey something of the vastness of God s power to us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God s power is transmitted to us according to an operation, and this operation is of the might of His strength.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God s Power Wrought in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Ephesians 1:20 Paul continues, Which He wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead, and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To what does which refer?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It refers to power in verse 19.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In verse 20 Paul speaks of the power which God wrought in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>From this verse through verse 22 we see that God wrought this power in Christ by four steps: first, raising Him from among the dead; second, seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies; third, subjecting all things under His feet; and fourth, giving Him to be Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The final step of God s working in Christ with His great power was to give Him to be the Head over all things, and what God gave Christ to be was to the church.</S>
