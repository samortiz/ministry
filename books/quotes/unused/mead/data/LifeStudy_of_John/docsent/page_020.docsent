   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Incarnation a. To Bring God into His Creation Man</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The second item was incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without creation there would have been no way for God to be incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Creation prepared the way and afforded Him the means to be incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Creation brought things into being, and incarnation brought God into His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God waited approximately four thousand years after the creation of Adam before becoming incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One day, He was incarnated, and there was on earth the little man Jesus with God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God was wrought into that man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That was the greatest miracle of all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By incarnation, God was brought into mankind and became one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Divinity and humanity became one unit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Between eternity in the past and eternity in the future is a gap, with time as a bridge to span it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On this bridge called time, Christ as the Word of God, through whom all things were created, was incarnated as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Creation was the first event on the bridge of time, and incarnation was the second.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Creation means that things not being are brought into being through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before creation, nothing existed, but by Christ s creation all things came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Incarnation is God coming into His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although everything created by God was perfect and good, yet nothing of creation had been joined to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Creation was but a preparatory step for incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God firstly brought all created things into existence so that He could later become one with His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the reason that God created the heavens, the earth, and man as the center of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was His design to prepare creation so that He could join Himself to it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Word became flesh means that God joined Himself to His creation by His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In incarnation, the flesh which God put on became His tabernacle 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This tabernacle was the building of God on a small scale; it was a miniature of the New Jerusalem, God s tabernacle in eternity Rev 21:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By creation, God brought all things of the universe into existence; by incarnation, He mingled Himself with man, who is the center of His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The purpose of God in creation and incarnation is to fulfill His desire of mingling Himself with humanity and to make humanity a living habitation for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is not satisfied with heaven as His abode.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He desires to build a living dwelling place with living people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, He created man as the center of His creation and mingled Himself with man by incarnation so that He might make man His living habitation in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To Declare God</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Incarnation is not only to bring God into His creation, but also to declare God to man in the Word, in life, in light, in grace, and in truth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the incarnation, the Word, which is Christ as God, became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Word is God expressed, explained, and defined so that man may understand God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Life is God imparted that man may receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Light is God shining that man may be enlightened to apprehend Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Grace is God enjoyed by man that man may share His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Truth is God realized by man that man may have Him as reality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In total, it is through these five things that God is fully declared to man in order that man may partake of and enjoy Him as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The third item on the bridge of time is redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After living on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, the Lord went to the cross as the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lamb of God is for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Through redemption, the Lord recovered fallen man and separated him from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By means of redemption, God not only removed sin, but also terminated the entire old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The very Jesus who was crucified on the cross took the old creation with Him into the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When He was raised from the dead, He left the old creation in the tomb and came out in resurrection as the head of the new creation.</S>
