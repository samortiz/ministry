In 11:19 the record goes on to tell us that those who were scattered by the tribulation that took place over Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch. Here we see that the migration from Jerusalem went as far as Antioch, where there was a church. The church at Antioch, therefore, was produced through Jerusalem. We need to trace this matter in the record in Acts.</p><p>When the account concerning those in Antioch &ldquo;was heard in the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem,&rdquo; they sent Barnabas to go as far as Antioch (11:22). Barnabas was sent out to visit the churches in other places.</p><p>In 11:19 we see that the scattered saints spoke the word only to Jews. But when some of these saints came to Antioch, they spoke also to the Greeks (v. 20). This is a hint that the trend of the Lord&rsquo;s spreading was toward the Gentiles.</p><p>Luke&rsquo;s record not only shows the tendency of the Lord&rsquo;s spread toward the Gentiles, but also reveals how Saul was produced as the vessel to carry out God&rsquo;s ministry in the Gentile world. Saul was produced through Jerusalem. He was not a new start apart from Jerusalem. Jerusalem&rsquo;s migration reached Antioch, and a church was raised up in that city. Then Jerusalem sent out Barnabas as an authoritative representative. When he saw the grace of God, he rejoiced. He was happy with the marvelous situation of the church in Antioch. Nevertheless, Barnabas realized that there was still a particular need&mdash;the need of ministry. The scattered saints had gone to Antioch for the raising up of a church, yet among them there was a shortage of ministry. Because of this, Barnabas &ldquo;went away to Tarsus to hunt for Saul&rdquo; (11:25). When Barnabas found Saul, he brought him to Antioch, and &ldquo;for a whole year they were gathered in the church and taught a considerable number&rdquo; (v. 26). This was part of the initiation of Saul&rsquo;s ministry.</p><p>During a time of great famine, the saints in Jerusalem and Judea were in need. Material help was sent from the church at Antioch to those in Judea through Barnabas and Saul (11:29-30). As we have pointed out, this indicates that through Barnabas Saul was brought into the service among the churches. Step by step the Lord brought in Saul. No doubt, he was welcomed in Jerusalem. After fulfilling their responsibility, Barnabas and Saul returned to Antioch.</p><h2 class="head2">Keeping the Oneness of the Body</h2><p>By the time Barnabas and Saul returned to Antioch, Saul had been fully prepared as a vessel. He was a product through Jerusalem, for he had been prepared by God through Jerusalem. We have emphasized the fact that with Saul we do not have a new start apart from Jerusalem. We stress this matter because it is something the Lord did sovereignly and wisely in order to keep the oneness of the Body.</p><h2 class="head3">One Stream</h2><p>In the booklet entitled <i>The Divine Stream</i> we pointed out that there is only one stream in the book of Acts. This stream started from Jerusalem and flowed through Samaria to Antioch. From Antioch the stream turned to Asia Minor and then to Europe. The Lord did not have two streams, one starting from Jerusalem through Peter and another starting in the Gentile world through Saul. No, the Lord had only one stream, the stream that started from Jerusalem.</p><p>The Lord knew that there was the need of a particular vessel, a new vessel. Peter was not qualified to be this vessel, and Peter could not replace this vessel. The Lord did all things wisely and sovereignly to put Saul, His chosen vessel, into the proper relationship with the church in Jerusalem. As we have pointed out, Saul was actually produced through Jerusalem.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_099.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_101.html">Next</a> </body></html>
