   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>9 Some Rule Was Established</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The lights God made on the fourth day were established "to rule over the day and over the night" by their shining Gen 1:18a .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The light not only shines, but also rules by its shining.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Where there is shining, there is ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Darkness brings in confusion, but light regulates.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For the growth of life, we need the ruling and the regulating of the fourth-day lights.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The lights on the fourth day also "divide the light from the darkness" Gen 1:18b .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The separation of the light from the darkness, as we have seen in message three, had happened already Gen 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now, the ruling of the fourth-day lights' shining strengthens this separation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For the growth of life, we need the ruling of the lights and also the strengthening of the separation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the second requirement for the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>10 The Living Creatures in the Water Were Generated</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the fifth day, the lower life with the lowest consciousness came into being Gen 1:20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although every form of animal life has some level of consciousness, some lives are higher and others are lower.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, the fish are mentioned, the animal life with the lowest consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have all had some experience of this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose there are some goldfish swimming in the water and we come near them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They will be frightened away.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, if we scatter some food into the water and keep away, all the fish will return.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This life is higher than the tree life, higher than the plant life Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>47:7, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although it is not very high, it is higher.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the first step of the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The fish in the sea live in salt water.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a rule, salt water doesn't grow anything; it kills, allowing nearly no plants to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Salt water kills life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Fish, however, can live in salt water.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The water may be salty, but the fish will never be salty, unless they are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is quite meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All of humanity, the entire human society, is like a great salt sea.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet, we Christians are so living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can be alive and live in such a society and not be salted by it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But once we are dead, we will become salty.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Chinese people used to eat a great deal of salted fish.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First, they killed the living fish and then put them into salt until all the fish became salty.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the fish were living, salt could do nothing to them; they could live in the salt water.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We Christians who have the life of Christ can live in this dark, evil society.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, if we become dead, we will be salted.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today, if you are so living and one of your schoolmates tempts you to go to a movie or to take some drugs, you will say, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nothing can influence you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But, if you are dead, you will first be brought to the movie theater like a sheep to the slaughter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once you have been slaughtered, you will be dead, take drugs, even heroin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You will be salted.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can never be salted because we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Life repels every kind of salt from the dead sea.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This life can survive in any death situation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the midst of an environment of death, this life can still survive.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is good; yet there is more.</S>
