   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONSECRATION A. The Heart Being Open</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is full of God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yet this light will only enlighten those who are open to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, "But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The basic qualification for being enlightened by the glory of the Lord is to behold Him with unveiled face.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a man comes to the Lord with a veiled face, the glory will not enlighten him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's light will only enlighten those who are open to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a man is not open to God, he will not receive God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The trouble with some people is that they are closed to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their spirit, heart, will, and mind are all closed to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a result, the light of the Scriptures will not reach them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even though the sun is full of light and shines on the whole world, its light will not reach a person who sits inside a room with closed door and windows.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The problem is not with the light but with the person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Light will only shine on those who are open to it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is true of physical light, and this is also true of spiritual light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever we lock ourselves in, light cannot shine through.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some people are closed to the Lord; they can never see God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must not pay attention just to reading and studying; rather, we should ask if we are open before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do not have an unveiled face, the glory of the Lord will not shine on us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If our heart is not open to God, God cannot give us any light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Light operates according to a law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It shines on those who are open to it, and the amount of shining depends on the amount of openness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If all the doors and windows of a room are closed but just one crack is left open, light will still come in. It is not difficult to get the light.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As long as one follows this law, he will receive the light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if he acts contrary to this law, he will not have any light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A man who is closed to God may study and pray much, but he will remain ignorant as far as understanding the Bible is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is hard for a man to expect any light when he is not open to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's light does not come unconditionally.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to have God's light, one must first fulfill the conditions for receiving it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every child of God has a Bible in his hand, but the amount of light each receives from this book is different.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some are completely ignorant of what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Others receive some light from reading it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Still others are full of light when they read it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The reason for the difference is that the persons reading it are different.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God's light is the same, but the persons are different.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>People who are open to God can understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Others who are closed to God cannot understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some are closed completely, and as a result they are in complete darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Others are closed partially, and as a result they receive partial light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Any lack of sight that we experience, whether great or small, complete or partial, means that we are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should never consider it a small thing to find ourselves having difficulty understanding the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we have difficulty understanding the Bible, it can only mean one thing: We are living in darkness!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is a very serious thing to read God's Word and not understand or receive any light from it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Next, we should ask what is the meaning of being open to God?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Openness comes from unconditional and unreserved consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Openness to God is not a temporary attitude; it is a permanent disposition which a man develops before God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not an incidental temperament but a continuous practice.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Openness to God can only come from unconditional and unreserved consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a man's consecration to God is perfect and absolute, he will have no reservation toward God and will not be closed in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Any closedness reflects shortages in one's consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Darkness is the result of being closed, and being closed is the result of a lack of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Any time there is a shortage of consecration, there will be reservations.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When a man refuses to humble himself before God in any area, he will try to justify himself instead.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As a consequence, he cannot understand the scriptural truth related to that same area.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As soon as he touches that area, he will try to dodge it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the reason we say that darkness comes from being closed, and being closed comes from a lack of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All kinds of darkness come as a result of being closed, and being closed in any area is the result of a lack of consecration and submission.</S>
