The Lord&#8217;s Promise to the Overcomers of This Stage</h2><p>[In verse 26 the Lord says that to the one who overcomes He will give authority over the nations. This is a prize to the overcomers of reigning with Christ over the nations in the millennial kingdom (20:4, 6). This promise of the Lord strongly implies that those who do not answer His call to overcome the apostate church will not participate in the reign of the millennial kingdom.]<p>[In 2:28 we have another aspect of the Lord&#8217;s promise to the overcomer in this stage. He says, &#8220;I will give him the morning star.&#8217;&#8217; The morning star here refers to the coming Christ. At Christ&#8217;s first coming, the wise men, not the Jewish religionists, saw His star (Matt. 2:2, 9-10). At His second coming, He will be the morning star to His overcomers, who watch for His coming. To all the others, He will appear only as the sun (Mal. 4:2). Only the hidden overcomers, those who enjoy Christ as the hidden manna, will see the hidden Christ appearing as the morning star to those who love Him.]<h2 class=head1>V. THE CHURCH IN SARDIS</h2><p>[Sardis in Greek means &#8220;the remains,&#8217;&#8217; &#8220;the remainder,&#8217;&#8217; or &#8220;the restoration.&#8217;&#8217; As a sign, the church in Sardis prefigures the Protestant Church from the time of the Reformation to the second coming of Christ. The Reformation was God&#8217;s reaction to the apostate Roman Catholic Church, signified by the degraded church in Thyatira. The Reformation was accomplished by a minority of the believers, the remainder. Hence, it was the restoration by the remainder.]<h2 class=head2>A. The Condition of the Church at This Stage</h2><p>[To the messenger of the church in Sardis the Lord says, &#8220;I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and you are dead&#8217;&#8217; (Rev. 3:1). The reformed Protestant Church has been considered by many to be living, but the Lord says that she is dead. Hence, in her dead condition, she needs the seven living Spirits and the shining stars.]<p>[In verse 2 the Lord says to &#8220;establish the things which remain, which were about to die.&#8217;&#8217; &#8220;The things which remain&#8217;&#8217; are the things lost and restored by the Reformation, such as justification by faith and the open Bible. Although these things were restored, they &#8220;were about to die.&#8217;&#8217; Hence, the Protestant Church needs revivals to keep things alive.<p>In verse 2 the Lord also says, &#8220;I have not found your works completed before My God.&#8217;&#8217; Nothing begun in the Reformation has been completed by the Protestant churches. Therefore, the church in Philadelphia (3:7-13), signifying the church in recovery, is needed for the completion. In the eyes of God, there are no completed works in the so-called reformed churches.]<h2 class=head2>B. The Lord&#8217;s Promise to the Overcomers of This Stage</h2><p>[In 3:5 we have the Lord&#8217;s promise to the overcomers of this stage. To overcome here means to overcome the deadness of the Protestant churches, that is, to overcome dead Protestantism. The whole of verse 5 is the Lord&#8217;s promise to the overcomers. It will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom after He comes back.]<p>[In 3:4 the Lord says, &#8220;But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.&#8217;&#8217; Garments in the Bible signify what we are in our walk and living. To defile the garments means particularly to stain them with deadness. Death is more defiling before God than sin (Lev. 11:24-25; Num. 6:6-7, 9). In this verse the defilement denotes anything of the death nature. The defilement in Sardis was not the defilement of sin but the defilement of death.<p>Speaking of those who have not defiled their garments, the Lord says, &#8220;They shall walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.&#8217;&#8217; White not only signifies purity but also approvedness. White garments here signify the walk and living which are unspotted by death and which will be approved by the Lord. It is a qualification for walking with the Lord, especially in the coming kingdom.]<p>[The Lord says in 3:5b, &#8220;I will by no means erase his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.&#8217;&#8217; The book of life is a divine record of the names of those who partake of the blessings God has prepared for them. These blessings are in three stages: the church, the millennial kingdom, and eternity. All the believers will share in the blessings of the first and third stages, but only the overcomers will share in the blessings of the second stage, that is, the blessings in the millennial kingdom. Those who cooperate with God&#8217;s supplying grace and mature in life in the church age will be given the prize of the entrance into the millennial kingdom and the participation in the divine blessings in that stage. This means that their names will not be erased out of the book of life during the millennium.]<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> </body></html>
