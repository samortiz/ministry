   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REDEMPTION ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is correct to say that it was not the four rings that accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The burning for the accomplishment of redemption took place on the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The grating signifies Christ, and the rings signify the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ, not the Spirit, was the One who accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have absolutely no doubt concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But where does the grating stand?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Is it supported by its own strength?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Apart from the four rings, the grating had no support.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both when the altar was at rest and when it was carried, the grating was upheld by the rings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There was no other support, no other upholding power.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To repeat, the grating was upheld by the four rings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yes, the burning was accomplished by the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the upholding power is in the rings, not in the grating itself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hebrews 9:14 speaks concerning this: How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was through the eternal Spirit Christ offered Himself to God as our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During the years I was with the Brethren, I was never told that Christ offered Himself by the Spirit and through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Have you ever heard a message on Christ offering Himself to God by and through the eternal Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christians do not ordinarily speak this way, for not many have this knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because they do not have the knowledge, they do not use the language of Hebrews 9:14.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nevertheless, such a word is found in Hebrews 9:14.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The all-inclusive Christ died an all-inclusive death through the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He died through the Spirit who is eternal, the Spirit who is without beginning or ending.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a mysterious event actually took place in human history, but it is neglected by unbelieving historians.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No history book will ever tell you that the all-inclusive Christ offered Himself through the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I first came to know Hebrews 9:14 many years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, I did not understand the meaning of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What does it mean to say that Christ offered Himself to God as a sin offering through the eternal Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>WHY CHRIST OFFERED HIMSELF THROUGH</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE ETERNAL SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is the significance of the phrase through the eternal Spirit ?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why was it necessary for Christ to die on the cross through the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Was Christ not almighty, and was He not able to do everything necessary to accomplish redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why then did He need the eternal Spirit in order to die on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>My burden in this message is to present a picture concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This picture will lead to a conclusion, and the conclusion will then become the answer to the question of why Christ offered Himself through the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ did not become a man suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, He became a man according to the normal process of conception and delivery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was conceived in the womb of Mary, and nine months later He was born.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then for thirty-three and a half years the Lord Jesus lived on earth as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually He went to the cross and died there as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But although He lived and died as a man, He was also God; hence, He was a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to Isaiah 9:6, the Lord as the child born to us in a manger was called the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But although He was God, He lived on earth not as God, but as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, He was conceived by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to Matthew 1 and Luke 2, the man Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When He came forth to minister as a man from Nazareth, He was anointed by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the time of His baptism, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him Matt 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In all His life He was full of the Spirit and continually under the leading of the Spirit Luke 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He lived, moved, acted, worked, and ministered altogether under the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He did not do anything apart from this leading Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Elsewhere I have pointed out that the Lord Jesus lived a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now we must see that He lived such a crucified life according to the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Moreover, in Matthew 12 we see that He cast out demons by the power of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, the Lord was a man who did everything under the leading of the Spirit and by the power of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He did not act according to His own will, wishes, or desires.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He lived, moved, and acted according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the time came for the Lord Jesus to die on the cross, He did not go to the cross according to His own wishes or desire.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, His going to the cross was according to the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His entire life had been lived according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thus, His going to the cross was also according to the Spirit s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the cross the Lord Jesus died an all-inclusive death, a death that took away the sin of the world, destroyed Satan, judged the world, terminated the old creation, and abolished the handwriting of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Such an all-inclusive death was accomplished through the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>During His life on earth, the Lord would not do even a small thing apart from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even His going to the wilderness was under the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Certainly when He died an all-inclusive death on Calvary, He would not do this apart from the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thus, when Christ died on the cross, He died through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In Hebrews 9 there is a comparison between the animal sacrifices offered by the priests in the Old Testament and the unique sacrifice of Christ offered to God through the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When the priests offered the sacrifices, they did not offer them through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>On the contrary, they did it by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, what they did was of little effect; it could not be powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This was the reason the sacrifices needed to be offered again and again each year on the day of atonement.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But Christ as the High Priest offered Himself to God as the sin offering through the eternal Spirit once for all, through One who is without beginning or ending.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, what Christ offered is powerful and efficacious.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Now we have an answer to the question of why Christ needed to offer Himself through the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We have seen that as a man He did not do anything on His own.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Everything He did was under the leading of the Spirit and by the power of the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is signified by the four rings on the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The full weight of the grating was borne by the rings.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore, what is accomplished by the grating is powerful and efficacious.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This means that the power, the strength, and the efficacy of the redemption accomplished by the grating depends on the four rings.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The power of Christ s redemption depends on the eternal Spirit.</S>
