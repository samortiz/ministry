   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>5-6 .</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The fine flour was mingled not with water but with oil.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here we have a picture of Christ's experience of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First, He was born of the Spirit of God Matt 1:18, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was a matter of His being mingled with the Spirit.</S>
