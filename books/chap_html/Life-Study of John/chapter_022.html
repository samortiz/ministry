<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">THE NEED OF THE BLIND IN RELIGION&mdash;<br />LIFE&rsquo;S SIGHT AND LIFE&rsquo;S SHEPHERDING</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><p>Now we come to John 10. This is a very interesting chapter, but it is also a misunderstood chapter. This chapter is actually a continuation of chapter nine. Verse 21 helps us to realize this, for the question is asked, &ldquo;Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?&rdquo; Both chapters center around the record of the case of the man born blind. The thought in this chapter is deep. On the surface, it seems easy to understand, but actually it is not easy to understand this parable or allegory. The Lord brought out this allegory about the sheepfold immediately after He cured the blind man who was cast out of the synagogue by the Jews. This incident, therefore, became the setting for the parable of the sheepfold.</p><h2 class="head1">II. LIFE&rsquo;S SHEPHERDING FOR THE BELIEVERS<br />OUTSIDE OF RELIGION</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Sheepfold, the Door, and the Pasture<br />for the Sheep</h2><p>We must now consider the significance of the sheepfold in this parable. It is not easy to define the sheepfold. Perhaps you know something about the Bible and especially about the gospels. Perhaps you were told from your youth about the stories from the gospels in Sunday School. Perhaps you have even graduated from seminary. Let me ask you this question: what do you realize about the sheepfold? What have you been taught about this matter? The key to unlocking the secret of this parable depends very much upon the meaning of the sheepfold.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Sheepfold<br />Signifying the Law, or Judaism,<br />the Religion of the Law</h2><p>The sheepfold, in its better usage, signifies the law of the Old Testament, but in its common and ordinary usage, it signifies Judaism, the religion of the law. Originally, before the first advent of Christ, God gave His law to the people of Israel. What was God&rsquo;s purpose in giving them the law? Did He expect them to keep it? No, that was not His purpose. Galatians 3:23-26 reveals God&rsquo;s purpose in giving the law. &ldquo;But before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed. So the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But faith having come, we are no longer under a child-conductor; for you are all the sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Before faith in Christ came, we were kept under the law. In other words, we were kept like sheep in a fold. The Greek word translated &ldquo;kept&rdquo; means confined. Before faith came&mdash;that is, before Christ came&mdash;the chosen people of God were confined under the law. They were &ldquo;shut up&rdquo; under the law. &ldquo;Shut up&rdquo; is a special word in Greek, meaning to be kept in custody or under special care in a ward. For instance, if the parents of a family pass away, the children might be put in the custody of their aunt or uncle. In other words, they are put under the care of someone else. This shows how the chosen people of God were placed under the custody of the law before faith in Christ came. The law kept God&rsquo;s people under custody &ldquo;unto the faith,&rdquo; which is better translated as &ldquo;for preparation to the faith.&rdquo; Galatians 3:24 says that &ldquo;the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ.&rdquo; Actually, the translation of the King James Version for this verse is not adequate. In the Greek text it means that the law was our slave to bring us to our schoolmaster, who is Christ. In ancient times, the children of the rich, Jewish families were escorted to their schoolmaster by a trained slave. Likewise, the law served as a slave to bring us to Christ. Before we were brought to Christ, the schoolmaster, we were under the care of a slave, the law. God the Father used the law as a slave to take care of us and to bring us to Christ. Before Christ came, we were put under the hand of the law which was to be our custodian. The law was responsible for the care and protection of God&rsquo;s chosen people and eventually it brought them to Christ. Once we have been brought to Christ, we are justified by faith. Since faith has come&mdash;that is, since Christ has come&mdash;we are no longer under the custody of the slave.</p><p>Now we understand what is the sheepfold. Before Christ came, God put His chosen people under the custody of the law. The law was the fold. For example, if you visit the ranch country, you will discover that the sheep do not stay in the fold most of the time. Most of the year the sheep stay in the pasture. The pasture is the permanent place for them to stay, but the sheepfold is merely a temporary place. Only when the pasture is not ready will the sheep be kept in the fold. The fold is used temporarily to keep and protect the sheep until the pasture is ready. This illustrates that Christ is the pasture, the permanent place for the Lord&rsquo;s children to stay. But before Christ came, God prepared the law as the sheepfold to keep and confine His chosen people temporarily.</p><p>However, when the Lord came, the Jewish religion had utilized the law to form Judaism. Judaism had become the sheepfold. Before the blind man was healed by the Lord, he was one of the sheep confined in Judaism. When he was cast out of the synagogue, he was actually driven out of Judaism. Therefore, he was put out of the fold. Formerly, he had been one of the sheep in the fold; now, he was cast out of the fold of Judaism.</p>
