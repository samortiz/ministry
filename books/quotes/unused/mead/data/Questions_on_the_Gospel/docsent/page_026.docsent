   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION SEVENTEEN CONCERNING GALATIANS 3:21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Can Galatians 3:21 be read as follows: "Is then the law against the promises of God?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Absolutely not!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For if a law had been given which was able to give righteousness, life would have indeed been of law"?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Is it wrong to render it this way?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If so, where is the error?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Galatians 3:21 correctly says, "Is then the law against the promises of God?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Absolutely not!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For if a law had been given which was able to give life, righteousness would have indeed been of law."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The error in the question is the reversal of "life" and "righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to understand what Paul meant.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul said that the law and the promises of God are not opposed to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Galatians thought that the promises came after the law; Paul proved that the promises were made before the law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God made the promises to Abraham and then gave the law later.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In fact, God made the promises to Abraham four hundred and thirty years before He gave the law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we must realize that God gave the law four hundred and thirty years after He gave the promises to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Among Christians there is the mistaken concept that God had to save man by grace because He failed to achieve His purpose through the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, this was not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's promise to Abraham did not depend on Abraham's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Abraham received the promise only by believing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The reason God gave the law to the children of Israel was because they failed to realize the preciousness of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The purpose for giving them the law was to make them realize that they were sinful in violating the law, so that they would then treasure God's promises.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But, even after God gave man the law, He continued to save man by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The law causes man to know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only after a man knows himself does he treasure grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a person is hungry, he naturally wants to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, if he does not want to eat, he may need to have his appetite stimulated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same way, the law leads man to the point where he realizes the need for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What Galatians 3:21 means is that if the law could have given life to man, it could also have given righteousness to man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Does the law give life or righteousness first?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do Christians gain life first or righteousness first?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the main point that Paul argued in Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul said that if the law could give us life, it also could give us righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In our salvation, we obtain righteousness first and then life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Does a man perish because he has committed sins?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Does committing sins or perishing come first?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Obviously, committing sins comes first and perishing follows.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How then can a man be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is saved by righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Does righteousness or life come first?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Obviously, righteousness comes first and life follows.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can verify this by the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Romans 5:17 says, "Much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This verse says righteousness comes first and reigning in life later.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 21 says, "So also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is another verse that says righteousness comes first and eternal life later.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Romans 8:10 says, "The spirit is life because of righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is yet another verse that says righteousness comes first and life later.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to be clear that the reason we do not have life is because we do not have righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to the righteousness of God, whoever is without righteousness should be punished and should die.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the Lord Jesus came, He did not first resurrect and then die for us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He died first, and then He was resurrected for us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we believe in Him, we receive the righteousness attained by Him; then this righteousness becomes our life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The spirit is life because of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord Jesus died and resurrected for us so that we might have life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord Jesus died, and according to God's righteousness, God must forgive man because the price has been paid and the righteous requirement of God has been satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our salvation is based on the righteousness attained by Christ, which renders it impossible for God not to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What Paul meant was, "If the law could have given life, I would also have to say that the law could give righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But I did not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Righteousness is manifested apart from the law, it is not of the law."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In spite of this, God still saves man according to the principle of the law, for the law states that only those who are righteous can gain life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Grace gives man righteousness and then life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, the promise of God is not opposed to the law.</S>
