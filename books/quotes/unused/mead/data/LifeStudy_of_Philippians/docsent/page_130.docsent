   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR THE WORD OF GOD BEING THE EMBODIMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE LIVING GOD Scripture Reading: Phil 2:13, 16a; John 1:1-2, 14; 6:63; Heb 1:1-2; 2 Tim 3:15; Acts 6:7; 12:24; 19:20</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible reveals God s doings, His deeds and activities.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, according to His plan, He created the universe and all things in it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God s deeds also include incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, descending as the Spirit, and, in the future, Christ s second coming, the kingdom, and the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God is by no means inactive.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the contrary, He has accomplished a great many things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If it were not for God s activity in creation, the universe would not have come into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The universe came out of God s activity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Incarnation is an even more impressive matter than creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through incarnation God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a man, Christ accomplished the work of redemption, dying on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In His resurrection He brought His humanity into God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE GOD-CHILD AND THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christians often say that the Son of God was incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This, of course, is true.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, John 1:14 does not say that the Son of God became flesh; it says, The Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John 1:1 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This Word, according to verse 14, became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that God Himself became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First, the Word became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then in resurrection Christ, the last Adam in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In John 1:14 and 1 Corinthians 15:45 we have two important uses of the word became: the Word became flesh, and the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, Christ became a man in order to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this, He died on the cross and was buried.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our God today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God has passed through a marvelous process.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He became a man by being born of a virgin in a manger.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this reason, Isaiah 9:6 declares that unto us a child is born and that this child is called the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That child born of a virgin was the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that the mighty God actually became a child.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do you realize that one day our God became a child?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The unique God, the only God in the universe, became a child!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may even speak of this child as the God-child.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of course, this term is not found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, the fact of God becoming a child is clearly revealed in Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To speak of the God-child is not heresy; it is a divine fact.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are considering two crucial times the word became is used.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first is that the Word became flesh, God became a child born in a manger.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As we have indicated, the second crucial time the word became is used is in 1 Corinthians 15:45, where we are told that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Who was this last Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No doubt the last Adam was the man Christ Jesus, God incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Through resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As Christians we all must recognize that the Word, which was God, became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The very God actually became a child.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We also must recognize that Christ, after His crucifixion and in resurrection, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some Christians, however, oppose this teaching and say that it is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They ask how Christ, the second of the Trinity, could be the Spirit, who is the third of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But according to 1 Corinthians 15:45, Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Is not the life-giving Spirit here the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To deny this is to hold the heretical view that there are two life-giving Spirits.</S>
