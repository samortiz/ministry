   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUILDING UP THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST Needing Christ as the Head</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To build up the Body of Christ, we need Christ as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A body must have a head, and Christ is the Head of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ s being the Head is an indication of His victory and of His passing through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the cross the Lord destroyed him who has the might of death, that is, the devil Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord then entered into Hades and overcame death by coming out of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then He ascended into the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through the victory of His death and resurrection and through the exaltation in His ascension, Christ led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men Eph 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even though we were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world 1:4 , when man fell, he became a captive of Satan through sin and death 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, God did not abandon us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was incarnated, and He passed through death, resurrection, and ascension to solve the problem of sin, to destroy Satan and death, and to deliver us from the authority of Satan so that we could sit with Him in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We were redeemed and regenerated, and we obtained the life of God and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now we are being transformed and are growing in life to be gifts to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are examples of gifted members 4:8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord gave these gifted members to His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He did this in the age of the apostles, and He continues to give gifted ones to His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord made every believer a gift to His Body, and He made some believers apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers so that they can be given to the church for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Needing the Gifts</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The gifts the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers are produced by the Head for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The work of the gifts is not to build up the Body of Christ directly; rather, their work is to perfect the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ v. 12 . Even though these four groups of people work in different ways, they all have one goal the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The gifts do not build up the Body of Christ directly; instead, they perfect the saints to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the old and traditional way of Christianity the pastors, the clergy, give sermons and do the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only the clergy build up the church; the congregation does not build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The God-ordained way is different.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the God-ordained way the church is not built up directly by a small group of gifted believers; instead, the gifts perfect the saints so that everyone can do what the gifts do.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everyone can do the work of the ministry, which is to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The main thing accomplished in the new way is the perfecting of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the old way the saints were only required to listen to messages in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We practiced this for decades, but we did not perfect many saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is as if we conducted classes to spiritually educate the saints for decades, but no one graduated, and we did not produce many teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was, therefore, difficult for the church to increase and spread.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This situation proves that there is a problem with our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must change and take the new way in order to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although the gifts work in different ways, the goal of their work is the perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The apostles do three things: they preach the gospel in new areas to lead people to salvation, they establish churches, and they define and expound the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The apostles, however, also need to perfect other believers to do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This also applies to the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They should not merely speak for God and speak forth God; they should also perfect others to be prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We also need the evangelists to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The evangelists need to know how to lead the saints, who are learning to preach the gospel by knocking on doors, to go into the midst of wolves and find the sons of peace cf.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Luke 10:3, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The brothers and sisters need to be perfected in all these areas.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In addition, we need the shepherds and teachers to care for people by shepherding and teaching the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They also need to perfect the saints to be able to shepherd and teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, the new way allows the gifts in the church to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They perfect the saints to preach the gospel and lead people to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They also perfect the saints to establish meetings in the homes of the new ones and to lead the new ones to testify for the Lord, to read the Lord s Word, and to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The saints also learn to care for one another, to nourish one another, and to function organically.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are willing to humbly learn and faithfully exercise to do these things according to the way revealed in the Bible, we will be able to build up the Body that God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In other words, all the gifts the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers must lead and perfect the saints to do these four things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then there will be apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers among the saints, and the church will receive a great blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Needing the Perfected Members</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For the building up of the Body of Christ, all the perfected members need to hold to truth in love Eph 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other words, we need to hold God, Christ, the Spirit, life, and the truth, the things that are true.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we hold to truth in love, we will grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We will also have something that is out from the Head for the building up of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every joint will be of the rich supply, and each one part will operate according to its measure so that the entire Body is joined and knit together.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This causes the Body of Christ to grow up and expand to build up itself in love v. 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When all the members are perfected to grow in life and to function organically, they will be joined together and built up as one Body, and the Lord will have an organic Body for His complete expression.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That will be a glorious and blessed situation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>May all the saints clearly see this vision and pray for this vision so that they become blessed people in the God-ordained way, people who manifest their organic function and are being built up in the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we have this desire, we will enter into many things, and we will learn to pray, to speak for the Lord, to care for other believers, and to perfect them to do what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In addition, some saints will learn how to preach the gospel in new places, establish churches, and rightly expound the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is how the believers who take the God-ordained way will function.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They will be able to speak for the Lord, to preach the gospel, and to shepherd and teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They will also be able to perfect others to do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The church will spread, and the Lord will obtain a built-up organic Body.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>May we all have a clear seeing of the goal of the new way, and may we labor with one heart to diligently learn to walk on the God-ordained way.</S>
