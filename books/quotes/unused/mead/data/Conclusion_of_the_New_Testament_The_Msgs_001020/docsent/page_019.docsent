   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>11.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Abba Father of the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In His person God is Abba Father of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Abba" is an Aramaic word, thus a Hebrew word, and "Father" is the translation of the Greek word pater.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such a term was first used by the Lord Jesus in Gethsemane while praying to the Father Mark 14:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The combination of the Hebrew title with the Greek expresses a stronger affection in crying to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such an affectionate cry implies an intimate relationship in life between a genuine son and a begetting father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Father is the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is indicated by the Lord's word in John 5:26: "The Father has life in Himself."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the New Testament, especially in the Gospel of John, the Father denotes the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even in a human family the father is the source of the life of that family.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the father of a family is the very source and origin of life, so the name Father reveals the Father as the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Father, the source of life, is for propagation and multiplication of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Father's life is for propagation and multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of the Father, who is the source of life, and who is for the propagation and multiplication of life, many sons are born for His expression John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The name Father is very much related to the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without having the divine life, God could not be the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How is it possible for a man to be a father?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is possible only by life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A father is a producer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A father produces not by manufacturing but by begetting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A father has a begetting life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Likewise, the Father has begotten us through His life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whenever we call Him Father, we need to understand that this title is realized by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without His life, the name Father is merely an empty term, without content or reality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is the revelation behind the name Father?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Father is the name for the relationship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I say, "Abba Father," I indicate that I have His life and that I was born of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the New Testament God is revealed as the Father who regenerates many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is the source of life;</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>hence, He is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is His intention to bring forth many sons by regenerating them with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the book of Matthew the Lord taught His disciples to call God Father, saying, "Our Father who is in the heavens" 6:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whenever we call God our Father, we should realize that He is our genuine Father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is not our father-in-law, and we are not His adopted children.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our Father is our Father in life, our genuine Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We call Him Father because we were born of Him and have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the two terms "Abba" and "Father" are put together, the result is a deep, sweet sense, a sense that is exquisitely intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"Abba, Father" is sweetness intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, the sense we have when calling in this way is very sweet and intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although the Spirit of sonship has come into our spirit, the Spirit cries in our hearts, "Abba, Father."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This indicates that our relationship with our Father in the sonship is sweet and intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, when a son calls his father "daddy," there may be a sweet and intimate sense deep within him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, the sense is not the same if he tries to say the same thing to his father-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The reason is that with the father-in-law there is no relationship in life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How sweet it is when little children, enjoying a relationship in life with their fathers, tenderly say, "daddy."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In like manner, how tender and sweet it is to call God, "Abba, Father!"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Such an intimate calling involves our heart as well as our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Spirit of sonship in our spirit cries, "Abba, Father," from our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This proves that we have a genuine, bona fide relationship in life with our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are His real sons, His genuine sons, and He is our genuine Father.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>12.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Only God</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the New Testament God is clearly revealed as being the only God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>First Timothy 1:17 says, "Now to the King of the ages, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory unto the ages of the ages, Amen!"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Romans 16:27 Paul declares, "To the only wise God through Jesus Christ be the glory forever and ever!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Jude 25 says that God our Savior is the only God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Furthermore, in 1 Corinthians 8:4 and 6 Paul says that "there is no God but one" and that "to us there is one God, the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our God is uniquely one; He is utterly distinct from the many false gods.</S>
