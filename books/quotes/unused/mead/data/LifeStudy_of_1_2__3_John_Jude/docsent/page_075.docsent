   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INWARD TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 27 John says, And as for you, the anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I would call your attention to the pronouns Him used twice and His.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As was the case in verse 25, these pronouns refer to both the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This use of singular pronouns proves strongly that the Son and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is significant that in these verses the pronoun they is not used with respect to the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, John uses singular pronouns to refer to both the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, the expression in the Son and in the Father v. 24 points to a distinction between the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there were no distinction, there would be no need for John to say, abide both in the Son and in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although there is a distinction between the Son and the Father, there is no separation, because the Father and the Son are one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore the Father and the Son are distinct but inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 27 John says, You have no need that anyone should teach you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Concerning the indwelling of the Divine Trinity John 14:17, 23 , we do not need anyone to teach us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By the anointing of the all-inclusive compound Spirit, who is the composition of the Divine Trinity, we know and enjoy the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as our life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to verse 27, the anointing of the all-inclusive compound life-giving Spirit teaches us concerning all things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not an outward teaching by words, but an inward teaching by the anointing through our inner spiritual consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This teaching by the anointing adds the divine elements of the Trinity, which are the elements of the anointing compound Spirit, into our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is like the repeated painting of some article: the paint not only gives color; its elements are also added to the thing painted, coat upon coat.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is in this way that the Triune God is transfused, infused, and added into all the inward parts of our being so that our inner man may grow in the divine life with the divine elements.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the context, all things refers to all things concerning the Person of Christ related to the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The teaching of the anointing concerning these things keeps us that we may abide in Him the Divine Trinity , that is, in the Son and in the Father v. 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this verse John also says that the anointing is true.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The anointing within us of the compound Spirit as the composition of the Triune God who is true 5:20 , is a reality, not a falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This can be proved by our actual and practical experience in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John concludes verse 27 with an exhortation to abide in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Greek word translated abide is meno, a word that means to stay in a given place, state, relation, or expectancy ; hence, abide, remain, and dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To abide in Him is to abide in the Son and in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is to remain and dwell in the Lord John 15:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is also to abide in the fellowship of the divine life and to walk in the divine light 1 John 1:2-3, 6-7 , that is, to abide in the divine light 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should practice this abiding according to the teaching of the all-inclusive anointing so that our fellowship with God 1:3, 6 may be maintained.</S>
