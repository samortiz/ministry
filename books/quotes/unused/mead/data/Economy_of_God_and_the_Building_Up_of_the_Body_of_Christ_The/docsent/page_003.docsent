   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, our hearts are rejoicing, and our spirits are praising.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You are the Lord of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We look to You for the meeting tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>May You visit every one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We praise You that whenever You gather us together into Your name, You speak to us and give grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Speak to us again tonight, and be gracious to us again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>May everyone receive the portion reserved for him, and may everyone touch You and gain You.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>May You speak in our speaking and visit every one of us in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>May You even glorify Your own name and bind Your enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, for the sake of Your testimony, Your church, and Your recovery in Korea today, grant us Your blessing in many ways that You may gain the ground and have Your way in this land that this whole nation would be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Your mighty name we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this conference we have received the burden from the Lord to consider the matter of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word economy in Greek means house law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It refers to the household management or household administration and is understood to mean an administrative arrangement, a plan, an intention, or a proposal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From this wonderful term we can see that the God we believe in and whom we serve is a God of purpose, plan, move, and activity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is full of matters related to His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even before the foundation of the earth, He in Christ made a plan and a decision, that is, an arrangement and a proposal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, He has set forth an economy for the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Superficially, it seems the Old Testament is a record of stories of individuals, a history of the nation of Israel, plus some songs, proverbs, and prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although you cannot find the word economy there, yet God's economy is there.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we come to the New Testament, especially when we come to the Epistles of the Apostle Paul, the one who received the highest and the greatest revelation, we find that he repeatedly used the term economy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Ephesians 1 he said that God, according to His good pleasure, has an economy for the ages, which is to head up all things in Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In chapter three he told us again that God is accomplishing this through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church is the highest means whereby God heads up all things under the authority of Christ for the fulfillment of His economy vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The entire book of Ephesians shows us how God accomplishes His economy through the church by the Triune God working Himself into tripartite men whom He created so that He could be their life, life element, and life sphere to constitute them the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through the church, God will head up all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By the time we come to 1 Timothy 1, we see Paul telling his co-worker Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge people not to teach things other than God's economy vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This shows us that any doctrine that causes the saints to deviate from the central lane and ultimate goal of God's economy is a different teaching and is a deception of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to emphasize God's economy again and again, so that it becomes the central lane and ultimate goal for our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE BASIC THOUGHT CONCERNING GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our God is a unique God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is the Lord of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For His economy, however, there is a distinction of three.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the three Persons, or three hypostases of the one God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the entering in. In eternity past, He was the Father, hidden in light, unapproachable by man, being invisible and untouchable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One day, in time, He put on human flesh and came among men, manifesting Himself visibly before men.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the Son, who was called Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When He came, He did not come by Himself, leaving the Father behind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, He came from the Father and with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>While He was living and moving on earth, the Holy Father was with Him, and the Holy Spirit was leading Him in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, the whole Triune God was in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When man sees Jesus he sees the Son, and he who has the Son has the Father, and he who has the Father has the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This shows us that the Father is the source and that the Son is the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then the Son went to the cross to die there.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After that He entered into resurrection, and the Spirit was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, the Spirit is the realization of the Son and is also the entering in of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This Spirit enters into all those who believe in the Lord and becomes their life, their life supply, and their everything.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this way, the Triune God is joined to man and even mingles with man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the story on God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our God is triune.</S>
