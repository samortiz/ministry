   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today we had a meeting with the leader of the Jesus Family and a few brothers from the Assembly of God and the Lutheran Church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some professors from the United Seminary also came to the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We had good fellowship.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After returning from Shanghai, I realized that the Lord has lit the gospel fire in the villages, especially in Dongxiang, Anyang.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every day many people repent and receive the Lord in some villages, and they are all clearly saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord has given us grace in our environment, so the brothers' hearts are filled with praise and thanks, and they are full of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The newly saved brothers are all burning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They are very fresh and living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, I feel more and more deeply that we need some older brothers to come give us much help.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With regard to the matter of unity, I have been asking the Lord to open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Most of the people in the denominations here have already turned to come this way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The rest are not clearly saved, and it is very difficult to talk with them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is a real problem knowing whether or not they will accept the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>May the Lord have mercy on them.</S>
