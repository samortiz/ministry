<h2 class=head2>Ham Exposing His Father’s Failure</h2><p>Look at the behavior of Ham, the son of Noah. When he saw the nakedness of his father, he went out to tell Shem and Japheth (9:20-22). A person who is not submissive in heart always likes to see authority in failure. Ham found the opportunity to expose his father’s mistakes. This proves that he was one who did not submit to his father’s authority. Previously, he submitted through pressure. When he saw his father’s mistake, he exposed it to his two brothers. Many brothers criticize others and delight in tearing them down because of a lack of love (1 Cor. 13:4-5). With Ham there was not just a lack of love, but a lack of submission. It was a manifestation of rebellion.<h2 class=head2>Miriam and Aaron’s Reviling of Moses</h2><p>In Numbers 12 Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses. They mixed up family affairs with the work. In God’s calling Moses was singled out; Miriam and Aaron were only the helpers. This was God’s decision. The disobedience of these two was also manifested in words. If we know authority, many mouths will be shut and many problems will be prevented. Once we meet authority, many natural problems are gone. Miriam’s words did not seem to be an overstepping. She only said, “Has Jehovah indeed spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us also?” (v. 2). But God understood that as reviling (v. 8). Perhaps there were many words which they had not spoken. Perhaps what was revealed was only the tip of the iceberg, a tenth of all that was there. Perhaps ninety percent was still hidden. As long as there is a spirit of rebellion in man, God will detect it no matter how many nice words he speaks. Rebellion is manifested in words. A rebellious word speaks of rebellion no matter whether it is strong or weak.<h2 class=head2>The Company of Korah Attacking Moses</h2><p>In Numbers 16 when the company of Korah and the 250 leaders rebelled, the manifestation was all the more in words. Whatever they had in their heart they spoke. They even broke out in open rebuke. Although Miriam reviled, she did so in a reserved way, and as such there was still the possibility of recovery. But the company of Korah had no restraint. Everything spilled over like a flood. Even rebellion has degrees. Some have more of a sense of shame, and they can be recovered. But those who have shaken off all restraints, who are completely unchecked, open the gates of Hades for themselves, and Hades swallows them up. Not only did the company of Korah speak in an evil way; they attacked in an open way. It was so serious that Moses had to fall on his face. How serious were such words: You take too much upon you. Why are you lifting yourselves up above the congregation of the Lord? We only recognize Jehovah in our midst. The whole congregation is holy. We do not recognize your authority. You are taking too much upon yourselves. Here we see that whoever listens only to God’s direct authority, but refuses His deputy authority, is in the principle of rebellion.<p>If a man submits to authority, surely he will restrict his mouth. He will not be careless. In Acts 23 Paul was being tried. As an apostle and prophet he spoke in the position of a prophet to Ananias the high priest: “God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall” (v. 3). But at the same time Paul was a Jew. When he heard that Ananias was the high priest, he immediately softened and said, “’You shall not speak evilly of the ruler of your people’” (v. 5). How careful he was in his words, and how much he restricted his mouth.
