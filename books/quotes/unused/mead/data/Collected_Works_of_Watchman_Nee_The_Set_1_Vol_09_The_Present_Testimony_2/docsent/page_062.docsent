   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Kuling, Kiukiang, there was a brother who was an electrician.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Originally he was a nominal Christian who was not even clear about his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He did not know if he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once after I studied the Bible with him, he became clear that he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have known him for five or six years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This year while I was speaking on the experience of the Holy Spirit, to my surprise, he told me that he had experienced what I was speaking about even though he had never read this verse before.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He said that he had a "steward" within him this is what he called the Holy Spirit which tells him if something is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was half illiterate.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When he first believed in the Lord, he could hardly read a few words of a verse.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet he had the Holy Spirit within him leading him, instructing him, and being a steward to him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a living example.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Should this not be the experience of every Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many times, we do not know what we should do concerning the things that we encounter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet many times, before we act, we know that something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our conscience is not telling us this; the conscience only works after something wrong is done.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But, in this case, we know that something is wrong because the law of God tells us within.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes when we are talking to someone and excited concerning what we are talking about, something within stops us and forbids us to say some further words which may not even be unscriptural or morally corrupting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But we just feel that something within us is giving us a pinch and telling us not to say anything more.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not know why.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we take care of this and obey it, we will have the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Otherwise, when the words come out, our conscience will tell us that we have done wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Subconsciously, it will stop us and issue a warning to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let me tell you another story.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A certain Christian was an active believer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He loved to offer hospitality to other believers and Christian workers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He always did his best to either invite the preachers that he met to meals or to give money to them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once, a pastor who graduated from an American school was preaching in his chapel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was preaching the social gospel and not preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After the meeting the brother wanted to go over to greet the pastor and talk to him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But he felt something was nagging at him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He hesitated for a while and did not walk forward.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Finally he decided to forget about the pastor and just went home.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brothers and sisters, this is the law written within us; it is not the law written on a tablet of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Later this brother asked me if he could associate himself with the pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I did not tell him my opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead I only quoted Galatians 1:8, which says that if any man preaches another gospel that is different from ours, he should be accursed a strong word of rebuke in Greek .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only did Paul say this, even John said the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John was called the apostle of love.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Love should make a person foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yet John said that if any man does not preach this teaching, we should not receive him into our house and should not greet him 2 John 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The brother then said, "Now I know that the leading within me and the law within me were right."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brothers and sisters, the Holy Spirit inspired men to write the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Holy Spirit also gives us the inspirations within.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we would be faithful and honest to follow the inner leading, God will surely lead us on.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Sometimes we can be mistaken through our prejudice.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am not telling you to not pay attention to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am telling you to link the Bible with the inner leading and judge what we do as right or wrong according to this way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This does not mean that the Holy Spirit is not leading believers today, nor does it mean that the believers have no leading from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The pitiful thing is that they are not willing to be led by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many read the Bible like reading a dead book.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Reading the Bible to them is like memorizing the Ten Commandments, because they cannot see any leading of the Holy Spirit there.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I do not despise the Bible at all; I am very concerned that the leading of the Holy Spirit must match the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yet it is a bad phenomenon today that many people seem to have no leading apart from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They are following the Lord without any speaking from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The reason many brothers and sisters cannot receive new truths is that they have refused and rejected the leading of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As a result, God puts aside the light.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God has placed the law within us, and He is constantly testifying to the truths.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we reject these testimonies, day by day we will find ourselves more and more in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if we are willing to be led, day by day we will become clearer and clearer.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Someone has said that the enlightening of the Holy Spirit is the light, while our inner being is the glass.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If the glass is not cleaned, it will become more and more darkened and receive less and less of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The reason why many people cannot receive truths is that they have rejected the truths once before.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many people cannot believe in the truths, because they have once refused the truths.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Holy Spirit is responsible within us to show what is and what is not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>THE BASIC DISTINCTION IN THE LEADING OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Everything from man, the world, Satan, or the flesh comes from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Everything from God and the Holy Spirit comes from the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we encounter something and this thing arises from our head and occupies very little weight, it must be from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If it is God's leading, deeper than feeling, it is always from the inside and is a sensation that cannot be removed or ignored.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we have a feeble mind, we may easily forget the verses we have memorized.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we are tired, we may be unable to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Sometimes when we are faced with some situation on the street, we may not have time to ask for the advice of others and consult a teaching from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But within us there is a living law leading us, whose leading is spontaneously compatible with the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This can be confirmed by the experience of many.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we repeatedly follow God's leading, which comes from the inward law within us, we will gradually be clear about the leading which comes from God's law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If God has made a covenant to put the law within us and to lead us, we can take hold of God's covenant and say to God: "I have Your law within me.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Therefore, I will surely know Your will."</S>
