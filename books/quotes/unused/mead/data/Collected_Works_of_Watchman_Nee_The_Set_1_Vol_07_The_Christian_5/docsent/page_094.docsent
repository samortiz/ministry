   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ACTS 18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 5:"And when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, solemnly testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Compare this verse with 17:16: "And while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld that the city was full of idols."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Wherever a believer is, among other believers or by himself, he should have the same earnestness for the salvation of others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 7:"And he left there and went into the house of one named Titius Justus, one who worshipped God, whose house was next to the synagogue."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are not many who worship God whose homes are close to the synagogue.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 8:"And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with his whole household; and many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Believe and be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>ACTS 19</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 2:"And he said to them, Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And they said to him, On the contrary, we did not even hear whether there is a Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This does not mean that they did not have the Holy Spirit, for as soon as they had believed, they had received the Holy Spirit already see Rom 8:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is saying that they had not received the Holy Spirit in the way that it was received on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1 JOHN 5</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 3:"For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our faith has much to do with our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>2 JOHN</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 11:"For he who says to him, Rejoice, shares in his evil works."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christians should not have anything to do with those who preach heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>REVELATION 4</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 1:"After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you the things that must take place after these things."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many people are no longer able to hear God's first voice to them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"The things that must take place after these things."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, all the things after chapter four are prophecies, and they are not yet fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>REVELATION 5</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 3:"And no one in heaven nor on the earth nor under the earth was able to open the scroll or look into it."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The angels in heaven, the human beings on earth, and the demons under the earth have all been defeated!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only the Lamb is victorious as God in heaven, man on earth, and among the dead ones in Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is Head over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>NUMBERS 19</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 2:"This is the statute of the law which Jehovah has commanded, saying, Tell the sons of Israel to bring you a red heifer without blemish, in which there is no defect, and upon which a yoke has never come."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The ashes of the red heifer signifies the cleansing away of the sins of those who have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This signifies the aspect of the daily cleansing of the believers by the precious blood of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 13:"Whoever touches a dead person, the body of any man who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of Jehovah, and that person shall be cut off from Israel; because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is still on him."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The ashes v. 9 for the purification denote the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The living water denotes the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Holy Spirit applies the work of the cross on the sinning believers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 20:"But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself, that person shall be cut off from the midst of the congregation, for he has defiled the sanctuary of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The water for impurity has not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Believers should not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If unfortunately they do sin, they should confess their sins and ask for the cleansing of the Lord's precious blood 1 John 1:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Otherwise, they "shall be cut off from the midst of the congregation."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This does not mean eternal perdition because the effect of the blood of the Passover lamb is still with them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This only means that they will be removed from the midst of the congregation of God's holy people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The eternal life which they have received through grace still remains, but they have lost their fellowship with God, their communion with the saints, and their reward as God's people.</S>
