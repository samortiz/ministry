   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we sincerely desire to take Christ as our life and as our person, we must let go of our ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, we should not have an ordinance about hair styles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, we should contact the Lord concerning this and pray, Lord Jesus, I am one of Your members.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What kind of haircut do You want to have?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I don t care for any way of worship or living, and I am not concerned about customs or habits.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, I only care that You be my life and my person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Spontaneously the living Lord Jesus will let you know how you should cut your hair.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then you simply act according to what He shows you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is not an ordinance; it is a practical experience of taking Christ as your person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our need today is not doctrinal knowledge, but the practical and daily experience of taking Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1970 we first began to speak of the church as the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that time we pointed out that in order to have the church in the aspect of the new man, we need to take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since that time, there has been much talk about the new man and about taking Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even some good hymns have been written along this line.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But according to my observation, there is little reality among us of actually taking Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not be satisfied if others regard us as good people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must be those who take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>May we all go to the Lord and have a thorough transaction with Him concerning all the details of our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>RECEIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In many respects we are still quite religious.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even the way we preach the gospel and help others to be saved may be carried out in a religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may tell people that they are sinful and that Christ died on the cross for their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may go on to say that if they believe in Him, they will be forgiven, justified, saved, and made ready for heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In a sense such gospel preaching is good, fundamental, and even scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, it may be religious.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The important factor in the preaching of the gospel is to help people open to the Lord Jesus and take Him into them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even if a person has no concept of forgiveness, justification, or heaven, he will have the reality of all these if he takes Christ into him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we have Christ, we have forgiveness, redemption, justification, salvation, and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s purpose is not simply to forgive our sins, to justify us, and then to carry us away to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His intention is to work Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before the foundation of the world, He chose us in Christ and put a mark on us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then, in time, He called us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When God called us, His desire was that we focus our attention not on forgiveness or justification, but on receiving His dear Son into us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as Christ is living in us, we shall have no problem with forgiveness, justification, salvation, or heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only by having Christ in us can we become part of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is Christ alone who constitutes us a part of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this, forgiveness, justification, and sanctification are not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>May the Lord grant that we may see that we have not only been forgiven, justified, saved, and sanctified, but also re-created in Christ and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because I have had experience with various kinds of Christianity, including fundamental, Pentecostal, and inner life Christianity, I am familiar with many different religious practices.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I can testify that today I am not for any practice, but only for taking Christ as my person in a genuine and living way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>My desire is to help others receive and experience the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is not a form, religion, regulation, ordinance, or practice He is the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our need is simply to open to Him and to take Him into us.</S>
