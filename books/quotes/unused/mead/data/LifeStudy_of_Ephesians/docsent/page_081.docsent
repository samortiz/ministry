   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST HIMSELF BEING THE CORNERSTONE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 20 reveals that in God s building Christ is the cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here Christ is referred to, not as the foundation Isa 28:16 , but as the cornerstone, because the main concern here is not the foundation but the cornerstone that joins together the two main walls: the wall of the Jewish believers and the wall of the Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Jewish builders rejected Christ, they rejected Him as the cornerstone Acts 4:11; 1 Pet 2:7 , which joins the Gentiles to them for the building of God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Matthew 21 the Lord Jesus indicated, in a figurative way, that the Pharisees would reject Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 42 says, Have you never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the cornerstone; this was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By this word the Lord revealed that after His resurrection He would become the cornerstone to join the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Referring to Christ, Peter said to the religionists in Acts 4:11 and 12, This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Peter s word shows that salvation implies building.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s intention in saving us is not to bring us into the heavens; rather, it is to join us to the Jews so that He may have His building.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many unbelieving Jews despise the Lord Jesus because they do not want to be joined to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as a Jew does not believe in Christ, he may be separated from the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But as soon as such a Jew believes in Him, he is joined by Christ, the cornerstone, to the Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whether we are Jews or Gentiles, we have been saved in order to be joined together in Christ for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>GROWING INTO A HOLY TEMPLE A. In Christ</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 21 says, In Whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here we see that in Christ, who is the cornerstone, all the building, including both Jewish and Gentile believers, is fitted together and is growing into a holy temple.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>B. Growing</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since the building is a living one 1 Pet 2:5 , it is growing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It grows into a holy temple.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The actual building of the church as the house of God is by the growth in life of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today the church is growing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, it is not growing in our natural life, but in the divine life, the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 21 also says that all the building is fitted together.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word fitted means being made suitable for the condition and situation of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>C. Into a Holy Temple</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As verse 21 points out, all the building is growing into a holy temple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Greek word rendered temple means the sanctuary, the inner part of the whole temple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is in the Lord that the building is growing into a holy temple.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that the entire building of God s house as His sanctuary is in Christ the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At this point I would like to ask you a question: Has the temple of God in the universe been completed?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The fact that the temple is still growing indicates that, from our point of view at least, the temple of God is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 21 does not say that all the building has grown into a holy temple; it says that all the building is growing into a holy temple.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The phrase all the building refers to the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you consider the past nineteen centuries of church history, you may find it difficult to see the growth of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But do not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The purpose of God cannot be thwarted.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The universal building is still growing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Matthew 16 the Lord Jesus prophesied that He would build His church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The building in Matthew 16:18 is the very building in Ephesians 2:21.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although the growth of the building is slow and hardly noticeable, it is nonetheless taking place.</S>
