<p>Prayer: Lord, we extol You again. Essentially You are the second One of the Trinity, yet economically You first became flesh, then You became the life-giving Spirit, and now You are the intensified sevenfold Spirit. We thank You that, essentially, You have never changed. From eternity to eternity You remain the same. We thank You also that, economically, You have changed. You changed by becoming flesh. Then as the last Adam in the flesh You changed again by becoming the life-giving Spirit. As the life-giving Spirit You changed again, and now You are the sevenfold intensified Spirit. We praise You for what You did to accomplish God&rsquo;s judicial redemption. We praise You for what You are doing to accomplish God&rsquo;s salvation organically and for what You are doing in Your intensification to carry out God&rsquo;s economy. How we worship You! Lord, we ask You to teach us concerning all these things. We believe that this is Your complete and perfect theology. Lord, save Your people so that they may be transformed and become the precious materials&mdash;gold, silver, and precious stones&mdash;and not remain in a situation of wood, grass, and stubble. Lord, we fear and tremble, fearing that we might be in the second category. Lord, we want to be in the first category, having all the precious, transformed materials. We pray that You will cover us. Lord, You are the Alpha and Omega. You have given us a good beginning, and now we ask You to give us a good conclusion. Amen.</p><p>The secret of the intensified work of God&rsquo;s organic salvation is something in addition to God&rsquo;s organic salvation. As we have seen, God&rsquo;s organic salvation is of eight sections, from regeneration through glorification. However, in order for God&rsquo;s economy to be completed and consummated, that is, for God to have the New Jerusalem, something further is needed. After His resurrection and in His heavenly ministry, the Lord Jesus established many churches, but not long afterward the churches became degraded. This made it necessary for Christ, who had become the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, to intensify Himself to be the sevenfold intensified Spirit. This is clearly revealed in the book of Revelation (1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6).</p> <h2 class="head1">I. THE THREE SECTIONS OF CHRIST&rsquo;S MINISTRY</h2><p>Christians often say that Christ&rsquo;s ministry is of two parts or sections&mdash;His earthly ministry and His heavenly ministry. However, Christ&rsquo;s ministry is actually of three sections. The third section of His ministry is the sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry. This ministry is still His heavenly ministry, but it is a heavenly ministry that has been intensified sevenfold.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The First Section</h2><p>The first section of Christ&rsquo;s ministry was His earthly ministry. This ministry was accomplished by Him judicially in the flesh from His incarnation to His death. In His flesh He died for us according to the righteous requirements of God&rsquo;s law.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Second Section</h2><p>The second section of Christ&rsquo;s ministry is His heavenly ministry. This ministry is carried out by Him as the life-giving Spirit, organically in the mystical realm, from His resurrection to the end of the millennium. Christ&rsquo;s ministry in this section is altogether organic, for it is carried out by Him in His resurrection life.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Third Section</h2><p>The third section of Christ&rsquo;s ministry is His sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry. This ministry is carried out by Him as the sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit, sevenfold intensified organically in the mystical realm, from the degradation of the church to the full consummation of the New Jerusalem. Now Christ is not only the life-giving Spirit&mdash;He is the sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit carrying out His sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry. The first section of Christ&rsquo;s ministry was judicial, the second section is organic, and the third section is sevenfold intensified.</p><p>Very few Christians realize that today we should not be merely in Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry but in His sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry. We all need to be in the third section of Christ&rsquo;s ministry. Today the Lord is working not only as the life-giving Spirit but also as the sevenfold intensified Spirit. This Spirit may be compared to the shining of the sun spoken of in Isaiah 30:26, which says that in the millennium &ldquo;the light of the sun shall be sevenfold.&rdquo; Today the Spirit who is filling us and saturating us is the sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit. We all need to see this and then pray, &ldquo;Lord, I worship You that You are working in me as the sevenfold intensified Spirit.&rdquo;</p><p>In the past some have tried to argue with us, saying that Christ cannot change and quoting Hebrews 13:8, which says, &ldquo;Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, yes, even forever.&rdquo; Regarding this we would point out that Christ has not changed essentially, but He has changed economically. Essentially He is the same from eternity to eternity, but economically He has changed in three ways&mdash;by becoming flesh in His incarnation, by becoming the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection, and by intensifying Himself to be the sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit in His intensification.</p>
