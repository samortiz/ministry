<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT BEING NOT YET<br>BEFORE CHRIST'S RESURRECTION</H2><P>In the Bible there is a wonderful progression concerning the Spirit. In creation the Spirit is the Spirit of God. Then in His relationship with man He progressed to be the Spirit of Jehovah. Eventually, in the New Testament He is the Holy Spirit to sanctify humanity for Christ's incarnation. Still, this progression has gone even further.</P><P>The Spirit was not yet before Christ's resurrection, in which He was glorified. According to John 7:39, before the Lord's death and resurrection, the Spirit was not yet. There was the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Holy Spirit. The Spirit indicated by these three titles had only the element of divinity. No other elements had yet been added to the Spirit. But on the day of resurrection something new took place in the universe. Jesus was resurrected, and in resurrection He was glorified (Luke 24:26) and was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit. In this Spirit the elements of Christ's incarnation, His human living with all His human virtues, His all-inclusive death with its effectiveness, and His wonderful resurrection with its power are compounded together. This Spirit is the all-inclusive compound Spirit of the processed Triune God.</P><P>What should we do with such a Spirit? According to John 7:37-39 and 1 Corinthians 12:13, we must drink the Spirit. Today the Spirit is drinkable. Isaiah 12:3-4 says, "Therefore you will draw water with rejoicing/From the springs of salvation,/And you will say in that day,/Praise Jehovah; call upon His name!/Make His deeds known among the peoples;/Remind them that His name is exalted." These verses show that the way to drink from the springs of the Lord's salvation is to praise Him and call upon His name. When we drink Him in such a way, rivers of living water flow out of our innermost being (John 7:38). These rivers are the different aspects of the life of Jesus Christ. If we drink the Spirit, rivers of love, joy, peace, holiness, and patience will flow out to those around us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LAST ADAM BECOMING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT AS THE PNEUMATIC CHRIST IN HIS RESURRECTION</H2><P>The last Adam became the life-giving Spirit as the pneumatic Christ in His resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45b). When Christ resurrected, He became the life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit is the pneumatic Christ. On the evening of His resurrection, He breathed into His disciples and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (John 20:22). The Greek word for spirit is pneuma, which means "breath," "wind," or "air." Christ as the life-giving Spirit breathed Himself as the holy pneuma, the holy breath, the Holy Spirit, into His disciples.</P><P>Today this pneumatic Christ dwells in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). Every day we can drink Him as a wonderful drink, and moment by moment we can breathe Him in as the heavenly air. On the one hand, He supplies us with all the positive elements of the pneumatic Christ, and on the other hand, He kills all the negative elements in our being, so that we can become the testimony of Jesus.</P>
