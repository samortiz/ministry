<h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Brother Tsi-yi:</p><p>I have received each issue of The Open Door. Thank and praise the Lord. Everything is according to His good pleasure. His gospel has been preached to places never reached before because of the present environment. I am still working in Liu-Gong-Dao, Wei-Hai-Wei. There is not much turmoil in the environment because the British are here. Thank God. Although the times are hard, I do not have any difficulties (materially speaking). I must think of my fellow members who are being affected both directly and indirectly by the war. I am sending a postal wire with X dollars for meeting the needs of the brothers and sisters who are depleted through the war and X dollars to help with the cost of printing. The amount is small, but I trust the Lord does not despise it. I hope God gives more grace in leading us on the way ahead. Amen. Peace in the Lord. Greet the brothers and sisters in Hankow.</p><p>Your weak brother,<br />Lin Shien-huei<br />April 4<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Hong Kong</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>My poor health has completely recovered through the Lord's mercy and grace. I dare not say when I will go to Szechuan. Because I deeply feel there are many important lessons that I must learn, I want to spend some time to specifically wait on the Father. I want to spend more time to consider the glorified Christ. In the past the only thing I knew was to work for the Lord; I did not desire the Lord Himself. The work is important, but the Lord Himself is more important than the work. Therefore, I really pray to pay more attention to Him than to His work. If the Lord does not gain the person in the work, the work is nothing more than outward activity. The work and the church in Hong Kong are already separate according to the new principles. Thank the Lord, the brothers and sisters are led by the same Spirit to have the same view in this matter and are very much in one accord. We really give glory to God for this. Brother Chou Hung-bao came to Hong Kong on March 5. Yesterday, he and Brother Yin Tzu-lan's entire family went to K'un-ming. Brother Chen Ju-yen, Brother Stephen Kaung, senior Mrs. Nee, Mrs. Nee, Miss Lei, and the brothers and sisters have been preserved in peace by the Lord. They are well. Miss Mei Guang-yao returned to Hankow with Mrs. Luk and Brother Yang Tsun-sin in a group of six people.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Philip Luan<br />April 29</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>I moved from Shek-Kip-Mei Street to 101 Tai-Po Road, Floor 2, on the twenty-fifth of last month. Thank the Lord, this place is better for my health. Sister Huang Ro-chen and Sister Kuo Hai-jen are still working in Chungshan. Chungshan and Macao need brothers and sisters to live there for awhile.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Philip Luan<br />May 16<br />[Address omitted]</p>
