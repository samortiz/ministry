   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE CHURCH ACCORDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO THE DESIRE OF GOD S HEART</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message and in the messages following we turn to the matter of the reality and practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are not concerned with the church in doctrine or merely with the church in revelation, but with the church in reality and practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, in order to see the reality and practicality of the church, we must have a clear revelation concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to see what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am especially burdened to help those who have recently come into the church life to see what the church is and to know the church s reality and practicality in the Lord s recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everyone in the church life should be familiar with these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The term church has been damaged, polluted, and spoiled by its usage in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When many people hear the word church, they think of a cathedral or of a bungalow with a high tower and a bell.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What a shame to understand the church in this way!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church is not a material building.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some have been helped, especially by the teaching of the Brethren, to know that the church, according to the Greek word ekklesia, means the called ones meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is correct, for the church is a gathering of God s called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, this understanding of the church is much too superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church revealed in the New Testament is far more profound than this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, we must turn to the holy Word to see the revelation concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE DESIRE OF GOD S HEART</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before we do this, we need to have some fellowship regarding the fact that the church is according to the desire of God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I realize that the phrase the desire of God s heart is not found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in Ephesians 1:5 and 9, we have the terms the good pleasure of his will and his good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I was young, I was very troubled by this phrase.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I asked myself, What is the good pleasure of God s will?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now, I would address this question to you: Do you know what the good pleasure of God s will is?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ephesians 1:5 not only speaks of God s will, but also of the good pleasure of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today, especially in this country, everyone desires pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Holidays are days of pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>People attend sporting events in the pursuit of pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we desire pleasure, then certainly God does also.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only something dead or nonliving has no such need.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A wooden table, for example, has no need of pleasure because it is not living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But every living thing desires pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In fact, the more living you are, the more pleasure you need.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A child of seven requires more pleasure than an old man who can hardly breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Often a child is naughty simply because he is seeking pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The degree of our livingness determines how much pleasure we need.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because God is certainly the most living One, He surely needst he most pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we, as fallen sinners, require pleasure, then how much more does God, the living One, have a deep need for it?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When I was in Christianity, I heard over and over again that we were saved because God loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Frequently, the preachers quoted John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I was merely told that God loves sinners and that He desires to bring them into His heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But I was never told that God has a pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Unlike the book of Romans, which begins from the perspective of man s fallen condition, the book of Ephesians does not begin from man s side, but from God s side.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The book of Ephesians reveals what God needs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God needs pleasure, and this pleasure is according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not understand this word will in your way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here, it does not mean that God has a strong will; rather, the meaning here is somewhat similar to a wish.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God has a good wish, a desire.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He longs, desires, to taste something.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God s desire is a good desire, a good will, and His pleasure is of such a good desire.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is exactly what is meant by the words heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The biblical term for heart s desire is the good pleasure of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The good pleasure of God s will is simply the desire of God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What does God desire?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The heart s desire of God is to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is not to have a group of saved sinners, but to obtain one entity the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All students of the Bible agree that the entire book of Ephesians is on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the book of Ephesians the church is described in at least seven or eight aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this message we need to cover all these aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I wish to impress you all, especially the young people, with the fact that the desire of God s heart is to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The church that is in His heart is too wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is so wonderful and profound that not even the apostle Paul in writing the epistle to the Ephesians had the adequate utterance to describe and define it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No human language can adequately portray the wonderful entity in God s heart.</S>
