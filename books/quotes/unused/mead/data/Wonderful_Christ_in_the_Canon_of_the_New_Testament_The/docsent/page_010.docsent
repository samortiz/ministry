   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A HYBRID</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is a word which I do not like to use, but for lack of a better one I will use it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That is, a hybrid.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jesus is a hybrid.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A hybrid, we know, is two things grown into one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When a branch of an apple tree is grafted into a peach tree, the fruit produced from that branch will be a hybrid.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It looks like an apple, and it also looks somewhat like a peach.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Which is it, an apple or a peach?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to say that it is an apple-peach or a peach-apple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is both!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is the same with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is He God or is He man?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is both.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is the God-man, and the man-God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should never use our limited, mental capability to try to analyze Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the problem with so-called theology today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How could Jesus be the root and also the branch?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To our thinking it is illogical.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you are the root, you are the root.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you are the branch, you are the branch.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How can someone be both the root and the branch simultaneously?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet we must remember that Jesus is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is not only the seed, but also the root.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is also the branch and the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the same principle, He is not only the Father, but also the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And He is not only the Son, but also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is everything!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you have Jesus, you have the seed, the root, the branch, and the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And this is not all!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you have Jesus, you have the Father, you have the Son, and you have the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jesus is all in all!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is truly wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE BREAD OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And this Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now, as the Word become flesh, He is not only the Son, but also the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And He is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such a One comes and presents Himself to us as bread.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He said in John 6:35, I am the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can realize now that this bread is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is full of ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All kinds of divine and human elements are in this bread.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And this bread is fully processed and cooked.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is ready for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I was a child, I was taught much concerning Jesus coming and dying on the cross for us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is right, but if you stop here, it is very superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Jesus passed through death and resurrection not only to redeem us, but also to put Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So again I say that Jesus must be so subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He said that He was our bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Could any food be our nourishment if that food remains objective to us?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As long as it remains on the shelf or in the refrigerator, however much we love it, it has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But though we hate it, as long as we eat it, we have it, and it is being wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>SUBJECTIVE FOOD</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is for this reason that Jesus presented Himself to us as food.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Nothing is so subjective to us as food.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Eventually the food becomes so subjective to us that it becomes one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We all know the saying that says we are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Everything we eat becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The chicken, oranges, apples, and meat that we eat become us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are the composition of all that we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our weight at birth was about seven pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But now we may weigh one hundred and seventy pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All the varieties of food that we ate added the weight, not in an objective way, but in a very subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The food was swallowed, digested, and assimilated.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It became our cells and our tissues.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hence, we are simply a composition of what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now we can understand why Jesus said, As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is only by eating Jesus that we can live by Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is the all-inclusive bread.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When this all-inclusive bread enters into us, it becomes so subjective to us and even becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is absolutely not a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Religion merely teaches others to serve God in an outward objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is not God s economy, and this is not God s divine purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God s economy is that this Jesus should enter into us to become our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He will come into us and grow in us and transform us into something different.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then we will be shining with Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the branching out of Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Teachings, doctrines, instructions, degrees will not help us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We can talk about a chicken, study it, and know everything about it, but unless we take the chicken into us, it does us absolutely no good.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Bible does not reveal to us merely an objective Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There is the objective aspect, but the Bible reveals more of the subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is why Jesus said that He is our food.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Nothing could be so subjective to us as food, for it becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Jesus said, I am the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He that eats me shall live by me.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If I did not eat breakfast this morning, it would be difficult for me to speak here.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But since I ate that breakfast, I am now living by what I ate.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is why I am so energetic.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Likewise, if we eat Jesus, we will live by Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Jesus is the all-inclusive meal.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He is whatever we need.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He is full of the finest ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is why He is the all-inclusive food.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He is not simple bread; He is all-inclusive bread.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In this bread are all the attributes of divinity and all the virtues of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>What a bread He is to us!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>No words can tell what Jesus is in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We can never exhaust telling what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>He is truly marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>He is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He is the One that prays, and He is also the One that answers.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He is the One that sows the seed, and He is also the One that grows.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He is the small root, and He is also the branch.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He is the root that came out of the dry ground, and He is also a tender plant.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>He is the seed, the root, the branch, and the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Now He presents Himself to us as the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If we eat Him, we will live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>All the divine, spiritual ingredients are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Hallelujah for such a Jesus!</S>
