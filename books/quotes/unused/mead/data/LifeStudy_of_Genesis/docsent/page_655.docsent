   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>g Christ Showing Love to Them</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As Joseph was disciplining his brothers, he loved them in a secret way 42:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This secret love frightened them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the prophecies in the Bible, the Lord will also exercise His sovereign authority to provide for all the needs of the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no need to worry about Israel, for we have the assurance that the sovereign Lord will provide whatever Israel needs for its existence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, if the little nation of Israel needs certain territory, the Lord will give it to them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He has a way to do this, because He is King of kings and Lord of lords.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is higher than all the presidents on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether or not Israel will retain the Golan Heights or the Sinai does not depend upon the decisions of presidents and diplomats.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It depends upon the Lord's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I were a Jew living in the nation of Israel, I would rest in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have no doubt that even today the Lord is extending His sovereign love to Israel in a secret way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord will continue to do this on Israel's behalf in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you read the newspapers, you will see this happening again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord will test and discipline Israel and at the same time extend His secret and sovereign love to them because He needs them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The record of Joseph's life in the book of Genesis reveals that Joseph needed his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whose need was greater?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Did Joseph's brothers need him more, or did Joseph need them more?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I would say that Joseph needed his brothers more than they needed him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yes, Joseph had become the ruler in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, Joseph was not yet satisfied, for he was still expecting to see the fulfillment of his dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Egypt Joseph was very lonely and he longed to see his father and his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He needed the fulfillment of his dreams, and he needed his father and his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, his need for them was greater than their need for him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The principle is the same today with respect to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whose need is greater does the nation of Israel need the Lord Jesus more than the Lord Jesus needs the nation of Israel?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I would say that the Lord's need of Israel is greater than Israel's need of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Likewise, we need the Lord Jesus and the Lord Jesus needs us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Again I would ask: Whose need is greater do we need the Lord more than the Lord needs us?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord needs us more than we need Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you know this, you can tell the Lord, "Lord Jesus, how I thank You for taking care of my need.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But, Lord, Your need of me is greater than my need of You.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I may not care whether or not I go to hell, but You care about it very much."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do you dare to say this to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At least a few times I have said, "Lord, I thank You for Your care.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But, Lord, I realize that You need me more than I need You.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Lord, I know that You care about losing me."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever I have said this to the Lord, I have had the deep sense within that the Lord was smiling and very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He seemed to be saying to me, "O my little child, you know Me so well."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not pray to the Lord out of the fear of being sent to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not say, "O Lord, I'm afraid I might be lost and sent to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Lord, have mercy on me and rescue me from hell.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Oh, don't let me go to hell!"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you pray like this, the Lord may say, "What are you talking about?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You are not so pitiful, and I don't need to have that much mercy upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have already shown great grace to you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Don't you realize that I need you more than you need Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>h Ignorant of Christ's Love</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because the Lord needs the nation of Israel more than Israel needs Him, He loves them in a secret way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, just as Joseph's brothers were ignorant of his love 42:27-28, 35 , so the nation of Israel today is ignorant of Christ's love for them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We also have been ignorant of His love for us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am somewhat concerned that many among us are still ignorant of the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Are you clear about His love?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do you realize that you are not in the church because of your determination, but because of His love for you?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The fact that you are in the church is the strongest proof that the Lord loves you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This does not mean, however, that the Lord Jesus does not love those outside the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He certainly loves them, but they are missing His love.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although we may not be missing His love, we may be ignorant of it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I hope that from now on none of us will be ignorant of Christ's love.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Rather, we should say to Him, "Lord, thank You for Your love.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The fact that I am in Your presence is proof that You love me.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Lord, how I thank You that I am here enjoying Your presence!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hallelujah for this sign of Your love!"</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this message we have covered eight aspects of the recognition of Christ by the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you consider the prophecies in the Old Testament and the New Testament, you will see that all these aspects are in the prophecies concerning Israel's relationship with Christ, their Messiah.</S>
