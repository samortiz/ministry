BY THE PRESENTING OF OUR BODIES</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Begging of the Apostle</h2><p>Romans 12:1 says, &ldquo;I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service.&rdquo; In 12:1 Paul speaks in a begging way, revealing the importance of the matter concerning which he is about to charge us. It unveils God&rsquo;s desire and purpose. For centuries and ages God has had a particular desire&mdash;to have a body for Christ. Hence, the Apostle said, &ldquo;I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God.&rdquo; Notice that it is not &ldquo;compassion&rdquo; in singular, but &ldquo;compassions&rdquo; in plural. In 9:15 we have seen that compassion is richer and deeper than mercy. God not only has one kind of compassion, but many kinds of compassion upon us. He has had compassion on us in selecting us. He has had compassion on us in calling us, in saving us, and in bringing us into His life. As the previous chapters show, He has had many compassions on us in the past. It was through these compassions of God that the Apostle Paul begged us to present our bodies to God. If we realize the compassions of God and are moved by them, we shall do what the Apostle begged us to do.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Presenting Our Bodies as a Sacrifice</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Many Bodies, One Sacrifice</h2><p>In verse 1 Paul also begs us to present our bodies &ldquo;a living sacrifice.&rdquo; In 6:13, 19 he encouraged us to present the members of our bodies as weapons for fighting and as servants for serving because Romans 6 is a matter of warfare and service. However, in the church life it is a question of sacrifice, of offering ourselves to God for His satisfaction. The church life as a whole is an offering for the satisfaction of God. Although many bodies are presented, the sacrifice is one. Why are there many bodies but only one sacrifice? Because the many members are one Body and the many believers are one church.</p><p>Why does Paul use the word &ldquo;living&rdquo;? Because he compares this sacrifice with the sacrifices of the Old Testament. The sacrifices offered in Old Testament days were all slain, but the church is not a slain offering; it is a living offering full of Christ as life. In chapter eight we see that the believers are filled with Christ as the life-giving Spirit. When they come to chapter twelve to offer themselves as a sacrifice to God, they are a living offering filled with the Spirit of life.</p><p>Furthermore, the sacrifice is holy, meaning that it is separate from common things and that it possesses God&rsquo;s nature. Our God is holy. He is absolutely different and separate from all other things. This holy nature of His has been wrought into the members of the Body. So the Body is holy and unique. It is different from a club, the YMCA, and every kind of social organization. The Body is holy, and nothing common can be brought into it. Thus, this offering is the only thing that is well-pleasing to God and is for the Body of Christ. For the practice of the Body life this offering is needed. We need to offer our bodies for the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">2. A Priestly Service<br />Which Is Most Reasonable</h2><p>To offer ourselves to God as a living sacrifice is our most reasonable service. The words &ldquo;present&rdquo; and &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; mentioned above indicate that the &ldquo;reasonable service&rdquo; is a priestly service. If we have a sober mind and if we intend to be reasonable, fair, and logical, then we certainly must have the church life. People who do not like to have the church life are the most foolish of people. To practice anything other than the church life is foolish, but to give up everything for the church life is logical and reasonable. Nothing is more reasonable than churching. To spend two dollars on a worldly item or amusement is foolish, but to spend two million dollars on the church life is reasonable. If I had a hundred lives, I would give them all for the church life. However, I would not give even the smallest fraction of my life to the worldly things, for to do that would be stupid. What a reasonable service it is to give ourselves to the church life! I can testify that I have been in the Lord&rsquo;s work for more than forty years and that I do not have the slightest regret about it. Whenever I think about the church I am excited. Every time I think about the church life and about my ministry for the church life I am in the heavens. What a reasonable service it is!</p><p>When Paul began to speak about the church life, he implored the believers to present their bodies because as human beings nothing is more real and practical than our body. If your body is not in the church life, please do not say how much you yourself are for the church life. In the past years many people have said to me, &ldquo;Brother, I stand with you. Because the burden of my business is so heavy I cannot be in the church life, but I am one with what you are doing.&rdquo; Others have said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too tired to attend the meeting. You go to the meeting and I&rsquo;ll stay home and pray for you. I can&rsquo;t go to the meeting physically because I&rsquo;m so tired, but my heart and spirit will be there with you.&rdquo; These words sound pleasant but they are a deceit. We must realize that we are in our bodies. Where our bodies are, we are. Suppose that all the saints should say that they are too tired to attend the meeting. What would happen to the meeting? Thus, Paul begged the brothers to present their bodies. If you mean business for the Lord&rsquo;s purpose, you need to present your body.</p><p>It is good for you to come to the meeting even if you sleep through most of it. It is better to come to a meeting and sleep than not to come at all. You may attend a meeting and sleep through it all except for the last few minutes. Perhaps during the last five minutes you will be inspired and receive a great help. I am familiar with a number of cases in which this has happened.</p><p>Let me tell you of one that occurred in my home province of Shantung. I was visiting a certain church with a young apprentice, a brother who was under my hand learning how to serve the Lord. His name was Chao. The wife of the leading brother in this little church loved the Lord very much and she served us food three times a day. As a result of all her work she was tired out. However, she could not stop attending the meetings. One day in particular she came and sat in the front row. Brother Chao was asked to speak a word in the meeting that night. While he was speaking, the sister fell asleep. During his message the young brother was very patient. Nevertheless, near the end of his message, unable to restrain himself any longer, he turned to the sister and said, &ldquo;If you keep on sleeping, I&rsquo;ll kick you out!&rdquo; When he did this I was very worried. After the meeting I told him never to do that again. I felt ashamed as we returned to the sister&rsquo;s house for hospitality. However, the sister greeted us cheerfully. This sister came to the meeting and slept almost the entire meeting, but during the last few minutes she received help. We need to come to the meetings bodily. Do not say that you will be in the church spiritually but not bodily. You need to present your body.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_091.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_093.html">Next</a> </body></html>
