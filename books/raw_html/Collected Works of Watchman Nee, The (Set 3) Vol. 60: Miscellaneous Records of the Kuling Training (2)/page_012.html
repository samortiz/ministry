<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION</h1><h1 class="title">(7)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: August 21, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><h2 class="head1">A WORD OF WISDOM AND A WORD OF KNOWLEDGE</h2><p>Question: What is the meaning of the terms "a word of wisdom" and "a word of knowledge" in 1 Corinthians 12:8?</p><p>Answer: First Corinthians 12:8 says, "For to one through the Spirit a word of wisdom is given, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit." Words of knowledge are words given by the Holy Spirit to relate facts. Words of wisdom are words given by the Holy Spirit to explain the reasons. Words of knowledge involve "what," and words of wisdom involve "why."</p><h2 class="head1">DEFILEMENT OF FLESH AND OF SPIRIT</h2><p>Question: What is the defilement of flesh and the defilement of spirit in 2 Corinthians 7:1?</p><p>Answer: The defilement of flesh is a defilement that originates from the flesh. In this defilement the flesh takes an active role. Defilement of spirit is an outside defilement that invades the spirit. In this defilement the spirit takes a passive role; it is acted upon. Once the flesh is defiled, the spirit is contaminated, defiled, and cannot rise up.</p><p>Question: What is the proper way to exercise supernatural power?</p><p>Answer: If supernatural power matches the operation of our spirit within, this power can be of use to us, and it is reliable. If it does not match our spirit, we cannot use it.</p><h2 class="head1">GIFT, MINISTRY, AND OPERATION</h2><p>Question: What is the difference between gift, ministry, and operation?</p><p>Answer: Gifts are what the Holy Spirit Himself imparts to man. They are not something that a man possesses in himself, and they are objective in nature. The Holy Spirit puts these gifts directly in man. When a man receives a gift, he is empowered to serve. Ministry is subjective. Every saved person has a ministry assigned by the Lord. Gifts are for the fulfillment of the ministry. We fulfill our ministry by the gifts given by the Holy Spirit. A gift is unrelated to the person receiving it; it is objective, having been placed directly in man by the Spirit. When a man serves the Lord according to this gift, he has a ministry. Here is a problem: Some people have gifts, but they do not necessarily use them in the way of a ministry. When a man's exercise of his gift is not under the Lord's authority, his gift is not being employed in the way of ministry because ministry always subjects itself to the Lord's authority. The Corinthians had gifts, but they did not have any ministry because they did not come under the Lord's authority. A man must first subject himself to the Lord's authority before he can exercise his gift to fulfill his ministry. Under the right conditions, a gift fulfills a ministry, and the ministry becomes part of God's work. This is what operation is; it is simply part of God's work.</p><h2 class="head1">INSTANT UTTERANCE</h2><p>Question: Can we rely on instant utterance?</p><p>Answer: If a man has learned his lessons before the Lord, his instant utterance will be a residual deposit of the light he receives from the Holy Spirit. Those who are trained by the Lord can turn the residual light they receive from the Holy Spirit into knowledge and make it a teaching. If a man has not learned his lessons from God, the instant words that he receives are probably products of his own mind. They are probably something from his brain or some arguments concerning the Scripture. Such words will not render others any supply or benefit.</p><p>Whether or not a church is strong depends on the ministry of the word. The whole burden rests on the ministers. If the ministers are poor and do not minister God's word, the church will be poor. In the church in Corinth we only find the gift of tongues. Therefore, there was only the ministry of tongues. Paul prophesied according to revelation. He had the word of prophecy. He also taught according to the knowledge derived from this revelation. This is what God wants to see in the church. The speaking in the church must at least be teachings based on knowledge, which is derived from revelation. A better kind of speaking is that which is based on the reminding of the Holy Spirit. This speaking will bring light to the church.</p><p>The ministry of the word that we are referring to here is absolutely subjective. We have to speak God's past words, and we have to speak God's present words. In delivering our words we have to be strong, and our utterance has to be rich. As we deliver the words sentence by sentence, we have to make them the outflow of life. The more we speak, the lighter our inward burden should become. The result should be a kind of unloading and relief. How God judges our ministry and whether or not it will touch others is something beyond our control; this is objective. The important thing for us to know is the kind of person we are and whether or not we have received a revelation. This is very subjective to us. We have to be inwardly clear concerning the way we take. We have to learn our lessons before God. We have to start with ourselves. If we accept the dealings and learn our lessons, these dealings and lessons will become part of our ministry. If, however, we have not learned anything ourselves, we only will have empty truths. Until we deal with this issue, we cannot face other problems.</p>
