   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Paul's words in 2 Corinthians 6:10 are wonderful: "As poor yet enriching many."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Here was a brother who really knew God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Seemingly he was poor, yet surprisingly he enriched many.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brothers and sisters, this is our way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we work in a place and the brothers and sisters there have something to say about us, or if they have a wrong attitude towards us, we should maintain our dignity as workers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should never accept their gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead, we should tell them plainly, "I cannot take your money.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have things to say about me, and I cannot use your money.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a servant of the Lord, I have to maintain God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I cannot use your money."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even in extreme poverty we have to learn to give.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we want to receive more, we have to give more.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more we are able to give, the more we are able to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a spiritual principle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Often when we are in lack, we should give more, for as soon as the money that we have goes, the Lord's supply comes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some brothers and sisters have many such experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They can testify that the more they give, the more they receive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not count how much is left in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord said, "Give, and it will be given to you" Luke 6:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We cannot annul God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Christian way of stewardship is different from that of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The world gains by saving; we gain by giving.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may be poor, but we can enrich others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 2 Corinthians 12:14 Paul said, "Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was Paul's attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How stern he was toward himself!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some had spoken against Paul and had a problem with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, when Paul was ready to go to them the third time, he was not a burden to them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 14 he continued, saying, "For I do not seek what is yours but you."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Was he being narrow-minded and mean?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No. He continued in the same verse, saying, "For the children ought not to store up for the parents, but the parents for the children." Brothers and sisters, do you see how sweet Paul's attitude before God was? The Corinthians heard many rumors and said many things about Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, Paul was forced to decline their gifts, but even though he declined their gifts, he did not shrink from the responsibility of teaching them about money.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Second Corinthians may be the book that touches the matter of money the most.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Had Paul refrained from any speaking of money, some could have construed that Paul was offended by the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But he was not offended, because money had so little influence over him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He went on to teach the Corinthians about money.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He told them to send the money to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He did not advise them not to send it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was above money; therefore, he was above the Corinthians' attitude towards him personally.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He refused their gift because he wanted to maintain his dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yet he boasted to the Macedonians that the Corinthians were well prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At the same time, he entreated the brothers to make their promised blessing ready beforehand, lest they be put to shame by their unpreparedness when the Macedonians came to them 9:2, 4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His personal feelings were completely set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God's servants must be delivered from the influence of money.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Had Paul not been delivered from money, the Corinthians would never have heard such a message.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul would still have spoken to the Ephesians or the Philippians, but he would not have spoken to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But Paul still went after the Corinthians; he would not give up.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He continued to talk to the Corinthians about money.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He showed them that God could use their money, but that he himself would not; he did not want anything from them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this matter, he did not become burdensome to them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, he still expected them to have a way to go on in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brothers and sisters, can we differentiate between them and theirs whenever we communicate with others in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we see the brothers, are we after them or after theirs?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If they have a problem with us and we cannot gain their hearts, will we still support them, edify them, and pray for their growth?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul had plenty of reasons to turn away from the Corinthians, but he came to them again and again, and even a third time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yet he was not after their possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is a great temptation to God's servants.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to learn to do what our brother Paul did.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In 2 Corinthians 12:15-18 he continued, saying, "But I, I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If I love you more abundantly, am I loved less?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But let it be so!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I did not burden you; but, as some of you say, being crafty, I took you by guile.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Did I take advantage of you through anyone whom I have sent to you?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I entreated Titus and sent with him the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Titus did not take advantage of you, did he?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Did we not walk in the same spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the same steps?"</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Brothers and sisters, think of Paul's attitude: He most gladly spent and was utterly spent on their behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In preaching the gospel, it is not enough for us just to be spent.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have to spend; we have to give everything we have.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is always wrong to receive money in exchange for our preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Rather, we have to be prepared to willingly spend our money for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If our money does not go into our preaching, something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If our money does go into our preaching, we are doing the right thing and are putting our money into a worthy cause.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is what Paul did.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He was willing to be spent, and he was willing also to spend.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He was willing to spend and be spent for their souls.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When he was among them he was not a burden to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Nor was Titus or the other brother a burden to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He would not take advantage of anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The gospel is true this is why we can spend our money on it.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Brothers and sisters, we have to be like our brother Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We should not be a burden to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>On the contrary, we should be utterly spent for the gospel's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Because the gospel is true, it is right for us to spend and be utterly spent.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Our gospel must be one which carries our money along with it.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is the proper way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In spite of what we have said, Paul accepted the gift of the Macedonians and the Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Under normal circumstances, it is right for a gospel preacher to receive gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Paul accepted gifts from some places and refused gifts from other places.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He was not bound in the matter of receiving gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He accepted the gift from the Macedonians.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But when some criticized him and looked for opportunity to slander him in Achaia and Corinth, he refused their gift.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This was Paul's way.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We should be the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We can accept gifts from some places like Macedonia, and we should refuse gifts from other places that say things about us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Brothers and sisters, we have to maintain this stand before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We should not think that we can accept any kind of money.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If someone is speaking behind our backs or if someone is seeking for an opportunity to criticize us, we simply cannot accept their gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>In other places we may accept the gift, but not in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Let us turn to Paul's letter to the Philippians to see his attitude in receiving offerings from the saints there.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Philippians 4:15-17 says, "You yourselves also know, Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I went out from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the account of giving and receiving except you only; for even in Thessalonica you sent both once and again to my need.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit which increases to your account."</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This was Paul's attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>It seems as if the Philippians were the only ones who supplied him.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When he was in Corinth and Thessalonica, it was the Philippians who supplied him.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Yet to the Philippians he said, "Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit which increases to your account."</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>He knew that God would make entries in the Philippians' account for the money they had spent.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>God would take note of the Philippians' money.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This is why he did not ask for their money.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Here was a man who had such an attitude towards the only ones who were supplying him.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>He did not seek the gift, but the fruit which increased to their account.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The Macedonians had given again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>But Paul's eyes were not on the money.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We may not accept some gifts, but even when we do accept, we should speak like Paul did to the Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We should pray for their fruit to increase to their account.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>It is altogether wrong for God's servants to be bound by money.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We must be delivered from money.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Let us go on to see what Paul said in verse 18: "But I have received in full all things and abound; I have been filled."</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>This was no ordinary financial report.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>An ordinary report usually highlights a lack so that others will be motivated to give.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>But to the only church that was supporting him, our brother Paul said, "I have received in full all things and abound; I have been filled."</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Paul's words were seldom repetitious, but here he said, "I have received in full all things and abound; I have been filled."</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Brothers and sisters, please pay attention to our brother's attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>He told the only church that was supporting him that he was full, that he was abounding, and that he was filled.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>He had enough; his only hope was that their gift would become "a sweet-smelling savor, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God" v. 18 . Here is a person with a beautiful spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>He did not have any consciousness of money.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Money did not touch him in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Let us go on to verse 19, which is a very precious verse: "And my God will fill your every need according to His riches, in glory, in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>He was grateful for their support, but he did not lose his dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>They offered up the money as a sacrifice to God; it was not for Paul personally, and it had nothing to do with him.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>At the same time, he blessed them: "My God will fill your every need according to His riches, in glory, in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>We cannot help but say, "To our God and Father be the glory forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Amen."</S>
