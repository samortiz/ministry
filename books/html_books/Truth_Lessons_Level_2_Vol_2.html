<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>The first group of historical figures in the Old Testament also forms the first group of figures in the Bible, God&rsquo;s entire holy Word. The significance of this first group of historical figures is the essential significance of Genesis, the first book of the Bible. The book of Genesis is the garden where every kind of seed of the divine revelation is sown. In this book the principal figures and historical events, whether positive or negative, all represent certain principles and pathways or have certain significances. Therefore, they all have become allegories that have figurative meanings. The first two figures are Adam and Eve. They were created by God as the first couple among the human race and as the first ancestors of all mankind; hence, in them the implications and significances are very profound and far-reaching.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. ADAM</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Declaring God</h2>
<p>Adam was created according to God&rsquo;s inward image and outward likeness (Gen. 1:26). Therefore, he was God&rsquo;s image for the purpose of declaring God. God&rsquo;s image refers to the characteristics in His intrinsic nature. The most prominent of the characteristics that are manifested in man are love, light, holiness, and righteousness. God created Adam according to His image, according to these virtues in His nature, that Adam might declare and express God through these virtues. God&rsquo;s likeness is the outward form in which He expressed Himself and was seen by men. Even before God became flesh, He appeared to Abraham and to many others with such an outward form (Gen. 18:1-5; 32:24, 28-30; Josh. 5:13-15; Judg. 6:12, 14, 16-24; 13:9-10, 17-20). God created Adam&rsquo;s inward nature and outward body according to His own image and likeness, that Adam might have God&rsquo;s image and likeness. God did this in order that Adam might declare and express Him. However, what Adam had was only God&rsquo;s image and likeness; it was not God&rsquo;s intrinsic being. Adam did not have God&rsquo;s life and nature within him. He was just like a man&rsquo;s photograph, which bears the image and likeness of a man but is without the life and nature of that man. Therefore, Adam needed to receive God as his life and content so that his virtues could be filled with the very substance of God&rsquo;s love, light, holiness, and righteousness. In this way he would be able to reach the goal for which God created man; that is, he would be able to declare and express God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Representing God</h2>
<p>After God created Adam, He authorized Adam to have dominion over all creatures in the seas, in the air, and on the earth (Gen. 1:26, 28). That is, He established Adam as His deputy, one who would exercise His authority to rule on the earth for Him, especially to have dominion over the earth in order to deal with His enemy, Satan, typified by the serpent, the chief among the creeping things (Gen. 1:26; 3:1; Rev. 12:9), and to restrict Satan&rsquo;s movement on earth. Because the earth was seized and usurped by Satan and became the place of his activities (Luke 4:5-6; 1 John 5:19), it became a strategic place. If God would have His kingdom come on earth, have His will done on earth, and have His glory manifested on earth (Matt. 6:10, 13), His authority must be brought in through man that His enemy might be dealt with and that man might represent Him in ruling on the earth, thus fulfilling God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Typifying Christ as the Head<br />
of Mankind and All Things</h2>
<p>Adam was created as the head of mankind. Mankind is the center of God&rsquo;s creation. As the head of mankind, Adam was also the head of all creatures. All his actions, whether successes or failures, gains or losses, are related to and represent mankind and all things. Adam, as the head of mankind and all things, is a type of Christ as the Head over all things (Eph. 1:22; 1 Cor. 11:3; Rom. 5:14b). Adam was the first man; Christ is the second Man. Adam was the first Adam; Christ is the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:47, 45). Adam was the head of the old collective man (mankind); whatever he did and whatever happened to him is participated in by all mankind. Christ is the Head of the new corporate man (the church&mdash;Eph. 2:15-16); whatever He did and whatever happened to Him is participated in by all the members of His Body, the church (Eph. 1:22-23).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Including All His Descendants,<br />
Being Created by God as God&rsquo;s Vessel</h2>
<p>When Adam, the father of all mankind, was created by God, all his descendants were included in him. God did not create Adam as only a single person; He created mankind collectively in Adam. In Genesis 1:26 God said, &ldquo;Let us make man...and let them....&rdquo; <em>Man</em> is singular, but the pronoun used is <em>them.</em> This proves that this man is a corporate man, a collective man. When Adam was created, all mankind, being included in him, was created as God&rsquo;s vessel (Rom. 9:21, 23) to contain God and to express God&rsquo;s glory. Therefore, Adam and all his descendants should receive God as their life and content that they may be God&rsquo;s expression. Otherwise, man is but an empty shell, and with him everything is vain and limited. Man&rsquo;s mind, emotion, and will are empty, and so are man&rsquo;s wisdom, prudence, good works, and virtues. Only when God enters into this man, this vessel, can all these items have reality and content and thus become God&rsquo;s expression and manifestation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Committing Sin and Becoming Fallen<br />
with All His Descendants</h2>
<p>Adam listened to his wife and ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which signifies Satan as the source of sin and death. Thus, he entered into an illegal union with Satan and received the evil nature of Satan, the nature that rebelled against God. Satan&rsquo;s evil nature became the sinful nature within Adam, and Adam was thus constituted a sinner condemned by God. Since he was a corporate man who included all mankind, in his one act of disobedience he included all his descendants, all who would later be born of him, in his sinning and becoming fallen. Thus, Satan and the sinful nature entered all mankind, and all men were constituted sinners (Rom. 5:12, 19) and were subjected under God&rsquo;s condemnation.</p>
<p>When Adam sinned and fell, we all, being included in him, participated in his sinning and becoming fallen. In him we also participated in the consequences of his sin. We came out of him, and since his life and nature became sinful, the life and nature that we received from him also are sinful.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Losing His Position as the Head</h2>
<p>In His administration in the universe, God established Adam as the head of the woman. Since Adam was the head of the woman, his wife, Eve, should have listened to him, and he ought to have stood in his position as the head. However, he not only failed to keep his position as the head, but he also followed his wife and acted contrary to God&rsquo;s ordination, causing all mankind to fall into sin and to be constituted sinners. This should serve as a warning to all his descendants, to all men and women, in their married life as husbands and wives.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Receiving the Promise of God&rsquo;s Redemption</h2>
<p>After Adam sinned and fell, he was in fear and trembling, and he hid from the face of God and awaited death. However, God came to seek him and to call him. God did not put him to death; rather, He gave him the promise of redemption. He promised that Christ would be the seed of the woman, who would bruise the head of the serpent (Gen. 3:15) and thus cause the serpent&rsquo;s death; that is, that Christ would destroy Satan, who deceived man and poisoned man with sin (Heb. 2:14). Furthermore, according to this promise, Christ would become the sacrifice for redemption and would shed His blood to accomplish propitiation (Gen. 3:21; John 1:29) in order to save and bring back fallen man that he might receive God&rsquo;s life and become God&rsquo;s expression. Adam believed and received this promise and gave his wife the name Eve, which means &ldquo;living&rdquo; or &ldquo;life&rdquo; (Gen. 3:20). God then used skins from the sacrifice to make coats for the man and his wife that they might be clothed. The skins from the sacrifice typify Christ as righteousness to those who believe (1 Cor. 1:30). Such righteousness makes it possible for fallen sinners to be justified by God (Rom. 3:24), to become acceptable to God, and thereby to be able to fellowship with God. Therefore, through the substitution by the bleeding sacrifice and through the union with the covering coat of skin, Adam received the anticipated redemption of God. Adam and Eve were then able to continue to live on the earth, and through Eve, whom Adam considered as one who was qualified to have life and live, they were able to beget generation after generation of descendants.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. Including All His Descendants,<br />
Being Driven Out of Paradise by God<br />
and Being Separated from the Tree of Life</h2>
<p>Although Adam believed and received the promise of God&rsquo;s redemption and also experienced God&rsquo;s anticipated redemption, he, including all the descendants who were to be born of him, was driven by God out of the garden of Eden and was separated from the tree of life in accordance with God&rsquo;s economical arrangement. God would not allow a fallen sinner with a sinful nature to contact Him and to receive Him as life. Not until Christ came to accomplish God&rsquo;s redemption and thereby deal with the fallen sinner and his sinful nature, thus fulfilling the requirements of God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness, did God open anew for man the way to the tree of life. By so doing He caused all fallen sinners in Adam to be justified by faith and to be accepted by God through the redemption of Jesus Christ, that they might be able to come forward to God, who is signified by the tree of life, to enjoy God as life and the life supply for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. EVE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Representing the Church</h2>
<p>In the process of creation, God created Adam and then took a rib from him to make a woman, Eve. They, Adam and Eve, typify different things. Adam typifies Christ (1 Cor. 15:45, 47) and is a prefigure of Christ (Rom. 5:14b), whereas Eve represents the church. In Genesis 2 the Bible speaks in detail concerning the creation of the woman, and in Ephesians 5 it tells us that Eve refers to the church (vv. 31-32).</p><h2 class="head3">1. Signifying That the Church<br />
Comes out of Christ and Is unto Christ</h2>
<p>Eve came out of Adam and was unto Adam, signifying that the church comes out of Christ and is unto Christ. Genesis 2:18-24 shows us that Eve was made from a rib taken from Adam. Before she was made, God saw that it was not good that man should be alone, so He brought every beast of the field, every fowl of the air, and all cattle to Adam. When Adam saw them, he gave each one a name, but he did not find a helpmeet among them. God then caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and took one of his ribs, and from it He made Eve. When Adam saw her, he said, &ldquo;This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh&rdquo;; and he was joined to her, becoming one flesh with her, and he took her as his counterpart. This signifies that among all the living creatures that God created, there is not one that can be Christ&rsquo;s counterpart. Only the church, which is produced out of Christ through His death, can be unto Christ as Christ&rsquo;s counterpart and can be one with Christ.</p>
<p>The church comes out of Christ and is created by God with the essence of Christ, not with the earthly essence of man. Just as God took a rib from the sleeping Adam to make Eve, He also caused blood and water to issue forth from the side of Christ at the time of His death (John 19:34). The blood is for redemption (Eph. 1:7; 1 Pet. 1:18-19); the water, typified by Adam&rsquo;s rib, is for the imparting of God&rsquo;s life (John 12:24) as the essence that produces the church. Eve received her life from Adam and had the same life and the same nature as Adam. Likewise, the church comes out of Christ and has the same life and the same nature as Christ. Eve was unto Adam that Adam might have a counterpart as his bride. In like manner, the church is unto Christ as His counterpart and His bride. Only Eve, who came out of Adam, could be unto Adam as his counterpart. Likewise, only the church, which comes out of Christ, can be unto Christ as His counterpart. Only that which comes out of Christ is worthy to be unto Christ. The church must be something that comes out of Christ, and it must be unto Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Signifying That the Church,<br />
Being Part of Christ, Is Christ&rsquo;s Increase</h2>
<p>Since Eve came out of Adam (1 Cor. 11:8), she was part of Adam; she was bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh. Moreover, she was the overflow of Adam as Adam&rsquo;s increase. This signifies that the church, being part of Christ, is Christ&rsquo;s increase, which becomes His Body as His fullness (Eph. 1:22, 23) for His expression.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Not Keeping Her Position in God&rsquo;s Creation</h2>
<p>Under the arrangement in God&rsquo;s creation, Eve was not an independent person, but was one who was subordinate to her husband and who was part of her husband. First Corinthians 11:8-9 says, &ldquo;For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man; for also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.&rdquo; Furthermore, according to the arrangement in God&rsquo;s governmental administration in the universe, man is the head of the woman (1 Cor. 11:3). Therefore, Eve, a woman, was to take her husband as her head and was not to be her own head or to make her own decisions, but was to submit completely to her husband. However, the cunning old serpent, the devil, the rebellious Satan, tempted and deceived Eve concerning this very point (1 Tim. 2:14). He caused her to assume the headship and to put her husband aside, thus making herself an independent unit in making decisions. She fell into the devil&rsquo;s scheme, violated God&rsquo;s prohibition, and made her own decision. She even seduced her husband to follow her in eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which resulted in death. Thus, Adam received the poison of sin, and there was also a charge of sin against him before God. Consequently, all mankind was brought into sin and death.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Following Her Husband and Receiving<br />
the Promise of Redemption</h2>
<p>In her fall Eve failed to keep her position but became one who assumed the headship. However, she kept her position in receiving the promise of God&rsquo;s redemption; she followed Adam, her head, and received God&rsquo;s promise. God promised that the seed of woman would come. Adam believed this promise, and Eve followed him and believed it also. After giving birth to Cain, Eve said, &ldquo;I have gotten a man from the Lord&rdquo; (Gen. 4:1), for she considered the child the seed of woman promised by God. This proves that she followed her husband and received the promise of God&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Becoming the Mother of All Living</h2>
<p>By following her husband and receiving the promise of God&rsquo;s redemption, Eve returned to the position in which she was created. In this way she was delivered from the position of death and became the mother of all living (Gen. 3:20), the begetter of all those who have life and are living. Out of her, millions of descendants have been produced. Hence, the human race has been able to multiply endlessly to replenish the earth. This has made it possible for God to continue to carry out His purpose in creating man and to thereby fulfill His eternal plan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Adam and Eve were created by God as the first couple among the human race and as the first ancestors of all mankind. Adam was created according to God&rsquo;s inward image and outward likeness. He was God&rsquo;s image for the purpose of declaring God. God established Adam as His deputy, one who would exercise His authority, especially to have dominion over the earth in order to deal with His enemy, Satan, and restrict Satan&rsquo;s movement on earth. Adam, who was created as the head of mankind, is a type of Christ as the Head over all things. Adam was the first man; Christ is the second Man and also the last Adam. When Adam was created, all mankind, being included in him, was created as God&rsquo;s vessel that man might receive God as his life and content and become God&rsquo;s expression. However, Adam ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and thereby included all his descendants in his sinning and becoming fallen. Thus, Satan and the sinful nature entered into all mankind, and all men were constituted sinners. Immediately after Adam sinned and fell, God came to seek him and to give him the promise of redemption. Adam believed and received this promise and was then able to continue to live on the earth. Through Eve, whom he considered as one who was qualified to have life and live, Adam begot generation after generation of descendants. However, he, including all his descendants, was driven by God out of the garden of Eden and was separated from the tree of life, until Christ came to accomplish God&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<p>Eve was made out of a rib taken from Adam&rsquo;s body and was unto Adam to be Adam&rsquo;s counterpart and to be one flesh with Adam. This signifies that the church comes out of Christ and is unto Christ, and that the church is the counterpart of Christ and is one with Christ. Since Eve came out of Adam, she was part of Adam; she was the overflow of Adam as Adam&rsquo;s increase. This signifies that the church is part of Christ as Christ&rsquo;s increase. However, Eve did not keep her position in God&rsquo;s creation and did not take her husband as her head. Thus, she fell into the devil&rsquo;s scheme and violated God&rsquo;s prohibition. Moreover, she seduced her husband to follow her in eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Thus, all mankind was brought into sin and death. However, Eve kept her position in receiving the promise of God&rsquo;s redemption; she followed Adam, her head, and received God&rsquo;s promise. In this way she was delivered from the position of death and became the mother of all living.</p>

</ol>
<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>The second pair among the first group of historical figures in the Old Testament is Cain and Abel, who were two sons born of Adam and Eve. This pair represents the two categories of Adam&rsquo;s descendants, one category rejecting God and taking the way of death, and the other receiving God and taking the way of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. CAIN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. His Name Meaning &ldquo;Acquired&rdquo;</h2>
<p>After Eve followed her husband, Adam, and received the promise of God&rsquo;s redemption, she brought forth their first son and named him Cain, which means &ldquo;acquired&rdquo; (Gen. 4:1a). She considered Cain the seed of woman promised by God, the one who would bruise the head of the serpent, which had poisoned them. Therefore, she declared, &ldquo;I have acquired a man, Jehovah&rdquo; (Gen. 4:1, lit.). In fact, Cain would not be the one to bruise the head of the old serpent; rather, he would be a follower of the old serpent. It was not until four thousand years later that the virgin Mary gave birth to a child whose name was called &ldquo;the mighty God&rdquo; (Isa. 9:6). That child was Jehovah. He was the God-promised seed, the One who would bruise the head of the serpent, which had poisoned man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Knowing God,<br />
but Refusing to Take God&rsquo;s Way</h2>
<p>Adam and Eve certainly must have told their children how they had been created by God, how they had been charged by Him not to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, how they had violated God&rsquo;s prohibition, and how they were in fear and trembling as they awaited death. Adam and Eve must have told them also how God came in to preach the gospel by promising them that the seed of woman would bruise the head of the serpent, and how God had slain the sacrifices, which were their substitutes, and used the skins to make clothing to cover their nakedness that they could stand before God and have fellowship with Him. Therefore, Cain came to know God through his parents. Although he knew God, he refused to take God&rsquo;s way. In rendering service and worship to God, he did not act according to God&rsquo;s revelation; he failed to present an offering with the shedding of blood according to God&rsquo;s redemption. Rather, according to his own preference he presented the fruit of the ground (Gen. 4:3), the product of his own labor, as an offering without the shedding of blood. As a result, he was not accepted by God, he lost God, and he was driven away and went out of the presence of God (Gen. 4:5, 16). His descendants thus moved toward a godless culture (Gen. 4:17, 20-22). They murdered (Gen. 4:23-24) and practiced polygamy (Gen. 4:19). Eventually, they became altogether godless, they had nothing to do with God, and they were without hope and were altogether empty in the world.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Caring Only for His Own Existence,<br />
Not for God&rsquo;s Purpose</h2>
<p>Cain was a server of the ground (Gen. 4:2b, lit.). To serve the ground is to earn a living, which is for the sustaining of one&rsquo;s own existence, not for God&rsquo;s purpose in His redemption. This indicates that although Cain knew God, he cared only for his own existence. He cared neither for God&rsquo;s purpose nor for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. Throughout the ages, all unbelievers have been toiling and laboring in order to earn a living. They diligently serve the earth, not God, and they care only for themselves, not for God or for God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Becoming the Representative<br />
of All Those Who Refuse to Take<br />
God&rsquo;s Way of Redemption</h2>
<p>Cain served God religiously according to his own way and after his own will. He rejected the redemption by blood that was required and ordained by God, and according to the flesh he envied and murdered Abel, a faithful witness of God (Gen. 4:4-5, 8). Eventually, he was rejected by God. Therefore, Cain took the godless way, which is not the way of redemption ordained by God. Thus, the way of Cain became a model (Jude 11a), representing the way of death taken by all godless people throughout the ages, a way that is out of death, in death, and unto death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Becoming the Representative<br />
of All Those Who Murder<br />
Because of Religious Jealousy</h2>
<p>Cain is also the representative of all those who murder the real worshippers of God because of religious jealousy. This exactly corresponds to the word of the Lord Jesus in John 16:2: &ldquo;An hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think that he is offering service to God.&rdquo; History confirms that the Roman Catholic Church has killed more genuine Christians than the Roman Empire. The Roman Catholic Church alleged that the believers of Jesus were heretics. Hence, after the time of Martin Luther, one of the items in an oath taken by Catholic bishops was that they had to persecute those who held heretical beliefs. Several popes even passed edicts ordering Catholics to destroy all those whom they called heretics. One of the popes said that a person could redeem himself from his sin of murdering a Catholic if he killed a Protestant. Just in Rome alone, over one million nine hundred thousand Christians were killed. Thus, Revelation 17:6 says that the woman, the Roman Catholic Church, was drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. All these historical facts are represented by Cain&rsquo;s murdering of his brother Abel. All such murderers are walking on the same pathway as Cain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. ABEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. His Name Meaning &ldquo;Vanity, Like a Breath&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Eve gave birth again, to Cain&rsquo;s brother Abel (Gen. 4:2). <em>Abel</em> means &ldquo;vanity, like a breath.&rdquo; This name may indicate that, because they were disappointed with their first child, Cain, Adam and Eve had the feeling and concept that the life of fallen man was vanity. Their second son, whom they begot and named Abel, must have inherited the same realization and feeling.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Knowing God and Taking God&rsquo;s Way</h2>
<p>In contrast to Cain, Abel not only knew God but also took God&rsquo;s way. According to God&rsquo;s foreordained redemption, he presented an offering of God&rsquo;s delight with the shedding of blood; that is, he offered the firstlings of the flock and the fat of the lambs. Thus, he was justified by God (Gen. 4:4; Heb. 11:4). In taking such a way of redemption, he believed in the God-ordained offerings according to God&rsquo;s revelation; he neither acted according to his preference nor trusted in his deeds or works. He knew that as a fallen sinner he could not cover or conceal his sinfulness with his own works and by his own behavior. He realized that he needed to present an offering with the shedding of blood for his redemption (Heb. 9:22) and for the satisfying of God&rsquo;s righteous requirement that he might be accepted by God and have fellowship with God. What Abel did corresponded exactly to the requirements of the Mosaic law, which was given later. This proves that the way of redemption that he took in worshipping God was according to God&rsquo;s divine revelation and not according to his concept.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Caring Only for God&rsquo;s Purpose,<br />
Not for His Own Existence</h2>
<p>Cain was a server of the ground that he might earn a living for himself, whereas Abel was a feeder of sheep (Gen. 4:2, lit.) that he might have an offering to present to God. At that time, before the flood, man ate only vegetables and fruits (Gen. 1:29), for God had not yet ordained that man should eat of the cattle, whose blood could be shed (Gen. 9:3-4). Therefore, what man gained by feeding sheep was for presenting offerings to God and not for earning a living for himself. Moreover, in the sense of man&rsquo;s need for covering because of the fall, the skin that was left from the sacrificial lamb was for the covering of man&rsquo;s shame before God so that man could be acceptable to God and thereby could contact God. Therefore, Abel&rsquo;s occupation indicates that Abel did not live mainly for himself; he lived according to God&rsquo;s desire primarily for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s purpose in His redemption. Likewise, all who believe in God and take the way of God&rsquo;s redemption should care for God&rsquo;s purpose more than they care for their livelihood. Everything they do should be for the purpose of serving God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Becoming the Representative of All Those<br />
Who Take God&rsquo;s Way of Redemption and Life</h2>
<p>In Abel&rsquo;s living, his occupation indicates that he cared for taking the way of God&rsquo;s redemption. Everything he did was according to God&rsquo;s revelation and by faith. To present offerings with the shedding of blood according to God&rsquo;s revelation and thereby be justified and accepted by God is to act by faith, doing something that man cannot perceive by his natural senses. The way of faith taken by Abel (Heb. 11:4) also became a model representing God&rsquo;s way of redemption and life taken by all those who have believed into Christ through the ages. Therefore, in the divine revelation of the Bible, Abel and Cain represent two categories of people, the believers and the unbelievers. Furthermore, the two opposite ways taken by them represent the two opposite ways taken by mankind, the way of life and the way of death. Abel and all those who believe and take the way of life will ultimately be in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth, where they will express God&rsquo;s life and glory for eternity. On the other hand, Cain and all those who do not believe but take the way of death will end up in the lake of fire, which also is in the new heaven and new earth (Rev. 20:15; 21:8; 22:15), where they will be a sign of God&rsquo;s condemnation, righteousness, and holiness for eternity (John 5:29).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Becoming the Representative<br />
of All the Martyrs</h2>
<p>Because Abel presented offerings with the shedding of blood according to God&rsquo;s revelation and was accepted by God, he incurred Cain&rsquo;s hatred and was killed by Cain (Gen. 4:4-5, 8). Thus, he became the representative of all those throughout the ages who take God&rsquo;s way of redemption and life and who because of this are martyred. The Lord Jesus said to the Pharisees, &ldquo;I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes: some of them you will kill...and some of them you will scourge...that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar&rdquo; (Matt. 23:34-35). This word indicates clearly that in both the Old Testament and New Testament ages, all those who take God&rsquo;s way of redemption and life will suffer persecution. Therefore, like Abel, all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted (2 Tim. 3:12). They all are Abel&rsquo;s followers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Cain and Abel as a pair represent the two categories of Adam&rsquo;s descendants: one rejecting God and taking the way of death, and the other receiving God and taking the way of life. The name Cain means &ldquo;acquired&rdquo;; it was given because Eve believed that Cain was the seed of woman promised by God, the one who would bruise the head of the serpent. In fact, Cain would be a follower of the old serpent. Although Cain came to know God through his parents, he refused to take God&rsquo;s way. On the contrary, according to his own preference he presented of the fruit of the ground an offering without the shedding of blood. As a result, he was not accepted by God and he lost God. As a server of the ground, Cain cared only for his own existence and not for God&rsquo;s purpose. He became the representative of all those throughout the ages who refuse to take God&rsquo;s way of redemption, and by murdering Abel he became the representative of all those who murder because of religious jealousy.</p>
<p>The name Abel means &ldquo;vanity, like a breath.&rdquo; This name indicates that Abel felt that the life of fallen man was vanity. He not only knew God but also took God&rsquo;s way. He presented the firstlings of the flock as offerings with the shedding of blood and was thus justified by God. As a feeder of sheep, he cared only for presenting offerings to God and not for his own existence. He became the representative of all those who take God&rsquo;s way of redemption and life, and in being slain by Cain he became the representative of all the martyrs throughout the ages who take God&rsquo;s way of redemption and life.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Enosh and Enoch are the third pair in the first group of figures presented in Genesis as seeds of the divine truths. In the divine revelation, Adam, among the first pair of characters, points to God&rsquo;s redemption, which was promised by God and was needed by fallen man. Abel, who is of the second pair, indicates a man who takes God&rsquo;s way of redemption and life according to God&rsquo;s revelation. Then, of the third pair, Enosh signifies a man who realizes his fragility and impotence while taking God&rsquo;s way of redemption and life; and Enoch signifies a man who is being supplied by God to walk and live with God and thereby to escape death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. ENOSH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Knowing His Fragility and Impotence</h2>
<p>Enosh&rsquo;s father, Seth, was born to take Abel&rsquo;s place (Gen. 4:25). This shows that he was consistent with Abel and was the continuation of Abel. He named his son Enosh, which means &ldquo;frail man.&rdquo; This surely indicates that as he took God&rsquo;s way of redemption and life, he sensed the extreme fragility, the impotence, and the complete helplessness of fallen man. His son, whom he begot and named Enosh, must have inherited the same realization and sense.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Calling on the Name of Jehovah<br />
and Thus Enjoying His Riches</h2>
<p>Because Seth sensed his own fragility, impotence, and helplessness, he must have sought God&rsquo;s help by calling on the name of Jehovah, the One who is, who was, and who will be forever&mdash;that is, the name of the One who always is&mdash;and thus enjoying His rich supply. This One who exists forever is everlasting, immortal, ever unchanging, self-existing, and ever-existing. He is the source of every rich supply and is fully sufficient to meet man&rsquo;s every need. Romans 10:12 says, &ldquo;For the same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.&rdquo; Whenever a person calls on His name, he will enjoy His rich supply. The name Seth gave to his son indicates that before naming him, Seth may have already begun to call on the name of Jehovah. Therefore, after he gave his son such a name, Genesis 4:26 says that men began to call on the name of Jehovah. Because Enosh was born of such a father, one who called on the name of Jehovah, he inherited this blessing naturally and became one who called on the name of Jehovah, thus enjoying God&rsquo;s riches.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Becoming the Representative<br />
of All Those Who Call on<br />
the Name of Jehovah</h2>
<p>Enosh, as one who called on the name of the Lord, became a model representing all those who call on the name of Jehovah and enjoy God&rsquo;s riches. The blessing of calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name continues throughout the entire Bible. It is inherited throughout the generations by those who take God&rsquo;s way of redemption and life, and it is practiced by the New Testament believers also. In the Old Testament age, Job (Job 12:4; 27:10), Abraham (Gen. 12:8; 13:4; 21:33), Isaac (Gen. 26:25), Moses (Deut. 4:7), Samson (Judg. 15:18; 16:28), Samuel (1 Sam. 12:18; Psa. 99:6), David (2 Sam. 22:4; Psa. 17:6; 55:16; 116:4; 118:5; 145:18), the psalmist Asaph (Psa. 80:18), the psalmist Heman (Psa. 88:9), Elijah (1 Kings 18:24), Isaiah (Isa. 12:4), Jeremiah (Lam. 3:55, 57), and others all practiced calling on the name of the Lord. Also, Isaiah charged God&rsquo;s seekers to call upon the name of the Lord (Isa. 55:6). It is God&rsquo;s commandment (Psa. 50:15; Jer. 29:12) and desire (Psa. 91:15; Zeph. 3:9; Zech. 13:9) that His people call on Him. It is the joyful way to drink from the fountain of God&rsquo;s salvation, and the enjoyable way to delight oneself in God (Isa. 12:3-4; Job 27:10). Hence, the psalmists called upon the Lord&rsquo;s name daily (Psa. 88:9). Joel the prophet prophesied that people would call upon His name in the year of the New Testament jubilee (Joel 2:32).</p>
<p>Joel&rsquo;s prophecy was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost when all who believed were saved by calling on the name of the Lord (Acts 2:17, 21). This became the way in the New Testament by which man can be saved and enjoy God&rsquo;s riches (Rom. 10:10-13). The early believers practiced calling on the name of the Lord everywhere (1 Cor. 1:2), and this calling became a popular sign by which Christ&rsquo;s believers were recognized by the unbelievers, especially the persecutors (Acts 9:14, 21). When he repented and believed in the Lord, Saul, who had helped to persecute Stephen, one who called on the name of the Lord (Acts 7:58-60), was told by Ananias to be baptized, calling on the name of the Lord. In this way Saul washed away his sin of persecuting those who called on the name of the Lord (Acts 22:16). Thereafter, he himself also became one who called on the name of the Lord. This can be proved by the fact that he exhorted others to be saved by calling on the name of the Lord (Rom. 10:13) and to enjoy all the riches of the Lord by calling on His name (Rom. 10:12). He told us that all who seek the Lord out of a pure heart call on the name of the Lord in this way (2 Tim. 2:19, 22).</p><h2 class="head1">II. ENOCH</h2>
<p>From Enosh, the third generation from Adam, to Enoch, the seventh generation from Adam, there were no outstanding persons who could serve as spiritual representatives or signs. Therefore, in terms of spiritual representation and significance, Enoch was the continuation of Enosh. Enosh called upon the name of Jehovah and enjoyed the riches of God; Enoch, in the spiritual sense, carried on from Enosh and went a step further to walk with God, and was taken by God so that he escaped the ultimate issue of man&rsquo;s fall, that is, death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Walking with God</h2>
<p>When Enoch was sixty-five years old, he begot a son, whom he named Methuselah, which means &ldquo;when he is dead it [the judgment of the flood] shall be sent.&rdquo; The significance of this name corresponds with Enoch&rsquo;s prophecy: &ldquo;Behold, the Lord came...to execute judgment against all&rdquo; (Jude 14-15). This certainly indicates that he must have known, through God&rsquo;s revelation, that one day the Lord would come to judge that ungodly and unrighteous generation. Therefore, when he begot Methuselah, he gave him such a name. It has been calculated that when Noah was six hundred years of age, at the time when the flood came to judge that evil age (Gen. 5:25-29; 7:6), Methuselah was nine hundred and sixty-nine years old, the age at which he died. Enoch must have been warned concerning this, and, fearing God, he began to walk with God, that is, to live and move with God, taking God as his center and everything.</p>
<p>Enoch&rsquo;s walking with God must have been due to his believing in God and his seeking after God. According to Hebrews 11:6, Enoch believed not only that &ldquo;God is,&rdquo; but that &ldquo;He is a rewarder of those who seek Him out.&rdquo; This shows that Enoch not only believed that there is a God, that is, that God exists, and that He is real, living, and present, but he also believed that God is a rewarder who will reward those who seek Him out. In this way, Enoch believed in God, sought Him out, and walked with Him for three hundred years. This satisfied and pleased God, and as a result God rewarded him with Himself as the eternal life and enabled him to escape death and to be taken by God so that he did not have to see death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being Taken by God</h2>
<p>Enoch&rsquo;s being taken by God meant that he was taken out of that evil age, which was ungodly and unrighteous. Not only was he exempted from suffering the judgment of the catastrophe concerning which he prophesied, but he even did not have to see the death that all fallen men must pass through. Death is the ultimate destiny of fallen man. It is not only those who forsake God&rsquo;s way of redemption and life and take the way of death who must die; even those who take the way of God&rsquo;s redemption and life, and who live according to God&rsquo;s revelation and for God&rsquo;s will, are subject to death. However, Enoch found the way to escape death. By walking with God for three hundred years, fully enjoying God&rsquo;s salvation, he lived a life that enabled him to escape the power of death, to overcome the destruction of death. Therefore, God took him away, separating him from death so that he did not see death. This is God&rsquo;s ultimate salvation, the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Becoming the Representative<br />
of All the Overcomers Who Will Be Raptured<br />
While They Are Living</h2>
<p>Enoch walked with God and was taken by God while he was living. Thus, he also is a model, representing all the overcomers who will be raptured while they are living. This signifies that all who take God&rsquo;s way of redemption and life by calling on Him, enjoying His riches, and walking and living with Him can receive grace to such an extent that they will not see death (John 8:51; 11:26). Elijah, the overcoming prophet in the Old Testament, was raptured while he was living (2 Kings 2:11). In the future, when the Lord returns, the overcoming believers, because they live soberly and watchfully, will be raptured while they are living, not having to see death. Thus they will escape the great tribulation that is coming upon the whole earth (Matt. 24:21; Luke 21:34-35; 1 Thes. 5:3) and will be taken up to Mount Zion (Rev. 14:1), where the Lord Jesus has been since the time of His ascension. There they will walk, live, and be with Him forever. All these items are represented by Enoch&rsquo;s walking with God and being taken by God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p><em>Enosh</em> means &ldquo;frail man.&rdquo; In giving his son this name, Seth must have sensed the extreme fragility, impotence, and complete helplessness of fallen man. Enosh must have inherited the same realization and sense. Because Seth sensed his own fragility and impotence, he must have begun to call on the name of Jehovah. Because Enosh was born of such a father, one who called on the name of Jehovah, he inherited this blessing naturally and became one who called on the name of Jehovah and thus enjoyed God&rsquo;s riches. In this way, he became a model representing all those who call on the name of Jehovah and enjoy the riches of God. In the spiritual sense, Enoch carried on from Enosh and took a further step to walk with God. When he begot Methuselah, he received the revelation from God that one day the Lord would come to judge that ungodly and unrighteous generation. Hence, he was warned and, fearing God, he began to walk with God. He also believed that God is a rewarder who will reward those who seek Him out. As a result, God rewarded Enoch with Himself as the eternal life and enabled him to escape death, to be taken by Him, and to not see death.

</ol>
<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>From the time Cain left God&rsquo;s way of redemption and went his own way of death, to the time of Methuselah, two striking things occurred among the human race. The first was the producing of a culture without God by the man who went the way of death, and the second was the judgment of the deluge, which came from God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. A CULTURE WITHOUT GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Invented by the Man Who Lost God</h2>
<p>Because Cain refused to take God&rsquo;s way of redemption and chose to go the way of death, he lost God and all the blessings that come from God. Consequently, he must have been filled with a sense of insecurity. He became a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, a person who had no goal, no satisfaction, no rest, and no protection. Hence, among the human race, he was the first one to build a city for self-preservation (Gen. 4:17). He named the city Enoch, after the name of his son. The fact that he did not name the city after the name of God was a declaration that man had become independent of God. His descendants invented cattle-raising for making a living, music for amusing themselves, and weapons for self-defense (Gen. 4:20-22). This was a godless culture that was for self-preservation, self-support, self-amusement, and self-defense. It was invented apart from God by the man who lost God and all God&rsquo;s blessings.</p>
<p>Hence, human culture was produced because man had lost God. Originally, God was everything to man. God was man&rsquo;s protection, maintenance, supply, joy, amusement, and defense. However, when man lost God and all that God was to him, he had to invent something for his own protection so that he might exist on the earth. This is the reason that human culture was formed. In such a godless culture man indulged in lusts and took many wives. Moreover, man became lawless, godless, murderous, and violent (Gen. 4:23-24). Among Cain&rsquo;s descendants, there was one named Lamech, who married two wives (Gen. 4:19), thus practicing polygamy. In order to fulfill the lusts of his flesh, Lamech was the first to break the principle of marriage ordained by God for human propagation, that is, the principle of one wife for one husband (Gen. 2:24). He also boasted that he had slain a man and had killed a young man. Thus, he was truly lawless and arrogant. How dreadful and evil was such a godless culture! Consequently, such a culture caused the whole human race to be corrupted. Because every imagination of the thoughts of man&rsquo;s heart was only evil continually, and because the earth was filled with man&rsquo;s violence, God repented that He had made man and was grieved in His heart. Thus, He had to destroy the human race completely (Gen. 6:5-7, 11-13), preserving only Noah&rsquo;s family of eight.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Produced by Satan&rsquo;s Instigation within Man</h2>
<p>Apparently, such a culture without God was invented by the man who refused to go God&rsquo;s way and thereby lost God. Actually, its intrinsic factor was the instigation and incitement of Satan, God&rsquo;s enemy, within the man who departed from God. At the time of man&rsquo;s fall, Satan, the evil one, injected himself into man and embodied himself in sin to dwell in man&rsquo;s flesh. This was like an evil seed that was sown into man. This seed developed first into jealousy, then into anger, hatred, murder, and lies (Gen. 4:5-9), and then into lusts and violence (Gen. 4:19, 23). Eventually, it destroyed the entire human race.</p>
<p>This can be proved by Genesis 6:2, where we are told that the fallen angels assumed human bodies to marry the daughters of men. This verse shows us that man, who had left God and had thereby lost God, followed Satan and cooperated with Satan, even to the extent of being united with the angels of Satan. These angels of Satan used the human body to bring confusion into the human race through marriage, making the human race a mixture of human nature and the fallen spirits, thus inviting God&rsquo;s judgment in order to clear up the human race.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Representing All Human Cultures<br />
throughout the Ages</h2>
<p>Such a culture, which was without God and was united with Satan, became a model representing all human cultures throughout the ages and signifying that these cultures have departed from God and are without God, and that they have followed Satan and are united with Satan. The godless culture began as a seed in Genesis 4, and it will develop throughout the history of the entire human race until it consummates in Babylon the Great in Revelation 18, which also will be cleared away by God&rsquo;s judgment. This clearing away by God&rsquo;s judgment is Christ&rsquo;s judgment of the world at His coming back. Therefore, in Matthew 24:37-39 the Lord Jesus considered the judgment of the flood as a prefigure of His coming. He said, &ldquo;For as the days of Noah were, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be. For as they were in those days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and being given in marriage...until the flood came and took all away; so also shall the coming of the Son of Man be.&rdquo; This word shows us that the godless culture at the time of Noah will develop to its uttermost in the period of the Lord&rsquo;s coming. Hence, when the Lord comes back, He will again clear up and put in order the world and the entire human race.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE JUDGMENT OF THE DELUGE</h2>
<p>Satan, the enemy of God, instigated and utilized the man who departed from God, the man who refused to take God&rsquo;s way but rather took his own way, to produce a godless culture that corrupted the entire human race. As a result, the judgment of the deluge was brought in. This judgment has the following three implications.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. God Changing the Function of the Atmosphere</h2>
<p>In His creation, God used the atmosphere to make rain and to cause the rain to come down on the earth so that the different kinds of life, including the plant life, the animal life, and human life, might exist. Acts 14:17 says that God is &ldquo;doing good, giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.&rdquo; Also, Isaiah 55:10 says, &ldquo;For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater....&rdquo; These verses clearly indicate that the function of the atmosphere is to send down the rain for the maintaining of all the living creatures on the earth. However, when God used the flood to judge the corrupted human race, He changed the purpose of the function of the atmosphere so that it was no longer for the existence of man and all living creatures, but was for the executing of God&rsquo;s judgment to destroy mankind and the whole earth (Gen. 6:13).</p>
<p>This kind of judgment, a judgment for the purpose of destruction, also became a model, signifying that when man has been corrupted to the uttermost, God will again alter the function of the heavens and the earth, which He created, causing that function to be for man&rsquo;s destruction rather than for man&rsquo;s existence. In that day the earth and the heavens will shake, the sun will become black, the moon will become as blood, the stars of heaven will fall to the earth, and every mountain and island will be moved out of its place (Rev. 6:12-14). These supernatural calamities will cause the people on the earth to lose their safe dwelling places. Then God will go one step further to judge the earth, the sea, and the rivers, and the sun, moon, and stars (Rev. 8:7-12). These intensified, supernatural calamities will damage the earth, the sea, and the rivers, and the third part of the heavenly hosts, thus causing the earth, which was created by God for man&rsquo;s existence, to be no longer good for man&rsquo;s living. Eventually, God will use the most severe calamities, the calamities of the seven bowls, which signify God&rsquo;s wrath, to give full vent to His wrath, causing the sea, the rivers, and the springs to become blood, the sun to burn men, and the kingdom of Antichrist on the earth to become darkened (Rev. 16:3-10). Moreover, there will be the greatest earthquake and the greatest hail in human history (Rev. 16:18, 21). The heavens and the earth, instead of working for men, will become calamities that damage men. However, for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose, God will exercise restraint in His ultimate fury; otherwise, the entire earth with its inhabitants would be destroyed.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Destroying the Mixed Human Race</h2>
<p>As we have mentioned before, in the human culture that was without God and was united with Satan, man and the angels of Satan, the fallen angels, became mixed as one through human marriage. This caused the human race created by God to become mixed with the race of the evil spirits. Therefore, God used the judgment of the flood to destroy the entire human race, except Noah&rsquo;s family of eight. One of His intentions was to destroy the mixed human race, to clear up the human race and put it in order, thus restoring and preserving the purity of the human race, that He might still carry out His eternal economy through man according to His purpose in creating man.</p>
<p>This point also is a model, signifying that God&rsquo;s subsequent judgments are for clearing up the human race to preserve it for the accomplishing of His eternal purpose. For example, at His coming Christ will judge the people living on the earth to clear away the evil ones, the &ldquo;goats,&rdquo; separating them from the righteous ones, the &ldquo;sheep,&rdquo; and casting them into the lake of fire for perdition (Matt. 25:41, 46), after Antichrist and the false prophet are cast there (Rev. 19:20). Also, at the end of the millennium, God will judge and destroy the last group of people who follow Satan and rebel against God. He will clear them away from the rest of the nations, devouring them by fire, and will cast the devil, who deceived them, into the lake of fire and brimstone, where Antichrist and the false prophet will have been cast (Rev. 20:7-10). By so doing He will purge away the rebellious nature in mankind. Finally, after the millennium, at the judgment of the great white throne, God will cast all the dead, including all the dead people imprisoned in Hades and all the demons confined in the sea, and death and Hades into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:13-15). In this way God will clear up the universe completely.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Rescuing Those Who Took<br />
His Way of Redemption and Life</h2>
<p>God had a positive intention in judging the human race by the flood. His intention was to rescue out of the corrupted age those who took His way of redemption and life, that they might live for Him on the new earth, which came out of the judgment of the deluge. Therefore, 1 Peter 3:20-21 considers the judgment of the deluge a prefigure of the water of baptism in the New Testament. In this aspect also the judgment of the deluge is a model of the three judgments mentioned previously. On the positive side, the first of the three aforementioned judgments is to separate the righteous ones from the evil ones, that the righteous may enter into the millennium and live on the restored earth to be God&rsquo;s people for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s kingdom (Matt. 25:31-34). The second judgment is to separate the purified people, whom God desires, from the rebellious ones, thus clearing away the poison of rebellion against God, which was injected by Satan into people. Thus the purified human beings may enter into the new heaven and new earth and live on the new earth to be God&rsquo;s people forever for God&rsquo;s eternal kingdom, so that God and His redeemed and transformed people may carry out His kingship, and so that His glory may be manifested in them (Rev. 21:24; 22:5b). Finally, in the third judgment, the judgment of the great white throne, the positive purpose is to separate out the new people of the New Jerusalem and the purified people on the new earth, both of whom God will have obtained by then, for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal economy. At that time, the old heaven and old earth will be consumed by fire and will be renewed to be the new heaven and new earth (2 Pet. 3:10-13), in which will be the New Jerusalem as God&rsquo;s eternal expression.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>When man lost God and all the blessings that come from God, he became a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, a person who had no goal, no satisfaction, no rest, and no protection. Hence, man invented a godless culture apart from God for self-preservation, self-support, self-amusement, and self-defense. The intrinsic factor that caused the formation of the godless culture was Satan&rsquo;s instigation and incitement within the man who had left God. Man, who had left God and thereby lost God, followed Satan and cooperated with Satan, even to the extent of being united with the angels of Satan. This brought confusion into the human race through marriage, thus inviting God&rsquo;s judgment for the purpose of clearing up the human race. Such a culture, which was without God and was united with Satan, became a model representing all human cultures throughout the ages and signifying that these cultures have departed from God and are without God and that they have followed Satan and are united with Satan. Consequently, they will be cleared away and judged by God.</p>
<p>The man who departed from God and refused to take God&rsquo;s way produced a culture that corrupted the entire human race. As a result, the judgment of the deluge was brought in. In this judgment God changed the function of the atmosphere that He had created, so that it was no longer for the existence of man and all living creatures, but was for the executing of God&rsquo;s judgment to destroy mankind and the whole earth. God also used the judgment of the deluge to destroy the mixed human race so that the purity of the human race might be restored and preserved. God even used the flood to rescue out of the corrupted age those who took His way of redemption and life, that they might live for Him on the new earth, which came out of the judgment of the deluge.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>As far as spiritual representation and significance is concerned, among those who took God&rsquo;s way of life, Noah was the continuation of Enoch. Just as Enoch walked and lived with God, so also did Noah (Gen. 6:9). However, Noah took a further step&mdash;he worked with God to build the ark according to God&rsquo;s revelation for the preserving of the purified human race and the various living things on earth that God intended to keep (Gen. 6:14-22).</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. NOAH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Inheriting the Spiritual Blessings<br />
from His Forefathers to Maintain and Extend<br />
God&rsquo;s Way of Redemption and Life</h2>
<p>Noah was born into the human race that was corrupt to the uttermost, and he lived among that race. At that time, men abused their fallen bodies and became flesh. They were full of lusts (Gen. 6:3a, 5). As a result, the fallen angels joined themselves to man through illegal marriage, so that the human race was no longer pure but became a mixture of the human nature with fallen spirits (Gen. 6:2, 4). That was the most evil thing in the eyes of God, and He could not tolerate it.</p>
<p>But Noah found grace in the eyes of God (Gen. 6:8). Born into a godly family (cf. Gen. 5:4-29), he inherited the spiritual blessings from his forefathers and took God&rsquo;s way of redemption and life, including Adam&rsquo;s way of salvation, Abel&rsquo;s way of offering, Enosh&rsquo;s way of calling, and Enoch&rsquo;s way of walking with God. Moreover, by faith he became a righteous man in God&rsquo;s eyes and a perfect man who walked with God in that generation (Heb. 11:7; Gen. 6:9). Therefore, he maintained and extended God&rsquo;s way of life so that God could carry out His plan on the corrupted earth according to His desire.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Working with God<br />
to Accomplish the Salvation<br />
That Was Being Carried Out by God</h2>
<p>At a time when people on earth were corrupted to the uttermost, God was still able to find Noah, one who took His way of life, to cooperate and work with Him for the accomplishing of the salvation that was being carried out by Him for those who took His way of redemption and life. The ark, which Noah built by working with God and into which he entered, signifies God&rsquo;s salvation. Noah was saved before he began to build the ark, but he still needed to be saved further, from that corrupted world. The ark that he built terminated the old age and ushered in a new age. That ark was the salvation that Noah built, which saved him not only from God&rsquo;s judgment but also from that crooked and perverted generation. This corresponds with Philippians 2:12-16, where Paul said, &ldquo;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure....that you may become blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation.&rdquo; This kind of salvation not only is prepared by God, but also is worked out by those who take God&rsquo;s way of redemption and life, through their cooperation with God.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Becoming the Representative<br />
of All Those Who Work with God</h2>
<p>Noah built the ark for God at God&rsquo;s command and according to God&rsquo;s revelation. This shows that in order for God to work on the earth according to His economy, He must gain some who will walk and live with Him and who will cooperate, coordinate, and work with Him on the earth. As the mighty God (Isa. 9:6), He alone completed the work of creation, for He spoke, and it was done, and He commanded, and it stood fast (Psa. 33:9). However, for the carrying out of the work of building, He must gain some who will work with Him.</p>
<p>The principle is the same in God&rsquo;s building of the tabernacle, in His building of the temple, and in His recovering of the temple. In building the tabernacle, God found Moses to cooperate with Him (Exo. 25:1, 8-9); in building the temple, He found David and Solomon to coordinate with Him (1 Chron. 28:2; 2 Chron. 3:1-2); and in recovering the temple, He found Zerubbabel and Jeshua to work with Him (Ezra 3:8). In the New Testament age, it is the same with the building of the church. God must find those who will walk and live with Him, such as the apostles, to coordinate and work with Him (1 Cor. 3:9; 2 Cor. 6:1). It is only in this way that His divine building can be accomplished. Therefore, Noah too is a model in God&rsquo;s way of life. He represents all those who walk and live with God, who are found by God to work with Him on the earth, and through whom God may carry out the salvation that will accomplish His economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Becoming the Representative<br />
of Those Who Become Loose<br />
and Thereby Fall into Evil<br />
after Receiving God&rsquo;s Blessing</h2>
<p>After the flood God made a covenant with Noah, promising that He would never again destroy the earth by a flood, that the earth would remain to supply man&rsquo;s need, and that Noah&rsquo;s whole family would live on the earth peacefully (Gen. 8:20&mdash;9:17). Noah experienced great success and became the leader on the new land and the father of all mankind. Under such a blessing from God, Noah was at ease and became loose. He began to be a farmer and planted a vineyard (Gen. 9:20) to produce grapes, from which he would make wine. Then, because of his drunkenness he became naked within his tent (Gen. 9:21) and lost his covering in the eyes of God. His son Ham saw this and told his two brothers outside (Gen. 9:22). Because Ham exposed the failure of the head of the family and the leader of mankind, he and his descendants received the curse (Gen. 9:24-25, cf. v. 18). Out of Ham&rsquo;s cursed descendants men like Nimrod were produced (Gen. 10:6-9). The tragic result was that they fell into all kinds of evil, such as rebellion against God, opposition to God, and the bringing in of idols.</p>
<p>This matter is a negative model, signifying that throughout the ages those who seek after God and take God&rsquo;s way often become loose and thereby fall into evil after receiving God&rsquo;s blessing. What Solomon did in his old age is a strong example of this. When he was young, he was the wisest of all men, he built the temple, and he had great honor and glory. Yet in his old age he succumbed to the temptations of his Gentile wives to such an extent that he followed after other gods and built high places, provoking God to anger. This eventually created the tragedy of division and confusion among God&rsquo;s people and led to the fall of their nation and to their captivity in a Gentile land.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE ARK</h2>
<p>Before He destroyed the entire human race, which was corrupted to the uttermost in the godless culture invented by Cain and his descendants, God gave a revelation to Noah. In that revelation He told Noah to build an ark for Him so that He might carry out His salvation for the preserving of mankind and all the living things that He intended to keep.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Ark Built by Noah<br />
Being in Contrast<br />
to the City Built by Cain</h2>
<p>The ark that God wanted Noah to build was in contrast to the city that Cain built for self-preservation. The city was built by Cain himself for self-preservation, because man had lost God and all the blessings that come from Him, had taken the way of death, and had completely lost his sense of security. But the ark, which Noah built by working with God, was for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s salvation in His economy, because man possessed God and the spiritual blessings that come from Him, took God&rsquo;s way of redemption and life, and walked and lived with God. The city Cain built could protect him and his descendants, but it could not safeguard them from God&rsquo;s judgment, which would destroy mankind and the whole earth. However, the ark was able to save Noah and his whole family out of God&rsquo;s judgment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Building of the Ark Signifying<br />
the Building of Christ</h2>
<p>The ark, which God revealed to Noah that he was to build, is a type of Christ (1 Pet. 3:20-21). The spiritual implication of this is that if anyone walks, lives, and works with God, whatever he does must be, in principle, the building of Christ. The tabernacle built by Moses, the temple built by Solomon, and the temple recovered by Zerubbabel and Jeshua, also are types of Christ. Therefore, the work that they did in coordination with God was, in principle, the building of Christ, whom God intends to build in His economy. In particular, the church that is being built today by those who work together with God is the practical building of Christ, that is, the building of Christ&rsquo;s Body as God&rsquo;s habitation (Eph. 4:12; 2:22), with the essence and element of Christ&rsquo;s riches as the building material. This building is also the working of Christ into people to build them together by Christ that they may become God&rsquo;s manifestation in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:15-16).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Ark Being a Symbol<br />
of the Salvation<br />
Accomplished in God&rsquo;s Economy</h2>
<p>The city built by Cain is a symbol of the godless culture invented by fallen men who are far away from God, whereas the ark built by Noah is a symbol of the salvation accomplished in God&rsquo;s economy. The city in the godless culture caused man to suffer God&rsquo;s destruction, whereas the ark in the salvation in God&rsquo;s economy caused man to be preserved by God. Even among the people on earth today, these two things are still in contrast to one another and are still going on. Those who refuse to take God&rsquo;s way of redemption and choose the way of death are building the city in the godless culture, which will be consummated in Babylon the Great (Rev. 18:2) and eventually will be consumed and completely destroyed by the burning fire (Rev. 18:8, 21). But those who take God&rsquo;s way of redemption and life are building Christ, who is in the salvation in God&rsquo;s economy, and their building work will ultimately be consummated in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2), which is the mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed ones. Such a building is mysterious, divine, and glorious, and it will remain for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Noah carried on from Enosh to walk and live with God. However, he took a further step&mdash;he worked with God to build the ark. He was born into the human race that was corrupt to the uttermost. But, finding grace in the eyes of God, he inherited the spiritual blessings from his forefathers and maintained and extended God&rsquo;s way of redemption and life. Therefore, God found Noah to cooperate and work with Him for the accomplishing of the salvation that was being carried out by Him for those who took the way of redemption and life. That salvation was the building of the ark, and it saved Noah not only from God&rsquo;s judgment but also from that crooked and perverted generation. It not only was prepared by God, but also was worked out by those who took the way of redemption and life, through their cooperation with God. Thus, Noah became the representative of those who work with God. After the flood, he became loose because he was at ease. Then he got drunk and became naked, losing his covering in the eyes of God and bringing a curse upon his son Ham and Ham&rsquo;s descendants. This negative model shows that throughout the ages those who seek after God and take God&rsquo;s way often become loose and fall into evil after receiving God&rsquo;s blessing. The ark Noah built was in contrast to the city Cain built. Cain&rsquo;s city could not safeguard Cain and his descendants from God&rsquo;s judgment, but the ark was able to save Noah and his family out of God&rsquo;s judgment. The ark is a type of Christ. Therefore, if anyone walks, lives, and works with God, whatever he does is, in principle, the building of Christ. The ark is the symbol of the salvation accomplished in God&rsquo;s economy.

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Among the first group of historical figures in the Old Testament&mdash;as recorded in Genesis, the book in which the seeds of the divine truths are sown&mdash;on the negative side, besides the godless culture invented by Cain and his descendants, there are Nimrod and the tower of Babel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. NIMROD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Born under the Curse and Walking in Death</h2>
<p>Nimrod was a descendant of Ham, the cursed one among the three sons of Noah (Gen. 10:6-8). According to Nimrod&rsquo;s genealogy, he was not a descendant of Cain, yet according to the way that he took, he did not follow his forefather Noah to take the way of God&rsquo;s redemption and life; rather, he followed those who were in the genealogy of Cain to take the way of godlessness and death, a way in which everything is out of death, lies in death, and is unto death, and in which everything is without God and has nothing to do with God.</p>
<p>Ham, a son of Noah, received the curse by exposing his father&rsquo;s shame and thereby rebelling against the God-established authority. God is a God of order and government. In His creation, everything is in good order, and this order is related to His government. Noah was God&rsquo;s deputy authority on the earth at that time. By exposing the nakedness of his father, Noah, Ham violated God&rsquo;s government. Hence, he and his descendants were cursed.</p>
<p>Since Nimrod was a descendant of Ham, who was cursed, and since he took Cain&rsquo;s way of godlessness and death, according to his genealogy, Nimrod was cursed, and according to the godless way that he took, he deserved death and God&rsquo;s destruction.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being a Mighty One on the Earth<br />
and Building a Kingdom</h2>
<p>Nimrod was the first king and the first one to build a kingdom. He was on the way of death and was under the curse, yet he became a mighty one on the earth (Gen. 10:8). He was utilized by Satan, took the lead to abuse the authority given to man by God, set himself up as king, ruled over others, and built a kingdom. He built a kingdom beginning at Babel in the land of Shinar (Gen. 10:10), and he also built the city of Nineveh in the land of Asshur (Gen. 10:11-12). In giving man authority to rule over others, God did not intend for man to form nations; His intention was to maintain peace among men. However, Nimrod misused this authority, using it to raise up a kingdom on the earth.</p>
<p>Nimrod&rsquo;s building of a kingdom resulted in division among Noah&rsquo;s descendants. After the flood, God had only one deputy authority on the earth, and that was Noah, who represented God, the true Head. At that time, there was only one family, and there was only one head. They were absolutely one. However, after Nimrod took the lead to build a kingdom and to rule as king over others, the descendants of Noah were divided into many nations (Gen. 10:32) according to their generations, having many kings ruling and controlling them. The result was division.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Bringing In an Idolatry<br />
That Spread throughout the Earth</h2>
<p>History tells us that at Babel, Nimrod brought in many idolatrous things. In that idolatrous worship he invented a most evil emblem, the Madonna with her child. According to the book <em>The Two Babylons,</em> the Madonna was the mother of Nimrod and was also his wife. This emblem, invented in the Babylonian worship, spread throughout the earth&mdash;to Egypt, India, Greece, Rome, Tibet, China, and Japan. It has even pervaded Roman Catholicism. The emblem of a mother embracing her child is found in Catholic cathedrals and in Buddhist idol temples. It has been utilized by Satan to deceive fallen people and rob them of their worship to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Becoming the Representative<br />
of All Those Who Take the Godless Way<br />
and Are Independent of God</h2>
<p>Among the first group of historical figures, Nimrod was indeed a negative model, indicating that all those after him who took the godless way and were independent of God were like him&mdash;they were born under the curse, walked in death, were utilized by Satan, God&rsquo;s enemy, became mighty ones, formed nations, and brought in idolatry. Some formed political nations and brought in secular idols, such as images of birds, beasts, and human beings. Others formed religious nations and brought in the so-called sacred idols, such as images of the Holy Mother, Saint Peter, Saint Paul, and Saint Francis.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. BABEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Rebelling against God<br />
and Being Confounded in Language</h2>
<p>Babel, which was in the land of Shinar in Chaldea (Gen. 10:10; 11:2), was the birthplace of idolatry on earth (Josh. 24:2). The city of Babel was the dwelling place and protection of the idolatrous people, and the tower of Babel was for the purpose of making a name for the people and for declaring their rebellion and opposition against God (Gen. 11:4-5, 9). As a result, they were judged by God&mdash;their language was confounded, and they were scattered throughout the earth (Gen. 11:7-9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Developing into Babylon,<br />
Which Destroyed God&rsquo;s City and Temple</h2>
<p>The kingdom that Nimrod built, beginning at Babel, was enlarged into the Babylon in the Old Testament at the time of King Nebuchadnezzar. King Nebuchadnezzar mobilized his troops to invade Jerusalem. He brought the nation of Judah to ruin, destroyed the city and temple of God, and even seized the holy vessels, the vessels for the service of God in the temple, and placed them in the temple of the idols in Babylon (Dan. 1:1-2; 2 Kings 25:8-9, 14-15). That was an insult to God. Hence, the prophets predicted that Babylon would suffer God&rsquo;s vengeance and that her broad walls would be utterly broken (Jer. 51:58), as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. She would never be inhabited, nor would she be dwelt in from generation to generation; only evil things, such as wild beasts, ostriches, wild goats, wolves, and jackals, would be there (Isa. 13:19-22; Jer. 50:39-40). Babylon became such an evil and devilish place not only because of her idolatry and rebellion against God, but also because she destroyed God&rsquo;s city and temple and carried away into captivity God&rsquo;s people and the holy vessels.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Becoming the Material Babylon the Great<br />
and Being Mixed with<br />
the Religious Babylon the Great</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals three aspects of Babylon: the literal, ancient Babylon, the material Babylon the Great, and the religious Babylon the Great. All three developed out of Babel. The material Babylon refers to the city of Rome; the religious Babylon refers to the Roman Catholic Church, which has copied many practices of Judaism and has assimilated many elements of paganism. In Revelation 17 and 18 the material Babylon is mixed with the religious Babylon. On the one hand, the female in chapter seventeen is a prostitute (17:1), signifying the apostate Roman Catholic Church; on the other hand, she is a woman (17:18), signifying the physical city of Rome. In 18:3 both of these aspects are mentioned. This verse says, &ldquo;For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the fury of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the power of her luxury.&rdquo; <em>The nations have drunk of the wine...and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her</em> refers to the religious aspect, whereas <em>the merchants of the earth have become rich by the power of her luxury</em> refers to the material aspect.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the New Testament the material Babylon, which came out of Babel, is mixed with the religious Babylon and is filled with religious confusion and idolatry. Revelation 17:4a says, &ldquo;The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet.&rdquo; Purple is a blend of blue and red; it signifies the blending of heavenly things with earthly. This is the appearance of the Roman Catholic Church. Moreover, the woman is &ldquo;gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication&rdquo; (Rev. 17:4b). Gold, precious stone, and pearls are the materials with which the New Jerusalem is built. But the woman is only gilded with these treasures as an ornament for outward display and a false appearance as a deception to attract people. She does have something of God in appearance. But within, her golden cup is full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication, full of idolatry, pagan practices, and the filthiness of heresies and sins.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church is full of idols. People can pray to any idol they choose. Some of the idols were brought in from paganism. For example, the Mary whom they worship is actually the embodiment of the goddess Venus in Greek mythology. The book <em>The Two Babylons</em> points out that the evil emblem that Nimrod invented was brought into the Catholic Church and appears as a picture of Mary and Jesus, and that the celebration of the birthday of the sun was brought in and became Christmas. In his book <em>The Great Prophecies,</em> G. H. Pember points out that even Buddha became a saint in the Roman Catholic Church under the name of Saint Josaphat. Hence, the Roman Catholic Church has become the mother of the religious prostitutes and the abominations (idols) of the earth.</p>
<p>At the end of this age, when the great tribulation begins, Antichrist will persecute the religious Babylon, the Roman Catholic Church, and &ldquo;shall make her desolate and naked,&rdquo; that is, shall destroy her, rob her other riches, and expose her; they &ldquo;shall eat her flesh,&rdquo; that is, shall kill her members; and they &ldquo;shall burn her utterly with fire,&rdquo; that is, shall annihilate her altogether (Rev. 17:16). This is the judgment of God on the religious Babylon. Furthermore, at His coming Christ will destroy the material Babylon, the city of Rome, with &ldquo;great authority&rdquo; (Rev. 18:1), making her &ldquo;a dwelling place of demons and a hold of every unclean spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird&rdquo; (Rev. 18:2). She will be condemned and cursed just as ancient Babylon was and will no longer be a fit dwelling place for human beings. Therefore, everyone who has been saved by grace must &ldquo;come out of her&rdquo; that he may not &ldquo;participate in her sins&rdquo; or &ldquo;receive of her plagues&rdquo; (Rev. 18:4).</p><h2 class="head2">D. Becoming a Model<br />
of All Man-made Organizations</h2>
<p>Hence, the city of Babel is a negative type, signifying that all man-made organizations among the human race, whether secular or religious, are for making a name for man himself and for opposing God, and that they are full of fornication and idolatry. As a result, they will be judged by God&mdash;they will be confounded and scattered.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Nimrod was a descendant of Ham, who was cursed, and he also took Cain&rsquo;s way of godlessness and death. Hence, according to his genealogy, he was cursed, and according to the godless way that he took, he deserved death and God&rsquo;s destruction. He became a mighty one on the earth, one who was utilized by Satan, took the lead to abuse the authority given to man by God, set himself up as a king, ruled over others, and built a kingdom, bringing in division among Noah&rsquo;s descendants. At Babel he brought in many idolatrous things and invented a most evil emblem, the Madonna with her child, which has been utilized by Satan to deceive fallen people and rob them of their worship to God. He was indeed a negative type, indicating that all those after him who took the godless way and were independent of God were like him&mdash; they were born under the curse, walked in death, became mighty ones, formed nations, and brought in idolatry.</p>
<p>Babel was the birthplace of idolatry on earth. The city of Babel was the dwelling place and protection of the idolatrous people, and the tower of Babel was for the purpose of making themselves a name. As a result, they were judged by God&mdash; their language was confounded and they were scattered throughout the earth. Later, Babel developed into Babylon, which destroyed God&rsquo;s city and temple and was cursed by God, becoming an evil and devilish place. In the New Testament, the material Babylon, which came out of Babel, is mixed with the religious Babylon. At the end of this age, Antichrist will persecute the religious Babylon, the Roman Catholic Church, annihilating her altogether. At His coming, Christ will destroy the material Babylon, the city of Rome. Hence, Babel signifies that all man-made organizations among the human race, whether secular or religious, are for making a name for man himself and for opposing God, and that they are full of fornication and idolatry. Because of this, they will be judged by God&mdash;they will be confounded and scattered.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Abraham and Lot represent two categories of people who answer God&rsquo;s calling, and the two ways that they take with the two kinds of results. Those who answer God&rsquo;s calling may take the way of faith by following God, or they may take the way of turning back to the world by themselves. Those who take the former way are under a blessing, and those who take the latter suffer loss and receive a curse.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. ABRAHAM</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Called to Be the Father of a New Race</h2>
<p>After no more than ten generations and through a period of approximately three hundred years (Gen. 11:10-26), the descendants of Noah&rsquo;s family, which was separated from the corrupted world by the judgment of the flood, departed from God&rsquo;s way and fell into Babel, an evil realm that was filled with idols. As a result, they could no longer be used by God to carry out His economy on earth. Thus, in the land of idolatry God called Abraham out from the idolatrous people (Josh. 24:2), telling him to go out of the land of idolatry and out from his idolatrous kindred and his father&rsquo;s house, and to come into the land that God would show him (Acts 7:2-3), the land of Canaan. This was God&rsquo;s new beginning with fallen man, and it was also a new beginning for the one who was fallen and was called. God gave up the created Adamic race and called Abraham with his descendants that they might be a new race; thus, with the called race God was able to continue His eternal purpose. In this way, Abraham became the father of the new, called race.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Justified by Faith</h2>
<p>Abraham was in a place and environment that were far from God, fallen, and idolatrous. However, because the God of glory appeared to him (Acts 7:2), he was able by faith to accept God&rsquo;s calling and obey God to go out from his country, his kindred, and his father&rsquo;s house. He went out from Chaldea without knowing where he was going (Heb. 11:8). Thus, he had to trust in God for His instant leading, taking God&rsquo;s presence as the map by which he traveled. When he arrived at the place that God had promised to show him, he could not immediately possess the land. So, by faith he dwelt in tents as a foreigner in that land, as in a land not his own (Heb. 11:9), and believed God&rsquo;s word of promise: that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars. Because of such faith he was justified by God (Gen. 15:4-6; Rom. 4:3) and became the father of all who are justified by faith (Rom. 4:11-12).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Living by Faith</h2>
<p>Abraham, the father of faith, believed the God who gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being (Rom. 4:17). Being about a hundred years of age, he considered himself and his wife old and unable to beget children; yet he was not weakened in faith, but was fully persuaded that God could give him a seed (Rom. 4:19, 21). Wherefore also there was born of him, as of one who had become dead, even as the stars of heaven in multitude, and as the sand by the seashore innumerable (Heb. 11:12). This was Abraham&rsquo;s believing that God is able to call the things not being as being.</p>
<p>After Abraham received a son, Isaac, from the God who calls things not being as being, he was tested by God, who told Him to offer up his only begotten son to Him as a burnt offering (Gen. 22:2). He obeyed and offered up Isaac (Gen. 22:9-10), believing that God was able to raise him from among the dead, whence he also received him back in a figure (Heb. 11:19). This was Abraham&rsquo;s believing that God is able to give life to the dead. Thus, he, as the father of faith, took the way of faith, and the life he lived was the life of faith. By faith he lived as a sojourner in the land, always pitching a tent and building an altar and calling on the name of Jehovah (Gen. 12:7-8; 13:3-4, 18). His building an altar meant that he offered everything to God that he might have fellowship with God, worship God, and serve God. His pitching a tent indicated that he did not belong to this world; rather, he testified to the people who had built a city and a tower to declare their own name that his living was for God and that he was only a stranger and a sojourner on the earth. He waited for the city which has the foundations (Heb. 11:10), that is, the New Jerusalem. Hence, his tent was a miniature of the New Jerusalem. As he lived in that tent, he was living in a miniature of the New Jerusalem. His tent became the place where he had fellowship with God (cf. Gen. 18). Thus, by faith he built an altar and pitched a tent, and walked and lived before God.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Living in Fellowship with God</h2>
<p>As a person who walked and lived before God, Abraham lived in fellowship with God (Gen. 18) as one who called on the name of Jehovah, the living God (Gen. 21:33). The third altar that he built for Jehovah was at the oaks of Mamre, which were in Hebron (Gen. 13:18). <em>Hebron</em> means &ldquo;fellowship.&rdquo; Abraham&rsquo;s building an altar and staying in Hebron shows that he not only worshipped and served God but also lived in constant fellowship with God. Hence, it was at the oaks of Mamre that God appeared to him in a human form (Gen. 18:1-21). God considered Abraham His intimate friend (Isa. 41:8; James 2:23), and Abraham welcomed God as a friend, inviting God to rest under the tree in front of his tent, preparing water that God might wash His feet for His refreshment, and feeding God with a rich meal for His satisfaction. Furthermore, he received revelation from God regarding the birth of Isaac and the destruction of Sodom. The birth of Isaac is related to Christ, and the destruction of Sodom is related to God&rsquo;s judgment on sin. God showed Abraham that, in order to accomplish His plan for the fulfillment of His purpose, Christ had to come and sin had to go. This is the important revelation that Abraham received as he lived in fellowship with God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Fighting and Interceding for His Brother</h2>
<p>As a person who lived by faith in fellowship with God, Abraham was able to overcome the striving of his brother and to give in to his brother (Gen. 13:7-11). He knew that he was in the hand of God and under the care of God. Therefore, when his herdsmen strove with Lot&rsquo;s herdsmen, he trusted in God&rsquo;s care, not striving for himself or choosing for himself. He even fought for his brother (Gen. 14:12-16). After Lot separated himself from Abraham, pitched his tent toward Sodom, and was taken captive, Abraham took three hundred and eighteen men from his house to fight against the four kings and their armies. With a small number he defeated a much larger number of men and thereby rescued Lot. Then God supplied Abraham&rsquo;s need in a timely manner, sending His priest, Melchisedec, to minister bread and wine to him and to bless him (Gen. 14:17-20). Abraham&rsquo;s victory adjusted and restored the entire situation, and testified to the fact that God is the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth. Abraham also went one step further, overcoming the temptation of earthly possessions (Gen. 14:22-23).</p>
<p>Although Lot went back to Sodom after he was rescued, Abraham never lost his concern for him. Hence, in his fellowship with God, when he heard that God would destroy Sodom, he repeatedly interceded before God for Lot (Gen. 18:22-32). As a result, when God overthrew Sodom, He remembered Abraham&rsquo;s intercession and delivered Lot from destruction (Gen. 19:29).</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Favored by God with the Covenant of Promise</h2>
<p>As a person who walked and lived by faith and in fellowship with God, Abraham was favored by God with the promise that all the families of the earth would be blessed in his seed and that he also would become one who would be blessed and not be cursed (Gen. 22:18; 12:2-3). This is the covenant of promise that God made with Abraham. It was the precursor of the covenant of grace in the New Testament, and it was also connected with that covenant. Hence, the New Testament says that by giving Abraham the covenant of promise, God preached the gospel to him, saying that all those from among the nations who would believe into his seed, Christ, would be blessed with him (Gal. 3:8-9); that is, they would receive the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, who reaches us (Gal. 3:14).</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Still Having Defects and Weaknesses</h2>
<p>Abraham was one who had faith in God, walked and lived by faith, lived in fellowship with God, and called on the name of Jehovah. Yet, even such a one, when he encountered temptation, left the place appointed by God and went downhill, going down to Egypt, where he even lied by telling the truth, caring not for his wife but for himself (Gen. 12:10-20). In that failure he was kept by God (Gen. 12:17-19) and learned the lesson that God took care of him in every situation. After that failure Abraham lived in intimate fellowship with God (Gen. 18). However, a short time later he repeated the same failure by journeying toward the south, toward Egypt. Moreover, he again used his old tactic and thereby exposed his hidden weakness, which was to sacrifice his wife for his own preservation. However, God still cared for him. He delivered Abraham and his wife from evil and considered him His prophet who would pray for the barren one, though he and his wife also were barren at that time (Gen. 20). His experience tells us that even such a great man of faith still needed God&rsquo;s mercy and care. Abraham&rsquo;s story was a model. Throughout the ages, many who have fully believed in God and have lived in God&rsquo;s presence by faith have had the same defect and weakness that Abraham had, yet they have still received God&rsquo;s mercy and care and have even been used by God to minister God&rsquo;s blessing to others.</p><h2 class="head2">H. Still Not Having the Maturity in Life</h2>
<p>The foregoing weakness manifested by Abraham shows us further that, although he was a great man who had faith in God, he had not matured in the spiritual life. That he was immature can be proved also by the fact that he remarried and begot children after Sarah&rsquo;s death (Gen. 25:1-2). This also is a negative model, showing that a person may be called, have faith, live in fellowship with God, and be led by God in his living and actions, yet he may not be fully transformed and may not be a complete pattern.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. Signifying the Initial Stage<br />
of the Experience and Life<br />
of a Spiritually Mature Person</h2>
<p>As one of the historical figures in the Bible, Abraham cannot signify a complete, spiritually mature person; he can signify only the initial stage of the experience and life of a spiritually mature person, a stage that includes such experiences as God&rsquo;s calling, justification by faith, living the life of faith, and the living that is in fellowship with God. Isaac and Jacob with Joseph were still needed to complete the latter stage in the experience and life of a complete, spiritually mature person. This latter stage includes the inheriting of grace, not using self-effort, and the restful enjoyment of the riches of Christ, signified by Isaac; being dealt with by God, transformation, and maturity, signified by Jacob; and reigning for God, signified by Joseph. Hence, although the Triune God is one, He became the God of those three persons&mdash;the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob (Exo. 3:15). In spiritual significance, those three represent the three aspects of a spiritually mature person, just as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the three aspects of the one unique God. The God of Abraham denotes mainly God the Father, the God of Isaac denotes mainly God the Son, and the God of Jacob denotes mainly God the Spirit. The three aspects of the Triune God are for, and they also correspond to, the three parts of the experience and life of a complete, spiritually mature person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. LOT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Not Having God&rsquo;s Clear Calling</h2>
<p>Lot was Abraham&rsquo;s nephew (Gen. 11:31; 12:5); he received God&rsquo;s grace with Abraham, and they became brothers before God (Gen. 13:8; 14:14). Although Lot was never clearly called by God as Abraham was, he participated in God&rsquo;s calling simply because he was willing to follow his uncle, who was called. According to the record in Genesis, Abraham took care of Lot as a brother before the Lord. Of course, in taking by faith the way of God&rsquo;s redemption and life, Lot must have received help from Abraham.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Taking the Way of Going Back to the World</h2>
<p>Although Lot followed Abraham to take the way of faith in God, because the two had many flocks and herds and great substance, Abraham&rsquo;s herdsmen and Lot&rsquo;s herdsmen strove with one another and were not in accord. Abraham gave in to Lot, seeing him as a brother; yet Lot, tempted by material substance, chose, based on his sight, the land that was rich and well watered and thus separated himself from Abraham (Gen. 13:6, 8-11), taking the way of going back to the world. Although he did not return to Chaldea, a place of idols, or go down to Egypt, a place of worldly riches and pleasure, he was attracted by Sodom, a city of sin. Perhaps he knew that Sodom was exceedingly wicked and sinful before God, yet he still moved there gradually (Gen. 13:12-13). Although he was warned and disciplined after Abraham rescued him from his captivity, into which he had been taken because of his staying in Sodom (Gen. 14:12-16), he did not go back to Abraham. Rather, he still missed Sodom and went back to the wicked city that was condemned by God. He even lived there and was a local leader, as indicated by his sitting in the gate of the city (Gen. 19:1), until Sodom was judged by God and destroyed by the burning fire (Gen. 19:1-25).</p><h2 class="head2">C. Being Rescued from the Destruction<br />
of the Burning Fire</h2>
<p>When God overthrew Sodom, He remembered Abraham and heard his intercession. Hence, Lot was saved from the destruction of the burning fire (Gen. 19:27-29). His wife, however, became a pillar of salt (Gen. 19:26), which is a sign of shame, and his two sons-in-law also were destroyed in the burning fire (Gen. 19:14-15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Not Coming Back to Abraham<br />
to Be Helped Again</h2>
<p>Although God rescued Lot because He remembered Abraham&rsquo;s intercession (Gen. 19:29), Lot, after being rescued, did not go back to Abraham to be helped again to follow God by faith. He acted on his own and, still exercising his own choice, he begged the angels to allow him to flee to a small, nearby city named Zoar. Eventually, he took his two daughters with him and dwelt in a cave in a desolate mountain. There, in a cave, where he was separated from his brother and was alienated from God, he became drunk under the manipulating of his two daughters, who had been influenced and corrupted by the wickedness of Sodom and thereby had lost their sense of shame. Hence, he committed incest and brought forth two sons, who were cursed by God to such an extent that even to their tenth generation they were not allowed to enter into the congregation of Jehovah forever (Gen. 19:30-38; Deut. 23:3). This was the issue of his taking the way of alienation from God, after having been warned twice and still not coming back to Abraham.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Becoming a Warning to Those<br />
Who Take God&rsquo;s Way of Life</h2>
<p>Lot was a righteous man who believed in God, and he was also oppressed by the licentious manner of life of the Sodomites (2 Pet. 2:7-8). However, he could not do anything about it; moreover, he had lost his position to help them. This is proved by the fact that his sons-in-law considered his word as mockery (Gen. 19:14). Even so, he still was not willing to depart from the evil place of fornication and come back to the place where he could have fellowship with Abraham, bear God&rsquo;s testimony with him, and be kept and blessed by God. These various aspects of his life, on both the positive side and the negative side, all have become a model, serving as a warning to those who would later take God&rsquo;s way of life by faith.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Abraham and Lot represent two categories of people who answer God&rsquo;s calling, and the two ways that they take with the two kinds of results. Abraham was the father of the new, called race. Because God appeared to him, by faith Abraham accepted God&rsquo;s calling and obeyed God to go out from his country, his kindred, and his father&rsquo;s house. When he arrived at the place that God had promised to show him, he could not immediately possess the land. So, by faith he dwelt in the land as a foreigner, and he believed God&rsquo;s word of promise: that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars. Thus he was justified by God and became the father of all who are justified by faith. Abraham took the way of faith and lived the life of faith. The way he took was the way of faith, and the life he lived was the life of faith. Furthermore, he lived in fellowship with God, and God considered him His intimate friend and supplied his need in a timely manner. Abraham overcame the striving of his brother and gave in to his brother, and he fought and interceded for his brother and was heard by God. As a person who lived by faith and in fellowship with God, he was favored by God with the promise that all the families of the earth would be blessed in his seed and that he also would become one who would be blessed and not be cursed. Although he was a great man who had faith in God, he still had defects and weaknesses and was not fully mature in the spiritual life. Hence, he cannot signify a complete, spiritually mature person; he can signify only the initial stage of the experience and life of a spiritually mature person. Isaac and Jacob with Joseph were still needed to complete the latter stage in the experience and life of a complete, spiritually mature person. In spiritual significance, these three represent the three aspects of a spiritually mature person.</p>
<p>Lot was never clearly called by God, but he participated in God&rsquo;s calling simply because he was willing to follow Abraham. However, he took the way of going back to the world, and he entered into Sodom, a city that was extremely wicked and sinful. Later, although he was rescued twice through Abraham, he did not go back to him to be helped again to follow God by faith. Instead, he took his two daughters with him and dwelt in a cave, where he was separated from his brother and was alienated from God. There he became drunk under the manipulating of his two daughters, who had been influenced and corrupted by sin and thereby had lost their sense of shame. Hence, he committed incest and brought forth two sons, who were cursed by God. These aspects of his life became a model, serving as a warning to those who would later take God&rsquo;s way of life by faith.</p>

</ol>
<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Sodom, the city to which Lot moved after leaving Abraham, was very wicked and sinful before God (Gen. 13:13). The situation of Sodom is the second aspect showing how utterly fallen and corrupted Noah&rsquo;s descendants became under the curse. Eventually, they were judged by God with burning fire, and their end was destruction (Gen. 18:20; 19:24-25). Sodom portrays the end&mdash;corruption&mdash;of the fallen men who were not in God&rsquo;s grace. The judgment by burning fire indicates that God, as a consuming fire, will destroy such corrupted people and will not tolerate their existence.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. SODOM</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. A Place Full of Fornication</h2>
<p>The first aspect of the ultimate corruption of Noah&rsquo;s cursed descendants was seen at Babel, a place full of idolatry; the second aspect was seen at Sodom, a place full of fornication (Gen. 10:19; 18:20; 19:4-9). Idol worship always brings in and goes along with fornication (Num. 25:1-2; Rev. 2:20). All the people who worship idols are careless regarding the matter of fornication. Their idol worship ushers them into fornication. Quite often in China, in front of the idol temples, where people worshipped idols, operas with stories of fornication were performed. In the book of Numbers, when the Israelites worshipped idols, they committed fornication (Num. 25:1-2). Therefore, the worshipping of idols brings in fornication, and fornication ushers in idolatry.</p>
<p>During Noah&rsquo;s time, some of the fallen angels came to the earth and committed fornication with the daughters of men (Gen. 6:2). When Lot dwelt in Sodom, the Sodomites, in the same manner as the fallen angels, gave themselves over to fornication (Jude 7), even males with males, working shame toward one another shamelessly (Gen. 19:4-9; Rom. 1:27). This is contrary to what God ordained for human marriage according to the nature of His creation (Gen. 2:18-24). Marriage is a holy thing. God instituted marriage in order to maintain the human race, which He created for His purpose. Therefore, we must hold marriage in honor (Heb. 13:4). God has ordained a holy principle regarding marriage&mdash;the principle of one husband for one wife&mdash;in order to keep the human race in a proper condition for the fulfillment of His purpose. But the Sodomites did not care for the holy principle ordained by God. Leaving the natural use of the female, the males craved one another and defiled their own bodies. Their sinfulness was so great that God had to intervene and judge them by burning fire.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Signifying the Sinful Aspect of the World</h2>
<p>For those who take God&rsquo;s way by faith, Genesis uses three places to signify the world. Chaldea, a place of idols, signifies the aspect of the idolatry of the world (Josh. 24:2); Egypt, a place of rich produce, signifies the aspect of the material riches of the world (Gen. 12:10); and Sodom, a city of fornication and sin, signifies the aspect of the sinfulness of the world (Gen. 13:13). These three places formed a triangular boundary around the land of Canaan, each side having its own attractiveness. We, God&rsquo;s called ones, live within such a triangle and must be careful lest we fall back to the land of idols, go down to the place of worldly pleasure, or drift into the city of sin.</p>
<p>Lot left idolatrous Chaldea and did not go down to materially rich Egypt. Nevertheless, he fell into sinful Sodom. Consequently, in seeing and hearing the lawless works of Sodom, he tormented his soul day after day (2 Pet. 2:7-8); yet he was not able to render the people of Sodom any help. His wife, by looking back on the wicked place condemned by God, became a pillar of salt (Gen. 19:17, 26). His two daughters, having been corrupted under the influence of sin, lost their sense of shame to such an extent that they even manipulated their father and bore children through him by incest (Gen. 19:31-38). Consequently, to the tenth generation their descendants were not allowed to enter into the congregation of Jehovah or to serve the Lord (Deut. 23:3). The sinful Sodom brought a tragic end to the family of Lot.</p><h2 class="head2">C. A Place under a Curse</h2>
<p>The idolatrous people of Babel were the descendants of Cush, the son of Ham (Gen. 10:6-10), whereas the wicked people of Sodom were the descendants of Canaan, another son of Ham (Gen. 10:15-16, 19; 15:19-21). These two groups of people were all descendants who were under a curse (Gen. 9:18, 22, 24-25). Therefore, Sodom was not only a place that brought man under the contamination of sin; it was also a place that brought man under a curse.</p>
<p>Lot followed Abraham and left Babel and the descendants of Cush. Upon arriving at God&rsquo;s promised land, he should have lived with Abraham a life of pitching a tent and of building an altar. He should not have gone into any city in Canaan, that he might avoid being mixed with the cursed descendants of Canaan. Sodom was a sinful city inhabited by the descendants of Canaan, yet Lot left Abraham and moved into it, mixing with the Canaanites, who were cursed by God. Thus, he caused his whole family to become involved and to come under a curse.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE JUDGMENT BY BURNING FIRE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Connected to the Punishment<br />
of the Lake of Fire</h2>
<p>Sinful Sodom was not only a place full of fornication but also a place under a curse. Being wicked to the uttermost, it was judged by God with burning fire. God rained upon Sodom brimstone and fire out of heaven and overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground (Gen. 19:24-25). The descendants of Cain had become so utterly corrupt that they were judged by God by means of the flood (Gen. 6:11-13), whereas the cursed descendants of Noah were so utterly wicked that they were judged by God with burning fire. The judgment of the flood was a destruction at that time mainly for the purging of the human race and the earth. The judgment by burning fire is connected to the punishment of the lake of fire mainly to show that God cannot tolerate the existence of the people of fornication.</p>
<p>In nature, the judgment by burning fire belongs to the punishment of the lake of fire. After the millennium and before the new heaven and new earth, God will execute a final judgment upon man. All the dead will be resurrected to stand before the great white throne (John 5:28-29; Rev. 20:11-12). If anyone is not found written in the book of life, he will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:15) and will suffer forever &ldquo;where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched&rdquo; (Mark 9:48).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Burning Fire Being Related to God&rsquo;s Holiness</h2>
<p>The flood is related to God&rsquo;s care for man, because He caused the rain, by which He cared for man, to become the flood, by which He destroyed man. Fire is related to God&rsquo;s holiness, because the holy God is a consuming fire (Heb. 12:29). God is holy; holiness is the condition of His nature. Whatever does not correspond with His holy nature, whatever is common, unclean, and sinful, will be burned by the holy God as the consuming fire. After man&rsquo;s first fall, the way to the tree of life was guarded by a flaming sword; at God&rsquo;s last judgment, there will be the lake of fire. These are all related to God&rsquo;s holiness in order to show that God is holy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Judgment by Burning Fire Never Ceasing</h2>
<p>When God destroyed the earth by the flood, He was grieved for man (Gen. 6:6); when God consumed Sodom with burning fire, He was angry with man (Gen. 19:15). Thus, in relation to their significance, the judgment by burning fire is more severe than the judgment of the flood. The judgment of the flood, which God executed because of His grief for man, took place only that one time. Afterward, God covenanted with man that He would never again destroy the earth by a flood (Gen. 9:11, 15). However, the judgment by burning fire, which God executes because of His wrath toward man, began with the burning of Sodom; thereafter, the fire of that judgment has continued to burn and will never cease. When the two sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, offered strange fire before the Lord, fire went out from the Lord and devoured them (Lev. 10:1-2). When the Israelites complained in the wilderness, God heard it, and His anger was kindled. His fire burned among them and consumed those in the uttermost parts of the camp (Num. 11:1). When Korah and his company gathered themselves together against Moses and Aaron, a fire came out from God and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who offered incense (Num. 16:1-3, 35). When Israel&rsquo;s king Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, sent two captains with their men to fetch Elijah, they were consumed by fire from heaven (2 Kings 1:9-12). During the great tribulation at the end of this age, fire will be cast to the earth and the third part of the earth will be burned up; and as it were a great mountain burning with fire will be cast into the sea and the third part of the sea will be destroyed (Rev. 8:7-8). The judgment by burning fire will consummate in the lake of fire, into which the devil, his angels, the demons, and all their followers, and even death and Hades, will be cast. There they will be burned by the eternal fire unceasingly (Matt. 25:41; Rev. 19:20; 20:13-15; 14:10-11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Sodom shows the end&mdash;corruption&mdash;of the fallen men who were not in God&rsquo;s grace. The judgment by burning fire indicates that God, as the consuming fire, will destroy such corrupted people. Sodom was a place full of fornication. Leaving the natural use of the females, the males craved one another and defiled their own bodies. Thus, they became sinful and wicked. Genesis uses three places to signify the world: Chaldea signifies the aspect of the idolatry of the world; Egypt, the aspect of the material riches of the world; and Sodom, the aspect of the sinfulness of the world. God&rsquo;s called ones live within this triangle and must be careful lest they fall back to the land of idols, go down to the place of worldly pleasure, or drift into the city of sin. The people of Sodom were the descendants of Canaan, who was cursed. Therefore, Sodom was not only a place that brought man under the contamination of sin, but also a place that brought man under a curse. Sinful Sodom was so utterly wicked that it was judged by God with burning fire. The judgment by burning fire is connected to the punishment of the lake of fire mainly to show that God cannot tolerate the existence of the people of fornication. Moreover, that judgment is related to God&rsquo;s holiness; whatever does not correspond with God&rsquo;s holy nature will be burned by the holy God as the consuming fire. The judgment by burning fire began with the burning of Sodom; thereafter, the fire continued to burn. It will burn until the lake of fire, and it will never cease.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<h2 class="head1">I. ISHMAEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Born of Hagar unto Slavery</h2>
<p>Ishmael was born of Hagar, Abraham&rsquo;s concubine, as a result of Abraham&rsquo;s accepting a proposal from his wife, Sarah. Ishmael was rejected by God because he was born of Abraham according to the flesh, that is, by man&rsquo;s natural strength, the strength of the flesh, and not by God&rsquo;s grace (Gen. 17:18-19). Hagar the maidservant signifies the covenant of law, which brings forth children unto slavery (Gal. 4:22, 24). Ishmael, who was born of Hagar into slavery, could not inherit Abraham&rsquo;s possessions with Isaac, who was born of Sarah, the free woman. This signifies that those who keep the law by their self-effort are in slavery and are born of the flesh, and they cannot be heirs of God with the believers, who are born of grace (Gal. 4:30); that is, they cannot inherit God&rsquo;s promised blessing&mdash;the all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Cast Out by Sarah and Denied the Inheritance</h2>
<p>When Isaac grew and was weaned, Ishmael mocked him (Gen. 21:9). Sarah, unable to tolerate Ishmael&rsquo;s mocking of Isaac, asked Abraham to cast out both Hagar and Ishmael, for she would not allow Ishmael to be heir along with Isaac (Gen. 21:10). Abraham obeyed God and cast out both Hagar and Ishmael, as he was told by Sarah (Gen. 21:12-14). This signifies that the law and those who keep the law by their self-effort are cast out by grace from the inheriting of grace and are unable to enjoy grace as their inheritance (Gal. 4:30-31; 5:4).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. ISAAC</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s aim in calling Abraham was to accomplish His purpose, which was to establish a kingdom that He might rule on the earth and express His glory. In order to have a kingdom, seeds were needed. Therefore, God promised Abraham that he would beget a son by his wife Sarah (Gen. 17:19) to be his heir.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Born of Sarah</h2>
<p>Isaac was the son born of Abraham by his wife Sarah, and he became the unique seed who inherited all the riches of his father (Gen. 17:19; 21:2-3; 25:5). Sarah, the free woman (Gal. 4:22b), symbolizes the new covenant of grace (Gal. 4:24a), which has the proper position in God&rsquo;s economy to bring forth children as God&rsquo;s heirs who will inherit what is of God. Therefore, Isaac represents the New Testament believers, who are born to be sons of God according to His grace and are His heirs who will inherit His possessions (Gal. 4:28, 30-31).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Born according to Promise</h2>
<p>When Abraham had become old and as good as dead, and Sarah had become out of function (Rom. 4:19), according to God&rsquo;s promise and at the appointed time, the time of life (Gen. 17:21, lit.), the time when the effort of the natural life ceases, Isaac was born. Therefore, Isaac was not produced by the natural strength, the strength of the flesh (Gal. 4:23), but by God&rsquo;s strength in grace. He was born not of blood, nor of the will of man, nor of the effort of the flesh (John 1:13), but according to the Holy Spirit (Gal. 4:29), who is God reaching man (cf. Gen. 17:21&mdash;21:1). Therefore, Isaac represents the New Testament believers, who are born according to the grace of God&rsquo;s promise&mdash;those who are not born of the flesh but of the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Inheriting and Restfully Enjoying<br />
the Father&rsquo;s Riches</h2>
<p>Isaac lived a life of inheriting and restfully enjoying all his father&rsquo;s riches. He was born of grace, grew up in grace, and became the heir in grace (Gen. 21:9-12), inheriting all that his father had (Gen. 25:5). Furthermore, he inherited God&rsquo;s promise to his father, especially the promise concerning Christ, in whom all the nations of the earth would be blessed (Gen. 26:3-5). His entire life was a resting and enjoying life. He was always resting. At a time when he had lost his mother, did not yet have a wife, and his servant had gone away from him, he was not troubled. Rather, he went to the field to meditate (Gen. 24:63). When he encountered the trouble with the Philistines over the wells, he remained restful and did not contend with them (Gen. 26:18-22). He was not merely resting; he was also enjoying. His father and his father&rsquo;s servant did everything to prepare a bride for him (Gen. 24:61-67). During his whole life, he never suffered thirst. Wherever he went, even when he went downward, going south to the land of the Philistines, there was always a well for his enjoyment. Whenever he sowed in the land, he received a hundredfold. He became great and continued to grow greater until he became very great (Gen. 26:12-14). When he was old, he still asked Esau to go out to the field to get some venison for him and make him savory meat, which he loved (Gen. 27:1-4). Throughout his whole life he did not do anything by his own effort. From the beginning to the end, he was a man who inherited his father&rsquo;s possessions (Gen. 25:5) and restfully enjoyed all his father&rsquo;s riches. Isaac represents the New Testament believers, who do not need to strive to accomplish something and who need only to inherit the grace in Christ and enjoy the unlimited grace of God (1 Cor. 15:10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Inheriting God&rsquo;s Promise</h2>
<p>First, God gave the promise to Abraham, Isaac&rsquo;s father, saying that He would make him a blessing to all the nations of the earth. Later, He gave the same promise to Isaac to confirm in him what He had promised to Abraham (Gen. 26:3-4). The focus of this promise was Christ in God&rsquo;s economy, in whom all the nations of the earth would be blessed (Gal. 3:16). The blessing that Christ gives to all the nations of the earth is the Triune God, who is embodied in Him. This Triune God in Christ, through Christ&rsquo;s becoming the all-inclusive Spirit, is received and enjoyed as the greatest blessing in the universe by all those on earth who have believed into Christ (Gal. 3:14).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Persecuted by Ishmael</h2>
<p>According to Genesis 21, after Isaac had grown up and was weaned, Ishmael began to mock him (v. 9). This means that Ishmael persecuted Isaac. God considered this persecution the beginning of the four-hundred-year persecution of His people, the Israelites (Gen. 15:13; Acts 7:6). Isaac was born according to the Holy Spirit and through the promise, whereas Ishmael was born according to the flesh and through the natural strength. As it was then, that he who was born according to flesh persecuted him who was born according to Spirit, so also it is now (Gal. 4:29). Therefore, Isaac&rsquo;s suffering of Ishmael&rsquo;s persecution signifies that the believers, who are born according to the Spirit of grace in the New Testament, will suffer persecution from those who are born according to flesh (Gal. 4:29).</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Offered as a Burnt Offering<br />
and Experiencing Death and Resurrection</h2>
<p>After Isaac had grown up, in order to test Abraham, God told him to bring Isaac to the appointed mountain and to offer him as a burnt offering. By faith Abraham offered Isaac. After Isaac was laid upon the altar on the wood, as Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay him, God prepared a ram as Isaac&rsquo;s substitute (Gen. 22:2-13). In this way, Isaac was offered as a burnt offering and thus experienced death and resurrection. This signifies that the New Testament believers also must be offered as a burnt offering and experience death and resurrection. When the New Testament believers, constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love, present their bodies as a living sacrifice (Rom. 12:1), a sacrifice of resurrection and life, they experience co-crucifixion with Christ (Gal. 2:20a). Thus, they live a crucified life by being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death, and thereby know and experience Christ and the power of His resurrection (Phil. 3:10). Eventually, they will attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead (Phil. 3:11).</p><h2 class="head2">G. Having No Maturity in Life</h2>
<p>As a historical figure in the Bible, Isaac, like Abraham, does not represent a complete, spiritually mature man. He represents only a part of the experience and life of a spiritually mature person, which includes the inheriting of grace, not using one&rsquo;s own effort, and the restful enjoyment of the riches of Christ. When he was old, he blessed Jacob blindly (Gen. 27:1-29). This proves that he was not sufficiently mature in his spiritual life and that he was not a complete, spiritually mature person, but can be considered only a part of such a person, just as we saw previously concerning Abraham.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Ishmael was born of Abraham according to the flesh, through his concubine, Hagar, unto slavery. When Isaac grew and was weaned, Ishmael mocked him. Consequently, Ishmael and Hagar were cast out by Sarah, and Ishmael was not allowed to be heir along with Isaac. Thus, Ishmael signifies those who keep the law by their self-effort, those who are under slavery and are born according to the flesh. They will be cast out from the inheritance of grace and will not be able to inherit and restfully enjoy God&rsquo;s grace as an inheritance with those who are born of grace.</p>
<p>Isaac was born of Abraham according to promise, through Abraham&rsquo;s wife, Sarah, and he became the unique seed who inherited all the riches of his father. He also inherited the promise given to Abraham concerning Christ, in whom all the nations of the earth would be blessed. When Isaac had grown up and was weaned, Ishmael began to mock him. Furthermore, Isaac was offered as a burnt offering and thus experienced death and resurrection. Thus, Isaac represents the New Testament believers, who are born to be sons of God according to the Holy Spirit by God&rsquo;s grace and who become God&rsquo;s heirs, inheriting and restfully enjoying God&rsquo;s possessions; who suffer persecution from those who are born according to flesh; and who are offered to God as a burnt offering, thereby experiencing death and resurrection. When Isaac was old, he blessed Jacob blindly. This proves that he was not sufficiently mature in his spiritual life and that he was not a complete, spiritually mature person, but can be considered only a part of such a person.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Both Sarah and Rebekah came from the idolatrous land of Chaldea (Gen. 11:31; 24:4) to the place of God&rsquo;s promise. One became the mother-in-law and symbolizes the new covenant of grace; the other became the daughter-in-law and symbolizes the church of the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. SARAH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Symbolizing the New Covenant of Grace</h2>
<p>Sarah, Abraham&rsquo;s wife, and Hagar, Abraham&rsquo;s concubine, symbolize two covenants (Gal. 4:24). Hagar symbolizes the old covenant of law, and Sarah, the new covenant of grace. That is, Sarah symbolizes grace, which originally was to be given to man by God (Rom. 5:15); Hagar symbolizes the law, which was added later (Rom. 5:20). Those who desire to keep the law by themselves are brought under slavery by the law (Gal. 4:24b; 5:3). Those who inherit grace by faith (Gal. 4:23b, 30b) are made sons of freedom by grace. The old covenant, symbolized by Hagar, is from Mount Sinai, which belongs to the law and brings forth children unto slavery. The new covenant, symbolized by Sarah, is from the Jerusalem above, which is free and belongs to grace, and which brings forth children of God that they might be His heirs. She is the mother of the New Testament believers. We are not children of the maidservant, Hagar, who symbolizes the old covenant, and we are not under the slavery of law. Rather, we are children of the free woman, Sarah, who symbolizes the new covenant, and we enjoy all the riches of Christ in grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. A Matter of the Union<br />
of the Triune God with Man to Produce<br />
the Believers for the Constituting of the Church</h2>
<p>Sarah symbolizes the new covenant of grace; that is, she symbolizes the heavenly Jerusalem, the Jerusalem above, as the mother of the believers (Gal. 4:26). Thus, this woman Sarah, as the wife, symbolizes the new covenant and grace, the content of the new covenant; she also symbolizes the Jerusalem above, and our mother. The wife, like the New Jerusalem, which is the wife of the Lamb (Rev. 21:2, 9), is the heavenly Jerusalem (Heb. 12:22). This heavenly Jerusalem, the Jerusalem above, is our mother, the grace through which we were born. This grace is the content of the new covenant (just as the law is the content of the old covenant&mdash;John 1:17). And this new covenant is the woman. Therefore, these six items&mdash;the woman, the wife, the new covenant, the grace of the new covenant, the Jerusalem above, and our mother&mdash;are all matters of the spiritual life that pertain to the union of the Triune God with man to produce the believers for the constituting of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Submitting Herself to Her Husband</h2>
<p>Sarah is a positive, spiritual model in the matter of submitting to her husband. When Abraham went down to Egypt because of the famine, he said to Sarah, his wife, &ldquo;Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon: therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee&rdquo; (Gen. 12:11-13). A weak Abraham lied by telling the truth (Gen. 20:11-13), sacrificing his wife in order to save his own life. And yet Sarah accepted his idea, completely obeying and submitting herself to her husband. Later, Abraham repeated his old failure of sacrificing his wife in order to save himself. Sarah again obeyed and submitted herself to him and did not complain at all (Gen. 20:1-2).</p>
<p>Sarah obeyed and submitted herself to her husband with a meek and quiet spirit (1 Pet. 3:4). She not only obeyed Abraham but also submitted herself to him, even calling him &ldquo;my lord&rdquo; (Gen. 18:12). Thus she became a positive, spiritual model. Therefore, the holy women who hope in God and who submit themselves to their husbands are her daughters (1 Pet. 3:5-6).</p><h2 class="head2">D. Making a Fleshly Proposal to Her Husband</h2>
<p>However, Sarah, who submitted herself to her husband, is a negative model in the matter of proposing that her husband take Hagar as a concubine (Gen. 16:1-3). God had repeatedly promised Abraham that he would have a seed and that he would personally bring forth a son (Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 15:4-5), yet Sarah was not able to bear children. Because of this, she proposed to Abraham that he should go in to her maid, Hagar, to have a son through her (Gen. 16:2). This was altogether a proposal of the flesh. Eventually, Abraham accepted Sarah&rsquo;s proposal, took Hagar as his concubine, and begot Ishmael through her (Gen. 16:15). This is a warning to all women who hope in God, namely, that they should not make any proposals according to the flesh to their husbands; and it is a warning to the husbands also, namely, that they should not listen to the fleshly proposals of their wives. Otherwise, they will produce &ldquo;Ishmaels&rdquo; out of their flesh, who will lust against the &ldquo;Isaacs&rdquo; born of God&rsquo;s promise. This is to sow according to the flesh and reap corruption of the flesh; for whatever a man sows, this he shall also reap (Gal. 6:8, 7).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. REBEKAH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Symbolizing the Church,<br />
Which Comes Out of Grace</h2>
<p>Sarah symbolizes grace, which produces the believers for the constituting of the church, whereas Rebekah symbolizes the church, which is produced by grace. Grace comes out of God the Father (2 Tim. 1:9), and the church belongs to Christ (1 Cor. 3:23) and is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). In Rebekah we can see that the church, symbolized by Rebekah, has the following four characteristics.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Chosen by the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Rebekah was chosen to be the wife of Isaac by the old servant, who was sent forth by Isaac&rsquo;s father, Abraham, to the land where Abraham was called by God (Gen. 24:1-4). When Abraham was old and well advanced in age, he said to the oldest servant of his house, who ruled over all that he had, &ldquo;Thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.&rdquo; Here Abraham typifies God the Father, the old servant typifies the Holy Spirit, Isaac typifies Christ, and Abraham&rsquo;s country and kindred indicate the place of fallen men and the fallen human race, respectively. Therefore, Abraham&rsquo;s finding a wife for his son signifies that the church is chosen for Christ out of the fallen people by the Holy Spirit, who was sent by God the Father to the place of fallen men.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Receiving Gifts from the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>As the old servant had hoped, Rebekah gave him a drink and also drew water for his ten camels. So the old servant took a golden ring and two golden bracelets and gave them to Rebekah (Gen. 24:17-22). Afterward, when the old servant went to her house, he brought forth more articles of silver and of gold, and raiment, and gave them to her (Gen. 24:53). The golden ring of half a shekel typifies the Holy Spirit as our foretaste. The two golden bracelets of ten shekels put on her hands typify that the gift of life that we have received of the Holy Spirit can fulfill the requirements of God&rsquo;s commandments and fully carry out the divine function. And the articles of silver, the articles of gold, and the raiment signify the riches of Christ. Therefore, Rebekah&rsquo;s receiving of the golden ring, the golden bracelets, and more articles of silver and of gold, and raiment, signify the church&rsquo;s receiving of the Holy Spirit and the gift of life from the Holy Spirit, and its enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Leaving Its Close Relatives and the World</h2>
<p>After Rebekah received and enjoyed the riches, the old servant wanted to go back immediately to his master&rsquo;s place. Rebekah&rsquo;s brother and mother considered keeping them there for a few more days, but Rebekah was willing to leave her father&rsquo;s house and her country immediately and go forth to the land of God&rsquo;s promise to be Isaac&rsquo;s wife. So they sent her and Abraham&rsquo;s servant and his men away (Gen. 24:54-59). This signifies the church&rsquo;s willingness to be separated from its relatives in the flesh and from the world.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Given to Christ</h2>
<p>Rebekah was given to Isaac and became one flesh with him (cf. Gen. 2:24). Thus, Isaac was comforted (Gen. 24:67), and Rebekah enjoyed all the riches that Isaac inherited from his father (Gen. 25:5). This signifies that the church is given to Christ and becomes one with Christ to be His counterpart, bringing satisfaction to Him and enjoying all the riches that He has inherited from God the Father (John 16:15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Her Partial Love in the Flesh</h2>
<p>Rebekah gave birth to twins. The older one, Esau, was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, and the younger one, Jacob, was a quiet man who dwelt in tents (Gen. 25:27, lit.). Rebekah&rsquo;s love was partial toward Jacob (Gen. 25:28). Thus, when Isaac was about to bless the firstborn son, she taught Jacob how to cheat his father (Gen. 27:1-17) in order to obtain the blessing. This sowed the seed of hatred between Jacob and his brother, Esau. Eventually, Rebekah had no alternative but to send away the son whom she loved in partiality, that he might flee to her brother&rsquo;s place (Gen. 27:41-45). For this she found an excuse and manipulated her husband, asking him to send Jacob to the place where she came from, that he might take a woman for his wife (Gen. 27:46&mdash;28:2). She probably never saw her beloved son again for the remainder of her life. All these things constitute a negative model. This model shows that the sisters who are mothers should not have a partial love toward their children or teach them to cheat their fathers in order to obtain blessings, thus bringing discord to the family life. It shows also that sisters who are wives should not try to find an excuse to manipulate their husbands; such manipulating might cause the children to leave home and wander about.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Both Sarah and Rebekah came from the idolatrous land of Chaldea to the place of God&rsquo;s promise. One became the mother-in-law and symbolizes the new covenant of grace; the other became the daughter-in-law and symbolizes the church of the New Testament. Sarah, Abraham&rsquo;s wife, and Hagar, Abraham&rsquo;s concubine, symbolize two covenants. Hagar symbolizes the old covenant of law, which brings forth children unto slavery; Sarah symbolizes the new covenant of grace, which is free and which brings forth children of God that they might be His heirs. This woman, Sarah, as the wife, symbolizes the new covenant, the grace of the new covenant, the Jerusalem above, and our mother. These six items are all matters of the spiritual life relating to the union of the Triune God with man to produce the believers for the constituting of the church. Sarah is a positive, spiritual model in the matter of submitting to her husband, but she is a model on the negative side in the matter of proposing that her husband take Hagar as a concubine. Rebekah symbolizes the church, which is produced by grace. In her we can see that the church, which she symbolizes, has the following four characteristics: the church was chosen for Christ out of the fallen people through God the Father&rsquo;s sending of the Holy Spirit to the place of fallen men; the church receives the Holy Spirit and the gift of life from the Holy Spirit and enjoys the riches of Christ; the church is willing to be separated from its relatives in the flesh and from the world; and the church is given to Christ to be His counterpart, bringing satisfaction to Him and enjoying all the riches that He has inherited from God the Father. In her partial love toward Jacob, in teaching him to cheat his father in order to obtain the blessing, and in finding an excuse to manipulate her husband, asking him to send Jacob to the place where she came from, Rebekah is a model on the negative side.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Esau and Jacob had the same parents; they were twins born of their father, Isaac, who was chosen by God, and of their mother, Rebekah, who was selected by the Holy Spirit. All that Esau and Jacob were and did are models and symbols.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. ESAU</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Symbolizing the Natural Man</h2>
<p>Esau was born the oldest son; hence, he was the first. In the Bible, the first, in the present sense, refers to that which is natural, of the old creation, and forsaken by God. For example, the Bible calls Adam &ldquo;the first man&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:45, 47), indicating that he was natural and earthy, and that the earthy aspect of his being was rejected by God. In another example, the firstborn sons of the Egyptians were smitten by God (Exo. 12:12-13), signifying again that the first is forsaken by God. Esau, born the oldest son and being the first, symbolizes the natural man, who is hated by God (Rom. 9:13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Symbolizing the Preference<br />
of the Natural Man</h2>
<p>Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; hence, he was the one most loved by his father according to the natural man. Isaac loved Esau because he often ate of Esau&rsquo;s venison (Gen. 25:27-28). When Isaac was old, he still asked Esau to go hunting and make him savory meat, which he loved, so that he could bless Esau before he died (Gen. 27:1-4). Isaac&rsquo;s love for Esau was altogether in the natural man and according to the natural taste. This indicates that what the natural man does by his natural strength (typified by Esau&rsquo;s hunting) is the preference of one who lives in the natural life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Despising and Losing the Birthright</h2>
<p>Although Esau was the firstborn, he despised the birthright. One day while Jacob was making pottage, Esau came from the field, and, feeling faint, he asked Jacob to give him some red pottage. However, Jacob demanded that Esau sell him his birthright before he would give him the red pottage. Esau said, &ldquo;Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?&rdquo; Then he swore to Jacob and sold his birthright to Jacob (Gen. 25:29-34). Esau lusted after the enjoyment in the flesh, after the world and its worldly pleasures, and for a morsel of meat he sold his own birthright. Afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing of his father, Isaac, he was rejected, though he earnestly sought it with loud weeping; for he had no ground, no way, to reverse by repentance the result of what he had done (Gen. 27:30-38; Heb. 12:16-17). Thus Esau despised and lost his birthright.</p><h2 class="head1">II. JACOB</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Symbolizing One Who Is Chosen by God</h2>
<p>Jacob was Esau&rsquo;s twin brother. He struggled with Esau while they were yet in their mother&rsquo;s womb (Gen. 25:22). When the time of delivery came, the two fought to be born first in order to obtain the birthright. When they were born, Jacob, who was the loser in the struggle, held on to the heel of the winner, Esau (Gen. 25:24-26). Even before they were born, God had already told their mother that the elder would serve the younger (Gen. 25:23). This signifies that God had chosen Jacob, who was born second, to be the firstborn son, and that Esau, who was born first, had failed to obtain the birthright. When the two were not yet born, before they had done anything good or bad, God chose Jacob, that the purpose of God according to selection might remain, not of works, but of Him who calls (Rom. 9:11). In the history of Jacob, the divine revelation in the Bible points out especially this aspect. Therefore, Jacob symbolizes one who is chosen by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Symbolizing the Natural Man<br />
Who Has Been Regenerated<br />
to Become the Spiritual Man</h2>
<p>Jacob, the younger of the twins, was the second. In the Bible, the second, in the present sense, refers to that which is spiritual and that which is chosen and desired by God. For example, the Bible calls Christ &ldquo;the second Man&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:47), indicating that He is spiritual and heavenly, that He comes from God, and that He is God&rsquo;s delight. As a second example, our regenerated man is the second man; it is spiritual, unlike the one from our natural birth, which is the first, is earthy, and is natural. Jacob, the younger son, the second, symbolizes the natural man who has been regenerated to become the spiritual man, who is loved by God (Rom. 9:13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. One Who Inherited God&rsquo;s Promise</h2>
<p>On the way during his escape to his uncle Laban&rsquo;s, Jacob slept on a stone, which he took for a pillow, and dreamed about a ladder set up on the earth, with God at the top of the ladder, saying, &ldquo;I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac...and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed&rdquo; (Gen. 28:10-14). The promise that all the families of the earth would be blessed was given first to Abraham and then to Isaac; here, it was mentioned to Jacob. God gave Jacob this promise so that the promise given to Abraham and to Isaac might be established and continued in him. Therefore, Jacob was one who inherited the promise, and all his descendants also were descendants who received the promise (Rom. 9:4). The promise that God gave to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with his descendants was related to Christ. Christ is the seed promised by God in whom all the families of the earth would be blessed. To become the blessing to all the nations on earth, He, as the embodiment of the Triune God, became flesh, passed through human living, accomplished redemption, died and was resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit that He might enter into all who believe into Him to be their supreme blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Symbolizing One Who Has Been<br />
Regenerated and Transformed</h2>
<p>In Jacob we see one who struggled, one who was a heel holder, a subtle and greedy one, yet one who, under God&rsquo;s dealing, was ultimately transformed into Israel, God&rsquo;s prince.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. By the Sufferings in His Circumstances</h2>
<p>Jacob was born the second, having lost to his brother the struggle in his mother&rsquo;s womb. However, he continually tried to supplant his brother in order to grasp the birthright. When he seized Esau&rsquo;s birthright and the blessing of his father through deception, Esau hated him and wanted to kill him. He then had to leave his parents and escape to Laban his uncle. At Laban&rsquo;s place, Jacob was deceived by Laban; he served Laban fourteen years for Laban&rsquo;s two daughters and six years for his cattle, and Laban changed his wages ten times. In the day Jacob was consumed by drought, and in the night by frost, and sleep departed from his eyes (Gen. 31:40-41). The competing, envying, and wrestling between his two wives, Leah and Rachel, in childbearing (Gen. 29:31&mdash; 30:24) put him in a predicament. When he returned to Shechem in Canaan, his only daughter, Dinah, was defiled by Shechem, son of Hamor the Hivite, and Jacob&rsquo;s sons plotted to get revenge. First, his sons Simeon and Levi killed Hamor and Shechem and all the men of the city. Then, his other sons came and spoiled the city, thus causing Jacob to be frightened and troubled (Gen. 34) and to have no peace. After this, his beloved wife, Rachel, died while giving birth to his youngest son, Benjamin (Gen. 35:16-20). His concubine was defiled by Reuben, his oldest son (Gen. 35:22). Also, he was deceived by his sons to think that his most beloved son, Joseph, had been devoured by wild beasts (cf. Gen. 37). All these things caused Jacob to be dealt with severely, again and again. All the sufferings in his circumstances were used by God to deal with Jacob from all sides that he might be transformed.</p><h2 class="head3">2. By God&rsquo;s Direct Dealing</h2>
<p>Jacob&rsquo;s transformation was accomplished also by God&rsquo;s direct dealing. At Penuel, God in the form of a man wrestled with Jacob until dawn. God did this to expose Jacob&rsquo;s natural life. Then God touched the hollow of his thigh, and he became lame (Gen. 32:22-32). This signifies that throughout Jacob&rsquo;s life he was struggling with God. Finally, in the matter of Joseph&rsquo;s being sold, Jacob was brought by God to a place where he no longer had any strength&mdash;he had become lame. Suddenly, he understood God&rsquo;s dealing, and he was matured in life to become Israel. <em>El</em> in the name Israel means &ldquo;God.&rdquo; God gave Jacob this name to signify that he had experienced God&rsquo;s dealing and had reached maturity. He was God&rsquo;s overcomer, God&rsquo;s prince. He was full of God&rsquo;s element and became God&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<p>Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty, through the sufferings in his circumstances and through God&rsquo;s direct dealing, Jacob was transformed and matured so that he became Israel. Therefore, he symbolizes one who has been regenerated and transformed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Symbolizing One Who<br />
Can Bless People on God&rsquo;s Behalf</h2>
<p>After Jacob had become mature in life, God accompanied him to Egypt (Gen. 46:4a). According to the record in the Bible, there he did nothing but bless others. First, he blessed Pharaoh, and later he blessed each of his own sons.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Knowing the Desire of God&rsquo;s Heart</h2>
<p>In contrast to Isaac, Jacob did not bless blindly. Rather, his sky was clear and he knew the desire of God&rsquo;s heart. Joseph brought his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, to Jacob that he might bless them. He led his older son, Manasseh, toward Jacob&rsquo;s right hand and his younger son, Ephraim, toward Jacob&rsquo;s left hand, expecting that Jacob would place his right hand on Manasseh&rsquo;s head and his left hand on Ephraim&rsquo;s head. However, when Jacob stretched forth his hands to bless them, he crossed his hands. Joseph was displeased and lifted up Jacob&rsquo;s hand to remove it from Ephraim&rsquo;s head and place it on Manasseh&rsquo;s head. But Jacob refused and said, &ldquo;I know it, my son, I know it&rdquo; (Gen. 48:8-20). Although Jacob&rsquo;s eyes were dim with age, his spirit was clear. He knew that God&rsquo;s desire was to place Ephraim above Manasseh. Therefore, he did not bless according to Joseph&rsquo;s arrangement but according to the desire of God&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Blessings Becoming Prophecies</h2>
<p>Jacob&rsquo;s blessings became prophecies because his blessings were shining with light and fit in with God&rsquo;s purpose. Therefore, whatever blessings he gave to his sons became God&rsquo;s prophecies to them. All that is recorded in the Bible from Exodus to Revelation constitutes the accomplishing and the fulfilling of the prophecies in Jacob&rsquo;s blessings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Signifying the Stage of Maturity<br />
in the Life of a Complete, Spiritual Man</h2>
<p>In his old age, when Jacob heard that Joseph had been made governor of Egypt, his reactions were twofold: &ldquo;his heart was numb&rdquo; and &ldquo;his spirit revived&rdquo; (Gen. 45:26-27, lit.). His soul-life had already become dead, and his spirit and soul could be divided. When he arrived in Egypt, he did not demand anything; he only blessed others. Thus, Jacob in his old age signifies the stage of maturity in the life of a complete, spiritual man. In this respect he is unlike Abraham and Isaac, who signify only the initial stage of the experience and life of a spiritually mature person, and not the maturity of a spiritual person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Esau, born the oldest son, the first, symbolizes the natural man, which is hated by God. He was a skillful hunter and was loved by his father according to the natural man. His father loved him because he often ate of Esau&rsquo;s venison. Therefore, Esau also symbolizes the preference of the natural man. Although he was the firstborn son, he despised his birthright and sold it for a morsel of meat. Later, when he desired to inherit his father&rsquo;s blessing, he was rejected.</p>
<p>Jacob symbolizes a chosen one. Before the twins were born and before they had done anything good or bad, God chose Jacob. Jacob, the younger of the twins, was the second. As such, he symbolizes the natural man who has been regenerated to become a spiritual person, who is loved by God. He also inherited the promise given by God to Abraham and Isaac, namely, that all the families of the earth would be blessed in Christ. Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty, through the sufferings in his circumstances and through God&rsquo;s direct dealing, Jacob was transformed and matured so that he became Israel. Therefore, he symbolizes one who has been regenerated and transformed. When he was mature in life, he went down to Egypt, and there he did nothing but bless others. He knew the desire of God&rsquo;s heart, and all his blessings became prophecies. Therefore, he also symbolizes one who can bless others on behalf of God. Furthermore, he signifies the stage of maturity in the life of a complete, spiritual person, and in this respect he is unlike Abraham and Isaac, who signify only the initial stage of the experience and life of a spiritually mature person.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>The issue of all the historical figures recorded in Genesis is the twelve sons of Jacob. Among the twelve sons of Jacob, the most outstanding was Joseph, and the remaining eleven formed a separate group. Among these eleven, Reuben, Levi, and Judah had their special characteristics; the remaining eight were not special. Reuben, Levi, and Judah, with Joseph, all were related to the birthright inherited by Jacob from the forefathers. The birthright is a continuation of the various excellent qualities and blessings of the forefathers. According to the Bible, the birthright includes the double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship, that is, the right and the position to enjoy Christ in full, and the right to be priests, bringing people to God, and to be kings, bringing God to people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. REUBEN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being the Firstborn</h2>
<p>As the firstborn son of Jacob, Reuben should have had the preeminence in dignity and in power (Gen. 49:3, lit.). According to the governmental arrangement in God&rsquo;s economy, Reuben, the firstborn, should have inherited the birthright.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Losing the Birthright</h2>
<p>Although Reuben had the preeminence of the birthright, because his lust boiled over like water, he lay with his father&rsquo;s concubine, thus defiling his father&rsquo;s bed (Gen. 35:22; 49:4; 1 Chron. 5:1). That indulgence in lust caused him to lose his birthright. This is a serious matter. In God&rsquo;s arrangement regarding human relationships, each man must keep his position in order to avoid confusion, that he may keep himself pure with self-restraint for his existence and propagation. Hence, in relationships among men, what God abhors most is fornication, and especially incest. Reuben not only committed fornication, but he also committed incest with his father&rsquo;s concubine. Therefore, the God of holiness removed the birthright from him and did not allow him to inherit any of the blessings that his forefathers received from God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. LEVI</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Losing the Blessing and Suffering Judgment</h2>
<p>Because his sister, Dinah, was defiled by Shechem, Levi, together with his brother Simeon, slew all the males in the city of Shechem by craftiness (Gen. 34:1-29). This incident frightened Jacob to such an extent that before his death, when he was going to bless his sons, he still could not forget it. Concerning Levi and Simeon, he said, &ldquo;In their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they hocked an ox. Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel.&rdquo; Therefore, Jacob could not give them any blessing. Rather, he exercised judgment over them to scatter them among the children of Israel (Gen. 49:5-7, lit.) so that they would not be able to behave according to their cruel disposition.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Receiving the Priesthood</h2>
<p>Although because of his cruel disposition Levi did not receive Jacob&rsquo;s blessing, because of their faithfulness to Jehovah his descendants received the Urim and Thummim (Deut. 33:8) and took up the charge of the priesthood. As recorded in the book of Exodus, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the tables and saw the people worshipping the golden calf in disobedience to God&rsquo;s commandments, he angrily cast down the two tables, burned the golden calf, and called all those who belonged to Jehovah to come to him. Eventually, out of all the tribes, only one tribe, the tribe of Levi, gathered together to him (Exo. 32:19-20, 26). Moses said to them, &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor. And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men&rdquo; (Exo. 32:27-28). Concerning this incident, Deuteronomy 33:9 says, &ldquo;Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they [the Levites] have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.&rdquo; Thereafter, the sons of Levi were separated from their brothers to replace the kingdom of Israel in taking up the charge of God&rsquo;s priesthood (Exo. 32:29; Deut. 33:10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Participating in the Priesthood<br />
as a Portion of the Birthright</h2>
<p>The priesthood that Levi received is one of the three blessings included in the birthright, and it is the particularly sweet and intimate portion of the birthright. The Levites had the privilege of drawing near to God and of serving God. Furthermore, they could wait before God and could offer to God the fat and the blood of the sacrifices to satisfy God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory. When they entered the Holy Place, they bore the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment, and they put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim, by which God spoke (Exo. 28:29-30). This shows that through the priesthood the Levites were able not only to bring satisfaction to God but also to bring God&rsquo;s people into His presence. Moreover, they were able to receive God&rsquo;s guidance that they might teach the people God&rsquo;s law and God&rsquo;s judgments.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. JUDAH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Loving His Brothers</h2>
<p>Judah&rsquo;s special characteristic was his love for his brothers. In particular, he took care of Joseph, who was in tribulation, and prevented him from being murdered by his brothers (Gen. 37:26-27). When the whole earth was struck by a famine, Jacob sent his sons to Egypt to buy food. Joseph, intending to test his brothers, told them that when they came back to buy food, they were to bring with them Benjamin, who was Jacob&rsquo;s youngest son, Jacob&rsquo;s beloved, and who had stayed behind in Canaan. When his father was greatly troubled about this, Judah comforted him, assuring him that he would bring Benjamin back and that, if he did not, he himself would bear the blame forever. This was a manifestation of his love for his brother (Gen. 43:8-9). Then, when Joseph again tested his brothers, using a cleverly devised scheme to keep Benjamin behind, it was Judah who, with deep feeling, told Joseph that his father&rsquo;s life was bound up in his youngest brother&rsquo;s life, that he could not bear to see his father&rsquo;s gray hairs go down to Sheol in sorrow, and that he would be willing to remain as a servant instead of Benjamin, so that Benjamin could go back with his brothers to see their father (Gen. 44:1-34). Here, Judah&rsquo;s love toward his brother and his concern for his father were manifested to the uttermost. This picture of love is representative of the love for the brothers spoken of in the Bible and shows that all God&rsquo;s children should care for the heart of God the Father and be willing to suffer loss, even to die, for the brothers (1 John 3:14, 16).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Participating in the Kingship<br />
as a Portion of the Birthright</h2>
<p>Judah was not the firstborn and thus should not have participated in the birthright. However, because of his love for his brothers, he received the kingship (Gen. 49:10) as a portion of the birthright; that is, he had the authority to bring God to people. Jacob prophesied in the way of blessing concerning his sons, saying, &ldquo;Judah...thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies....Judah is a young lion...he couches, he lies down as a lion, and as a lioness....The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler&rsquo;s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be&rdquo; (Gen. 49:8-10, lit.). This is a picture depicting Judah&rsquo;s fighting and gaining the victory and his resting in victory as a king. The scepter and the staff represent kingship, or dominion. The words <em>between his feet</em> are a poetic term denoting seed, or posterity. This indicates that Judah has the kingship and that rulers come out of his posterity. Christ, as Judah&rsquo;s seed, became the Lion of the tribe of Judah (Rev. 5:5). As such, He has overcome and has been given all authority in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18). When Christ, as Shiloh, the One who brings peace, comes again, the whole earth will be filled with peace, and all nations will obey Him. They will come to Him to receive God&rsquo;s instruction (Isa. 2:1-3; 11:10). At that time, the kingdoms of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever (Rev. 11:15).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. JOSEPH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Continuing the Way of Life That Chooses God,<br />
the Way Taken by His Forefathers</h2>
<p>Joseph was special among the sons of Jacob and was separate from his brothers (Gen. 49:26). He continued the way of life that chooses God, the way taken by his forefathers. He lived as a sheaf of life, was full of the riches of life, and was like a bright star shining in the darkness (Gen. 37:7, 9). Although he passed through various trials and sufferings, he was prosperous in all things because he had the presence of God (Gen. 39:2-5, 21-23). Eventually, he became the representative of all those who are mature in God&rsquo;s life and who reign for God and enter into glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Suffering the Ill-treatment of His Brothers</h2>
<p>Joseph was his father&rsquo;s favorite, and he brought back to his father evil reports about his brothers. Therefore, his brothers hated him and could not speak peaceably to him (Gen. 37:2-4). Joseph had two dreams in which he dreamed that his brothers, signified by sheaves and stars, were bowing down to him. Because of his dreams, his brothers were jealous of Joseph and hated him even more (Gen. 37:5-11). Later, when Joseph, in obedience to his father&rsquo;s command, went to visit his brothers, they conspired against him and almost slew him. Fortunately, his oldest brother, Reuben, rescued him by proposing that they cast him into a pit that was in the wilderness (Gen. 37:21-22), and Judah suggested that they sell him to the Ishmaelites (Gen. 37:25-27). Thus he was spared from death and was brought to Egypt and sold to an officer of Pharaoh (Gen. 37:36). In this way, Joseph suffered all the ill-treatment from his brothers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Reigning for God</h2>
<p>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob signify the three parts of the experience and life of a complete, spiritually mature person. These three parts of such an experience and life eventually produced a mature Israel, one who could reign for God. Joseph represents the reigning aspect of the mature Israel. Thus, he symbolizes one who is mature in the spiritual life and who reigns for God.</p>
<p>Genesis 37:2 says, &ldquo;These are the generations of Jacob.&rdquo; Then it goes on to tell us of the life of Joseph. This proves that Joseph&rsquo;s life was a part of Jacob&rsquo;s generation. Because of this, the last fourteen chapters of Genesis combine the record of Joseph&rsquo;s life with the record of Jacob&rsquo;s, considering them as the biography of one person. Joseph was an aspect, a part, of Jacob. He was Jacob&rsquo;s expression. When Joseph was in power, it was actually Jacob who was reigning through Joseph. Joseph&rsquo;s reigning and ruling over Egypt signifies that all who are spiritually mature will reign for God and rule over the earth. At the conclusion of the age of grace, Christ will come back to take the whole earth and set up the millennial kingdom on the earth. At that time, all those throughout the ages who have been perfected unto the maturity of life will be co-kings with Christ (Rev. 20:6), ruling over the nations on earth in the millennial kingdom.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Participating in the Double Portion<br />
of the Land as a Portion of the Birthright</h2>
<p>Because of his purity, Joseph overcame the temptation of the lust of the flesh (Gen. 39:7-12). He conducted himself as a bright star shining in darkness. Hence, the birthright was transferred from the lust-indulging Reuben to Joseph (1 Chron. 5:1-2). He received the double portion of the land, signifying the enjoyment of Christ in full, as a portion of the birthright. In Genesis 48, when Joseph brought his two sons to Jacob, Jacob said, &ldquo;And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt, before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine&rdquo; (v. 5). Jacob&rsquo;s intention was to replace Reuben and Simeon, his first two sons, with the two sons of Joseph, that Joseph might become his firstborn to participate in the double portion of the land as a portion of the birthright.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Typifying Christ</h2>
<p>According to the record of the Bible, Joseph was altogether perfect, without defect. Joseph is the perfect one in the Old Testament, and Jesus is the perfect One in the New Testament. Hence, Joseph is a type of Christ in His perfection. He typifies Christ as the Father&rsquo;s Beloved (Gen. 37:3-4; Matt. 3:17; 17:5); as the One who ministered to God&rsquo;s people according to the will of God the Father (Gen. 37:12-17; John 6:38), but was hated, harassed, and betrayed by them (Gen. 37:4-5, 8, 18-28); as the One who was delivered into the prison of death (Gen. 39:20; Acts 2:23) and resurrected from the prison of death (Gen. 41:14; Acts 2:24); and as the One who was enthroned with authority (Gen. 41:40-44; Matt. 28:18; Acts 2:36; Rev. 3:21), who received glory (Gen. 41:42; Heb. 2:9) and gifts (Gen. 41:42; Acts 2:33), and who became the Savior of the world, the Sustainer of Life (Gen. 41:56-57; Acts 5:31; John 6:50-51). Joseph&rsquo;s taking the Egyptian woman Asenath as his wife is a type of Christ&rsquo;s taking the church as His wife from among the Gentiles after He was rejected by the Jews (Gen. 41:45). Joseph&rsquo;s brothers&rsquo; being forced to turn to Joseph (Gen. 42:1-6) typifies the Israelites&rsquo; being forced to turn to Christ (Zech. 12:10). Eventually, Joseph acknowledged his ignorant brothers (Gen. 45:1-4, 14-15) and enabled them to participate in his reign (Gen. 45:18; 47:4-6). This is a type showing how Christ will acknowledge the ignorant nation of Israel (Rom. 11:26-27) and will enable the Jews to participate in His reign in the earthly part of the millennial kingdom (Zech. 14:16-19).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Reuben, Levi, Judah, and Joseph were all related to the birthright. The birthright, a continuation of the various excellent qualities and blessings of the forefathers, includes the double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship. As the firstborn, Reuben should have inherited the birthright; but because his lust boiled over like water, he lost the preeminence of the birthright. Because of his cruel disposition, Levi did not receive Jacob&rsquo;s blessing; yet because of their faithfulness to Jehovah, his descendants received the priesthood as a portion of the birthright. They had the privilege of drawing near to God and of serving God. Because of his love for the brothers, in particular his taking care of Joseph, who was in tribulation, Judah received the kingship as a portion of the birthright; that is, he brought the authority of God to the people. Joseph was special among the sons of Jacob and was separate from his brothers. He continued the way of life that chooses God, the way taken by his forefathers. Although he suffered the ill-treatment of his brothers and passed through various trials and sufferings, he was prosperous in all things because he had the presence of God. Eventually, he was able to reign for God and receive glory. Hence, he symbolizes one who is mature in the spiritual life and who reigns for God. Furthermore, he received the double portion of the land as a portion of the birthright. Thus he had the right and the position to enjoy Christ in full. His whole life was altogether perfect, without defect. Therefore, he is a type of Christ in His perfection.</p>
