THAT ARE TAKING PLACE ON EARTH TODAY</h2>
<p>Today three things are taking place on earth: the consuming by the Roman locusts, the suffering of Israel, and the manifestation of Christ. We are joined neither to the consuming of the Roman locusts nor to the suffering of Israel but to the manifestation of Christ. Little of Christ is manifested in the Roman Catholic Church and in the denominations, but Christ is manifested in His recovery. Today we are in the line in which Christ is being manifested. The line of the manifestation of Christ will eventually bring us into the fuller manifestation of Christ in the age of restoration. This fuller manifestation of Christ will consummate in the fullest manifestation of Christ in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. This is the proper eschatology. This is the best, the clearest, and the most inclusive eschatology.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD AND THE BIBLE BOTH BEING REAL</h2>
<p>God is real. If God were not real, there could not be such a book as the Bible. The Bible tells us beforehand concerning world history. The Bible is the only book that predicts human history so accurately and all-inclusively. Therefore, we believe not only that our God is real but also that the Bible is real.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A CLEAR VIEW<br />
CONCERNING THREE MATTERS</h2>
<p>We all need to have a clear view of the age in which we are living, of where we are, and of what our goal should be.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Present Age</h2>
<p>We are living in an age, the continuation of the preceding ages, in which our God is still moving. He is working among the Jews and by the nations to perform His economy in the building up of the organism of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Where We Are</h2>
<p>We need to see that today we, the believers in Christ, are in the Body of Christ. We all are members of the Body of Christ, which is the organism of the Triune God. As members of the Body, we should aspire to be overcomers, the mighty ones (Joel 3:11) who will return with Christ to deal with Antichrist at the battle of Armageddon and who will be His co-kings in the millennium.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Goal as Members of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>Furthermore, we should be clear concerning our goal as members of the Body. Our goal is to enlarge the manifestation of Christ intrinsically. We do not care for a mere outward enlargement. We do not appreciate a good outward appearance, and we do not want any kind of fa&#231;ade. On the contrary, we desire to see the intrinsic enlargement of the manifestation of Christ in the Spirit of the processed Triune God and by the life of our Father, the eternal, almighty divine Being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE OVERCOMING WAY</h2>
<p>I hope that we all will take not the ordinary Christian way but the overcoming way to be the mighty ones who can match the unique mighty One. Christ is now on the throne in the heavens, waiting for us to be perfected and matured. Eventually the time will be ripe for Him to come back to deal with the nations, to save the remnant of Israel, and to complete God&rsquo;s economy with us. Then the age of restoration will be ushered in. That age will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s expression in Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of the Minor Prophets &nbsp; pg 35</div><br></body></html>
