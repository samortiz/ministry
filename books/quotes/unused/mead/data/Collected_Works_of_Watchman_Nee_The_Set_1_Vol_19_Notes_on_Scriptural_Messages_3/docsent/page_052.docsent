   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE POWER OF RESURRECTION Scripture Reading: Acts 13:33; 1 Cor 12:13; Eph 1:16-23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to consider one matter before God, which is the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a great subject, and we cannot cover it fully within this limited space.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I only intend to point out the most central principle in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But I must state again that this cannot be explained clearly in human language, and the human mind cannot comprehend it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Human words and thoughts are useless in understanding resurrection because this matter is beyond human thoughts and words.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can only look to the Lord's Spirit to reveal this matter to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even though the creation of man was good and perfect, we must understand that it did not reach God's goal because man did not have God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Man's creation was perfect but not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When God created all things, they were complete, but when He created man, His purpose was not completed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In one sense man was perfect, and the work of creation was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But since the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life were placed before man, we should realize that the purpose of man's creation was not yet complete.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The work of creating man was finished; he was a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But he still did not have the life represented by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God finished the creation of all things, and in one sense, He also finished the creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in another sense, man had not yet reached the stage of completion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the difference between man and all the other creatures; after all the other creatures were created, there was no need to add anything more to them because God had no other demand on them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But God has a special purpose for man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why there was a need to complete another step after man was created.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This step required man's initiative; he had to take in the fruit of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Unfortunately, man took in the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil instead of the fruit of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must see that man's purpose in creation was not complete; God had not gained man according to His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even if man had not eaten the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, God's heart would still not have been satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In other words, whether or not man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he was still limited and somewhat short.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even when he reached his highest attainment, he was still short; he had not reached a point of completion that was according to God's eternal plan because he did not have God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We know that in creating Adam, God collected the dust of the earth and breathed into it the breath of life, making him a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But His purpose was not finished.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was not enough because man did not have God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Man only had the created life; he did not have the uncreated life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Man was still bound by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His creation brought him to a certain point, but according to God's plan, he had not reached the stage of completion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, since the time of Adam, God has been working continuously for the purpose of gaining a man who is fully according to His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We see that God worked on man throughout the entire Old Testament from Genesis 3, with Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joshua, Samuel, David, and many others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The purpose of His work was to fulfill His purpose in these men.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We see that these men were indeed gained by God, and God indeed completed His work through these men.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As far as God's particular purpose for these men was concerned, God gained them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But as far as a man who could fulfill God's eternal purpose, they still came short.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These men all stopped at a certain point.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every one of them reached a certain point and stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nevertheless, the highest point that they reached was part of what a man after God's plan should have.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the New Testament a man came, who was the Son of God Himself coming to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was the Word who became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This man was the man that God had been waiting for.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man, according to God's heart, was indeed complete at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This man was Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to remember that Christ is the man that God has been waiting for throughout all the years.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ is a completed man, a man who represents God, a typical man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But it was not enough for the Lord Jesus to be such a man on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even though He was different from other men on earth because He possessed God's nature and was a perfect man, He was still limited by the human limitations with respect to His power.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Time could limit Him, and space could limit Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the four men took the paralytic to the Lord Jesus, there were too many people, and they had to remove the roof to let him down before the Lord Mark 2:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When someone wanted to touch Him, she had to press upon Him before she could touch Him 5:27-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord commended the great faith of the centurion because he said to the Lord, "Lord, I am not fit for You to enter under my roof; but only speak a word, and my servant will be healed."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He knew that he did not need to press the Lord and touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He knew the unlimitedness of the Lord, and the Lord commended him that his faith was great Matt 8:5-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In terms of His humanity, the expression of the Lord on earth was limited and had not yet reached the highest point according to God's view.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This was with respect to His power.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This does not apply to His character; in His character, He could not have been more perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But in the manifestation of His power, He was limited.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After His death and resurrection, He reached the stage of perfection and attained the highest peak.</S>
