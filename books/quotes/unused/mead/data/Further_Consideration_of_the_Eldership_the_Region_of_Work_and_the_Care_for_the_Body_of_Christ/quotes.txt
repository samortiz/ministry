[1]  CONTENTS Knowing the Body Keeping the Oneness of the Body and Maintaining a Good Order in the Body
[2]  CHAPTER ONE KNOWING THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4; Acts 2:42; 15:1-34; Rom 15:25-27; 16:1-4; Acts 19:21; 20:16; 21:12-13, 17-19; 1 Cor 1:12; Gal 2:8-9; Acts 18:24; 19:1a; 1 Cor 1:12; 4:6; 16:12
[3]  Prayer: Lord, we worship You for Your economy and for Your sovereignty over us today that we all could be gathered together at this time and in this place.
[4]  The door is also wide open to the Lord's recovery in Russia.
[5]  The Problem of the Thought of Being a Hero
[6]  In this elders' meeting, I have been prepared by the Lord to say something very practical to the three age groups the young people, the middle-aged brothers, and the old brothers.
[7]  I was humble, because I did not know much about life, the Spirit, Christ, or the church as the Body of Christ.
[8]  In the recovery we have been suffering and suffering from 1922 up to now because of these three things: the pride of the younger ones, the thought of being a hero of the middle-aged ones, and the opinions of the older ones.
[9]  In the past two years of the full-time training in Anaheim, I can testify that I and all the trainers did not have anything other than the truth, the Spirit, Christ, and the church, the Body of Christ.
[10]  We should be serious in taking the eldership in the recovery.
[11]  Not only should the young ones be subject to the older ones, but also the older ones should be subject to the young ones in the fear of Christ Eph 5:21; 1 Pet 5:5 .
[12]  In doctrine, it may not seem so good to say that the Spirit is the Body, but in actuality the Spirit is the Body.
[13]  Locality as the church ground of a local church separates the church in existence but does not divide the church in essence.
[14]  I am concerned that in the Lord's recovery, the brothers in a certain country may consider that the work there is their work.
[15]  If we want to be those who are in the practicality of the Body, we need to keep the oneness of the Body and maintain a good order in the Body.
[16]  We have taught much concerning the Body, and we have printed many books concerning the Body, but when a certain situation arises, not many would take care of the Body.
[17]  Today in all of Christianity, the reality of the Body is absent because there is no oneness.
[18]  At this point in our fellowship concerning knowing the Body, I would like to add a word concerning those saints whom the Lord used to recover the experiences of the inner life.
[19]  Brother Austin-Sparks visited us in Taiwan in 1955 and in 1957.
[20]  Regardless of how much you care for Christ and have experienced Christ, if you meet in a way that does not care for the truth of the church, your meeting is a division.
[21]  I must testify in honesty that I have been commissioned by the Lord to carry His truth and bring His recovery to the United States.
[22]  The recovery is based upon the truth that Christ has only one Body.
[23]  Even if these divisive ones move to a city in which there is not a church, they have to be checked concerning what kind of relationship they have with the other churches.
[24]  KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE BODY Keeping the Oneness of the Spirit
[25]  To keep the oneness of the Body is actually to keep the oneness of the Spirit because the Spirit is the reality and the essence of the Body.
[26]  No one can deny that having a good speaker speak every Lord's Day helps people to a certain extent, but the annulling and killing of the saints' function is hidden in this practice.
[27]  If someone takes the way of one man speaking and the rest listening for more than ten years, the ones under his speaking, who received much help, will be annulled in their function and their capacity of speaking for the Lord.
[28]  Now that we are practicing the God-ordained way, many new ones among us are being raised up in a proper way to be functioning members of the Body of Christ.
[29]  I hope that we will rise up to drop everything other than Christ and to carry Christ as our ark, to carry the Body of Christ as our tabernacle, and to follow the truth as our pillar of fire in the night and our pillar of cloud in the day.
