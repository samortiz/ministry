   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. To Have Close, Intimate, and Thorough Fellowship with the Lord and with the Seeking Saints</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to have close, intimate, and thorough fellowship with the Lord and with the seeking saints.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To fellowship only with the Lord is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must also be in fellowship with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to get companions with whom we can labor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the example in the Bible, Daniel had three companions Dan 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I would encourage you to get three companions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not ask the elders to give them to you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ask the Lord to lead you to someone, making this one your companion in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then you can get a few others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Spontaneously, you and your companions will be a very good small group.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The elders should not try to form the groups in an organizational way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They must stir up the saints to be vitalized first.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once you get vitalized, you will have the deep sensation that you need companions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then you need to follow the Lord's leading to gain some to join you to be a group.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This will be an organic group, and eventually this group will be vitalized.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Four saints grouped together is a sufficient number.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not get more saints at this point.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead, be vitalized to an extent that you would go fishing to get some new fish.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When your organic group of four saints is vitalized, you will not need to hunt for more saints to join you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, you will go fishing to get some new fish.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>D. To Reconsecrate Yourself to the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After you get your companions in fellowship, you must learn to take the lead to reconsecrate yourself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may have consecrated yourself already, but you need to be consecrated afresh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Presenting Your Body as a Living Sacrifice to the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To present your body means to give your body to the Lord as a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have to sacrifice your body to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is what Paul taught in Romans 12:1.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You need to reconsecrate yourself in presenting your body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Being Transformed by the Renewing of the Mind from Being Fashioned according to This Age</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Firstly, you give your body to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Following this you should have your mind renewed from being fashioned according to this age Rom 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The world is the satanic system, which is composed of many ages Eph 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>An age is a part, a section, an aspect, the present and modern appearance, of the system of Satan, which is used by him to usurp and occupy people and keep them away from God and His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A number of years ago, men wore wide neckties.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That was a current of that age.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Later, they wore narrow ties; that was a current of another age.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the sixties, men began to have long hair; that was a current of that age.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the worldly people are fashioned according to the present age.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to be vitalized, we need to be transformed by the renewing of the mind so that we will not be fashioned according to this age.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Not Being Slothful in Zeal, but Burning in Spirit to Serve the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our body needs to be presented to the Lord, our mind needs to be renewed, taken over by the Lord, and our spirit needs to be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This involves our entire being body, soul, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to be persons who are fully gained and occupied by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not be slothful in zeal, but burning in spirit to serve the Lord Rom 12:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then we will be vitalized.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>E. To Be the Overcomers in the Church Life 1.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the Age of the Overcomers according to the Lord's Calling</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church life is the right place for you to be an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But this does not mean that as long as you are in the church life, you are an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is one thing to be in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is another thing to be an overcomer in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As Today's Zion in Today's Jerusalem the Church Life</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the Old Testament, there is the city of Jerusalem with Zion as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Jerusalem was built on a mountain range.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Mount Zion was one of the mountains on which Jerusalem was built.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Zion is the center and Jerusalem is the circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The church life is today's Jerusalem; within the church life there must be a group of overcomers, and these overcomers are today's Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>According to Revelation 14, the overcomers are standing on Mount Zion with the Lord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Actually in typology, the overcomers are today's Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then in the last two chapters of Revelation, there is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Without Zion the overcomers , Jerusalem the church life cannot be kept and maintained. a. The High Peak, the Center, the Uplifting, the Strengthening, the Enriching, and the Reality of the Church, the Holy City</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Zion is the high peak, the center, the uplifting, the strengthening, the enriching, and the reality of the church, the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If there are no overcomers in a local church, that church is like Jerusalem without Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There are some churches like this today, so they are weak churches.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A local church must have some overcomers, and these overcomers are the peak and the center of that local church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They are the uplifting, the strengthening, the enriching, and the reality of that local church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you take away these overcomers from that local church, that local church becomes like a flat tire.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The full-time training is for the producing of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Once a church has some full-time workers as overcomers, that church is like Jerusalem with the peak of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The overcomers as Zion are the highlight, the center, and the reality of the church. b.</S>

   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is why at the end of the Bible, in the last book, there is the calling for the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Today the way to become vitalized is to answer the Lord's call to be an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There are two ways before us today.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We can either choose to be vitalized or choose not to be vitalized.</S>
