<p>Because only prayer can keep us in the spirit, the New Testament tells us to unceasingly pray (1 Thes. 5:17). When we do not pray, we are not in the spirit, and when we are not in the spirit, our practice and living are but a picture. Our practice may be &ldquo;realistic,&rdquo; resembling reality, but it is merely a human practice without the spirit. Only that which is lived out of the spirit is real. We should speak to our spouse in the spirit and also buy things in the spirit. The Spirit is all-inclusive. The genuine Christian life and the genuine church life are in the Spirit. The secret to being a Christian is with the spirit.</p>
<p>This generation of young people is more blessed than previous generations, because the light that we now have is clearer. If we are not in the spirit when we speak of being dealt with, obeying our seniors, and having an absolute consecration, then we are merely drawing a picture. The spirit is the reality. Without the spirit, everything is a picture. I was not so clear when I spoke this several years ago, but during the recent turmoil I learned the lesson of doing nothing. The saints in the United States were amazed that I did nothing and said nothing concerning the dissenting ones. But I was clear that by neglecting the Spirit and life, we had opened the door to Satan for the pretenders to cause trouble. I realized that methods are futile and that we had to return to the Spirit and live in life. Thus, we received more light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO LIVE CHRIST</h2>
<p>One day after the training on Ephesians, the Lord rebuked me while I was praying. He asked me how much I lived Christ during the day. I could only confess that I spent too little time living Him. Then I saw that my living was according to the letter of the Bible and according to knowledge and doctrine. I could not say that Christ was my not going to the movie theater and my not loving the world. Buddhist monks are separated from human society and love the world less than we do, but is that Christ? Chinese peasants are not fashionable, but is that Christ? The Lord told me that it is one thing to love Him and another to live Him. We must not only love Christ but also live Him. It is not sufficient to say that we do not watch movies because we love Christ. We still need to live Christ. I should not go to the movies because He is not going to the movies. This light shined brightly in me.</p>
<p>Whether in co-workers&rsquo; meetings, young people&rsquo;s meetings, elders&rsquo; meetings, service meetings, or other meetings, I have only one burden&mdash;to live Christ. This is the only &ldquo;dish&rdquo; that I will serve for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I have no other burden. I only want the saints to live Christ and live in the spirit.</p>
<p>Our way and our ground are right. We are taking the way of the recovery, and we are standing on the proper ground because the Lord wants this way and this ground. If we do not take this way and stand on this ground, the Lord will have no way to go on. However, if we take the right way and stand on the proper ground but do not have the reality of living Christ, we are empty, and the Lord still has no way to go on.</p>
<p>We have experienced many turmoils, but where are the dissenting ones today? What is their condition? They are still Christians, and some may even be working for the Lord, but we must admit that they are scattered and have lost the blessing. They declared that they saw a vision, but they have each gone their own way and are finished. Several have left us, and they ended up with nothing. This proves that our way is right and that our ground also is right.</p>
<p>In the past few decades the Lord has made His intention known to us and has given us more light. It is difficult to find other publications with spiritual weight or of spiritual value. Between the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century many weighty, spiritual books were published, but since then almost no publications of spiritual value have been published. The Lord&rsquo;s mercy put us on a way that corresponds to His heart. However, if we merely take the right way and stand on the right ground without the reality of living Christ, we are empty, and the Lord cannot go on.</p>
<p>If we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery do not live Christ, where will the Lord gain a group of people who live Christ? Because the Lord has had mercy on us, we should care for nothing but the spirit. We should drop every problem and take care of the spirit. It is not a matter of right or wrong but of whether we are in the spirit. This is the only standard. We may do everything right and be free of problems, but it will be empty and of no value if we are not in the spirit. At best, our doing and living will be a picture for others to look at.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
