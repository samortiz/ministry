<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Completion of God's Creation of Man<br>in the View of His Dispensing<br>according to His Economy<br>Needing the Entire Bible to Fully Define</H2><P>Why does the record of God's creation of the heavens, the earth, the plants, the animals, man, and billions of items occupy only two chapters in the book of Genesis? I do not believe that God wrote these two chapters merely to tell us of the creation. Actually, these two chapters do not speak mainly of the creation; rather, they unveil to us the divine dispensing according to the divine economy. Although we cannot find the expressions the divine dispensing and the divine economy in these chapters, the fact is there. The intention of Genesis 1 and 2 is to show us how God made a preparation for His upcoming dispensing according to His divine economy. Genesis 1 and 2 are a record of how God created man with the intention that He would be man's life and content.</P><P>After His creation of man, God brought man into a garden and placed him in front of two trees. One tree, the tree of life, was good for food (2:9), but the other tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, issued in death (v. 17). God warned man not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</P><P>God Himself was embodied in the tree of life. The tree of life is mentioned again in the book of Revelation (2:7; 22:2). In Revelation 2:7 the Lord Jesus gave a promise to the overcomers, saying, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God." Then in Revelation 22:1-2 a river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. Along the flow of the river and on the two sides of the river, a vine tree grows. The tree bears fruit every month for the supply of all the inhabitants in the New Jerusalem, and the river flows to quench their thirst. The New Jerusalem itself is constituted of the Triune God as gold, pearl, and precious stones (21:18-21). The mentioning of these precious materials, the river, and the tree of life corresponds to the record in Genesis 2. In Genesis the precious materials are there but are not built up. But at the end of the Bible, these materials have all been built into one building, the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the composition of these three materials to be the bride (19:7-8; 21:2; 22:17), the real Eve, to match the real man, the Triune God. At that time, God will have a counterpart with which to spend His eternity for His rest, joy, and satisfaction.</P><P>The entire Bible is a record of the divine dispensing of the processed Triune God into the transformed tripartite man, issuing in an entity that is not only a combination but also a blending, a mingling, of the Triune God with the tripartite man. This entity satisfies God and makes Him happy, and at the same time, it causes man to rest in God and be satisfied and happy with Him.</P>
