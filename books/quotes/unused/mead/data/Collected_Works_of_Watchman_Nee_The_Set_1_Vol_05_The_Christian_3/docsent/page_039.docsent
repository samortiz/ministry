   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Although Philadelphia is utterly weak, she is faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many times there may be much power without, yet within one is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is what the Holy Spirit means in 1 Corinthians 13.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The believers can speak the language of the angels and the tongues of all men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They can know all mysteries and all knowledge, yet at the same time be utterly weak and powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is a most dangerous thing to have more of a manifestation of outward power than an inward working and a oneness with God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The inward life must match the outward power.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must remember that God's marvelous gifts and revelations are not the source of our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Miracles and works of wonder do not render people strength.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They may comfort us at the time of sufferings and may testify for the word of God at the time of trials, but they will not give us the inward strength.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul's experience is one example of this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The experiences of being caught away to the third heaven and into Paradise and of hearing unspeakable words which are not allowed for man to speak are most definitely amazing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They gave Paul some comfort at the time of trial.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, this did not afford him any inward strength.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Except for the special work of God, he would have become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of course this shows that the strength was not there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Still, whenever he felt that he was weak, the power of God came upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our hearts are more evil than anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Unless we are watchful, we will glorify ourselves with the gifts of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our temptations are not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why we need different kinds of "thorns" to preserve us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was in this thorn-pressed condition that Paul realized his weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul had to have this feeling of weakness before he could realize where strength lay.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, whether or not God gives us miraculous gifts, the greatest strength lies in the mingling of a feeling of weakness with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is possible to realize one's weakness without losing one's faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus had the same feeling when He went through the sufferings: "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Father, save Me out of this hour" John 12:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suffering drew the Lord closer to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How about us?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When sufferings come, we are drawn to the sufferings themselves and begin to doubt God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our minds are always set on the method of deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are stuck to the environment or to ourselves and are closed completely to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the Lord Jesus was not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As soon as sorrow came, He said: "Father, save Me out of this hour."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the consideration of our weaknesses does not turn us to trust in God, we are being faithless.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A trust in God always brings strength.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Difficulties can come, and God can allow many things to expose our weaknesses, but simple faith always advances forward.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It never plans what to do ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead it trusts in the unfailing help of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The real strength is a steady following of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine" 1 Sam 17:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the eyes of David, there was no difference between the lion, the bear, and Goliath.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was equally weak to them, and they were equally fierce to him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet he was equally unafraid of them, and he trusted equally in God's deliverance from them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God has delivered me once; now I "reckon" that He will deliver me again.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is totally different from the attitude of the ones sent by Moses to spy out the land, who considered themselves as grasshoppers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They forgot to compare God with the children of Anak.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead, they compared themselves with the children of Anak.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Of course, they failed in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me" Phil 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the secret to all victories.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is useless to look to ourselves, for there is nothing in ourselves except weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, if we look to the Lord, we will receive deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"You have a little power."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In a situation where the general condition has corrupted, God's way is not to award those who have great strength.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the Israelites returned from Babylon, they saw God's awarding of abundant grace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, this was no outward power.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At that time there was nothing outward worth exhibiting.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even their enemies mocked them saying that foxes could tear down their walls!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Neh 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The same is true with Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Israelites did not have strong fortifications to withstand the Samaritans.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord was their wall of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The first thing they built was an altar to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord occupied the first place in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Since the Lord was their wall, they could wait for the construction of other works to come later.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Here we did not have the slaying of the firstborn by the angels, and we did not see any special calamities befalling the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God did not perform any special miracles for them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Their only promise was "My Spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not" Hag 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When one fears the enemy, all strength will be gone, but when one looks to the Lord, he will forget about the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>"And have kept My word and have not denied My name."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Is it true that all they had was a little power and nothing else?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>No. The Lord says: "And have kept My word and have not denied My name." How does the Lord know that they have a little power? Surely it is by their keeping the Lord's word and not denying His name.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They have not received the gifts which the church has lost; they have not received a position, a great number in the church, or a place before men.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Rather, they received strength before God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Real power lies in obedience and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is precisely because the Lord's word has been despised that there is the need to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is precisely because the Lord's name has been rejected that we should not reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Indeed, the Lord's word has become widespread in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>However, has man received it yet?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord's name is indeed known, but has it been honored?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Have the believers loved it and sought after it like seeking after treasure?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Are believers gathered together to pray and to read for the purpose of further understanding the Lord's word and for closer intimacy to the Lord's name?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>How many believers are there who honor the Lord and hold His word as truly authoritative?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We need inward spiritual power before we can obey and worship the Lord in such environments.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Here there is no evangelism or great revivals but the loving, serving, and extolling of Christ by a small body of people.</S>
