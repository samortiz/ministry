<p>Our natural constitution has many problems, shortcomings, and defects. Whether a church is under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing does not depend on eloquent speakers or capable persons. I told the saints in the United States that we should thank the Lord because two kinds of persons have left the churches in the United States: &ldquo;donkeys&rdquo; and &ldquo;monkeys.&rdquo; The church is a flock of sheep; we are all sheep. However, donkeys are taller than sheep, and they jump and kick wildly. Monkeys are clever and good at playing tricks. Everyone suffers when there are donkeys and monkeys in the church. The church receives blessings because it is a flock of sheep, not because there are big donkeys and clever monkeys. As long as we are a flock of sheep, there will be the blessing.</p>
<p>We may think that we have been under the blessing because we are not big donkeys or clever monkeys. However, even though we may not be big donkeys or clever monkeys, we still need to bow down and confess that we have the temper of a donkey and the cleverness of a monkey. In the church we often are wild and still play tricks.</p>
<p>There is a church in North America that could not go on for many years. In recent years the Lord raised up an environment that forced the donkeys and monkeys to leave. Now there are no more donkeys and monkeys; there is only a flock of little sheep in that locality. Outsiders have asked, &ldquo;How can there be any blessing when no one is left to take the lead?&rdquo; But that church is now under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. The brothers do not have the gift of speaking, nor are they capable of administrating; hence, they always fellowship with the Lord and with one another. There are no conflicts among them, nor are there peculiar tempers. As a result, the Lord&rsquo;s blessing is with them.</p>
<p>The Lord has enlightened us to see the way that matches His heart concerning the ground of oneness. We know that other ways do not work, so we must take this way. However, we must take this way together; we cannot walk on it alone. It is not easy to walk with others. If there is only one person, he can decide how to walk, but it is not easy for four people to carry a palanquin, because of differences in their height, pace, and temperament. When four people work together, their peculiarities will immediately be manifested.</p>
<p>For example, suppose there are younger and older elders in a locality. These elders should open to one another and should have equal consideration for one another. It is not acceptable for one elder to think that the other three are under him, nor should he say, &ldquo;I am the only one taking the lead. The other three must listen to me.&rdquo; In such a situation there will be no blessing, even if the way and the ground are right. As long as there are some who depend on their seniority and take pride in their seniority, the Spirit will have no way to work. Whether the elders are old or young, strong or weak, if they are bearing responsibility together, they should stand on equal footing, fellowshipping with one another and being open to one another in all things. A situation in which the elders merely tolerate one another to avoid arguments may seem to be fine, but it will not yield results in the spirit.</p>
<p>People can succeed in society by clever maneuvering, but such maneuvering does not work in the church. Clever maneuvering involves playing tricks and can be likened to burying a corpse in the snow. The corpse will be hidden for a few months. However, when spring comes and the snow melts, the corpse will be exposed. Those who do things by clever maneuvering and tricks are deceiving others as well as themselves. After a while the saints in the church will know that such a person is not genuine, sincere, or faithful. The church life is a long-term matter; hence, our heart and condition cannot be hidden. The wisest way is to be open and to not hide things. If we agree, we should say that we agree, but if we disagree, we should say that we disagree. We should not insist on our opinions, nor should we pretend to be polite. We should be fully open and present ourselves without playing politics or clever maneuvering. When saints coordinate together, nothing should be hidden, but everything should be open. We will have genuine fellowship and prayer when we are only little sheep without clever maneuvering or peculiar temperaments. If we are not sheep, we will merely go through the motions of praying, but our prayer will be a pretense. If we do not fellowship in the spirit, are not in harmony, and do not have genuine one accord, it will be hard for us to receive the blessing.</p>
<p>When we live in the spirit, we will not maneuver, nor will we be foolish. Our spirit is sober and can be likened to the sense of smell. If we live in our spirit, we will know the true condition of those whom we contact. In the Lord&rsquo;s work, in the administration of the church, and in the shepherding and perfecting of the saints, human wisdom and cleverness are useless and only spread death. Clever maneuvering involves deceiving people. If we use clever maneuvering in our dealings with the saints, we will eventually offend them. We must deal with others in truthfulness, that is, in spirit, without tricks and maneuvering. May we all be faithful to live in the spirit. If the Lord leads us to do something, we should do it, but if the Lord does not lead us, we should not do anything. We should not do things in order to please others. We do not speak to please others. If we do not speak, it is not because we are maneuvering but because we are in the spirit. If the Spirit guides us not to speak, we should not speak, but if the Spirit guides us to speak, we should speak. I do not hide things from the brothers. I do not use human wisdom or clever maneuvering with the brothers, nor do I insist on my opinions. I am open, and I treat others equally. If we are open and treat others equally, the Spirit will have a free way among us, and the blessing will come. Furthermore, the responsible brothers will gain the respect and trust of the saints. Our only way is to live in the spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
