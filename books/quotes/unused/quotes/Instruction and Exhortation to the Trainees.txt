A proper character is another matter that the Lord wants to gain in us during the course of the full-time training
If we would not be willing to do this, we will never have any success in our dealings with the Lord concerning our character
If we would be dealt with and even broken by the Lord in this aspect of our character, we would become very useful
We must have a clear, sober mind and a very strong will in order to give ourselves to the Lord and leave ourselves in His hand
The young man felt that it was not logical to be accepted as a student to learn to sing, yet not be allowed to sing for three years
They may be burdened to learn how to take care of people and bear remaining fruit, but they consider themselves not to be useful
The fourth matter that we will stress in this training is the perfecting and building up of a proper character
As we are learning to serve the Lord full-time and have dedicated ourselves to this, we now have at least four and a half months
Although there are three occasions before noon and two in the afternoon, we may not pray during these five times
Often, before we finish praying for our relatives, another burden will rise up within us to pray for the church
In 1 Timothy 2:1 Paul charges us to pray for everyone, but do you believe that Timothy had a burden for everyone that he prayed for?
Since they loved each other, both the husband and the wife preferred to live to see the other party die in order to take care of the other
Although this training is one of truth, life, the gospel, and character, without prayer all of these things might be in vain
According to our present way of carrying on the training, we would like to have altogether two terms for each trainee
We will always begin our training in the fall, not in the spring, because the first year of the training began last fall
All of those who have been here for the last two terms are, no doubt, considering what they should do and where they should go
According to the Old Testament, from the very beginning God did have the intention to train and discipline His people
In all of the ancient fathers such as Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and Isaac, we cannot see much of God's discipline
It was an individual Israel in Genesis, but when we come to the book of Exodus, there is no more individual Israel
Immediately after God rescued this corporate Israel, the children of Israel, out of Egypt, the Lord brought them to Mount Horeb
Whether the children of Israel wanted to stay for a longer or shorter time did not depend upon them, but upon Him
In addition to building a habitation for God, there was the need of the service of the priesthood to be set up to serve in the tabernacle
Whether we are too slow or too quick, humble or proud, patient or impatient is not a matter of conduct, but of what we are
We may have picked up a lot of knowledge concerning what the Spirit is and what life is, but what about our being?
We may have a great deal of knowledge and a certain amount of growth in life, yet without transformation we will surely cause trouble
According to my knowledge and experience, every eight to ten years there is some kind of turmoil within the church life
If we would stay away from the training and still work here, after only three months we would say that we made a mistake
If we do not possess an adequate amount of transformation, then after two months, everybody will be disgusted with the full-time training
It seems that Moses did fail and was defeated in his forty-year work, for even he himself did not enter into the good land
We may choose to go back to the church that sent us and has been supporting us, to serve the church there full-time
There may be a few churches that would not oppose or criticize the new way, yet they do not have a heart to take the new way
We have been practicing this principle for years and years in other matters as well, such as in the matter of baptism
In nature, in element, and in ground, the church in Corinth, regardless how evil and sinful, was still the church
Whether a church would take the new way or not it is still the church because it is the church of God in a certain city sanctified in Christ
We would all like to go to a place where the elders are so positive and one with us to help us carry out what we have been trained to do
Even though a church opposes the new way to the uttermost, it is still the church if it is right in its nature, element, and ground
Regardless of its situation and condition, as long as it is right in its nature, in its element, and in its ground, it is the church
We should never go there to revolt, revolutionize everything, or do something to chase away the elders and set up new elders
We do tell people that we have a burden to save the sinners and to visit our relatives, friends, and colleagues
All the churches desire to see the attendants in their meeting function because that strengthens, enriches, and uplifts the meeting
We should go back to that church to serve in the way we have mentioned, until the Lord has a second arrangement
Whatever church raised us up, sent us, and has been supporting us through the years expects us to go back to serve there
We should not take the excuse that because a wonderful work has been started here, there is the need for us to stay
We, our supporting church, and the work here, all three parties, should fellowship together to seek the Lord's will
The training here has a unique purpose to train young people to grow in life, in the truth, in capacity, and to transform their character
Question: In the last chapter of Brother Nee's book Further Talks on the Church Life, he talks about the work, even the centers of the work
Answer: The so-called work according to the New Testament teaching and according to our experience has two aspects
The work has another aspect, which is the work of the gifted persons such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
Question: At the end of the message, you shared that our present way to carry out the training is with two terms
Regardless of time and space, we must not forget that the church of God, the church of Christ, is always one universally and locally
Many of you have been here for two terms, and some have been with us for more than six terms including Taipei, Irving, and Anaheim
When you return to the church that has sent you and is still supporting you, you might feel quite strange there
If you are careless about these twelve points, you will make trouble for others, for the church, and for yourselves
Wherever you go, wherever you are, wherever you stay, and wherever you serve, you should be one with the church
Quite often a number of saints consider the leading ones in other churches to be very good, but not the leading ones in their church
Once a candidate is elected president and ushered into his office, then immediately all the Americans take his leadership
Among 240 million Americans there may be another ten twenty or even fifty who are more intelligent and much more capable than the president
Similarly, we have to believe that it is under God's sovereignty that our president has been elected into office
It does not mean that when others are good in your eyes, you love them, and when you feel that they are not good, you do not love them
We can coordinate, in spite of many differences, with all of the members of the Body of Christ for building up and service
In our training we considered how we could baptize people immediately after visiting them and bringing them to the Lord
Some trainees returned and taught people to always keep turning to the left in visiting people at their doors, so this became a legality
When some trainees return and their church agrees that they should serve the Lord full-time, they consider themselves a co-worker
In their consideration they felt that they should do something so that they could be today's Apostle Paul or at least a big evangelist
Whether you go out and knock on doors or stay at home and call people on the telephone, you must bring the unbelievers to the Lord
In God's eyes there is nothing else but these four horses carrying the gospel, war, famine, and death on the earth
Some groups were good because they contained a number of experienced and gifted brothers who were leaders and teachers
After they sit down, the first one may start to tell what happened to him on that day and ask the other one to pray for him
The group meetings cannot directly build the church because a group is not the church; a group is only a part of the Body
When you return to your locality, you must look to the Lord for His grace so that you can practice these points and live such a life
When there are a few of you doing the same thing with these three or four, you can bring them together for an informal group meeting
After they had agreed to go back and visit the new believers, Barnabas proposed to bring his cousin Mark with them
You must not strive together in other things such as in the interpretation of the Bible, but in the faith of the gospel
Not only is it difficult to strive together to be in one accord in your soul concerning the interpretation of the Bible but it is also wrong
You should be submissive to the leading ones, love all the saints, and learn to cooperate and coordinate with others
