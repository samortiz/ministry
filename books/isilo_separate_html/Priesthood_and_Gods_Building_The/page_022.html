<h1 class="title">GOD IN THE LAMB FLOWING OUT AS LIFE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW JERUSALEM BEING<br />
THE CONCLUSION OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The picture of the New Jerusalem is the conclusion of the Bible. The Bible covers many matters, but the last two chapters of Revelation are its conclusion. This conclusion is not merely explained with words; it is expressed by a picture. This representation is richer than any description. There is the saying that &ldquo;a picture is worth a thousand words.&rdquo; If we want to give others thorough knowledge of a certain matter, a simple picture is better than giving many speeches.</p>
<p>God is wiser than we are. In the Bible He covered many things that are complicated and exceedingly mysterious. If He concluded the Bible with only a &ldquo;speech,&rdquo; the conclusion would be very complicated. He used sixty-six books, from Genesis to Revelation, to cover the entire course of mankind and the history of God with man. The length of a summary through words alone would be incalculable. Even a lengthy thesis would not be able to make things clear. At the end of the Bible God in His wisdom uses a picture as the conclusion to all the things He has done throughout the ages.</p>
<p>All the positive things in the Bible are included in the New Jerusalem, but all the negative things have their end in the lake of fire. Hence, the New Jerusalem is the conclusion of all the positive things in the Bible.</p>

AND THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE AS ITS CENTER</h2>
<p>The center of the picture of the New Jerusalem is a throne and a river of water of life with the tree of life growing on either side of it. The last two chapters of Revelation, which concern the New Jerusalem, seem to stand out in terms of their content and writing style. It seems as if the Bible is complete by the end of chapter 21, which covers different aspects of the New Jerusalem, but chapter 22 gives more details, specifically related to the throne and the river of water of life. Chapter 22 says that in the New Jerusalem there is the throne of God and of the Lamb, out of which proceeds the river of water of life, which is bright as crystal, in the middle of its street, and that the tree of life grows on both sides of the river. The details concerning the New Jerusalem conclude with a throne, a river of water of life, and the tree of life.</p>
<p>The entire Bible concludes with the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem concludes with a throne out of which proceeds a river of water of life on both sides of which grows the tree of life. This is the ultimate conclusion as well as the focal point of the entire Bible. The conclusion to the entire Bible is the throne of God and of the Lamb, the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne, and the tree of life growing on both sides of the river. This is the central line of the entire Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Being in the Lamb</h2>
<p>There is a need to add two points of explanation concerning the throne and the river of water of life. First, God is in the Lamb. Revelation 22:1 says that a river of water of life proceeds &ldquo;out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.&rdquo; This verse speaks of God and of the Lamb, but the throne is singular, not plural. There is only one throne, not two. How can God and the Lamb sit on one throne? Some believers may say that God and the Lamb sit side by side because other verses in the Bible say that the Lamb is sitting at the right hand of God (Matt. 26:64; Mark 14:62; Luke 22:69; Acts 5:31). Reading the Bible is not a simple matter. We should not think that since the Lamb is sitting at the right hand of God, God must be sitting at the left hand of the Lamb. We cannot say this. The Bible says that God wants Christ to be seated at His right hand, but to be at the right hand means to have the first place. To be at the right hand means to be first, to be at the top, and to be superior, having the place of honor, but to be at the left hand means to be second, to be lower, and to be inferior. Therefore, for Christ to sit at the right hand of God means that God has given Him the first place. It does not mean that Christ and God are sitting side by side and occupying one seat. Revelation also says that the Lamb is the lamp and that God is the light (21:23). The light is in the lamp. The light and the lamp are not side by side. Therefore, the words <em>of God and of the Lamb</em> indicate that God is in the Lamb, just as the light is in the lamp.</p>
<p>By reading the Gospel of John we can have a better understanding of the meaning of the expression <em>of God and of the Lamb.</em> The first verse of the Gospel of John says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Verse 14 of chapter 1 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; After the Word came forth, became flesh, John the Baptist introduced Him as the Lamb of God (v. 29). In the beginning of chapter 1 the incarnated Word is God, but at the end of chapter 1 this incarnated One is the Lamb of God. God and the Lamb are inseparable, for God is in the Lamb. By reading chapter 1 thoroughly, we can conclude that the words <em>of God and of the Lamb</em> mean that God is in the Lamb.</p>
<p>In chapter 10 the Lamb, the incarnated Word, said, &ldquo;I and the Father are one&rdquo; (v. 30). This verse makes it even clearer that the words <em>of God and of the Lamb</em> refer to the fact that God is in the Lamb. The two are one.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
