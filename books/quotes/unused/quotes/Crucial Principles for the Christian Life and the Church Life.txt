The universe, which contains the heavens, the earth, and millions of created things, may be likened to our physical body
The meaning of the universe is not in all the visible things but in something that is invisible and physically intangible
Now we know Christ according to the Spirit, but the Spirit also is quite mysterious and intangible in a physical sense
Regardless of how intelligent or educated we are, we will have difficulty explaining certain terms and expressions in John
The story of human beings, the universe, human history, the church, and the Bible is simply the story of this vine and this husbandman
Regardless of what else we know of the Bible, if we do not know the vine and the husbandman, we do not know the Bible
If we do not know the vine and the husbandman, we do not know ourselves; we do not know what we are or what the meaning of our human life is
They know only that they need to eat, sleep, drink, breathe, have a home, find a spouse, beget children, and work to make a living
Growing Christ may be an unfamiliar expression not only to unbelievers but even to most Christians, including many pastors
Although medical doctors have studied the physical life for centuries, their knowledge of life is still very limited
Unlike a pine tree, which is tall and has relatively short branches, a vine does not shoot up but spreads outward through its branches
The Father as the source grows the vine by growing into the vine, and we as the branches grow the vine by expressing the vine
When we are enlightened to see that our unique obligation on the earth today is to live Christ, we will be immediately exposed
We need only to look at the picture of the vine to see that we are branches in Christ and that we should simply live Christ
The way for us to abide in the Lord as branches in the vine is to receive the Lord's word and touch the Spirit
Some saints may think that we do not need to be legal in our Bible reading and that we can read the Bible only when the Spirit inspires us
Reading the Word is our spiritual eating, praying is our spiritual drinking, and praying unceasingly is our spiritual breathing
These are all life necessities, for spiritually we live by them, just as physically we live by eating, drinking, and breathing
Just as we do not wait for inspiration to eat physically, neither should we wait for inspiration to read the Bible
Because eating the word, drinking the Spirit, and breathing the Spirit are necessities of our spiritual life, we should do each one legally
Some saints may find it difficult to spend time in the Word each morning because they must go to school or work very early
Some saints claim that because they were born with a weak disposition, they should not be bound by any legalities
They support this claim by quoting Romans 7:18, which says, 'To will is present with me, but to work out the good is not'
Verses 15 through 17 show that this word was written about overcoming indwelling sin, not about taking care of daily life necessities
No caring parent would excuse a child from eating breakfast simply because the child was born with a weak disposition
In both our pray-reading in the morning and our reading of the Bible later in the day, we need to read consecutively
We should pray-read from the first verse to the last verse of whichever book the Lord chooses, taking a few verses each morning
The Bible is the divine revelation; however, the basic element of the Bible is not the divine revelation but the divine breath
Because the Bible is God's breath, God's presence always accompanies it, for His presence is always with His breath
God is mysterious, universal, and eternal, but we can find His breath in the Bible, for the Bible is His breath
We need to realize that the Bible we hold is simply God's breath and that where God's breath is, there His presence is
Many believers are concerned that after they read a portion of the Bible, they do not remember the verses they have read
Brother Nee pointed out that after water passes through the basket many times, both the rice and the basket are washed
When we come to the Word, we are also washed and cleansed as the divine water of the word passes through us again and again
Just as our physical body needs to be washed every morning, so our inner man needs to be washed morning by morning by coming to the Word
He says that we need to legally come to the Word every morning and legally pray and contact the Lord every day'
From the moment a man enters the military service, he must do everything according to instructions, which are legalities
Without certain necessary legalities, it is impossible to have governments, corporations, schools, or even families
The Bible is constituted with three major items: Christ, who is the living Lord as our life, His death, and His resurrection
In 1 Corinthians there are mainly crossing out, killing, and crucifying, but in 2 Corinthians there is resurrecting
The only way to become righteous is by being crucified and resurrected through the word of the cross and the word of life
We can be pure only by receiving the killing of the word of the cross and the resurrecting of the word of life
In our daily reading of the Bible there is no need for us to read a verse about purity to experience the word of the cross
When we come to the Bible and receive the word of God, we will be nourished, refreshed, watered, washed, killed, and resurrected
If we simply read the Word on the way home, we will not become angry, because our old man will have been crucified on the way
The Bible is not constituted mainly with many teachings; rather, it is constituted with Christ, His death, and His resurrection
For this reason, we all need to spend time in the Bible to take the word into us and, if possible, to store the word within us
If we do not read the Bible we will be void of nourishment refreshment cleansing Christ as our life supply His death and His resurrection
Spending time in the Word is a life matter, but we need to do it legally so that we will not miss all the benefits it brings
When coming to the Bible in the way of eating, we need to avoid exercising our mentality to understand what we read
When we finish reading through the Bible the first time, we should read it a second time, then a third and a fourth time
Although we may not understand a portion the first time we read it, we may understand it the second or the third time
If we practice to daily read and pray-read the Bible, we will see a positive change and much growth in life after only a few months
The anointing mentioned in 1 John comes from the holy anointing oil described in Exodus 30:23-25, which was a compound ointment
The dictionary tells us that to abide is to remain, indicating that the branches' abiding in the vine is simply their remaining in the vine
According to this teaching, we can go to worldly places, such as movie theaters, because the Lord will go with us
The compound ointment was made from a hin of olive oil compounded with four spices: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia
The death of Adam, which brought us all into death , was negative, but the death of Christ, which rescued us out of death, is positive
The effectiveness of Christ's resurrection repels the serpent, Satan, and all the negative 'insects' that come to bother us
The two hundred fifty shekels of cinnamon and two hundred fifty shekels of calamus compose one unit of five hundred shekels split in two
The New Jerusalem has twelve gates, twelve foundations, and measures twelve thousand stadia in all three dimensions
The type of the compound ointment is the source of the number of the New Jerusalem, the ultimate mingling of God and man
In the previous chapter we saw that the constituents of God's word in the Bible are Christ, His death, and His resurrection
Christ's resurrection is a constituent of the word, and His resurrection has also been compounded into the Spirit
As long as we eat the proper food, we will have the killing element, the natural antibiotics, to kill the germs
As long as we are on the earth many spiritual germs will enter into us through the things we see in the sinful environment that surrounds us
When we read the Bible and pray, taking in the word and touching the Spirit, we receive the killing element of the death of Christ
If the brother begins to spend only ten minutes per day in the Word, perhaps after only a week his wife will say, 'Praise the Lord!
By reading the Bible and praying, we take in the word and touch the Spirit, both of which contain Christ, His death, and His resurrection
Children must be taught the meaning of certain words before they can be expected to fully understand their parents
If a person speaks to us in a language we do not know although we hear the sounds of the persons speaking we will not understand the meaning
Because we lack the necessary knowledge and education, we are not qualified to understand the person's speaking
The anointing within these two brothers may be the same, but their understanding will differ greatly because their preparation differs
After reading the New Testament fifty-two times in such a way, a clear knowledge of the Word was surely wrought into his being
By reading the Bible, we accumulate the knowledge we need to understand the teaching of the anointing, which enables us to abide in the Lord
When we believe into the Lord Jesus and repent and confess to Him, we open our conscience, and the blood purifies our conscience
If we do not deal with an offense, our conscience will condemn us, and this will frustrate our abiding in the Lord
If we would do this, our conscience will be cleared up immediately, and the gate of our spirit will be wide open
In this way we can have fellowship with the Lord and participate in all the riches of the life-juice of the vine
Our conscience will immediately sense any matter in which we are wrong so that we can confess it and be cleansed by the blood
A purified conscience is a highway and an open gate for us to contact the Lord and for the Lord to come into us
It will issue in much traffic between us and the Lord, which will keep us in the proper condition of abiding in Him
It is logical to say that Christ is both the Head and the Body, for every person is not only a head but also a body
Because we have the same life and nature as Christ, we are parts of Christ, and we may even say that we are Christ
It is beyond our capacity to know everything concerning who and what Christ is, but Colossians reveals several crucial items of Christ
It is more difficult to understand what it means for Christ to be our portion and how to enjoy Him as our portion
Some Christian theologians think that it is heresy to say that Christ, who as God is the Creator, is also part of creation
We exist in a particular way, because apparently we are standing on the earth, but intrinsically the earth is holding us
In Him all the fullness, the full expression of the rich being of God in both the creation and the church, was pleased to dwell
The fullness of the Godhead, the expression of the riches of what God is, dwells in Christ as one who has a human body
We could never even exhaust the significance of the two terms the mystery of God and the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead
When others are disappointed and everything is in darkness, we have a bright new beginning and a new hope in Christ
In the new man there are no Americans, Chinese, or any other nationality or race, but Christ is all and in all
Christ is also the mystery of God, the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, and the reality of every positive thing
Christ being all and in all in the church should be a controlling vision to us to repel all foreign things from the church
We should not consider Christ's being all and in all in the church as merely a doctrine; this needs to be a vision to us
Such a vision will transform our concept, our mentality, our emotion, our sensation, and every part of our being
We need this controlling vision because in today's Christianity there is much confusion, division, darkness, and death
If we do not have Christ as all and in all in our church life, we will immediately have confusion, division, darkness, and death
Some who have promoted these activities among the saints say that there is too much legality, religion, and bondage in the local churches
If we go to movie theaters, we will lose the Lord's testimony before our relatives, classmates, and colleagues
They may appear to be offended, but deep within they will appreciate the fact that we are an honest and true follower of Jesus
If we truly love the Lord, we will not go to a movie theater, for we cannot enjoy Him or build up His testimony by going to a theater
The testimony of Jesus will be torn down in the Lord's recovery if the Lord's recovery becomes as loose as Christianity
For the sake of the enjoyment of the Lord and the testimony of Jesus, we need the proper standing and environment
We can exercise and maintain a proper testimony by cleaning our home and caring for our lawn rather than participating in something worldly
Corinthians 15:45b says that He became a life-giving Spirit, and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, 'The Lord is the Spirit'
Today the wonderful mysterious allinclusive Christ has become the lifegiving pneuma that is the lifegiving air the lifegiving breath
The wonderful, mysterious, profound, and all-inclusive Christ is impossible to fully comprehend but easy to enjoy
If we try to argue according to the anointing, we will have nothing to say because the anointing will not lead us that way
To daily and hourly walk and have our being according to the inner anointing is to walk and have our being by Christ
When Christ thus becomes our practical daily living, living Christ will not be a doctrine to us but will be our reality
If we quarrel with someone before the meeting, we are performing when we come to the meeting and say, 'Praise the Lord!
The meetings should be a genuine exhibition of our daily life, a window to allow others to see what kind of life we live
The genuine oneness is possible only when we are in the Triune God, not only in doctrine and position but also in experience
As believers, we are all in the Triune God doctrinally and positionally, but we may not be in the Triune God experientially
Although we know that we need the genuine oneness, we often lack this oneness because we do not live in the Triune God
The genuine oneness is safeguarded and secured only by our being in the Triune God practically and experientially in our daily living
Regardless of who we are, if we are not in fear and trembling to live in the Triune God every day, we may eventually cause a division
If we have any goal, aim, and intention other than the expression of the Triune God, we will eventually lose the genuine oneness
In order for the genuine oneness to be secured, we must first live in the Triune God and second be in the expression of the Triune God
They care instead for their own goals, aims, and intentions, or even worse, for their personal tastes, choices, or preferences
Although we love the Lord, we still have our tastes and are still natural, fleshly, and selfish in the old man
We need the Triune God to work in us to eliminate all the negative things within us so that we may be perfected into one
Although we may have been in the church life for years, we may easily fall out of the Lord's recovery if we lack the genuine oneness
Christ as life is the nature of the Lord's recovery, and oneness is the standing, the ground, of the Lord's recovery
The nature and standing of the church-Christ as life and the genuine oneness-are both lacking to the uttermost in today's Christianity
When electricity is in the lights, they are one, yet they are not one in themselves but one in the electricity
One, a doctoral student, may have a peculiar concept that eventually becomes a great problem in the church life
The third student may attend a Baptist church and become convinced that immersion by that church is the only proper form of baptism
Their oneness will be lost because they picked up various things other than the oneness of the Spirit and the oneness of the faith
Although the first brother is a doctoral student, in the eyes of the Lord he is a young boy who likes the toy of his peculiar concept
At a certain stage of maturity in the Christian life, we will care only for the oneness of the Spirit and the oneness of the faith
Today's Christianity is full of division, but the Lord's recovery is to recover us back to the genuine oneness
Any Christian group that has a particular name, such as Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, or Episcopalian, is a division
To hold such a doctrine is not wrong, but if some preach this, insisting that the whole church hold this doctrine, it will lead to division
We are common and general for the sake of the oneness, but because other Christians are particular, they refuse to be one with us
We need to learn not to be particular but to receive all kinds of genuine Christians in order to keep the oneness
Answer: Philippians 2:2 and 4:2 mention the matter of thinking the same thing, and 2:2 also mentions thinking the one thing
We desire to have only the one unique ministry composed of many different gifted ones who all teach the same thing-Christ and the church
Corinthians 11:19 says, 'There must even be parties among you, that those who are approved may become manifest among you'
Answer: In some places it is necessary to form a club in order to be able to use a classroom for a Bible-study
Many good Christian evangelists have tried to find the best way to attract people to hear the gospel and be saved
The previous two chapters concerned two basic truths-the church being Christ and the genuine oneness of the church
Ephesians 1:20-22 states that when Christ ascended to the heavens, God gave Him to be Head over all things to the church
God needs a man to exercise His judgment in His administration because His administration is very much related to dealing with Satan
Because God is the Creator and Satan is a creature, God would never lower His status to deal directly with Satan
Christ as the Son of God alone was not qualified to be the Head over all things in God's governmental administration
By incarnation He picked up the human element, and by being crucified He accomplished God's purpose and defeated and destroyed God's enemy
Because the human mentality can only know doctrine, we need heavenly light, vision, and revelation in order to see a vision of the truth
Jesus was not a great man outwardly; rather, He was an unknown man from Nazareth, a small town in the despised region of Galilee
Through the twenty centuries of church history the matter of how the church should be organized has been a continual problem
Eventually, there was not only a church in Jerusalem, but there were also churches in Samaria, Antioch, Asia Minor, and Europe
In the church there were not only believers but also apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
Finding this arrangement and the proper way for all the affairs of the church to be carried out is a great problem
The Catholic Church says that Peter became the first pope and that every succeeding pope has also been the head of the church
It is true that in the four Gospels and Acts Peter's name is mentioned first, but at least one verse lists Peter second
The organization of the Catholic Church begins from parishes, or local assemblies, which have deacons and priests as their leaders
The Protestant denominations are the same as the Catholic Church in principle; they are different only in scale
State churches have the head of government as the head of the church and are therefore an insult to the headship of Christ
In principle these are the same as the Catholic and state churches-they have an organizational structure that leads to a head
The Lord told the disciples, 'The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them
In Matthew 23:8 the Lord told His disciples, 'Do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers'
Although Peter was the leader for a time, he was not a leader officially, permanently, organizationally, or positionally
Because he had the highest spiritual capacity on the day of Pentecost, he certainly should have been the leader
According to God's New Testament economy, there is no permanent, official, or positional leadership among God's people today
At another time or in another matter a different brother may have the greatest capacity; hence, he will be the leader at that time
Through the plurality of the eldership there is no definite leader and the absolute headship of Christ is regarded preserved and respected
According to medical science, there is only one head, and it gives orders directly to every member of the body
We know how to receive orders from higher brothers, but we do not know how to receive orders directly from our Head
Regardless of his or her location or function, every member is related directly to the Head; every member has the same standing
Regrettably, something has secretly crept in among us to cause some members to become intermediaries between the saints and the Lord
He made it clear that he was not the head or the leader but only a brother with a burden to minister God's word to His people
My burden at this time is to share with all the young saints in the Lord's recovery concerning the constitution of the church
In order for the Lord's recovery to be strong and in a good order today, we must be clear about the constitution of the church
The Bible shows that on the day of Pentecost there was the need for someone to rise up to declare the gospel to the people
Peter took the lead to meet this need, but he was not an official, permanent, organizational, or positional leader
At that time Peter had the greatest capacity; therefore, he spontaneously took the lead to carry out that ministry
The plurality of the eldership and the apostles prevents any human leadership that would insult the headship of Christ
In each local church there is no head, and among all the churches there is no organization, for this would lead to a hierarchy with a head
It is appealing on a human level to merge two regions of work into one, but such a merger would result in a hierarchy
To summarize, in every local church there is not a head; rather, there are several elders with no permanent leader
Finally, among the regions of the work there is no merged work, which also would lead to a hierarchy and produce a head other than Christ
That there is no organization or human leadership in a local church does not mean that there are no leading ones in a local church
We may think that the church is simply the coming together of the saints with some leading ones and the carrying out of some services
If it were, Paul would not have needed to instruct Timothy concerning how to conduct himself in the church life
Matthew 1 through Revelation 22 reveals that God's intention is that no head other than Christ should exist among God's people
In John 21 he threw himself into the sea to be the first to meet the Lord on the shore, but he was shamed by the Lord
The four Gospels show no sign that the Lord had any intention to establish Peter as the leader among the apostles
In Mark 16 when the angel sent the sisters to tell the disciples of the Lords resurrection the angel particularly added the phrase and Peter
Some may think that the phrase and Peter indicates that Peter was first among the apostles, but this is not the meaning
At that time Peter was certainly the leader, but he was not an official, permanent, organizational, or positional leader
Christ's headship has been insulted by organized Christianity, not only today but even since the second century
There are some practices in the Lord's recovery that have partly transformed our concept, but much of our old concept remains
Even the mentality among the saints in the Lord's recovery has not been thoroughly purified concerning the matter of leadership
According to the natural human mentality, in any organization or group the leaders are in a position above others and give orders
If a restroom needs to be cleaned, a leader in worldly society customarily gives an order for someone to clean the restroom
In the church the elders should be the first to clean the restroom in order to establish a pattern, an example
It is the elders' responsibility to be the first to carry out a service, and all the other saints simply need to follow
We must see the headship of Christ and the constitution of the church to know how to conduct ourselves in the church
Suppose a brother does not make decisions for himself and instead prefers to depend on an elder to make decisions for him
In a sense, it is good that a young believer who is unlearned and inexperienced would not trust in himself but would seek help from an elder
In another sense, this is not good, because no believer is a leader with the authority to make decisions for another believer
In order to know how to conduct ourselves in the house of God, the first principle that we must keep is to honor the headship of Christ
Regardless of how young or old we are, we all need to learn to contact the Lord in order to have a healthy Christian life
The pillar and base of the truth is the entire church, including all the saints, not only the elders and leading ones
Paul referred to this architectural feature to illustrate that the church is the pillar and base to bear the truth
Peter's shrinking back from eating with the Gentiles was contrary to the truth of the gospel, and Paul saw this
The United States is a strong nation because all the citizens bear the responsibility of upholding the Constitution
If a student attends a university only to have a good time, after four years the student will go home with nothing
We should not go to the meetings mainly to have a good time but to receive some discipline and be instructed and edified
The New Testament reveals that the church in ancient times met in a solid way, in a way to edify and instruct the saints
Because we come together to learn and to minister to one another, we must be sober and exercise our discernment
While a brother is speaking, all the saints need to discern whether or not he is speaking according to the truth
If what he speaks is not according to the truth, every saint should be ready to stand up and say something to uphold the truth
The saints should also be prepared to ask the elders to stop someone from speaking anything that is not according to the truth
The church being the pillar and base of the truth implies that every member of the church should know the truth
For the sake of the spreading of the church to new localities, there is a need of leading ones, some who can bear responsibility
If we learn the truth and practice the truth in the daily church life, every member will be able to bear some responsibility
The headship of Christ and the truth are two basic factors that direct, control, and safeguard the church life
We need to honor, respect, and not insult the headship of Christ, not overstepping in any matter related to Christ's headship
If a thief breaks in or the house is on fire, a wife should not wait for her husband's permission to call for help
The young ones will gradually come to know more things, not by waiting passively but by contacting the Lord and the Word
As we gradually accumulate knowledge of the Bible, the light will come to us from the accumulated truth in our being
Some have said in recent years that the saints should not have any discernment and that to discern is not to love
On one hand, God does not ordain any official, permanent, organizational, or positional leadership in His New Testament economy
Christ as the Head, the church as the Body, and the death and resurrection of Christ are not doctrines but the truth
The shortage of every member learning and practicing the truth is the reason that the churches suffer from turmoil
What Paul ministered to Timothy was entirely concerning how to conduct himself in the church in a time of degradation
In the church life in the Lord's recovery, the first thing that we need to take care of is to regard the headship of Christ
The second matter we saw in the previous chapter is that the entire church is the pillar and base of the truth
The word economy is an anglicized Greek word, denoting a dispensation, a stewardship, or an administration to dispense something
In the preceding chapter we saw that even the youngest believer needs to be bold to discern different speakings according to the truth
Christ was taken up in glory in His ascension before He was preached among the nations and believed on in the world
Because 'taken up in glory' is listed last in verse 16, it must refer not only to Christ's ascension but also to the church's rapture
The manifestation of God in the flesh includes both Christ and the church because Christ is the Head and the church is His Body
Corinthians 142425 says that if the church is meeting properly an unbeliever who comes into the meeting will say Indeed God is among you
Christ manifested God in the flesh as a man on the earth individually, but today God is manifested in the church corporately
These Epistles do not say that we need to do what is right; rather, they say that we need to exercise ourselves unto godliness
Another governing principle that we must follow to properly conduct ourselves in the church is to exercise ourselves unto godliness
Bodily exercise is profitable, but its profit is very small compared to the profit of exercising ourselves unto godliness
They may tell the other saints that they have been liberated from all bondage and that in the church life there should be no legalities
We must be discerning and strong, not to cause division but to keep the church in the right lane to manifest our God
In our daily lives we should not live by regulations, but we should have one governing principle, that is, godliness
In deciding whether or not to wear a certain article of clothing, we should consider whether or not it expresses godliness
The conscience of parents who exercise themselves unto godliness would not allow them to take their children into a movie theater
Godliness is another governing principle that we need to take care of in order to properly conduct ourselves in the church life
In order to properly conduct ourselves in the house of God, the church, we also need to take care of the healthy teaching
We need to conduct ourselves in the church not according to our itching ears but according to the healthy teaching
Some may say that it is overly legalistic to refrain from going to movie theaters or other places of worldly entertainment
Our ears may itch to hear such speaking, but we should be governed by the principle of taking care of the healthy teaching
Whether a teaching is boring or tickling does not mean anything; we need to consider only whether or not it is a healthy teaching
Paul used the terms healthy teaching, healthy words, and healthy speech seven times in the Epistles to Timothy and Titus
He knew that when the church life is in degradation, people will be bored of the healthy teaching and will prefer to have their ears tickled
We need to conduct ourselves not according to our opinion or our likes or dislikes but according to the healthy teaching
We should receive and apply any teaching that is spiritually healthy, and we need to reject any teaching that is not healthy
He wrote, 'Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth'
The way to conduct ourselves in the church life is not mainly to take care of doctrines but to take care of the truth
If the Lord's table becomes something formal to the saints, some may want to drop it because our principle is not to keep any empty forms
Everyone in the Lord's recovery should be a Bible lover, always eating, reading, and studying the word of God in the Bible
The way to conduct ourselves in the church life is to know the Bible to the extent that others would call us a 'Bible man'
If possible, we should read three chapters of the Old Testament and one chapter of the New Testament every day
Rather than spending much time reading worldly publications, we should redeem the time by reading the word of our Father
We should not make the excuse that we were not born with the kind of disposition necessary to be such a person
We need to eat the word every day to receive the nourishment and become constituted with the truth of the Bible
If this is our daily testimony and this governs our walk in the church life, we will know how to conduct ourselves in the house of God
We need to spend time before the Lord to consider the principles we have seen that should govern our conduct in the church
Question: What is the proper way to meet for saints who live in small cities near a larger city with an established church?
As they continue to grow, they eventually begin to have the Lord's table and become the church in that locality
Once they begin to meet as the church in that locality, they have the same standing as the church in the larger locality
Eventually, there may be one larger church in a central city and perhaps ten or fifteen smaller churches in the surrounding small cities
In this way, the churches are prevented from becoming an organization, which would lead to hierarchy and insult the headship of Christ
To study a book of the Bible word by word, we need an interlinear version to find the accurate meaning of every Greek or Hebrew word
Through the past twenty centuries many different ways have been used to study the Bible, the greatest of all books
The best two concordances are Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible and Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible
Wuest's Expanded Translation, the Amplified Bible, and Vincent's Word Studies in the New Testament also are helpful
If we use all the reference books and the Life-studies, we will gain a thorough, all-inclusive view of any book in the Bible
