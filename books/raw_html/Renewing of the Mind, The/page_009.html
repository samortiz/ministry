<P>You should not think that your mind is too dull. Do not think that only those who are naturally intelligent will grow and quickly understand the truth of God. There is no such thing. If man's growth in the truth were governed by his natural intelligence, it would be entirely a matter of the flesh. Your personal growth has nothing to do with your intelligence. If your nous is renewed, you can understand God, and you can know everything of God. The person beside you may be the most intelligent and wise person, but he cannot understand; only you can understand. Therefore, you should specifically ask God to give you a renewed nous. Otherwise, you will have no way to go on. Once again I stress that you must go to God in a specific way to seek after this.</P><P>Before you believed in the Lord, you did not love men. After you believed in the Lord, you began to love men more. If there was no such change in you, I am afraid that you are still not saved. If you are saved, you will surely see a change of heart and an improvement in the matters of loving, forbearing, and serving. Before, you loved to be great, but now, you would rather suffer, be defrauded, and forbear. This is because you have a new heart. Others will also see your change and say that you were a certain way before, but that now you are changed. But my question is: has there been any improvement in your thoughts? Has there been any improvement in your mental power? Are your thoughts more orderly and concentrated? Or are they still the same as they were before you were saved? If this is so, your nous is still not renewed.</P><P>Regardless of whether a believer is wise or foolish, he should know that his mind as well as his heart should be proper. Furthermore, in his nous he should have the same improvement. God is without respect of persons. He destroys the wisdom of the wise and the understanding of the prudent. God puts the wise and the foolish all on the same level. The nous of the foolish needs to be renewed. The nous of the wise also needs to be renewed. As long as your nous is renewed, you can know God, understand His will, perceive, analyze, and synthesize what God has given you. This is what you did not know, understand, or see and what you could not verbalize or analyze before. Furthermore, you will be able to run the race before you.</P><P>Indeed, the difference between a renewed nous and an unrenewed nous is like the difference between a bright, clear window and a dark, dirty window. If a believer's nous has not been renewed, he cannot think or work like a person with a renewed nous. If his nous is renewed, his thinking ability will be at least several times (if not ten times) more than before. Furthermore, his mental power will be much improved. But if his thoughts are not renewed, his thinking will not be improved because his thoughts are dead. Just as there is a great difference between death and life, there is a great difference between a renewed nous and an unrenewed nous. Just as there is a difference between heaven and earth, there is a difference between a renewed nous and an unrenewed nous. If we earnestly and single-mindedly deal with our nous in the way that we dealt with our salvation in the past, our sky will always be clear.</P>
