   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROBLEM OF AMBITION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to my experiences over the past fifty years in the church life, all the problems came out of one source ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the church life and church service ambition is a real gopher.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not only in the secular government are there power struggles, but even in the church the problem is ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We would all like to be on the same level as Peter, Paul, or Apollos and not as Timothy whom we consider a learner and not a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yet in the New Testament they are all apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1 Tim 1:1-3; Matt 10:2; 1 Cor 4:6, 9, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Acts 14:14 records that both Barnabas and Paul were apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today none of us would consider Barnabas as anything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everyone desires to be on the same level as the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So this matter of ambition has been the real source of all the problems over the years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From the time the Lord s recovery came to the United States and was established in 1962, there was never any talk about who the apostles were until 1982.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This matter has been debated even more during the past three years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This has also been a problem in the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the island of Taiwan within five years 1949-1954 we grew from a few hundred to fifty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The people crowded in because we preached the gospel over the whole island and in a prevailing way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So many people were brought into the church life that we had to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By themselves the elders, deacons, and deaconesses were not adequate to handle the number.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>So we added group leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those groups worked well to take care of the people, but ambition was there in the group leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As more group leaders were added, some were crouching, waiting to get the position of group leader.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One very good sister, who was seeking the Lord and serving diligently, did expect to be one of the group leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that time, almost every six months we added new group leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the names of the new group leaders were announced, and she did not hear her name, she was greatly disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Her problem continued even for a few years and troubled the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Later, from 1957 to 1965 in Taipei there was a kind of rebellion due to this matter of ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although Romans 12 shows us that we are honorable priests, eventually if we mean business to partake of the service in the church, we must humble ourselves to be slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be a slave was a part of Paul s preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 2 Corinthians chapter four, Paul says, For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus sake v. 5 . We preach firstly Christ as Lord, and then we preach ourselves as slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, we do love the Lord, but there is a real problem within all of us our natural ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must not say that because of His mercy and grace, we do not have this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We dare not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even in the church meetings when some saints pray and receive more amens than you, you do not feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although in mainland China I was in the center of the Lord s work, I was not the umbrella.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The big umbrella was Brother Watchman Nee, so all the arrows came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was the target.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then, the political situation in China changed and the country fell into the hands of the Communists.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The work sent me out of mainland China in the spring of 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only three to five hundred of us, a very small number, came to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At that time, there were only a few churches on the whole island.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Besides Taiwan there were a number of churches, in the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In those five places outside of mainland China forty years ago, there were about eighty to ninety churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When I came out, I did not have the thought or idea to be the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The only thought I had was a burden for that primitive island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I had come from the large modern city of Shanghai, which was the center of the British concession, to a primitive place.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>So, my burden was only to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In my pocket was not more than three hundred dollars with which to care for my family.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, I had no thought about what I would be or what I should be.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eventually I became the target because I became the umbrella.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The sufferings, problems, and troubles always came from one source ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When I came to chapters twenty and twenty-three of Matthew during the 1977 Winter Training on that book, I did speak a strong word to the sisters who are wives of the elders that they should consider themselves as wives of slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Matthew 23:8 the Lord said, But you, do not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Either we do not serve at all or as one who serves, we think that the church surely owes us something.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If so, this causes trouble.</S>
