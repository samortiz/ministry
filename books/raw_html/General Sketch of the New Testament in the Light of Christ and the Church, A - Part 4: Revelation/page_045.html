 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 21:22-27; 22:1-21</h1>
<p>In this chapter we shall consider further aspects of the New Jerusalem and the concluding sections of Revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Enlarged Temple</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:22 says, &ldquo;And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.&rdquo; The temple is the place where we contact God and serve Him. In the ancient times, in order to serve the Lord and worship God, the Israelites had to go to the temple. In the holy city, however, there is no need to go to a certain place to serve God, for God Himself in Christ will be the temple. We will serve God in God Himself.</p>
<p>Today in the New Testament time, the principle is the same in spirit. There is no need to go to a temple, because we are in Him and we serve the Lord in the Lord Himself. Today He is so dear, near, available, present, and direct to us. His presence is always with us, and His presence today is our dwelling place. It will be more so in eternity. There will be no need for a temple in order to contact God because God and the Lamb will be the temple. In the New Jerusalem God Himself in Christ will be everything to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Her Light and Lamp</h2>
<p>Verse 23 continues, &ldquo;And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.&rdquo; God is the light, and the Lamb is the lamp. That the light is in the lamp signifies that God is in Christ. Since God Himself in Christ is the light, the glory of God will illumine the holy city. Therefore, there will be no need of the sun by day or the moon by night.</p>
<p>In the ancient times the outer court of the tabernacle was lit by the sun during the day and by the moon at night, and the Holy Place was lit by the lampstand. In the Holy of Holies, however, there was no sun, no moon, and no lampstand. The light in the Holy of Holies was God Himself in His eternal glory. In the same way, in the holy city in eternity future there will be no need of the sun or of the moon because God Himself will be the light. This indicates that the entire city of New Jerusalem will be the Holy of Holies. As we have seen in a previous message, the measurements of the city in three dimensions also prove that the city is the Holy of Holies. Besides the New Jerusalem, the Holy of Holies in both the tabernacle and the temple is the only structure in the entire Scriptures that was equal in three dimensions. Similarly, in the entire Scriptures the Holy of Holies is the only other place where there is need of no light other than God. This shows us that in eternity the holy city will be the Holy of Holies. Again we say, in the New Jerusalem God Himself in Christ will be everything to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Nations around Her</h2>
<p>Verse 24 says, &ldquo;And the nations will walk by its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.&rdquo; Even after the millennium the nations will live on the new earth as the peoples (vv. 3-4). These nations will have kings, who will bring their glory into the city. In Genesis 31:1, <em>wealth</em> literally means <em>glory;</em> Jacob&rsquo;s wealth was his glory. Therefore, the glory of the nations in Revelation 21:24 refers to splendor, including wealth. In eternity, we the redeemed ones will be the royal family ruling over the nations.</p>
<p>Verse 25 continues, &ldquo;And its gates shall by no means be shut by day, for there will be no night there.&rdquo; Although this verse says that there will be no night, it still uses the phrase <em>by day.</em> This indicates that in the new heaven and new earth there will still be the distinction between day and night, but in the New Jerusalem there will be no such distinction. This is because in the holy city, just as in the Holy of Holies, there is no need of the sun or of the moon for God Himself will be the light. Moreover, at that time we the redeemed ones will have a body in resurrection which will never be tired, so we will not need nighttime for sleeping. Rather, we will serve God continually. For us, there will be no night but only day, because in the holy city God Himself will be the &ldquo;sun&rdquo; which will never go down.</p>
<p>Verses 26 and 27 say, &ldquo;And they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it. And anything common and he who makes an abomination and a lie shall by no means enter into it, but only those who are written in the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life.&rdquo; Anything common is in contrast with the holy things (Lev. 10:10; Ezek. 44:23). <em>Common</em> means not only unclean or defiled but also natural or fleshly. Anything natural, even if it is good, is common. Nothing common will have the right to enter into the holy city or to have a share in it, because the city will be holy. In the same principle, anything of the church must be holy and separated; whatever is common or natural has no place in the church.</p>
<p>Verse 27 also speaks of making an abomination, referring to the worship of idols. Moreover, lies are from Satan. Therefore, common things, abominations, and lies are all related to Satan, and they have no share in the holy city.</p>
