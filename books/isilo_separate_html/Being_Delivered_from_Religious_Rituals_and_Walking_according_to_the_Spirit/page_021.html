<h1 class="title">MAN&rsquo;S TENDENCY BEING<br />
TO KEEP LAWS AND ORDINANCES</h1>
<p>There is a tendency within man to keep laws and ordinances. In this chapter we will consider some examples in the Bible of man&rsquo;s tendency to keep laws and ordinances.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXAMPLE OF THE JEWISH BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>The first example is the Jewish believers. The Jews have the law of Moses. The most important ordinances in the law of Moses are related to circumcision, the Sabbath, and dietary regulations, which stipulate what the Jews can and cannot eat. Circumcision takes place once in a person&rsquo;s lifetime, the Sabbath takes place once every seven days, and dietary regulations are kept daily. The ordinances show that the law of Moses is very strict.</p>
<p>In Acts 10 Peter, a Jew, was led by God in a special way to break away from Jewish tradition and custom in order to contact the Gentiles. When Peter returned to Jerusalem, the Jewish believers disputed with him and condemned him for going into the home of a Gentile and eating with Gentiles (11:2-3). In their consideration Peter had violated the law. It was not easy for Peter to overcome in this matter. Three times God had to give him a vision of a great sheet in which were all kinds of animals. According to Leviticus 11, which is concerning dietary regulations, the Jews could eat animals that have divided hoofs and that chew the cud, such as cattle and sheep. These animals are considered clean. Animals that do not have divided hoofs and do not chew the cud, such as pigs, dogs, and crawling things, are unclean. The Jews could not eat or touch them.</p>
<p>Before Peter went to the Gentiles, God showed him a vision. In this vision heaven opened, and a vessel like a great sheet descended, in which were all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of heaven. Then a voice charged Peter to rise up, slay, and eat, but Peter refused and said that he had never eaten anything common and unclean. The voice came to him again a second time, saying that the things God has cleansed must not be made common. This occurred three times (Acts 10:11-16). According to this vision, Peter was to contact the Gentiles. Because the Jews regarded the Gentiles as unclean dogs and pigs, they were not willing to contact the Gentiles or eat with them. However, Peter received a special leading from God to contact the Gentiles. As a result, the Jewish believers disputed with him. Those Jewish believers were saved and knew that salvation does not depend on keeping the law (Gal. 2:15-16), but they were still inclined to keep the law and its ordinances.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXAMPLE OF THE GENTILE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>The second example is the believers in Galatia. The Galatians were Gentiles who, after hearing of the gospel, believed into Christ. The Old Testament law was not given to them. However, due to the influence of the Jewish believers, the Galatians began to keep the law after their salvation. It is easy to fall into keeping the law because the natural man has a tendency to keep the law. It is difficult for people to believe in the gospel, but it is very easy for them to try to keep the law. Even though we stress turning to the spirit and walking by the spirit, it is still difficult for us to grasp this point. It is easier for us to follow a method or to keep a regulation.</p>
<p>Suppose we had a regulation of being quiet in the meetings. There would be no need to remind the saints; everyone would be quiet. Similarly, if we had a regulation of calling and praying audibly in the meetings, the saints would receive it after being reminded a few times. We could easily turn from a method of being quiet to a method of calling and praying out loud. However, when we say that we should walk by the spirit, turn to the spirit, and exercise our spirit, it is not easy for us to respond. It is rather easy to try to keep the law and the ordinances because we know what is required, but when we speak of the Spirit, we do not know what to do. The Spirit is like the wind that blows where it wills (John 3:8). The wind may blow toward the east today and toward the west tomorrow. It may even blow as if it is coming from all four directions. The wind is difficult to grasp.</p>
<p>The Galatians did not know anything about the law prior to their salvation. After they believed in the Lord, they had contact with certain Jewish believers who may have said, &ldquo;Brothers, it is right to follow Jesus. However, there is a commandment in the Old Testament that says we should be circumcised, so we should keep this commandment.&rdquo; The Galatians received this word to keep the law and to be circumcised. They were willing to keep the law. Many ordinances are easy to understand. However, it is not easy to grasp the things of the Spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
