   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO NECESSARY THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In learning to preach the gospel, we have to pay attention to two things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we have to understand God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to find words with "hooks."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second, we have to understand the sinner's heart, that is, we have to understand the condition of those whom we are preaching the gospel to.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Concerning the first point, we should study in detail all the verses in the New Testament concerning the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should begin from the first chapter of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should consider how sinners dwelt in darkness and sin, how the Lord preached the gospel to them, and how they were touched.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to pay attention to how the Lord dealt with sinners and how men received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we preach the gospel, we have to visualize these different kinds of sinners before our eyes and consider how we can turn them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Finding Words with "Hooks"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In preaching the gospel, we should not preach only with the aim of passing on gospel facts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nor should we try to stir up sinners unnecessarily.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, we should preach according to God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our words should have "hooks" that can latch on to men.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The words of our preaching should have "hooks" that can catch people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our job is not merely to convey words but to clinch men with the words.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not be lazy to exploit these hooks.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to remember that the effectiveness of preaching does not lie in doctrine but in the "hooks."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should study and constantly analyze the words that bring about salvation in others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we spend enough time on this, we will discover that every person is captured by some "clincher" words.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In preaching the gospel, the main thing is not to make things clear, but to use "clinchers."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every time we apply these "clinchers," men will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Gospel preachers should have the habit of asking other brothers and sisters, "With what word were you saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should write these words in a notepad and study them constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should also study our own story of salvation, as well as those who were saved through us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should read all kinds of gospel stories.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should ask, "What words pricked you?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What words smote you?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Write down these words.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then ask, "What words warmed you up and stirred up your desire?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Write down these words as well.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then ask, "What words prompted you to receive the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Write down these words.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We will see something very interesting: The Holy Spirit likes to use words that He has used before to save men.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In preaching the gospel, we have to know the words the Spirit likes to use.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to know which words touch men, subdue men, produce a sense of need in men, prompt men to make a decision, and clinch men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should be able to develop our own clinchers in addition to using these clinchers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The best gospel preachers always bring their audience to a high point and then conquer them with God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to learn to use words that the Holy Spirit once used.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is very easy for the Holy Spirit to use words that He has used before.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For this reason, we urgently need stories of salvation, in particular, stories of those saved through us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A study of these stories will help us find the words that the Holy Spirit has used.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By what words were men subdued?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to pay attention to these words and mark them down.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have said that there are not too many categories of people in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once we know how to deal with these few categories of people, we have just about mastered everything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is definitely the need to spend time learning the words that subdue people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need more than one notepad to write down the words that touch men to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some people are touched in their conscience by certain words.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Others are prompted to receive salvation by some other words.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to record these words in our notepads.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we meet another person in a similar condition, we can use these words on him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In preaching the gospel, all we care for is saving men; we do not care to use too many words.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have to mark the words that the Holy Spirit has used before and try to use them again.</S>
