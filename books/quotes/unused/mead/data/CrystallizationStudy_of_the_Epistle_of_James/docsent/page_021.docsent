   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>James 4:11 says, "Do not speak against one another, brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks against the law and judges the law.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates clearly that James wanted the believers to be doers of the law of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the royal law refers to the Mosaic law, surely the law of freedom also refers to the Mosaic law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He said that this law is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may wonder how James could consider the Mosaic law as the perfect law, the law of freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Psalm 19:7 and 8 say, "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The term the perfect law did not originate with James but with the psalmists.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Surely James must have been a lover of the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The thought of freedom regarding the law is also in Psalm 19.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Psalm 19 tells us that the law of Moses is perfect and it causes people to be converted and to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To convert the soul is to make one's dead soul alive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is to release him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Converting and rejoicing imply release, liberty, freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Psalm 1 says that the one who meditates in the law day and night will be like a tree growing by a flowing river vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The law is likened to a flowing river, and this flowing river makes a person living and released.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, the thought of the law being the perfect law of freedom was already in the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>James used another two terms to describe the Mosaic law, which he appreciated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>James 1:18 says that God brought us forth by the word of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Psalm 119:43 David said that the word of the Lord's law was the word of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Testament teaches us that God regenerated us by the word of the gospel, not by the word of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul said that he begot the Corinthians through the gospel 1 Cor 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then Peter said that God regenerated us with an incorruptible seed, and this incorruptible seed is the living and abiding word of God 1 Pet 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are New Testament gospel terms, but James said that God regenerated us with the word of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This shows us the mixture of James.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>James 1:21 says, "Receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The implanted word here also refers to the Mosaic law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Psalm 119:11 says, "Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the implanted word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the law were only outside of people, it would not work out anything for them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They have to keep the law in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The law has to be implanted in them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then this law will keep them from sinning against God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is also the liberty to which James referred.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, all the different terms used by James for the law refer to the Mosaic law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The law, the royal law, the perfect law of freedom, the word of truth, and the implanted word refer to the same Mosaic law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By this we can see how highly James appreciated the law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is no wonder that he was so zealous for the law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the New Testament teaches us that the age of the law is over.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The law should not be used in the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The law was given through Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That was of the old age, the age of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But grace came through Jesus Christ John 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The age of Moses is over.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now the age of grace is with Christ.</S>
