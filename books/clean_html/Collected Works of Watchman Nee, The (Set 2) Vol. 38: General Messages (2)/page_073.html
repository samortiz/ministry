<h2 class="head1">THE LAYING ON OF HANDS FOR THE GIFT</h2><p>Paul said to Timothy, "For which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands" (2 Tim. 1:6). This means that the gift which Timothy had received at the time of the laying on of hands needed to be revived and rekindled. First Timothy 4:14 says, "Do not neglect the gift which is in you, which was given to you by means of prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery." Here we see that the gift was given by the apostle with the presbytery by means of prophecy. They ushered Timothy into the Body through the laying on of hands, while the anointing bestowed the gift. While they laid their hands on Timothy and prayed for him, God gave one of them a prayer of prophecy, which foretold the kind of person that Timothy would be. This prayer governed the anointing. When an experienced person lays his hands on others, his prayer will become the characteristic of the life of those on whom he lays his hands. This is the authority of the Head dispensing the proper gift through the laying on of hands of the representative members. Those who receive the laying on of hands should realize that from that day on they can no longer trust in themselves and no longer be independent. They are a part of the Body, and they can no longer seek their own benefit. Even if they seek after spiritual things, they have to seek them for the sake of the Body. Thereafter, the Lord can use them or others. When other members are used, they are no longer envious. Many people work in an individualistic way, and they pursue in an individualistic way. We have to ask God to deliver us from these things in the same way that we asked Him to deliver us from sin.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYER WITH THE ANOINTING OF OIL</h2><p>James 5:14 says, "Is anyone among you ill? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord." This must be read in conjunction with 1 Corinthians 11:29-31: "For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not discern the body. Because of this many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep. But if we discerned ourselves, we would not be judged." Some become sick because they have acted contrary to physiological laws, while others become sick because they have acted contrary to the law in the Body of Christ. If a Christian does not discern the Body and does not act according to the rule of the Body, he will surely become weak and sick. This kind of sickness requires the elders' attention. The elders are appointed by God in a local church as representative members; they represent the Body of Christ in that locality. They should come and anoint the sick with oil. Psalm 133:2 says, "It is like the fine oil upon the head/That ran down upon the beard,/Upon Aaron's beard,/That ran down to the hem of his garments." The ointment was poured on Aaron's head, and it ran down from his head to his garments. God's ointment is on Christ's head; it is an ointment which the Holy Spirit gives to the Son. Christians receive their ointment by coming under Christ the Head. What does it mean for a sick man to ask the elders to pray for him? Suppose a man is sick. We can understand his sickness by looking at the medicine prescribed to him. When the elders are asked to come and anoint a sick man with oil, it means that he has detached himself from the ointment. If a Christian maintains his proper standing as a member, he will not lose his anointing. He becomes sick because he has not discerned the Body. The elders should bring the sick ones under the Head and recover them to the Body. If you live in the Body, you will not lose your anointing. If you leave the Body, you either become sick or you die. Brothers and sisters, everything will be well if you really see the life of the Body and live in the Body.</p><p>The sickness in James 5 is a special kind of sickness. We know that it is a special sickness and not an ordinary one because verse 15 says, "And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him." What kind of sin did he commit? The sin he committed must have been the sin of being detached from the Body of Christ. If his sin were a personal sin, he would only need the blood, and he would be forgiven when he confessed to men and dealt with the sin. There would be no need to ask the elders to come and anoint him with oil before he could be forgiven. The anointing of the elders cannot remove sin; only the blood can wash us of our sins. Yet verse 15 says that if he sins, his sins will be forgiven. This forgiveness comes from the prayer of the elders. Hence, the sin in this verse is different from ordinary sins. This sin is the sin of walking contrary to the Body. This sin cannot be forgiven if one just prays to God; the elders need to pray for him before he can be forgiven. He has to look to others for this forgiveness.</p><p>Verse 16 is even more peculiar: "Therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another that you may be healed. The petition of a righteous man avails much in its working." This verse says that we should confess our sins to one another. We have to confess our sins to one another because something is wrong in the Body of Christ, and the mutual confession of sins is needed. The sick have to confess to the elders, and the elders have to confess to the sick. This shows that when one member is in trouble, the whole Body is responsible. If one member who has been healthy in all respects suddenly becomes sick, the elders have to take responsibility for it. It may be that the elders have been lacking in love. It may be that the elders have been negligent in care. Therefore, the elders have to confess these sins. As for the sick, they have to confess the sin of acting independently and the sin of detaching themselves from the Body.</p><p>Not only do we have to confess our sins to one another, but we also have to pray for one another. Praying for one another is asking that the elders pray for the sick ones and that the sick ones pray for the elders. Hence, there is always the need for love and humility in the Body. If a person is detached from the Body, he will incur spiritual sickness as well as physical sickness. Whenever he is detached from the Body, he loses the anointing. Those who are outside the Body need to realize the importance of returning to the Body and coming under the anointing.</p>
