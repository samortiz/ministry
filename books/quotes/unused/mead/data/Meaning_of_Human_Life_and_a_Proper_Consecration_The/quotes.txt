[1]  The Meaning of Human Life and a Proper Consecration CONTENTS
[2]  AND THE MIND USING THE SPIRIT TO PRAY-READ
[3]  In this chapter we will fellowship concerning pray-reading.
[4]  When we pray-read, we must first exercise, use, our spirit, because the substance of the Bible as the word of God is Spirit.
[5]  The Chinese classics are excellent, but no matter how we read them, we cannot feel the Spirit, because the Spirit is not in them.
[6]  However, if we do not read the Bible with our spirit, we will not be able to touch the Spirit.
[7]  If our heart is on something other than the Lord, there is a problem with our heart, and we should deal with it.
[8]  CHAPTER TWO THE MEANING OF THE UNIVERSE GOD S SALVATION
[9]  Ephesians 1:4-5 says, Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love, predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.
[10]  We should never think that the presence of human beings on the earth is a coincidence.
[11]  In Genesis 1:26 God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.
[12]  Education, marriage, and careers cannot satisfy man because the meaning of human life cannot be found in these things.
[13]  The meaning of human life is Christ entering into man.
[14]  The New Jerusalem is the aggregate of all those who have received the Lord throughout the generations.
[15]  This message touched me, so when I went home, I knelt down and asked the Lord to forgive me because for ten years, from 1925 to 1935, I had believed in Him but not to the extent of being beside myself.
[16]  Some will regard us as fools, but we must remember that Christ is the meaning of our human life and that we are the meaning of society.
[17]  CHAPTER FOUR BEING FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT THE NEED TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT
[18]  We have seen that the Lord is our meaning and that we are the meaning of the universe.
[19]  In addition to these points, we have also seen that the Lord Jesus now is the Spirit.
[20]  If we are not filled with the Spirit, we cannot properly express the Lord, nor can we properly represent Him.
[21]  In order to be filled with the Holy Spirit, we first must turn to the Lord so that our face is toward Him.
[22]  When we consecrate ourselves in this way, we are open to the Lord and our whole being is turned to Him.
[23]  Then the true and living Lord will immediately begin a sweeping and emptying work in us.
[24]  On the other hand, we are not empty, but rather we are full of all kinds of things other than the Lord.
[25]  When we enter into the Lord s presence and consecrate ourselves to Him, He will do a cleansing work within us to deal with the filthy things that occupy us, such as jealousy or despising others.
[26]  After we consecrate ourselves to the Lord and He touches our sins, we should confess our sins and ask Him to cleanse us with His blood.
[27]  After we consecrate ourselves to the Lord, confess our sins, are emptied, and give the Lord the ground in us, we should not wait to be filled.
[28]  CHAPTER FIVE A PROPER CONSECRATION CONSECRATION BEING TO GIVE OURSELVES
[29]  Every one of us should have a genuine consecration; we should spend time to earnestly pray and offer ourselves to the Lord.
[30]  A person may say that since he has consecrated himself to the Lord, he no longer wants certain things.
[31]  This is not the kind of consecration that we are speaking of, because not wanting certain things may just be something according to a person s desire.
[32]  Consecration means that we offer ourselves as vessels to the Lord to let Him fill us, occupy us, and be expressed through us.
[33]  If the Lord says that our attitude to our parents is not good, we should respond by asking Him to forgive us and cleanse us with His blood.
[34]  The Lord may say that we offended a younger brother, and we should respond by asking Him to forgive us for offending this brother.
[35]  When we touch and gain the Lord, we realize that we are vessels created by the Lord, and we are willing to give ourselves to Him and receive Him as our Lord.
[36]  If the Lord says that we should get rid of something, we get rid of it, and if the Lord says that we should keep something, we keep it.
[37]  Whatever the Lord does not want, we should not want, and whatever the Lord desires, we also should desire.
[38]  Consecration is our willingness to give ourselves to the Lord and tell Him that we are willing to cooperate with Him to deal with our sins, to remove the things of the world, and to deal with our self, that is, that we want Him to be our person.
[39]  Growth in life is not coincidental; it requires time.
[40]  Our precious experiences of the Lord will not be our experience of Him as thunderstorms but our experience of Him as showers of rain.
[41]  If I buy a house and it has its own person, I would not dare move in. However, even though we are God s house, we also have our own person, our old man, who is very strong.
[42]  TO TAKE THE LORD AS OUR PERSON EXERCISING THE SPIRIT
[43]  First, our spirit needs to be fresh so that we will not be old.
[44]  When we are in the meetings, we must exercise our spirit and open our being to the Lord.
[45]  Perhaps we feel that since the Lord loves us and since He died and lives for us, we also need to love Him and give ourselves to Him for His use.
[46]  We may even be resolute and ask the Lord to cleanse us, fill us, and equip us for His use, even though we are not qualified, useful, or gifted.
[47]  If we ask the Lord to be our person so that we will not lose our temper, then we are still the person; the Lord is not our person.
[48]  By the Lord s mercy we were brought into the light of His Word to see that His salvation is practical, complete, thorough, and simple.
[49]  The influence of tradition and our Christian background have given us a mistaken concept.
[50]  Our concept is that we need salvation because we are sinners destined to perish in hell.
[51]  We say that we need His salvation to be forgiven of our sins, to be delivered from hell, and to be spared from God s judgment.
[52]  Not only does the Lord give eternal life, but He gives His Spirit to live in us as our power, sanctification, and everything.
[53]  Nevertheless, in our subconsciousness we still have a religious concept that we should do something for the Lord.
[54]  This means that as soon as we receive the Lord as our person, spontaneously our sins are forgiven; we are delivered from the lake of fire and spared from God s judgment.
[55]  When we receive the Lord Jesus, not only do we receive His whole person, but we also receive Him once for all.
[56]  By the Lord s mercy, we need a thorough salvation so that the Lord can enter into us, occupy us completely, and be our person.
[57]  When we consecrate ourselves, take Christ as our person, we are practicing Paul s word in Galatians 2:20: It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.
[58]  We are becoming the Lord s dwelling place by letting Him make His home in our heart and be our person.
[59]  As soon as we are saved, we become members of the Body of Christ.
[60]  In this Body we have life and we function; hence, we become lovely.
[61]  Whenever we are not in the Body, however, our life is over, our function vanishes, and we are no longer lovely.
[62]  If we would let God fulfill His eternal heart s desire to gain us as His expression, we need a change of person; that is, we must take Christ as our person.
[63]  CHAPTER EIGHT KNOWING THE CHURCH AS THE NEW MAN
[64]  God s intention in creating man was to gain a group of people on earth who have His image and likeness in order to express Him and represent Him.
[65]  As Christians, we know that we should love others, but since we are unable to do this, we depend on the Lord as our power, our ability, to love others.
[66]  We need an absolute consecration of handing ourselves over to the Lord and yielding our person to Him so that He can be our person.
[67]  We should say, Lord, I do not care about hating or loving others.
[68]  It is not that we hate or love others, it is not that we are meek or irritable, and it is not that we are humble or proud.
[69]  If we receive the Lord s grace, we will see that in order for Christ to make His home in our hearts, we should take Christ as our person.
[70]  We are empty vessels who consecrate to the Lord so that He may dwell in us and make His home in us to be not only our life but also our person.
[71]  When the Lord is our person, we can spontaneously love an unlovable brother because the Lord, who is our person, loves him.
[72]  TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON Putting Off the Ordinances and
[73]  Ephesians 2:15 says, Abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace.
[74]  The Lord abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances in His flesh.
[75]  We have said that if we, as Christians, are not beside ourselves, we are not qualified to be Christians, because the Bible says that we should be beside ourselves toward God 2 Cor 5:13 .
[76]  Ephesians 4:22 and 24 speak of putting off the old man and putting on the new man.
[77]  Since the new man in 2:15 is the church, to put on the new man in 4:24 must be to put on the church life.
[78]  The Bible says that we need to put off the old man, the former manner of life, that is, the old social life, and that we need to put on the new man, the church life.
[79]  When we let the Lord strengthen us into the inner man, He makes His home in our hearts, and we are filled unto all the fullness of God.
[80]  I hope that you will not only grow in life and know the truth but also learn to apply the truth and speak it to others.
[81]  This requires that we exercise our spirit, our heart, and our mind.
[82]  It is not enough to have a strong spirit or a heart to love the Lord.
[83]  Many of the saints are willing to serve the Lord full time but are not so clear.
[84]  Sometimes the more we pray, the more confused we become.
[85]  We need only to take Christ as our person and love Him.
[86]  We do not have to consider our future; we should simply take Christ as our person and let Him live in us.
[87]  If we continue with our education, we should let the Lord lead us to study while we testify for Him.
[88]  AGGRESSIVELY PREACHING THE GOSPEL A COMMISSION TO LEAD CLASSMATES TO SALVATION
[89]  As young saints, you need to receive a commission to contact and preach the gospel to your fellow students.
[90]  The second item for the release of the Lord s life is the infilling of the Holy Spirit.
[91]  Whenever we feel that we have offended the Lord, we must immediately confess by telling Him that we are wrong.
[92]  Sometimes Satan does not want us to confess our wrongdoings, but after we confess, he wants us to remember what we have confessed so that we do not go on.
[93]  We must ask the Lord to fill every part of our being for the sake of the gospel.
[94]  When He says that we are wrong in a certain matter, we should confess that matter and ask Him to forgive us, cleanse us, and cover us with His precious blood.
[95]  When we fellowship with Him in this way, our relationship with Him becomes transparent, peaceful, and bright.
[96]  Then the Lord will be our person, and we will be able to follow Him in a simple way.
[97]  When we live a life of following the Lord, the people whom we contact with the gospel will be subdued.
