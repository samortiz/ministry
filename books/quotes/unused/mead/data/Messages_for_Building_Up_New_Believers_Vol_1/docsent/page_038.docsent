   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Anything Smaller than a Locality</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not Being the Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No matter how big a church is, it cannot extend beyond the boundary of its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the same time, no matter how small a church is, it cannot have anything less than the locality as its unit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a church is smaller than a locality, it is not a church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a church is bigger than a locality, it is not a church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is smaller than a locality?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, in the church in Corinth some said, I am...of Cephas.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Others said, I am of Paul, or I am...of Apollos, or I am...of Christ 1 Cor 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They divided the church in Corinth into four parts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is making the church too small.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, Paul told them they were divisive and sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First Corinthians 1 shows that it is wrong for a church to be smaller than a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Was Paul good?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yes!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Was Apollos good?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yes!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Was Peter good?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yes!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But it is wrong to divide the church according to these persons.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church is divided according to localities, not according to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul said that to divide the church according to the apostles is divisive, sectarian, and fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Dividing the church this way is to take the way of the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>B. The Boundary of a Church</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not Being Bigger than the Locality</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is also wrong for a church to be bigger than the boundary of its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Please read your Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible speaks of the churches of Galatia 1 Cor 16:1 , the churches of Asia v. 19 , and the churches of Judea Gal 1:22 . In Judea there were many localities with churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why we refer to them as the churches of Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We see this in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the book of Galatians we see the churches of Galatia.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Revelation 1:4 we see the...churches which are in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After reading these portions of the Scripture, we should be quite clear about what the Bible says concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No church is ever bigger than a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Galatia was a province in the Roman Empire; it was not a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why the Bible does not say, The church of Galatia, but, The churches of Galatia.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There were several churches in Galatia.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is why the plural word churches is used instead of the singular church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, it is wrong for a church to be bigger than its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible does not say, the church in Asia, but the seven churches which are in Asia !</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea were all localities in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These seven places did not become one united church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They remained seven churches in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is wrong for a church to be bigger than its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These seven churches did not become one big church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the same principle, we see the churches of Judea because at that time Judea was a province of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Originally, it was a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Later, it became a province.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the province of Judea there were many localities with churches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They could not be combined together to become one church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must see that God ordains to have only the church in Foochow ; there cannot be an XXX church in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Having this would make the church smaller than its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Neither can anyone unite all the churches in the province of Fukien and make them one church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can only have the churches in Fukien, not the church in Fukien ; to have such would make the church bigger than its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>C. The Church Bearing</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only the Name of the Locality</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brothers, we must be clear that the church cannot be named after a person, a doctrine, a system, or the place of its origin.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It should be identified only by the name of its locality, not the name of its place of origin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There can only be the church in Foochow ; there cannot be the church of Shanghai in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You cannot have the Roman Church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Roman Church has to go back to Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If some believers from the church in Rome come to Shanghai, they can be part of the church in Shanghai, but they cannot set up a Roman Church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The place of origin cannot be brought to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Anglican Church should go back to England.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Anglican believers that come to Shanghai should become the believers in the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They should not bring the Anglican Church to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The church can only be local.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In His Word, God has ordained that the church should be divided only according to locality, not nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There should not be any Chinese Church or Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There can only be the church in London and the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They are only localities.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Churches are based on locality, not nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is no such thing as the Church of Christ in China in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There should not be any distinction of people, nationality, or doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God s Word only allows one kind of distinction according to locality.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Wherever you are, you are a member of the church in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you want to change your church, you have to change your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If I am in Foochow, and I cannot get along with a brother, there is only one way for me to leave the church in Foochow I have to leave Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God only recognizes the difference of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He does not recognize any other difference.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I hope you will receive God s mercy to see that there is only one church and that the church is local.</S>
