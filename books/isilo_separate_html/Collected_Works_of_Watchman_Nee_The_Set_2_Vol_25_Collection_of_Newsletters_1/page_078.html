He was a teacher in Mr. Ting's house. In his spare time, he went out to preach the gospel. The Lord confirmed His work with miracles and the casting out of demons. Just as Mark 16:20 says, when the disciples preach the gospel, the Lord works with them and confirms the word by miracles. The news of this spread all over the neighboring towns, and many sick people came for healing by the Lord. Many sick ones were healed, and a few sinners were saved. Unfortunately, we and Mr. Ting did not understand the nature of God's work; therefore, when many sick ones came, we refused and even criticized them by saying that believing in Jesus for the sake of healing is not proper. We did not realize that the Lord was manifested to destroy the work of the devil. When we failed to express the Lord, His work stopped. Only recently has the work been revived.</P><P>Mr. Ting moved to Chang Chia Chuang in 1932. He came back to Ta Ch'iao in 1933. He began by renting a house to live in and then rented land and began building a five room house. Now we are still meeting in Mr. Ting's house. However, these few rooms are only sufficient for Mr. Ting's family, and it can barely accommodate the meeting. We have already given this matter to the Lord and have prayed for some time before the Lord concerning this matter. We also ask the brothers and sisters to pray for us to see when the Lord will make provision for the accomplishment of His work.</P><P>In January of this year, Mr. Ting returned from Shanghai and told us that in the past not only our gospel work was contrary to the will of God but even our prayer was not according to God's will. He said that in Shanghai he had heard Mr. Nee say God had an eternal plan before the foundation of the world. All creation and man are for the purpose of expressing the glory of His Son so that His Son can be the center and Head of all things. The Lord Jesus died on the cross to resolve God's problems and accomplish God's plan. The redeemed ones must be united with Christ to deal with the rebellious Satan. All our work and prayer must be according to this desire. In this way, we can become people after God's heart like David and Samuel. We can walk with God like Enoch. Upon hearing this word, we changed our prayer. We never expected it, but in a little more than half a month, the Lord's work revived and was recovered to the first condition. We used to have only a few people in our meetings; now we have more than thirty. On the twenty-eighth of last month (June), three brothers, Lu Tsai Chih, Lu An Pang, and Ting Ai Chu, and six sisters were baptized. Now there are a total of nineteen brothers and sisters in our table meeting. Although Mr. Ting often works in other localities, we still thank the Lord. In addition, Messrs. Chiu and Chi, Mr. Feng Hsien Chih, and Mr. Chu Huai Nan have come among us to help us go on.</P><P>Our hope now is that the Lord will return soon. We also hope that the brothers and sisters who love us will pray for us and help us weak and little ones stand firm so that we do not shame the Lord's name. Peace to the brothers and sisters in the Lord!</P><P>Your little brothers,<br>Lee Hsin Ling, Lee Yu Kao, Yang Shih Huai<br>July 14</P><P>Mailing address: c/o Mr. Chi Yung Tung, Su Chia Tsueh, northern Kiangsu</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS FROM YIN HAN CHUANG, HUAI AN,<br>NORTHERN KIANGSU</H2><P>Peace to Brother Yueh Chiao:</P><P>I have received all the copies of Notes on Scriptural Messages, Collection of Newsletters and The Glad Tidings. I have also received your letter explaining why you did not send the issue of The Present Testimony (No. 32). It is truly the love of Christ that you did not feel bothered to do this even though you are very busy! Thank you, and thank you again!</P><P>In April I wrote a letter to the brothers telling them that the number of people meeting on the Lord's Day was around thirty and that our meeting place was in a sister's house. Thank the Lord for His marvelous grace. He did a special work in the hot summer and saved several people out of the authority of darkness. Now we have increased to fifty people, and the meeting place has moved to a three-room house I built when I returned here last year. We moved three Lord's Days ago. The Lord's table has increased by four sisters: Mrs. Yin, from the Presbyterian Church (baptized by sprinkling); Mrs. T'ang, from the China Inland Mission (baptized by immersion); and Miss Yin and Mrs. Ku who are newly regenerated through the truth. They were baptized together after the table meeting on the fifteenth of this month. The Lord willing, there will be others who are willing to be buried with Him. Please do not forget to pray for this.</P><P>There is one more thing we would ask the brothers and sisters who have fellowship with us in all the localities to especially pray for. It is the Lord's work. Thank the Lord, He has raised up workers in northern Kiangsu to work for Him. But the environment has hindered us, and we have been unable to do a proper work for the Lord. We were able to do something only at the end of the third month in 1932 when Brother Ting Yi Yuan came from Chang Chia Ao to work with us for three days. The rest of the time Brother Chou Pu Ch'ien and useless I have done some scattered work. Now the Lord has placed Brother Chang in Chang Chia Ao and has placed me, the very immature one, in Yin Han Chuang. I am still very ignorant of the truth of the church. Thank the Lord, He opened His channel of life at Wen-teh Lane in Shanghai, so that His water of life can flow livingly to every place to irrigate His fields and water His crops. We ask the Lord's glorious light to protect the co-laboring brothers and sisters there until His second coming and to rapture us before the tribulation. Amen.
