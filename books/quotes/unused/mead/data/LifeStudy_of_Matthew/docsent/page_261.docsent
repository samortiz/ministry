   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE SEVENTY-TWO THE KING S VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to the King s victory recorded in 28:1-20.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Compared to chapters twenty-six and twenty-seven, chapter twenty-eight is short and simple.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we are in resurrection, everything is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. RESURRECTED</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The resurrection of Christ was a matter of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Have you ever considered the resurrection of Christ in this light?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God was righteous to come in to judge Christ as our substitute on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This judgment of Christ on the cross was just and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By being judged by God, Christ fulfilled all the requirements of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He bore our sins on the cross to fully meet all the righteous requirements of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, through Christ s death on the cross, God s righteousness has been wholly satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, the righteous God was judicially satisfied with Christ s death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, Christ was buried in a new tomb that belonged to a rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that immediately after Christ s judicial death and immediately after the satisfaction of God s righteous requirements, Christ rested as the fulfillment of the prophecy of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After Christ was buried, God was held responsible in His righteousness to release Christ from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not many Christians realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Most think that the resurrection of Christ was only a matter of the divine power of God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Few realize that the resurrection of Christ was not only a matter of power, but also a matter of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If God had not raised Christ up after His death on the cross to satisfy all the requirements of God s righteousness, God would have not been righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was righteous for God to release Christ from death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to His righteousness, God had to judge Christ on the cross because Christ was bearing all our unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But after God had judged Christ in full, God s righteousness held Him responsible to release Christ from death and to raise Him up from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Gospel of John there is the concept that Christ was resurrected by the power of an endless life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But this is not the concept of Christ s resurrection in the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The concept in Matthew regarding Christ s resurrection is that it is related to God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John is a book on life, and life is a matter of power.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But Matthew is a book on the kingdom, and the kingdom is a matter of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, according to Matthew, for Christ to be raised from the dead meant that God released Him according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, Christ was both righteously judged and put to death and righteously raised up from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, Christ became not only the powerful King, but also the righteous King.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you read the prophecies concerning Christ s kingship, you will see that His kingship is not very much related to power, but that it is closely related to righteousness and justice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Kingship is not a matter of power; it is a matter of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The heavenly Savior-King was righteously judged by God on the cross, and He was righteously raised up from the dead by Him to become the righteous King.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is altogether righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is the righteous King for God s righteous kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to have this concept as we read Matthew 28.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this chapter we cannot find a hint that the resurrection of Christ is related to power.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, if we read carefully, we can find that it is related to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps you have wondered why in this chapter, a chapter concerned with Christ s resurrection, Matthew includes the account of the bribery of the Roman soldiers vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>11-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is mentioned for the purpose of exposing man s unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The opposite of unrighteousness is not power, but righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because of His righteousness, God was held responsible to raise Christ up from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, Christ s resurrection was according to God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This was the reason that Matthew inserted the historical account of the bribery of the soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No other Gospel mentions this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Matthew includes it to show that Christ s resurrection was related to God s righteousness, which is versus man s unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Again I say that it is difficult to find in chapter twenty-eight any hint that Christ s resurrection was related to power or to life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At this point we need to consider Romans 4:25.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This verse says, Who was delivered because of our offenses and was raised because of our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This verse links resurrection with righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Bible makes resurrection not only a matter of power, but also a matter of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Not only was God s righteousness manifested in raising Christ from the dead, but we were justified because of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, Christ s resurrection is a proof both of God s righteousness and of our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hallelujah, in Christ s resurrection God is the righteous God, and we are the justified people!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have seen that resurrection is very closely related to God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The kingdom of the heavens is built and established upon God s righteousness, which held God responsible to raise up the righteous Redeemer and to make us righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, Christ s resurrection is a realm of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the sphere of Christ s resurrection, God is the righteous God, and we are the justified people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Here we have the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many Christians today know only the kingdom of love or the kingdom of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In other words, they are familiar only with the realm of love and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They have no understanding of the realm of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But God s righteousness, not His love or grace, is the foundation of God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The kingdom of the heavens is built not upon God s love or grace, but upon His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How precious, necessary, and vital the righteousness of God is!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is absolutely necessary for the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we realize this, the churches in the Lord s recovery will be greatly strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hallelujah, our kingly Savior has been resurrected through the righteousness of God!</S>
