   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN THE PERSON OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eventually, Paul gives us such a deep verse in 2 Corinthians 2:10.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suppose you go to the department store.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Could you say that you are going there in the person of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you buy something there, could you say that you are buying it in the person of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we were able to say this, I am quite sure that we would not buy many items.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Almost all Christians know Galatians 2:20, but very few know 2 Corinthians 2:10.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here is a verse which tells us that we must do things in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Greek text, the word for person in 2 Corinthians 2:10 is a difficult word to translate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not easy to find an equivalent for this Greek word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This word in Greek denotes the part of the face just around the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is sometimes called the index of the face.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This part around our eyes is the index of our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we look at this part, we know whether a person is agreeable or not agreeable, happy or angry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many times a wife s yes is changed into no by looking at the index of her husband s face.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that at that time she was taking her husband as her person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This would make a very good marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whatever the wife does, she does it in the person of her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is what Paul meant when he said that he forgave in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not do anything in his own person; he did everything in the person of Christ because he was taking Him as his person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>So in this verse we see the practical application of what Paul said in Galatians 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is really marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>WALK ACCORDING TO THE MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now we must look at some verses in another category.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Romans 8:4 says, That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to flesh, but according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is not the definite article here before the word spirit, which makes it difficult to decide whether it is our human spirit or the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore it must be the mingled spirit, the Holy Spirit and our spirit mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>So now we must walk according to this mingled spirit, which simply means to walk according to the living Christ as the Spirit who indwells our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here there is the real fulfillment of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whatever the law requires we will spontaneously fulfill, not by ourselves, but through Christ, the Spirit moving in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This shows us how to take Christ as our person, which is to walk and live according to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Day by day we should not have our being according to teaching, feelings, concepts, or circumstances, but according to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Praise the Lord that we do have a spirit and that Christ as the life-giving Spirit is indwelling our spirit to make these two spirits one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now we must walk according to this mingled spirit, and to walk according to this spirit is to take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The wording is different, but the fact is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To practically take Christ as our person is to have our being wholly according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the entire Bible, especially in the New Testament, there is not one verse which tells us that we must walk according to Bible teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This does not mean that I am against the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am absolutely for the Bible, but our walk should not be something according to the outward teachings of the Bible; it must be according to a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we walk only according to the teaching of the Bible, we will get into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is because there are many things that the Bible does not mention.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It never tells us how long or short to cut our hair; nor does it say whether we should smoke or not.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you read the Bible two-hundred times, you will not find one verse about smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the Lord meant for us to walk according to the Bible, the Bible would need to have thousands of pages!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It would be difficult for us to carry such a book!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But praise the Lord, it is so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We simply must learn to walk according to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>TRANSFORMED FOR THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is by walking according to the mingled spirit and taking Christ as our person that we will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:18, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>. We behold Christ as a mirror, and we reflect Christ with an unveiled face.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>While we are beholding and reflecting Christ in this way, we are being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not correction, improvement, or adjustment, but transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A very good illustration of transformation is the petrification of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is caused by different logs being caught in a place where water is constantly flowing over them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By the flowing of the water, the minerals in the water discharge the old, wooden nature.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then the logs become petrified.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Wood is transformed into stone.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Praise the Lord, we are just like those logs!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The water of life flows into us and brings all the divine elements into our being to replace our natural essence.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All of our natural elements are discharged, and we are transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Teaching can never do this because teaching does not have the flow of the living water with the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But Christ as the life flow has all the divine minerals to flow through us to replace our natural disposition and discharge all the natural things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then we are transformed into the image of Christ from one degree of glory to another degree of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>And this is by the Lord Spirit whom we have learned to take as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Eventually, when we come to the end of the Bible, we do not have anything built with wood.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The whole New Jerusalem is built with transformed precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Precious stones are not natural elements, but transformed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the New Jerusalem there will be nothing natural, for whatever is built into God s building must be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All the natural dispositions must be discharged and replaced by what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Today in the church, wherever there are some brothers that have some amount of transformation, that church will be living, rich, strong, and established.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But wherever there is a church without such a measure of transformation, that church will be weak, poor, and shaky.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We do look to the Lord that we may have a church built not by teaching, but by taking Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>And this person is the living flow of the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then we will become the precious stones which are good for the building up of God s building which is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The building of the church is by the Christians who have been transformed by the Lord Spirit through taking Christ as their person in walking according to the mingled spirit.</S>
