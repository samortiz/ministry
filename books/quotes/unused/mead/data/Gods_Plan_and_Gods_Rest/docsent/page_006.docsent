   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE UNCHANGEABLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PURPOSE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God wanted to have man to rule for Him on this earth, but man did not attain to God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Genesis 3 the fall took place and sin entered; man came under the power of Satan, and everything seemed to come to an end. Satan was seemingly victorious and God was seemingly defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In addition to the passage in Genesis 1, there are two more passages in the Scriptures which are related to this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are Psalm 8 and Hebrews 2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>PSALM 8</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Psalm 8 shows that God's purpose and plan have never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the fall, God's will and requirement for man remained the same without any alteration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His will in Genesis 1, when He created man, still holds good, even though man has sinned and fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even though Psalm 8 was written after man's fall, the psalmist was able to praise; his eyes were still set upon Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Holy Spirit did not forget Genesis 1, the Son did not forget Genesis 1, nor did God Himself forget Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us see the content of this psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 1 says:</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>O Jehovah our Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How excellent is Your name</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All who are inspired by the Holy Spirit will utter such words: "How excellent is Your name in all the earth!"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Though some people slander and reject the Lord's name, yet the psalmist loudly proclaimed, "O Jehovah our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He did not say, "Your name is very excellent."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Very excellent" does not have the same meaning as "how excellent."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Very excellent" means that I, the psalmist, can still describe the excellence, whereas "how excellent" means that even though I can write psalms, I do not have the words to express, nor do I know how excellent is the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>So I can only say, "O Jehovah our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth!"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not only is His name excellent, His name is excellent "in all the earth"!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The expression "in all the earth" is the same as in Genesis 1:26.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we know God's plan, every time we read the word "man" or the word "earth" our hearts should leap within us.</S>
