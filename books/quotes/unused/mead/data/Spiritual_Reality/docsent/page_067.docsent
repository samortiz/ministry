   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Asking for a Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first prayer is for a spirit of wisdom and revelation 1:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation is for seeing, and wisdom is for understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, suppose there is a radio sealed in a box so that we are not able to see it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since we cannot see the radio, we have no revelation concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we open the box and put the radio in front of us, we will be able to see it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is to have revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, for us to understand what is inside of the radio, we still need wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A person who has studied electricity would be able to understand the radio by looking at it, but someone unlearned in electricity would be unable to understand it no matter how much he looked at it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though he may see it, he would not understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is to have revelation but no wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A person who has studied electricity has the wisdom before he has the revelation because his mind has been trained to have the knowledge of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can say that he has the wisdom of electricity in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the radio is revealed to him, he is able to understand it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is to first have the wisdom and then the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After he sees the radio, he is able to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The mystery that God is working out in us in Christ is so great and wonderful that it requires not only our seeing but also our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, we need revelation, and we also need wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Regarding many spiritual matters, we often hear of them but lack the inward understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The reason is that we are short of spiritual wisdom, and our mind is not exercised enough and is not experienced in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, even though we may have heard these things again and again, inwardly we still may not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When some people first learn how to sing, they think that every musical note is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Their ears can hardly tell the differences in pitch because their ears are not experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some people s ears are experienced in listening to gossip but not to music, because their ears have been exercised for several decades to listen to gossip but not to music.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When you talk about business trade with some brothers, they can fully understand you, even if you mention only a few words.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are able to say things in a more precise, concise, and thorough way because their minds are experienced in business.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When some saints get angry and scold people, their voices are loud, forceful, and full of confidence because they are experienced in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if we asked them to speak for God and to speak the grace of God, they would be speechless.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even though they may say something, they would not say it clearly and to the point.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This shows us that we are most experienced in the matters in which we exercise our mind and our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this reason, our mind has to be exercised in the spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>GOD S POWER TOWARD US</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the prayer of Ephesians 1 Paul mentioned three great points.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When these three great points are put together, we can see that the burden is that we would truly know God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First, we have to know His calling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Second, we have to know that He wants to gain us as His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Third, we have to know His power toward us vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The power of God toward us is the power of God toward Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words, the kind of power that God had toward Christ is the kind of power God has toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that today the work that God is doing in us is nothing less than the work that God did in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The power of God toward Christ in the past was exactly the same as the power of God toward us today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What God did in Christ in the past is what He is doing in us today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What God is doing in us is what He did in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The power of God toward Christ is now also toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The power of God toward Christ accomplished several major events in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>First, it raised Christ from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Second, it seated Him at God s right hand in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Third, it caused Him to be far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Fourth, it subjected all things under His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Fifth, it gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sixth, it caused the church to be His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>20-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The power of God that operates in us is the power that He caused to operate in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This power caused Christ to be raised, to ascend, to be far above all things, and to be Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It also caused the church to be His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now the power that God caused to operate in Christ is also being applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This power still has the same effect on us today.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The power that caused Christ to be raised from the dead, to ascend to the heavens, to be far above all, and to be Head to the church is also toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This power is so great!</S>
