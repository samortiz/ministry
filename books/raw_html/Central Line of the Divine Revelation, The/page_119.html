<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>33. By Eating the Word of Righteousness<br>as the Solid Food</H2><P>To eat the word of righteousness as the solid food (Heb. 5:13-14) is a strong way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ. The word of righteousness is the solid food. Hebrews is divided into five sections, and each section ends with a warning concerning the coming kingdom (2:1-4; 3:7&#151;4:13; 5:11&#151;6:20; 10:19-39; 12:1-29). If we do not heed the warnings, we will suffer punishment and lose the kingdom in the millennium. Many in today's Christianity not only do not understand this word but even oppose it. Some say that since the redemption accomplished by the blood of Jesus is perfect and complete and we have been washed by Him, we cannot be punished when Christ comes again. They say that if Christ can punish His redeemed ones, then His redemption is not complete. It is true that Christ's redemption is complete, but Hebrews tells us that God chastises those whom He receives (12:6). God's chastisement is not against Christ's redemption. Moreover, there is no word in the New Testament that says that God chastises His people only in this age and not in the next. In nearly every book of the New Testament we are warned concerning the possibility of being chastened by God in the coming age. We must live a life of the highest righteousness. If we do, we will enter into the kingdom of the heavens and enjoy it as a reward (Matt. 5:20). Otherwise, according to the Lord's word in the Gospels, we will be cast into outer darkness, where there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, as a kind of chastisement (25:30).</P><P>Many Christians will lose the kingdom as a reward, but they will still enjoy eternal redemption. The word concerning the kingdom is not "the good word of God" (Heb. 6:5); it is the word of righteousness. The good word of God is like milk. It is easy to receive, but it does not sustain long. Paul told the Hebrews that they had tasted of the heavenly gift, had become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and had tasted the good word of God and the powers of the coming age (vv. 4-5). However, he also told them that he had deeper things to say to them that they were not able to understand (5:10-12). The word of righteousness, on the other hand, is solid food. It is difficult to take, but it is solid and it sustains long.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>34. By Taking the Milk of the Word as Newborn Babes<br>for the Growth in Life unto Salvation</H2><P>Another way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is by taking the milk of the word as newborn babes for the growth in life unto salvation (1 Pet. 2:2). Experiencing Christ in this way is proper while we are still babes. After a certain period of time, however, we should not remain babes. We need to advance beyond 1 Peter 2:2 and proceed to Hebrews 5:13-14 to eat the word of righteousness.</P>
