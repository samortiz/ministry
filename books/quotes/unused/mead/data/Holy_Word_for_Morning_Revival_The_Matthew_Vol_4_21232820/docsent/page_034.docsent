   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 20 DAY 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 28:1-2, 5-9</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Now late on the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the 1 first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2 And behold, there was a great 1 earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended out of heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>5 And the angel answered and said to the women, Do not be afraid, for I know that you are seeking Jesus, the crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>6 He is not here, for He has been raised, even as He said.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Come, see the place where He was lying.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>7 And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has been raised from the dead, and behold, He goes before you into 1 Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There you will see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Behold, I have told you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>8 And they went away quickly from the tomb with 1 fear and great joy and ran to report this to His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>9 And behold, Jesus 1 met them, saying, Rejoice!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And they came to Him and took hold of His feet and worshipped Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>1 1 Christ resurrected on the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This signifies that His resurrection brought a new start with a new age for the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>See note 1 1 in John 20.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>2 1 This signifies that the earth, the base of Satan's rebellion, was shaken by the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>7 1 The heavenly King began His ministry from Galilee of the Gentiles 4:12-17 , not from Jerusalem, the holy city of the Jewish religion; after His resurrection He again went to Galilee, not to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This strongly indicates that the resurrected heavenly King had fully abandoned Judaism and had initiated a new age for God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>8 1 With fear because of the great earthquake v. 2 and with great joy because of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>9 1 This took place after the Lord appeared to Mary the Magdalene John 20:14-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The resurrection of Christ was a matter of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to His righteousness, God had to judge Christ on the cross because Christ was bearing all our unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But after God had judged Christ in full, God's righteousness held Him responsible to release Christ from death and to raise Him up from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to consider Romans 4:25.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This verse says, "Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This verse links resurrection with righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, Christ's resurrection is a proof both of God's righteousness and of our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the sphere of Christ's resurrection, God is the righteous God, and we are the justified people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here we have the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The resurrection of Christ was first discovered by two sisters, Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They discovered it by loving the Lord to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then they became the first two witnesses of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Jewish leaders with the Roman soldiers spread a false rumor about Christ's resurrection Matt 28:11-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They gave the soldiers a large sum of money to say that the Lord's disciples came by night and stole Him away while the guards slept.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This word from the mouth of the religious leaders was a bare lie, indicating the lowest standard and falsehood of their religion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 14 they said to the soldiers, "And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him and make sure that you have nothing to worry about."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The evil religionists always persuade the evil politicians to perpetrate falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 15 indicates that this lie concerning the Lord's resurrection was widely spread, as were the rumors concerning His followers and His church after His resurrection Acts 24:5-9; 25:7 .</S>
