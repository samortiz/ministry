   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because of What They Had and of What They Saw</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The two tribes made their request because of what they had a very great multitude of cattle v. 1 and because of what they saw a land good for livestock v. 4 . This was the reason for their choice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Self-choice, even in the church life, comes from two things considering what we have and need and considering how a particular situation or opportunity that we see in front of us fits in with our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This should not be our situation in the church life or in the service of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both in the church life and in the Lord's work, we need to resist the temptation to have our self-choice for the purpose of taking care of our own welfare.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to learn the lesson of not considering what we have or what is in front of us but leaving our future in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not try to have our own choice in the church life or in the Lord's service.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you insist on having your own choice, be prepared to suffer as a result.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our choice is not the best selection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are shortsighted and somewhat selfish, so it is difficult for us to be pure in motive, desire, intention, goal, and purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should be willing to give up our choice and tell the Lord that we do not have any choice of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Without Crossing the River Jordan</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The land requested by Reuben and Gad could be reached without crossing the river Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without crossing the Jordan signifies without having the old man dealt with and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only after we have had the old man dealt with and buried are we in a position to talk about possessing the good land for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Receiving the Promise of the Good Land</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not with the Body of the Children of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Reuben and Gad did not receive the promise of the good land with the body of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This signifies receiving the enjoyment of Christ separately, without the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Rebuking and Warning of Moses</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verses 6 through 15 we have the rebuking and warning of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>a. Rebuking Them for Their Selfishness</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Moses said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to the war while you stay here?" v. 6 . Here Moses was rebuking them for their selfishness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moses seemed to be saying, "You are considering the welfare of your tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What about the other tribes?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the other tribes follow your pattern, every tribe will have its own choice, and we will not have a way to distribute the land."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Warning Them with the Pitiful Story</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>of Kadesh-barnea</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verses 7 through 15 Moses warned Reuben and Gad with the pitiful story of Kadesh-barnea, a story of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verse 7 he said to them, "Why will you discourage the heart of the sons of Israel from going over into the land which Jehovah has given them?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moses might have thought that they were afraid of the giants in the land and that this fear would have discouraged all the other tribes.</S>
