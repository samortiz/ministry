   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GAINING CHRIST BY EATING HIM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul also desired to gain Christ, to obtain Him, to take possession of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The best way to take possession of something is to eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Dietitians say that we are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, by eating Christ, Christ gets into us and then comes out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Christ comes into us, He is our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But when He comes out of us, He is the righteousness which is of God by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we eat Christ, He becomes the life supply within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then this Christ will live Himself out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When He does this, He becomes our living righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, when we take Christ into us by eating Him, Christ becomes the resurrected One within us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this resurrected One there is the power of resurrection that motivates us and energizes us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because we are energized by resurrection power, we cannot be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, we must be excited and even beside ourselves with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is Christ, not in doctrine, but in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A PARTICULAR WAY TO EAT CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the food has been prepared and set on the table, we may not know how to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Philippians 3 we see a very particular way to eat Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The best way to eat Him is by denying something.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to eat Christ, we must deny everything, including ourselves, our mind, our cleverness, our knowledge, and all our good points.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must even deny yesterday's experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul said that he counted all things loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that he denied everything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because Christ was everything to him, he denied everything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A certain person may be humble, and another may be very bold.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The humble one has been humble from birth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no need to teach him to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He simply does not know that there is any such thing as pride.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The bold one was born with the ability to release his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is natural for him to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, for the humble one to release his spirit is difficult, and for the bold one to be humble is a killing to him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A third person may naturally be very intelligent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was born that way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Humility, boldness, and intelligence are the heritage these persons have from birth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A fourth person may be very kind and gentle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day all four may come to believe in the Lord Jesus and become partakers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Suppose a servant of the Lord visits them and tells them that our only destiny is to obtain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to gain Christ, we must count all things loss.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, the humble brother may count all things loss except his humility.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In principle, the same may be true of the bold brother, the intelligent brother, and the gentle brother.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because the humble brother has not counted his humility as loss for the sake of Christ, he will use his humility in the church life whenever an opportunity is presented.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although he is humble, there is nothing of Christ in his humility.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He secretly treasures his humility and thus it replaces Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The same is true regarding natural boldness, natural intelligence, and natural gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All these things are simply aspects of the flesh.</S>
