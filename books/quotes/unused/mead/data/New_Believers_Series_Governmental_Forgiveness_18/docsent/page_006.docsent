   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. Learning to Humble Oneself</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>under God's Mighty Hand</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our God is a God of government.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He will not move His governmental hand immediately away from those who have sinned against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Often, God does not do anything; He lets you go.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But as soon as He stretches forth His governmental hand, you can do nothing except humble yourself under His mighty hand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You have no escape!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is not like man; He is not sloppy and will not let you go!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A sin which damages one's fellowship with God can easily be forgiven, and a person can easily be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But no one can run away from God's discipline in the environment, the home, one's career, and his physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The only thing we can do is to learn to humble ourselves under His mighty hand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The more we humble ourselves under His mighty hand and give up all resistance, the easier it is for God to lift His governmental hand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more we refuse to humble ourselves, and the more angry, vocal, or indignant we become, the more difficult it is for God to lift His governmental hand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a very serious matter!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Twenty years ago we might have done something according to our own will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today we still have to face the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We still have to suffer the consequences.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It will come back to haunt us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When such a thing catches up with us, we should bow our head and say, "Lord, it is all my fault!"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must humble ourselves under God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not resist.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more we resist, the heavier God's hand will become.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let me repeat: Let us humble ourselves under God's mighty hand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we reject God's governmental hand, the more problems we will encounter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When God's governmental hand is upon us, we must humble ourselves and say, "Lord, You have done no wrong!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I deserve this."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must humble ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must not only remove all rebellious thoughts but also take away all reasonings and murmurings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not easy to be rebellious and to try to escape God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Who can escape His hand?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You must realize that you have fallen into your present state through what you did before.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose a brother loved sugar too much as a youth, and his teeth have decayed from the overconsumption of sweets.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One day he feels that he has eaten too many sweets.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These sweets have brought about his toothaches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He asks God to forgive his sin of indulgence in eating.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God can easily forgive such a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But it does not mean that his teeth will recover from their decay.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His teeth will still be bad; that is God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you eat sweets, your teeth will decay.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you confess your weakness, the fellowship will be restored, but it does not mean that good teeth will grow back after your confession.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once you recognize God's government, you have to learn to humble yourself under it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One can never recover a tooth from decay, but there are matters concerning God's governmental hand which can be removed, and the person involved can be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>G. Falling under God's Governmental Hand</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Being a Serious Matter</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let us consider one portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After Moses smote the rock in Meribah Num 20:10-12 , both he and Aaron fell under God's governmental hand.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After Aaron failed, God still allowed him to remain a priest and restored his fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even though he wore the priestly robe, God nevertheless told him that he would not be able to live.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Moses also did not honor Jehovah as the Holy One when he was by the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God wanted him to command water to flow out from the rock, but he smote the rock with his rod and lost his composure.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He did not honor Jehovah as the Holy One.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God's hand was upon his servants, and Aaron and Moses could not enter Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do you see the basic principle here?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is God's government!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We cannot pin down our God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot guarantee that God will always treat us the same way as before.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At a certain point, God may change His way with us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He may change even what we consider to be the best way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible is full of such stories.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, when the Israelites reached Kadesh in the wilderness of Paran, spies went up to spy out the land Num 13 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When they saw that it would take two people to carry a cluster of grapes, they realized that the land was a land flowing with milk and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But they became afraid and refused to enter into that land, because they saw that the people who dwelt in that land were of great stature.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In their own sight the Israelites were as grasshoppers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As a result, all but two of them died in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Joshua and Caleb were the only two persons who would go into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Later, the people confessed their sins and wanted to go in. God still treated them as His people and was gracious to them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, they could no longer have a part in the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God's government had changed!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Brothers, the very day that you begin your Christian life, you should set a hope before you that you will stay on the course that God has measured to you, all the way to the end. Do not live loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Please bear in mind that even though God may be merciful, He can change His way!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God's governmental hand will never let you go.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God's governmental hand is indeed a serious matter!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I know of a brother who was clearly called by the Lord to set aside his career to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He went home for a visit but could not bring himself to quit his occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He wanted to be a good Christian, but he did not want to set aside his career or spend his life for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Since then he is sometimes weak and sometimes strong.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But it is impossible for him to turn back to this way!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Please bear in mind that our greatest fear is God's disciplining hand; we do not know when His hand will come upon us!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God may let us go, even if we rebel ten times, but He may not let us go the eleventh time.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>However, God will not let some people go the first time they rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We do not know when God will catch up with us!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Brothers, please bear in mind that God's government is not something under our control!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He does things according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I know of a sister who at one time wanted to consecrate herself to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Later she married, and her marriage was not a very good one.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As soon as she made such a move, the light ceased to shine in her.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>There is no way to ask her to return to this way now.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>God's governmental hand is upon her.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Today we cannot turn her back no matter how hard we try.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Light is shut off from her; it is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It is as if a veil is hanging in front of her.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>There is no way for her to see the light again.</S>
