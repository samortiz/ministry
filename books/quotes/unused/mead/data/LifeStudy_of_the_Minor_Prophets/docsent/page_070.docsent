   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PROPHECY CONCERNING THE HOUSE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF JEHOVAH IN THE MILLENNIUM</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND THE PROMISE OF MESSIAH</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>IN THE COMING KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Haggai 2:1-23 is the prophecy concerning the house of Jehovah in the millennium and the promise of Messiah in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. The Prophecy concerning the House</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>of Jehovah in the Millennium,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>as an Encouragement to the Building</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>of Jehovah s House at Zerubbabel s Time</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verses 1 through 9 the prophet Haggai was charged to speak to the people concerning the house of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For thus says Jehovah of hosts, Yet once more it is but a little while I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land; and I will shake all the nations, and the Desire of all the nations will come; and I will fill this house with glory, says Jehovah of hosts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, declares Jehovah of hosts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former, says Jehovah of hosts; and in this place I will give peace, declares Jehovah of hosts vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This prophecy concerning the house of Jehovah in the millennium was an encouragement to the building of Jehovah s house at Zerubbabel s time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 7 reveals that Christ is the Desire of all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I appreciate the line in Charles Wesley s hymn that says, Come, Desire of nations, come!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ truly is the desire of all mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All people desire to have life, light, peace, goodness, and righteousness, yet they do not realize that what they desire is really Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is life, light, and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do not have Him, we do not have life, light, peace, or any of the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ is the reality of every human virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, to desire virtue actually is to desire Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to God s arrangement in His creation of man, the human virtues, such as love, kindness, patience, and humility, are for the expression of the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is God s intention that the attributes of His being would be expressed by man in his virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As an illustration of this, consider a glove that is designed in the form of a human hand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The hand is the content of the glove, and the glove is the expression of the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Likewise, the human virtues are the glove for the expression of the divine attributes as the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just as a glove without a hand has no content, so the human virtues without the divine attributes have no reality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Genesis 1:26 tells us that God made man in His own image and according to His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, man was empty, having only the outward form but not having God as his inward content.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God intended, therefore, that the man created in His image would exercise his will to choose God, signified by the tree of life, as his content.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To choose God in this way means that we receive God s life with His attributes into us to be expressed through us by our virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, one of God s attributes is love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may say that this love is part of the hand and that our human virtue of love is part of the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even unbelievers have a natural, human love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Of course, they do not have the divine attribute of love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As believers, we have received God as our life, and as He lives within us, His attribute of love is expressed through the virtue of our human love.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way, Christ becomes the reality of this human virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today people everywhere desire life, light, love, patience, and endurance without realizing that to desire these virtues is actually to desire Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All people, including unbelievers, desire Christ unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is what it means to say that Christ is the Desire of all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>B. The People s Uncleanness</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>and Jehovah s Dealing with Them</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>and Then Blessing Them</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In verses 10 through 19 the prophet spoke about the people s uncleanness and Jehovah s dealing with them and then blessing them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The uncleanness here was not physical but moral and spiritual, involving their relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once the uncleanness was removed, they would be blessed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>C. The Promise of Messiah</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>in the Coming Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Finally, in verses 20 through 23 we have the promise of Messiah typified by Zerubbabel in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Haggai was charged to speak to Zerubbabel, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And I will overthrow the throne of the kingdoms and will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots and their riders, and the horses and their riders will go down, each by the sword of his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In that day, declares Jehovah of hosts, I will take you, O Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, My servant, declares Jehovah, and make you as a signet ring; for I have chosen you, declares Jehovah of hosts vv.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Jehovah s making Zerubbabel as a signet ring indicates that Jehovah regarded him as His representative and that He loved him and trusted him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Zerubbabel was surely such a one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He represented God, and he was loved and trusted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this matter Zerubbabel is a type of Christ, for God s signet has been given to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He represents God, and He is the One whom God loves and trusts.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As such a person, He is qualified to take care of the building of God s house, the church.</S>
