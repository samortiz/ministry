   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>and Served Other Gods</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 17:2-7 we see that God's people were required to stone to death those who transgressed God's covenant and served other gods, bowing down to them or to the sun, the moon, or any of the host of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way, the children of Israel would utterly remove this abomination, the evil, from the midst of the people.</S>
