<P>But what the Lord's recovery has seen and picked up from the New Testament is so high, concerning God's eternal economy, the all-inclusive God processed and consummated, the all-inclusive Christ, the life-giving compound Spirit, the divine eternal life, and the church as the Body of Christ. This mystical Body of Christ consummates in the New Jerusalem. In today's fundamental teaching of Christianity, not one of these items is fully, adequately touched. They say that God never changed. The Bible tells us God never changed in His nature, but He did become a man. Was that not a change? The procedure for Him to become a man was a process, the process of conception. He entered into a virgin's womb and stayed there for nine months to be born as a man. He was God, but after being processed, He became a God-man. No longer was He merely God, but He was God plus man. He passed through the process of human life as God living on this earth for thirty-three and a half years. He went to the cross and was buried in the tomb for three days. Was that not a process? Then He entered into resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit. Surely this is also a process. By this we can see that today's teaching in Christianity is inadequate.</P><P>Who today sees the intrinsic significance of God's incarnation, Christ's death, and Christ's resurrection? Many say God came to be a Savior. That is not wrong, but the Lord has shown us that God's incarnation indicates that God became one with man. God brought Himself into man and joined Himself with man, even mingled Himself with man that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. All the items in the Bible have their intrinsic significance. We do not eat the skin of an orange, but the intrinsic content of the orange. The inner content is the real significance of the orange.</P><P>One wrong teaching today is that the believers in Christ go to heaven when they die. The Bible shows that God has prepared two Paradises for His believers. The first Paradise is for today. When a believer dies, his body is buried in the earth, but his spirit and soul go to the first Paradise. The Lord Jesus told the criminal on the cross, "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise" (Luke 23:43). This Paradise is the pleasant section of Hades. Hades is divided into two sections: the section of torment for the perished unbelievers, and the pleasant section called Paradise. That is the place where the Lord Jesus went after He died (Acts 2:27, 31), and the place where Abraham and the poor man Lazarus are, as described in Luke 16:19-31.</P><P>They remain in Paradise, a place of comfort, waiting for the Lord's coming back. When the Lord comes back, they will be resurrected from Paradise and from the earth with a body, soul, and spirit. Then they will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10). If they are overcomers, they will go into the New Jerusalem in the thousand years of the kingdom. That initial stage of the New Jerusalem is called the Paradise of God in Revelation 2:7. But if you are a defeated genuine believer, you will be condemned at the Lord's judgment seat. Then what you did as wood, grass, and stubble will be burned (1 Cor. 3:12-15), and you will be disciplined in the thousand years of the kingdom to get yourself matured, perfected, and transformed. At the end of the thousand-year kingdom, you will enter into the New Jerusalem in its consummate stage in the new heaven and new earth to meet together with all the overcomers.</P><P>I share this to show again that the teaching of today's Christianity is like that of James&#151;right to a certain degree but devoid of the highest peak of God's revelation. The Lord's recovery is absolutely different. For over seventy years, we have dived into the intrinsic significance of the Bible. We have read the different interpretations of the Bible throughout the church's history, and the Lord has given us the discernment to see what is according to His eternal economy. We need to see the difference between the Lord's recovery and today's Christianity. The Lord's recovery is up to the standard of the divine revelation, but Christianity is devoid of it.</P>
