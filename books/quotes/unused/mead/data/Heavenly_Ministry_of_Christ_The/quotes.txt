[1]  Christ in the Growth and Function of the Believers for the Building Up of the Body
[2]  CHAPTER ONE CHRIST IN ASCENSION Scripture Reading: Acts 2:32-33, 36; 5:31; 10:36b; Heb 4:14-15; 7:25-26; 8:1-2; Rev 1:5a; Eph 1:22 I. THE ENDING OF THE BIBLE
[3]  The Bible opens with God and then with His creation.
[4]  The center of the creation was man, who was made in God s image and after His likeness.
[5]  If you consider, you will realize that man was formed specifically that he might be one with God.
[6]  When Christ ascended, He was inaugurated into a number of great offices.
[7]  Not until His ascension was Christ officially inaugurated as the Christ.
[8]  On the day of Pentecost Peter said, God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ Acts 2:36 .
[9]  Christ has been not only chosen, appointed, and anointed by God, but also inaugurated by Him into His office.
[10]  CHAPTER TWO CHRIST IN GOD S ADMINISTRATION Scripture Reading: Rev 4:1-5; 5:1-10; Matt 28:18-19; Mark 16:19-20; Acts 1:8; 2:33 THE ASCENSION SCENE
[11]  Revelation 4 and 5 used to be a great puzzle to me.
[12]  As far as I can recall, I never heard any message on them, and it was quite a long time before I came to have some understanding of what they meant.
[13]  I do believe that what the Lord is doing in the heavens finds its correspondence among us in His recovery.
[14]  On the day of Pentecost, the response to Christ s move in the heavens began on earth.
[15]  CHAPTER THREE CHRIST IN THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Acts 2:33; 7:55-56; 9:10-16; Eph 1:20-22; 4:8, 11-12, 15-16
[16]  Of the various offices into which Christ was inaugurated at His ascension, the two greatest are that He is the Ruler of the kings of the earth Rev 1:5 and the Head over all things to the church Eph 1:22 .
[17]  As Ruler of kings, He is administering all the governments on this earth.
[18]  By this means God s chosen ones are being gathered in. From studying world history we can see that the course of events has been for the spread of the gospel.
[19]  In addition to His sovereignty over the nations, Christ also exercises His headship.
[20]  As Head over all things to the church, He works to gain His chosen vessels.
[21]  If we read Acts 9, we can see how much Christ did to win Saul.
[22]  Then He went to Ananias in a vision and conversed with him about going to see Saul, who, He said, is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel: For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name s sake Acts 9:15-16 .
[23]  FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 4:7-16; Col 2:19
[24]  We have been considering the Lord as Ruler and Head.
[25]  He has been directing the affairs of all the nations for the spreading of the gospel and the gathering in of God s people.
[26]  When we consider Him as Head, in addition to His moving we realize that the matter of life is brought in. Under Christ s headship, a very fine work in life is being done.
[27]  We do not know the details of Christ s heavenly ministry as Ruler moving on earth.
[28]  When we come to His ministry as Head, however, we see a fine work in life, by life, and with life.
[29]  The Spirit of the Body would have told him, Me means the enlarged Christ, the increased Christ, the corporate Christ, the Christ including Peter, James, and Stephen.
[30]  Saul must also have thought on the Lord s words, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do Acts 9:6 .
[31]  Why did the Lord give him such an indirect answer to his question, What wilt thou have me to do?
[32]  Again, the Head was showing him the principle of the Body.
[33]  How can all the members grow and function that the Body of Christ might be built up?
[34]  You begin to speak in tongues, to roll on the floor, to shout that you have the power, and to preach from the rooftop that the people below must repent and believe in Jesus lest they go to hell.
[35]  It is not my intention to discredit any Christian work, but I believe the Lord has shown me that Pentecostalism is not the work that can build up His Body in life.
[36]  Notice what Ephesians 4:15-16 says: But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, Who is the Head, Christ, out from Whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.
[37]  All this activity is part of Christ s heavenly ministry, causing all His members to grow and function that His Body may be built up.
[38]  If you have, you are under the exercise of Christ s headship, His heavenly ministry, receiving the life He ministers into you for the growth and functioning of His Body.
[39]  UNDER HIS HEADSHIP Scripture Reading: Acts 8:26-39; 9:10-11; 10:1-3, 9-22; Col 2:18-19; Eph 4:14-16
[40]  Ever since His ascension the Lord has been ministering in the heavens.
[41]  Thus, as this age draws to a close, there is an urgent need for us to correspond to the Lord s ministry.
[42]  Now that we have covered some of the wonderful things that transpired in the book of Acts, illustrating the Lord s move in life to gain people through the preaching of the gospel, let us go on to see how the Body is built up.
[43]  It is the Epistles which deal with this matter.
[44]  Rather than being accomplished by a move, the building up of the Body comes about through the growth in life.
[45]  AND GROW INTO HIM IN ALL THINGS Scripture Reading: Col 2:18-19; Eph 4:14-16; Rom 6:3; 1 Cor 1:9, 24, 30; 2:2; 15:22, 45; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Gal 5:4; Eph 3:16-17; Phil 1:21a; 3:8; Col 1:18; 3:4, 11
[46]  The goal of Christ s heavenly ministry is to fulfill God s eternal purpose.
[47]  I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of Whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them refuse that I may gain Christ.
[48]  When I was first saved, I loved the Lord and His Word.
[49]  As a young man, I loved the Bible and made up my mind I would come to understand every verse of it.
[50]  If you do not know, they will make you feel your knowledge of the Bible is too restricted, that you know only about Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.
[51]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE HEAVENLY PRIESTHOOD OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Heb 2:17; 3:1; 4:14-16; 5:5-6, 10; 6:20; 7:27-28; 8:1; 10:21; Rom 8:34
[52]  As you are probably aware, the Bible tells us that Christ has three offices: prophet, priest, and king.
[53]  Christ came the first time mainly as the Prophet foretold in Deuteronomy 18:15, 18.
[54]  In His earthly ministry He spoke for God, spoke forth God, taught the disciples, and prophesied.
[55]  Then in the last part of His earthly ministry He began to offer Himself to God until finally on the cross He offered Himself as the sacrifices to God for us.
[56]  CHAPTER EIGHT CHRIST S EXECUTION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT Scripture Reading: Heb 7:16, 25; 9:11-12, 15-17
[57]  In Hebrews 7 through 10 Christ is presented in a threefold way: as High Priest, as Minister, and as Executor of the new testament.
[58]  When Christ is mentioned as the High Priest, we are also told that He is the Minister of the holy places and the Executor of the new testament.
[59]  While Christ is carrying on His priestly work, He is also executing the new testament and simultaneously ministering its contents to us.
[60]  The promise of God s covenant is insured by God s faithfulness; God s covenant is guaranteed by God s righteousness; and the testament is enforced by Christ s resurrection power.
[61]  We have already covered three aspects of Christ s heavenly ministry: how He exercises His rulership over the whole world that His gospel may be preached and God s called people be brought in; how He exercises His headship to cause us to grow and function that His Body may be built up; and how He intercedes for us and cares for us as our High Priest.
[62]  In this message we shall consider the fourth aspect: how He executes the testament He has bequeathed to us.
[63]  By the execution of the new testament by the heavenly Christ, He is making all the items listed therein real to us.
[64]  IN THE TRUE TABERNACLE Scripture Reading: Heb 8:1-2, 6; 9:15-17 THE WILL AND THE EXECUTOR
[65]  Now that everything has been accomplished through Christ s death, it is a testament or will, with every item of its content bequeathed to us.
[66]  After the interceding and the executing of the will, this very Intercessor and Executor is the Minister, bringing us whatever it is that we need and serving it to us.
[67]  Here on earth I may be having trouble upon trouble.
[68]  He exercises His rulership for the spreading of the gospel, that God s chosen people may be brought in. He exercises His headship to cause all His members to grow and function, that His Body might be built up.
[69]  IN THE HEAVENS Scripture Reading: Rev 1:11-13, 16-18, 20; 2:1; 3:1; 21; 5:1-10; 7:2-3; 8:3-5; 10:1-2; 18:1; 20:4, 6; 22:1, 3
[70]  In our previous messages we have seen that Christ is now exercising His rulership for the spread of the gospel, that His people might be brought in; He is exercising His headship to cause us to grow and function, that His Body might be built up; He is exercising His priesthood to intercede for us; He is executing the new testament for us; and He is ministering the life supply to us.
[71]  In Revelation we first see that Christ, God s anointed One, is now caring for His church.
[72]  In Revelation Christ is first presented as the High Priest for the churches.
[73]  He walks in their midst, taking care of their shining and holding all the leading ones in His hand, that the churches may go on, even in the dark night of a degraded situation.
[74]  Christ is next portrayed as the overcoming Lamb, the Lion-Lamb qualified to execute the new testament.
[75]  In chapter seven Christ as God s Angel controls the whole universe, directing the other angels to carry out God s judgment upon the earth 7:2-3 .
[76]  In chapter ten another strong Angel is seen coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon His head, and His face was as the sun, and His feet as pillars of fire...And He placed His right foot on the sea and the left on the land 10:1-2 .
[77]  Paul s completing ministry, as we shall see further in the upcoming messages, focuses upon Christ as the center of God s economy and the circumference of God s purpose.
