<h2 class=head2>The Local Church</h2><p>The second aspect of the church is the local aspect. In each locality there should be an expression of the Body of Christ (Acts 8:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; Rev. 1:11). This expression of the Body in a locality is the local church. The universal aspect of the church is revealed in the book of Ephesians, while the local aspect of the church is unfolded practically in the book of Revelation. In chapters 2 and 3 there are seven churches in seven cities, one church in each city. We all must see the one Body, and we must also see the local churches. We must see the universal aspect of the Body, and we must also see the local aspect of the church, the local churches. In every locality the church must be one as the local church.<p>To see the local churches we must be in our spirit (Rev. 1:10-12). Do not exercise your mind. The more you exercise your mind, the more you will be confused. We need to be in our spirit, and we need to be out of our self. We must be away from the present situation, away from today’s culture and religion. We must be away from everything else and be in our spirit. Then we will see not only the church but also the churches.<p>The Bible reveals four great figures: God, Christ, the church, and the churches. The Jewish people today do not believe in Christ, but they do believe in God. Fundamental Christians not only believe in God, but they also believe in Christ. However, many Christians have no concept of the universal church. Some Christians with improved knowledge have a vision of the church as the universal Body. They have a heavenly vision, but they cannot touch it practically. I do not want merely a heavenly vision that is not practical. Praise the Lord, in the Lord’s recovery we have seen not only God, Christ, and the universal Body, but also the local churches.<p>Most of the Jews today are still in “Genesis.” Many Christians are in the “four Gospels,” while a few might be in “Ephesians.” However, the church people today are in “Revelation.” Because we are living in the local churches, we are close to the New Jerusalem. Where is the Lord Jesus today? He is the Son of Man walking in the midst of the seven lampstands (Rev. 1:9-20). If you wish to find the Lord Jesus, you must get into the seven lampstands, which are the seven local churches. Today the Lord Jesus, not only as the Son of God but also as the Son of Man, is in the midst of the local churches.<p>The local churches are different from the denominations. In Genesis 2 Adam gave names to all the animals, but none of them matched him. He needed someone who matched him, who was bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh (Gen. 2:19-23). Just as Eve was different from all the animals, the Lord has made the church different from everything else. Some who do not care for the local churches may still appreciate that the churches are different from the denominations, and they may try to imitate the churches. They may imitate the churches, yet they may still not be the proper church. The Lord’s recovery is not a matter of certain practices. It is the recovery of the local church as the expression of the Body of Christ. Today we have God, Christ, the Body, and the local churches. Because we are standing as the local churches, we are in the Lord’s recovery.<p>The young people should have much fellowship about the Christ and the church, not only in one group of five companions but in five or ten groups coming together. You may also need to read some of our publications. You need the experience and you also need the definition of all these matters.
