<p class="bold">WEEK 1 — DAY 6</p><h2 class="uhead1">Scripture Reading</h2><p class="bold">Matt. 28:19 &nbsp;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</p><p class="bold">1 Pet. 3:20-21 &nbsp;…While the ark was being prepared; entering into which, a few, that is, eight souls, were brought safely through by water. Which water…also now saves you, that is, baptism, not a putting away of the filth of the flesh but the appeal of a good conscience unto God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">The Significance of Baptism</h2><p>To be baptized is to be baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19).<sup>32</sup> To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to bring them into spiritual and mystical union with Him.…The name is the sum total of the Divine Being, equivalent to His person. To baptize someone into the name of the Triune God is to immerse him into all that the Triune God is.<sup>33</sup> [Furthermore], baptism practiced in a proper, genuine, and living way puts the believers into…Christ, a living person (Gal. 3:27); into the death of Christ, an effective death (Rom. 6:3); and into the Body of Christ, a living organism (1 Cor. 12:13), that the believers may enter into an organic union not only with Christ but also with His Body.<sup>34</sup> Positively, we have been baptized into the Triune God and into Christ; negatively, we have been baptized into the death of Christ. This negative aspect of baptism clears away such negative things as sin, the flesh, the self, and the old creation. The ultimate issue of baptism is that we are put into the Body. We praise the Lord that we have been baptized into the organic entity of the Body of Christ for His expression.<sup>35</sup></p><h2 class="head1">Baptism—Typified by the Water through Which Noah and His Family Passed</h2><p>Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, Peter told us that Noah’s household of eight passing through the flood in the ark was a type of baptism [1 Pet. 3:20-21]. The waters of the flood separated those who were in the ark from the world in which they once were, that they might be delivered from that corrupted age. This signifies that the water of baptism separates those of us who are in Christ from the world in which we formerly lived, that we may be delivered from this crooked and perverted generation. Therefore, just as Noah and his family were saved through the flood and delivered from that corrupted generation, so we also are saved through the water of baptism and delivered from this crooked generation. On the one hand, they entered the ark by faith and were saved through the ark, thus escaping God’s judgment by the flood. On the other hand, they passed through the flood in the ark and were saved through the flood; that is, they were saved out of the former world and were brought into a renewed world.<sup>36</sup></p><h2 class="head1">The Reality of Baptism Being Christ in Resurrection as the Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>Baptism itself does not and cannot put away the filth of our flesh [1 Pet. 3:21]—the dirt of our fallen nature and the defilement of fleshly lust. The erroneous teaching concerning baptismal salvation, a teaching based on this verse and Mark 16:16 and Acts 22:16, is corrected here. Baptism is only a figure; its reality is Christ in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit, who applies to us all that Christ passed through in His crucifixion and resurrection, making these things real in our daily life.<sup>37</sup></p><h2 class="head1">Baptism Being an Appeal to God</h2><p>Baptism is the appeal to God of the baptized ones for a good conscience unto God (1 Pet. 3:21). When we were baptized, we were baptized into Christ to be identified with His death, burial, and resurrection [Rom. 6:3-4]; hence, through baptism we were able to obtain a good conscience.<sup>38</sup> All our sins, offenses, transgressions, and trespasses have been forgiven, and all the problems that estranged our life and our being have been buried in the water.…Because of this clearance, we can have a good and pure conscience.<sup>39</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
