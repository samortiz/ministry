Today there has been much scientific study concerning food and medicine to help people to be healthy and stay healthy. The Bible tells us that in our Christian life, the Word of God is food (Matt. 4:4; Jer. 15:16) and medicine to us (Prov. 4:20-22). In 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus, Paul spoke of healthy teaching (1 Tim. 1:10; 2 Tim. 4:3; Titus 1:9; 2:1), healthy words (1 Tim. 6:3; 2 Tim. 1:13), and healthy speech (Titus 2:8). Healthy implies the matter of life. The healthy teaching with the healthy words and healthy speech ministers the Word as the supply of life to people, either nourishing them or healing them. Because the Word is our food and medicine, we need a scientific study of it to help us to be healthy and stay healthy in our Christian life. In particular, we need a scientific study of the all-inclusive Spirit, who has been compounded with the elements of Christ's all-inclusive death and all-inclusive resurrection.</P><P>We have seen that the all-inclusive Spirit is typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25. This ointment is a compound of five elements. Olive oil is the basic element, signifying the unique God. This element is compounded with four other elements, which typify various aspects of the death and resurrection of Christ. Exodus is a book of types. If we do not understand the types, we cannot understand Exodus. Pharaoh was a type, Egypt was a type, and even all the calamities used by God to punish Pharaoh are types. We need to understand the truths in the Bible through its types.</P><P>One of the great types in the Bible is the type of the compound ointment in Exodus 30. We need a scientific study of such a wonderful type of the all-inclusive Spirit. Because of the scientific study of food and medicine, people are healthier and live longer today. Nearly every medicine in the United States today has been studied scientifically. Such a study of the all-inclusive Spirit with the elements of Christ's death and resurrection really helps us to be healthy in the Christian life. In this series of messages on the Christian life, we want to present all the things we have dug out of the Word in our scientific study.</P><P>Actually, organic things are altogether mysterious and beyond our natural understanding. Anything that is related to our physical life is mysterious, but studying the things of our physical life helps us to be healthy. It is the same with the plant life. If we study the plant life, we can do the things necessary to keep plants healthy. We want to have a scientific study of the things of the divine life so that we can be healthy in the Christian life. In this message we want to see the crucial things concerning the all-inclusive resurrection of Christ.</P>
