   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE GLORIOUS VISION AND THE WAY OF THE CROSS 1 Scripture Reading: Acts 7:2-3; Isa 6:1-5; John 12:38, 41; 2 Pet 1:3, 16-18; Acts 9:3-6; 26:19; Rev 4:1-3; 21:10 SERVING THE LORD BEING A GREAT THING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This message is on serving the Lord and being a testimony for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is too great a thing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whether one considers it from the point of view of serving the Lord, or from the point of view of being a testimony for the Lord, the matter is not small.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Both expressions are tremendous expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We say that we are serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But who is this Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If I could meet the head of a state face to face, I would feel quite extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But this is only to serve man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to see that the Lord is higher and more glorious than any man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We serve the Lord Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many times we have spoken about the service of the Lord in too low a term and have considered it too lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, to testify for the Lord is not a light matter either.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our thoughts and concepts have to be delivered from frivolity and degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever we talk about serving the Lord, we have to be serious.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we mention service to the Lord, we have to consider it a tremendous matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are serving a God that is the Lord of heaven and earth and the One who is the highest of all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can illustrate it in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the President of our nation were going to see you this morning, perhaps your heart would have beaten much faster when you woke up in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Perhaps in the night you would not sleep too well.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is nervousness, and there is fear.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, when we talk about serving the Lord today, often we are quite insensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to realize that we are serving the Lord of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If any man says that he is serving the Lord yet has no feeling whatsoever, it proves that such a person has degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to be watchful concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>SERVING THE LORD REQUIRING A GLORIOUS VISION</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Following this, we have to see the glorious vision.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everyone who serves the Lord must have a glorious vision.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not the seeing that is glorious; rather, it is the object which we see that is glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This in turn makes the seeing itself glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is what we mean by a glorious vision.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The word vision means something extraordinary, unusual, uncommon, and strange.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It also means a scene or a scenery.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is a kind of special seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One sees because a scenery is there.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A few hundred of you are sitting here.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a very beautiful scenery.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If I had a camera, I would capture this on my film.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, a vision is a special kind of seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to know that to serve God is not an ordinary matter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is because the Lord is not ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do not have any feeling concerning serving the Lord and being a testimony for Him, we are those without a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE LORD'S SERVICE REQUIRING THE LORD'S CALLING</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From the whole Bible, we can see that every servant of the Lord begins by being called.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is like our taking up a job and receiving a letter of acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our calling is similar to this today.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not the church which is calling you, nor is it the work of the gospel team which is calling you, it is the Lord Himself who has called you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When you are called, you receive the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The calling of the Lord is the appearing of the God of glory to you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He does not appear to you without reason.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God's appearing to you is His calling you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It makes you a called one.</S>
