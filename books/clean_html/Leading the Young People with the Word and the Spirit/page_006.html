<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;Your Years Are without End&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Psalm 102:24-27 says, &ldquo;My God,... / Your years are throughout all generations. / Of old You laid the foundation of the earth, / And the heavens are the work of Your hands. / They will perish, but You endure; / Indeed all of them will wear out like a garment; / Like clothing You will change them, / And they will be changed. / But You are the same, / And Your years are without end.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s years are without end, and He will never change. These verses are quoted in Hebrews 1:10-12, which say, &ldquo;You in the beginning, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands; they will perish, but You remain perpetually; and they all will become old like a garment, and like a mantle You will roll them up; like a garment they will also be changed; but You are the same, and Your years will not fail.&rdquo; These verses, which refer to Christ, show two points. First, Christ existed before the heavens and the earth were created. He existed before the heavens and the earth came into being because He laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of His hands. This proves that He is without beginning. Second, even if the heavens and the earth perish, He would remain the same. This proves that He is without end. Hence, He is the eternal One.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;From Eternity to Eternity, You Are God&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Psalm 90:2 says, &ldquo;Before the mountains were brought forth, / And before You gave birth to the earth and the world, / Indeed from eternity to eternity, You are God.&rdquo; The first <em>eternity</em> refers to eternity past, and the second <em>eternity</em> refers to eternity future. From eternity past to eternity future Christ is God. Based on the quotation of Psalm 102:24-27, which speaks of God being eternal, and Hebrews 1:10-12, which refers to Christ, we know that <em>God</em> in Psalm 90:2 refers to Christ. Christ is God from eternity to eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;I Am Who I Am&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Exodus 3:14 says, &ldquo;God said to Moses, I AM WHO I AM. And He said, Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.&rdquo; The divine title <em>I AM</em> denotes that God is the One who is self-existing and ever-existing. <em>Self-existing</em> denotes that He is without beginning, and <em>ever-existing</em> denotes that He is without end. This is the equivalent of saying that He is from eternity to eternity. God said, &ldquo;I AM WHO I AM,&rdquo; indicating that He is God without beginning and without end and from eternity to eternity. This verse also is a reference to Christ, who is eternal in His divinity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;I Am the Alpha and the Omega&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Revelation 1:8 says, &ldquo;I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, He who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty.&rdquo; Alpha is the first of the twenty-four letters of the Greek alphabet, and omega is the last letter. This denotes that the Lord is the First and the Last. At the same time, He is also the Almighty, the One who is, who was, and who is coming. <em>Who was</em> refers to the past, <em>who is</em> refers to the present, and <em>who is coming</em> refers to the future. Christ is such a One; He is the Almighty, He who is from eternity past to eternity future.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;Having neither Beginning of Days<br />
nor End of Life&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Hebrews 7:3 says, &ldquo;Being without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually.&rdquo; This is a depiction of Christ as the eternal Son of God, who, having no genealogy in time, has neither beginning of days nor end of life.</p>
<p>The first seven references mentioned above can be used all or in part with students in junior high and high school, but the last reference is entirely for college students. We should lead the young people to memorize these verses, but the younger ones can memorize important phrases in the verses rather than memorizing the whole verse or the whole section. In this way they will have a basic understanding of the divinity of Christ and the eternal nature of Christ.</p>
