   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>for Us to Call God "Abba, Father"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After our regeneration, the regenerating Spirit becomes the Spirit of sonship for us to call God "Abba, Father" Gal 4:6; Rom 8:15 .</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I. As the Writing Ink,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sealing and Saturating Us</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As the writing ink, the all-inclusive Spirit seals us as a mark of God's inheritance by saturating us to dispense the substance of God into us to form the image of God 2 Cor 3:3b; Eph 1:11a, 13; 4:30b; 2 Cor 1:22a .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A seal on something forms the image of the seal on that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Spirit is the writing ink, the sealing substance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more He seals, the greater is His mark upon us and the greater is His image within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We bear the image of the sealing God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a deeper blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>J. Being the Pledge of God as Our Inheritance</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the pledge of God, the Spirit is our inheritance that we may enjoy God today as a foretaste unto the glorification the redemption of our body, to guarantee that God will be our full taste in the ages to come Eph 1:14; 2 Cor 1:22b .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The pledge is a guarantee that our God is our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As God's inheritance, we need the sealing, but for God to be our inheritance, we need the guarantee, the pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today we have the Spirit as a foretaste of God, and this foretaste is a guarantee of the coming full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Both the foretaste and the full taste are God Himself for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The preceding points are some of the items of the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This all-embracing blessing is Christ, the threefold seed in humanity, becoming the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The entire Bible is a book that is concerned with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, the more we touch the Spirit, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To touch the Spirit requires that we contact Him in prayer and in fellowship with Him.</S>
