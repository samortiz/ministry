   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. IN THE STAGE OF HIS INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first stage of Christ, the stage of incarnation, was not a part of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is our Savior, and He did redeem us, but His incarnation by itself was not His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Isaiah 53:2 says, "For He grew up like a tender plant before Him, / And like a root out of dry ground."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ's being like a tender plant and a root out of dry ground was not part of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Likewise, His not being esteemed v. 3 was not part of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Isaiah 53:1b-3 refers to Christ's incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 1 says, "Who has believed our report?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>/ And to whom has the arm of Jehovah been revealed?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The arm of Jehovah is a figure of speech signifying Jehovah Himself in His power.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the arm of Jehovah is God Himself in His saving power.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This arm of Jehovah has been revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Two thousand years ago, when the Lord Jesus came out of Nazareth to preach the gospel, that was the unveiling of the arm of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ as the arm of Jehovah was revealed to many, but they did not realize that He was the arm of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They did not see that He was Jehovah Himself coming in power to save them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Based on this revelation of the arm of Jehovah, the apostles reported 1 John 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But who has believed their report?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord Jesus comes back, the remnant of Israel will all repent and wail.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At that time they will recount Isaiah 53:1: "Who has believed our report?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>/ And to whom has the arm of Jehovah been revealed?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then they will go on to recount, "For..."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word for at the beginning of verse 2 is a great word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why did no one believe the report and receive the revelation concerning Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because He grew up not like a king but like a tender plant before Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because of this they did not believe the apostles' report.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A number of times in the four Gospels the Jews despised the Lord Jesus, speaking words such as, "Can anything good be from Nazareth?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John 1:46 and "Is not this the carpenter's son?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Matt 13:55 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If Jesus had come out of Bethlehem, out of the city of the royal family, perhaps many Jews would believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But they have not believed, because He grew up like a tender plant before Jehovah, and like a root out of dry ground.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Isaiah 53:3 begins, "He was despised and forsaken of men, / A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verse 1 Christ is referred to as the arm of Jehovah, and in verse 3 He is called a man of sorrows.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The arm of Jehovah is Jehovah in His power, and the man of sorrows is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When these two are put together, they equal incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One day Jehovah, the very Elohim, became a man by the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Isaiah 53 Jehovah is signified by the arm of Jehovah, and Jesus is called a man of sorrows.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is incarnation.</S>
