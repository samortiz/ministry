   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE THE MAIN PRINCIPLES IN 1 CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:2, 9, 18, 22-24, 30; 2:2, 14-15; 3:1, 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we saw in the previous chapters, the first five books of the New Testament are a history of the universal man, Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After this history, Romans gives us a full sketch of the definition of this universal man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Following this sketch, 1 Corinthians presents cases and illustrations to show us that in this universal man there are two matters which are basically and vitally important: Christ and Christ crucified, or we may say, Christ and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1:22-23a Paul says, "For indeed Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ crucified refers not only to Christ Himself but Christ with His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this universal man there is Christ on the positive side and the cross on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without Christ and His cross it is impossible for the believers to realize the practical life of this universal man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The practical life of the universal man depends on the practical realization of Christ as everything to us on the positive side, and the cross as our all-inclusive termination on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Following Romans, therefore, 1 Corinthians gives us a lengthy illustration to show us how much we need to realize Christ as everything and to experience the cross of Christ in our daily walk, in our church service, and in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE CRUCIAL MATTERS IN CHAPTERS ONE THROUGH THREE Christ as Our Portion</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are a few key verses in the first three chapters of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First Corinthians 1:2 says, "Our Lord Jesus Christ who is theirs and ours."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This short word is very meaningful, for it says that Christ is theirs and Christ is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To say that Christ is merely our Lord and their Lord is not the proper meaning of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The right meaning is that Christ is our portion and their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This can be proved by verse 9, which says, "God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be called into the fellowship of Christ is to be called to share Christ, to partake of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ has been given to us as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The term the allotted portion of the saints is found in Colossians 1:12.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The lot, the portion, of the saints is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The book of Colossians especially deals with this matter, telling us that the portion which we received from God is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No philosophy or any element of this world is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ, not anything else, is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, 1 Corinthians 1:9 says that we were called into the partaking of Christ as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to partake of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Word of the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Following this, verse 18 speaks of the word of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the preaching of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The ministry and preaching of the apostle Paul was a preaching of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul preached not only Christ Himself but Christ with the cross.</S>
