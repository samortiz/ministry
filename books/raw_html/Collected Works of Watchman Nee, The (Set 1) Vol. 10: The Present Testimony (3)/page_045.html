<H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN OPEN LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 29</H2><P>This surely is a time of temptations; everything is confusing, cold, and harsh. In this hour it is indeed difficult for Christians to stand. But have we not known this for some time from the beginning already? What else can we say?</P><P>We walk in solitude and bewilderment; we must either put down our weapons or be raptured. O Lord, which do You think is best?</P><P>This is the first issue of this year. We cannot say that there is greater hope, greater courage, or greater interest than last year. On the contrary, there will probably be greater hardships; still we need to go on as usual.</P><P>We treasure those co-workers who pray for us.</P><P>Watchman Nee<br>March 23, 1933</P>
