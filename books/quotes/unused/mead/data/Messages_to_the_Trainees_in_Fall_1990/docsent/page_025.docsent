   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINGLED SPIRIT IN EPHESIANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible, however, has much to say about the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Each chapter in Ephesians has at least one phrase related to the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 1:17 says, "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Spirit" here does not refer to the Holy Spirit but to the regenerated human spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians 2:22 says, "In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit," and 3:5 says that God's New Testament economy was "revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ephesians 4:23 says, "And are being renewed in the spirit of your mind."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ephesians 5:18 says, "And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many versions, including the King James Version, interpret "spirit" in Ephesians 5:18 as the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is not correct since the first part of this verse serves as a modifier for the second.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first clause says "Do not be drunk with wine," implying a part of our being, our body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, the second clause should read, "but be filled in spirit," in another part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Finally, Ephesians 6:18 says, "By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is impossible to understand the book of Ephesians without knowing the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>EXPERIENCING THE MINGLED SPIRIT BY FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all must realize that the most crucial part of our being is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many times our fellowship and contact with the saints help us to realize that we are still in our flesh and our soul our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to learn to always live not in our flesh or in our soul but in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we are angry with someone, we are often in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then when we realize that we should be nice to them, we act like gentlemen and talk very thoughtfully with much logic.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is to talk, live, and behave ourselves in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Neither living in the flesh nor living in the soul count before God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The book of 1 Corinthians reveals three kinds of persons: the fleshly man, the soulish man, and the spiritual man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 1 Corinthians 1 3 Paul condemns division because division is in the flesh 1:10, 11; 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul further tells us that we should not walk in the soul 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should be neither fleshly men nor soulish men.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, we should be spiritual, walking in our spirit 2:11-13, 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be proper Christians, we must know that the Lord Jesus today as the embodiment of the Triune God is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 indwelling our spirit and mingled with our spirit as one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A number of those among us who have been saved for a short time realize that they have a human spirit and that the divine Spirit indwells their human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, some may begin to wonder how the great Lord as the Spirit can dwell in their human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If it were not for the word of the Bible, they might even doubt that they have such a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, even though they believe the Bible, they may wonder why they never feel that they have a spirit or that the Lord Jesus as the Spirit indwells their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not try to prove that we have a spirit and that Christ as the Spirit indwells our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These two spirits can only be realized by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more we believe, the more we experience the two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many of us have learned that we have the indwelling Spirit and the outpoured Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We realize that when we go to preach the gospel, we need the outpoured Spirit as the power from on high.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, we often pray to receive this power because we think that the more we pray, the more we have the power.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is true that the more we pray before we go to preach the gospel, the more power we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, the more we try to feel that we have the Spirit, the more the Spirit eludes us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some may ask, "If the divine Spirit and the human spirit are substantial, how can it be that I do not have any feeling that they are within me?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are many invisible parts to our being, such as our psychological heart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our mind, emotion, will, and conscience are all invisible, but we believe that we have them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Likewise, we have a human life within us, but we cannot see it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can see so many parts of our body, but we cannot see our life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If one does not examine himself, he still has the human life, but if he opens himself up to find his human life, he will lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Life is a substance; it is substantial, but it is not visible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the same way, the divine Spirit and our human spirit are invisible, but we believe that we have them.</S>
