   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEWS Arriving at the Oneness Hangchow</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Niu Shu-guang in Hangchow saw the Lord's way a long time ago in northern China, but like other brothers, he tended toward the so-called "spiritual" unity, thinking that it was all right as long as he did not have sectarianism or division in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Recently, he was reading Ephesians, and when he came to the phrase all arrive at the oneness in verse 4:13, the Lord particularly showed him the word arrive in arrive at the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Arriving is more than just something of the heart, it involves some action.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Arriving is not just unity of the heart, it is unity that involves some movement.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since there is one life, there should be one testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, he felt it was wrong to have two administrations in one locality and that he should take action to arrive into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After dinner one day we talked together, sang hymns, and prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Niu was full of praise and full of indebtedness to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When he returned to the Body of Christ, he touched God's riches which he could not have touched outside the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Respectfully,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Dah-weh</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Seeking Fellowship Foochow</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With regard to the condition of the church in Foochow, by the Lord's grace, all the meetings are going on as usual.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every month each home meeting has special gospel meetings for several consecutive days.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thank the Lord, the results are better than those in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have had three baptisms over the past three months.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The brothers and sisters are divided into twelve home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With respect to the ministry of the word, we are going over Basic Truths.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do this because the newly-baptized ones do not seem to be able to keep up in Lessons for Building Up New Believers, but they feel that ordinary gospel messages are too tasteless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, they need this kind of message, and then we will continue with the edification of the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the meetings every month the believers are edified, and sinners are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With regard to the meetings to edify the new believers, we are now meeting in fourteen homes according to the condition of the believers in each area.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In these meetings we preach a message first and then divide into small groups for discussion and testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The co-workers have gone out to visit all the localities in the northern and eastern parts of Fukien province.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The believers in all the localities are really hungry and thirsty; they hope that people could visit them often to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>With regard to unity, recently many people from different denominations have come to fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, an elderly Congregationalist minister, who is eighty years old and had been a minister for fifty years, saw the way and wants to walk with us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He stood up in a love feast and gave a short testimony, saying that he was very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A female preacher from the Episcopalian Church brought several young brothers and sisters to fellowship with us after seeing this way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This sister is now learning to serve among us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Another Congregationalist preacher, who is a seminary graduate, came from the Dongmen Chapel and was received at last week's Saturday fellowship meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Other groups and individuals that love the Lord are also seeking fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Your brothers,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Chen Bi-yin, Chu Mao-xiang, Cheng Zheng-guang,</S>
