<h1 class="title">SEEING LIFE<br />
IN GOD&rsquo;S RESTORATION OF CREATION</h1>
<p>After God&rsquo;s original creation became waste and emptiness because of His judgment, the whole universe fell under a curse. We do not know how long this situation lasted, but it must have been quite a long time. Then at a certain point God began His work of restoring creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REASON<br />
FOR GOD&rsquo;S RESTORATION OF CREATION</h2>
<p>God restored His work of creation because He did not achieve His desire and good pleasure in the original creation. God&rsquo;s eternal plan and will were not accomplished, and there was a further need to deal with Satan&rsquo;s rebellion. Therefore, God had to restore the created world.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIS<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S RESTORATION OF CREATION</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:10 says, &ldquo;Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&rdquo; Revelation 4:11 says, &ldquo;You have created all things, and because of Your will they were, and were created.&rdquo; Thus, we see that God&rsquo;s restoration of creation was based on His plan and will.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEANS<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S RESTORATION OF CREATION</h2>
<p>The means of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation was the Son of God and His word (Col. 1:15-16; Heb. 11:3; John 1:1-3).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROCESS<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S RESTORATION OF CREATION</h2>
<p>Genesis 1 and 2 give a record of the process of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation. We need to consider this process carefully. When reading Genesis concerning the process of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation, we must consider not only the facts of what God did on the first day, the second day, and so forth. Many things in the Bible, especially in the beginning book of Genesis and the concluding book of Revelation, do not contain much detail. Hence, we must see not only the facts but also what is implied by the facts. We must listen to the story of creation not as if we were merely children who want to learn some facts. We should instead seek God&rsquo;s light. Hence, we must see what is spiritually implied in this book of the Bible.</p>
<p>If we have God&rsquo;s light, we will see that life is the center and subject of the process of God&rsquo;s creation in Genesis 1. In this chapter God&rsquo;s attention is focused on things related to life. God created countless things in the universe, but He did not mention them. Instead, in this simple record of creation He provided details related to life and living creatures. This proves that in creation God&rsquo;s attention is on the matter of life.</p>
<p>If we look carefully into the process of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation, we will see a line of life. According to fact, God created many kinds of life, beginning with the lower forms of life, before He created the human life. The spiritual implications of this line of life can be applied to our spiritual life. The steps of God&rsquo;s work preceding the creation of life speak of the conditions that are necessary for generating spiritual life, and the appearing of various kinds of life can be considered as the steps in the growth of our spiritual life. This understanding is not a random thought. I believe that these implications were present when the Holy Spirit inspired the writing of the Holy Scriptures. We will now consider step by step the process of creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Coming of the Spirit&mdash;<br />
the First Requirement for Generating Life</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:2 says, &ldquo;The earth became waste and emptiness, and darkness was on the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters.&rdquo; The first step in God&rsquo;s restoration of creation was the coming of the Spirit. Because of God&rsquo;s judgment, the earth was under deep waters and was covered by darkness. Both water and darkness in verse 2 symbolize death, indicating that the earth was in a situation of death; that is, it was lifeless.</p>
<p>The earth was covered by darkness when God accomplished the first step of His work&mdash;the coming of the Spirit. The Spirit of God is always the means by which God works. The Spirit of God came to eliminate death and to bring in life. The Spirit of God is the Spirit of life; in Him is life. Whenever a place needs life, it needs the Spirit of God. When the Spirit of God comes, He brings life. Therefore, the first step of God&rsquo;s work on the death-filled earth was for His Spirit to brood on the death waters.</p>
<p>Spiritually speaking, the coming of the Spirit of God is the first requirement to generate the divine life. The creation of living creatures required the brooding of the Spirit of God, and the receiving of the life of God also requires the operation of the Holy Spirit. The life of God is with the Spirit of God. Before we were saved, we were filled with death and darkness; we were lifeless within. Hence, the Spirit reaching us was the first step that God took in generating His life in us.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
