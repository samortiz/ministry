<h1 class="title">A VISION, A GOAL, AND A DISCIPLINED CHARACTER<br />
BEING NEEDED FOR SERVICE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE VISION<br />
IN WORKING FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>When Paul met the Lord on his way to Damascus, the Lord said to him, &ldquo;I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a minister and a witness both of the things in which you have seen Me and of the things in which I will appear to you&rdquo; (Acts 26:16). Two &ldquo;things&rdquo; are mentioned in this verse: the things in which Paul had seen the Lord and the things in which the Lord was to appear to Paul. It is not easy to see the content of these two &ldquo;things&rdquo; from reading Acts alone. In Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, however, it is easier to see that the things in which he had seen Christ are related to Christ Himself and that the things in which the Lord would later appear to him are related to the church. Paul&rsquo;s main testimony was of Christ and the church.</p>
<p>In Colossians we see the things of Christ, and in Ephesians we see the things of the church. In Colossians 2:2 Paul speaks of &ldquo;the mystery of God, Christ.&rdquo; The things concerning Christ are related to the mystery of God. God is a mystery, and no one can know or understand Him. Although God is a mystery, Christ is the story of this mystery. Christ is God&rsquo;s story; God&rsquo;s details are revealed through Christ. This is the reason that Colossians speaks of Christ as the mystery of God. In Ephesians 3:4-6 Paul speaks of the church as &ldquo;the mystery of Christ.&rdquo; The story and details of God are revealed through Christ, and the story and details of Christ are revealed through the church. Hence, these two books reveal two mysteries&mdash;the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ. The mystery of God is Christ; the mystery of Christ is the church. We have spoken of these mysteries for more than twenty years here in Taiwan, and we have published numerous messages related to them in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> magazine.</p>
<p>However, I must mention something. Although we have been speaking on these matters for many years, it seems as if the co-workers&rsquo; messages and work and the results of their work are not related to the speaking of the ministry concerning Christ and the church. The messages of the ministry and the work of the co-workers seem to be unconnected and even far removed from each other. This shows that we have not entered into the vision of the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ; this vision does not control our work. Although we have heard messages and read books related to these two mysteries, our actual work is quite removed from the central vision of Christ and the church. We must bow our heads to admit that we have not entered into this vision even though we have heard these terms. This vision does not control us.</p>
<p>Christians are in a pitiful condition because for centuries they have not let the Lord bring them into this vision. The speaking in the denominations today shows that Christians are far removed from this vision in their actual living. They do not even know how to speak of this vision in a clear and definite way. Any speaking related to Christ and the church is mixed with human, cultural, moral, and religious concepts. Although this is the condition of Christianity today, we are not completely removed from this condition either. In our messages we still combine verses and excerpts from the ministry books with our cultural, moral, and religious concepts. Those who speak among us do not have a clear sky, and those who hear do not have a strong discernment. Consequently, everyone is unclear about this vision. The work of the co-workers is equally unclear; it is as if blue is not blue, green is not green, black is not black, and white is not white. There are no clear boundaries. Such a mixed and unclear condition makes it difficult for God to bless us; this is the reason that we do not have much fruit in various localities.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A GOAL IN WORKING FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>According to the situation in all the local churches, we need to be thoroughly trained. Training can be likened to a doctor speaking to his patient. It is the responsibility of a doctor to speak truthful words, not pleasing words; however, truthful words are often bitter and hard to take. We need to be calm and ask ourselves before the Lord about the testimony of the churches in Southeast Asia. There have been churches in Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand for three to four decades, but no one can say that he is satisfied with the number of saints and the number of churches. We should bow our heads and admit that our vision is not clear or strong. Speaking more accurately, we are lacking in vision. Likewise, we do not have a strong vision in our work; therefore, we do not have much fruit.</p>
<p>According to our God-created human nature, every man has an inclination and a desire to accomplish something. Regardless of one&rsquo;s profession, everyone has a goal. Even bandits have a goal. Having a vision and a goal is essential to achieving anything. It is difficult for others to regard an unaccomplished person with much seriousness. Man was created by God, and in his created human nature, there is an inclination to pursue toward a goal. Our work, however, is like a rudderless ship that is in the hands of captains who do not have a compass; consequently, we are drifting. This is a true portrayal of our work. Our work has no goal, and our messages have no set direction; we speak as we please on one thing today and on another thing next week. In the end neither the leading ones nor the saints know where we are going. Truthfully, this is a deplorable situation.</p>
<p>Recently, some saints from the churches in Manila, Singapore, and Hong Kong visited a district for the bread-breaking meeting. As soon as the bread and the cup were passed, a responsible brother stood up and said, &ldquo;I thank and praise the Lord for the brothers visiting today. Let us hear some fellowship from them.&rdquo; As soon as he said this, the ship was handed over to others. This shows that the responsible brother was steering the ship without a compass. During a recent Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting, a responsible brother saw me and said, &ldquo;Thank the Lord, Brother Lee is here today; we have hope.&rdquo; I responded, saying, &ldquo;I will not speak. You are steering the ship here and doing a good job. If you hand the ship over to me just because I am here, there will be no direction.&rdquo; Sometimes we hand the ship over to others, and we do not even know when they have run it aground. This damages the purpose of the meeting and accomplishes nothing. A directionless meeting can be likened to hot and sour soup that is neither hot nor sour. Who would want such a tasteless soup? The believers who come to such a meeting will feel cheated and will never come back again. If our meetings accomplish nothing and have no goal, no vision, no revelation, and no spirit, people will have no desire to come back.</p>
<p>The co-workers must prostrate themselves before the Lord and endeavor to accomplish something definite. The New Jerusalem has a wall that is one hundred forty-four cubits high (Rev. 21:17); it has definite boundaries and specifications. Yet we have created an atmosphere of indifference toward our messages, our work, and our meetings. Even more grievous, some co-workers are defiled by sin, yet they feel nothing. Others sin again and again, yet they are not dealt with properly. Such co-workers should leave, and the other co-workers should be rebuked for being indifferent to sin. This is not a proper condition.</p>
<p>During a recent service meeting of the church in Taipei, a brother from another locality sat in the back of the room and stood up to speak three times. It was a meeting for the brothers and sisters from the various districts in Taipei, but this brother joined the meeting and openly expressed his opinions. This was a grave mistake that shows that we do not take the church and the Lord&rsquo;s work seriously. How can we expect the Lord&rsquo;s blessing in such a condition? The Lord&rsquo;s blessings are like rain. Although rain comes from heaven, there must be the proper vessels to receive it. If our special service meetings are not proper, there is little doubt that our work and our meetings will be lacking in definite accomplishments. Many of us have consecrated ourselves to serve full time, even abandoning our futures, but we are actually forsaking our consecration when we work without a vision and a goal.</p>
<p>We must see that the mystery of God is Christ and that the mystery of Christ is the church. We have been speaking about the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ for many years. However, I have not seen the co-workers in the Far East take the vision of the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ seriously. If I give a message in the United States, the brothers and sisters will focus on it for a long time, but it seems as if there is an indifferent attitude here. It is as if we can take it or leave it. God&rsquo;s blessing depends on our cooperation, and the extent of our cooperation determines the extent of God&rsquo;s blessing. If we have an indifferent attitude toward God&rsquo;s blessings, we will not succeed in anything we do. Everything we do must matter and must yield results.</p>
<p>We need to pray that the Lord would grant us to see the vision of the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ. The mystery of God is the story of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Christ, the Son, is also the Father and the Spirit (Isa. 9:6; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17). As the source, God is the Father. As the expression, God is the Son, and as the realization, application, and entering into man, God is the Spirit. Christ is the mystery of God; He is everything&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;to work Himself as the mystical One, the wonderful One, and the rich One into us. The focus of our work must be to go to the churches and to work this matter into the brothers and sisters so that they may see that the Triune God wants to work Himself into us. We must speak this regardless of our capability so that the brothers and sisters in every locality can see that the Triune God&mdash;the Father as the source, the Son as the expression, and the Spirit as the realization&mdash;wants to work Himself into us. We must give messages on this topic every week for a whole year. Furthermore, we must speak livingly and thoroughly until the saints are touched inwardly. After we speak on the mystery of God, we must speak on the mystery of Christ, the church. We need to speak message after message about the human spirit being a vessel to contact God, to contain God, to digest God, and out from which God can spread into every part of our being. We should list all the verses on the human spirit in the New Testament and focus on them verse by verse, speaking continually for a year or two until the saints are ushered into the spirit. The brothers in Hong Kong have done this to some extent over the years, but strictly speaking, I have not seen co-workers elsewhere who are speaking and doing the same thing.</p>
<p>In our work, giving messages is like teaching in school, but we are grossly unprepared. When it is &ldquo;class time,&rdquo; we do not know whether we are teaching literature, history, or geography. I do not know what people have learned over the years from meeting with us. In such a condition, how can our work be blessed? How can seeking ones come? The condition of the co-workers and our overall situation is one of indifference. Forgive me for saying this, but our condition in principle is the same as that of Christianity. We lift up the banner of Jesus Christ, but we are wholly indifferent and do not know what we are doing. The co-workers, the elders, and even the responsible ones in the districts are indifferent; everyone is indifferent.</p>
<p>There was once a brother named John Sung who, from the standpoint of the truth, did not preach the gospel so accurately. However, he had one goal&mdash;to speak until people repented, until people were convicted in their conscience and confessed even with tears and much weeping. He would speak twice a day for two hours each time to impart a sense of sin into people so that they would repent. His messages were actually not fully according to the truth, but he had a goal and a direction. Hence, he was fruitful.</p>
<p>In Philippians 3:14 Paul says, &ldquo;I pursue toward the goal.&rdquo; This indicates that Paul had a vision. In verses 5 and 6 Paul describes himself as being &ldquo;of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, persecuting the church; as to the righteousness which is in the law, become blameless.&rdquo; At one time Paul was more religious than all the other religionists. Nevertheless, he counted all these things as loss so that he could pursue toward the goal of living Christ. If we look at the entire Epistle to the Philippians, we will see that Paul&rsquo;s goal was the Christ who lives in us. Paul also warned the Philippians to &ldquo;beware of the dogs,&rdquo; who were injecting them with their religious poison (v. 2). These &ldquo;dogs&rdquo; were in contrast to &ldquo;the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh&rdquo; (v. 3). We must never be caught by any religion; we must regard religion as refuse (v. 8). Paul regarded all the religionists as biting dogs; we must fear them and beware of them, on the one hand, and pursue Christ, on the other hand. If we apply this principle to ourselves, we may discover that the routine things we do in our service may have been affected by religion. For example, even though we may have a morning watch, we may not be in Christ. We must beware of religion because it is possible that even we can become &ldquo;religious dogs.&rdquo; We must thus flee from our religion. Only a vision can truly touch other people&rsquo;s feelings; religious or natural messages mean nothing.</p>
<p>If we see the vision, we will be delivered from our natural views and understandings even in our reading of the Bible. I was recently at a bread-breaking meeting where a sister fellowshipped about 1 John 3:1, which says, &ldquo;Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God.&rdquo; When she spoke of the Father&rsquo;s love, her speaking was based on a natural understanding. She understood the literal significance of the verse but not its inner revelation. The verse indeed says that God loves us and that we should be called children of God, but the emphasis is on God&rsquo;s being in us today as our life, our fellowship, and our anointing. His nature has become our nature, His fellowship of life has become our fellowship of life, and He is the inward anointing that is constantly anointing us. It is easy to read the Bible literally, but it is another matter to see the deeper points. When, for example, the Lord Jesus referred to God as &ldquo;the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob&rdquo; (Mark 12:26), He was talking to the Sadducees about resurrection. Although the word <em>resurrection</em> is not used in this verse, the Lord used the name <em>the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob</em> to reveal the matter of resurrection. This is vision.</p>
<p>Our meetings and our work in the church are not weighty, because of our lack of vision. If a school is run in a weighty manner, good students will come. If we rely only on zeal, we will produce something that is lacking in vision, light, and revelation, and people will not remain. This is our problem.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Vision for Serving the Church &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
