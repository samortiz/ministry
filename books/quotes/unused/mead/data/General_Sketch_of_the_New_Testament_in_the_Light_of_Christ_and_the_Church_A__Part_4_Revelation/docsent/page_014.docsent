   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Fifth Trumpet Judgment on Men</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the first four trumpets, a warning is issued to all the people who dwell on the earth v. 13 . In principle, we are sojourners on this earth, not those who dwell in it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not be those who dwell on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As Christians we should not settle down.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, we should be a migrating people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are the children of Abraham, who migrated, traveled, and sojourned all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some may need to migrate from the west coast to the east coast, passing through Idaho, Missouri, Chicago, and other places in the Midwest, Boston, Washington D. C., Florida, and then on to Mexico, Central America, and South America.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not be settled; do not be those who dwell on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The warning in verse 13 consists of three woes, in which Satan, who is cast down from heaven to the earth, damages the earth as much as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verses 1-11 of chapter nine speak of the first woe, which is also the fifth trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the fifth angel trumpets, a star out of heaven falls to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By reading this book carefully, we can realize that this star is the fallen Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Luke 10:18 the Lord said that He saw Satan falling like lightning out of heaven; that was the judgment of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Revelation 9:1 contains the execution of that judgment, which also corresponds with 12:9-10.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After being cast out of heaven, Satan is given the key of the pit of the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When he opens this bottomless pit, many evil spirits come out in the demon-possessed locusts 9:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the time of Moses, locusts were a great judgment on the Egyptians Exo 10:12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The fifth trumpet, however, will be a woe of supernatural locusts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These locusts will have tails like scorpions to sting people and torment them for five months.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Due to this suffering, people will seek death, yet death will flee from them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These locusts will do a great deal of damage, which will be a real suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not like to say much beyond this, as some do with their wondrous interpretations of the locusts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not care for such interpretations; we only receive what is according to the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Revelation 9:11 says that these strange locusts have a king, who is the angel of the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many believe that this angel is Satan, but this is not so.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to 11:7 and 17:8, the beast, Antichrist, is the one who comes out of the pit of the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Antichrist, as the king of the demon-possessed locusts, has a name in Hebrew, Abaddon, meaning destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This word is used also in Job 26:6, 28:22, and Proverbs 15:11.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He also has the name Apollyon, which in Greek means destroyer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Antichrist will be the destruction and the destroyer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Sixth Trumpet Further Judgment on Men</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The sixth trumpet is the second woe, which is more serious and intensified than the fifth trumpet Rev 9:12-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verses 12 through 15 say, The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are yet coming after these things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And the sixth angel trumpeted, and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the golden altar which is before God saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And the four angels were released, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year that they might kill the third part of men.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first four trumpets damaged only the earth with the trees, the seas, and the rivers, and the things in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They did not directly damage men s bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the fifth trumpet, however, the scorpions sting men s bodies, and at the sixth trumpet not only are men s bodies damaged, but the third part of men are killed v. 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 16 says, And the number of the armies of horsemen was two hundred million; I heard their number.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not like to suggest too freely where these two hundred million horsemen will come from, but we should consider what part of the world can produce this many horses; that is where the trouble will arise.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verses 17-21 continue to show us what the sixth trumpet will be like.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This entire portion of the earth at this time will be full of armies the army in verse 16 alone will have two hundred million horsemen and a third part of men will be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That will be a real woe to the human race.</S>
