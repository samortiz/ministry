<p>In this point John condemns &ldquo;a pervasive control exercised over the church.&rdquo; He also defines this control, saying that &ldquo;this control has not been exercised so much directly, but very much indirectly, through videos, conferences, trainings, and elders&rsquo; meetings.&rdquo; Is there among us such &ldquo;a pervasive control exercised over the church,&rdquo; that is, a control that pervades all the churches? I would say here and now that there is no such thing! I do not exercise any control over any church, nor do I have any intention to do this. Here John has pointed out clearly that &ldquo;this control has not been exercised so much directly.&rdquo; This word of his indicates definitely that the pervasive control that he condemns is not one that is carried out directly by me or by anyone other than me, but &ldquo;very much indirectly,&rdquo; as he says, &ldquo;through videos, conferences, trainings, and elders&rsquo; meetings.&rdquo; His clear word indicates that the means to carry out the indirect, pervasive control mentioned in his accusation are &ldquo;videos, conferences, trainings, and elders&rsquo; meetings.&rdquo; The videos, conferences, trainings, and elders&rsquo; meetings refer, no doubt, to the messages I have put out at different times and on different occasions. To say that through the messages that I gave I exercised a pervasive control over the church is not true. Whenever I gave a message, I never had the thought to control any church or anyone. In speaking for the Lord, I have only a sincere intention that through the Lord&rsquo;s word that I speak, sinners may be saved, saints may be edified and perfected, and the church may be built up for the carrying out of the New Testament economy of God. The thought of speaking for the Lord with an intention to exercise control over others is evil.</p>
<p>Here John says also, &ldquo;At least I can speak for Anaheim. I know this to be a fact, and I&rsquo;m in a position to know this.&rdquo; &ldquo;This&rdquo; must refer to the pervasive control that has been exercised &ldquo;very much indirectly through videos, conferences, trainings, and elders&rsquo; meetings,&rdquo; as he indicated. The messages given by me in conferences, trainings, and elders&rsquo; meetings that were recorded on video were sent to all the churches, not only to the church in Anaheim. Hence, not only John, but all the elders of all the churches who have listened to my tapes are in a position to know this pervasive control. Do some of you brothers, who are the elders of the churches and who are present in this meeting, have the same kind of realization that John has&mdash;that I exercise a pervasive control over your churches indirectly through the messages on the videos?</p>
<p>My messages are always spoken with the Word of God as their base, structure, and element, which always conveys not only the divine revelation and the supply of the divine life, but also regulations, corrections, exhortations, and even reproofs (2 Tim. 3:16). How could John consider my messages, with such contents, a means that I use in order to exercise a pervasive control over the churches? If all the churches had the same kind of realization that John has, what would be left of the building up? This is a real devastation.</p>
<p>John also says, &ldquo;There has been much outside influence exercised upon the church.&rdquo; Since what was mentioned in his accusation was an &ldquo;influence,&rdquo; especially an &ldquo;outside&rdquo; influence, it should not refer to anything within but to something outside the church that was under his care. Even if there were such an outside influence, such an outside influence should not be considered as a control that I exercised over the church under his care.</p>
<p>John went further to say that this outside influence &ldquo;has made it very difficult to go on by getting our leading directly from the Lord.&rdquo; In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we work and serve in the Body of Christ. So, in our work and service to the Lord, we are related both to the Lord as our Head and to the ones who work and serve together with us as fellow members of the Lord&rsquo;s Body. Hence, the New Testament teaches us to be subject not only to the Lord but also to one another in the fear of the Lord (Eph. 5:24a, 21). Thus, in the Lord&rsquo;s work and service, in the matter of &ldquo;getting our leading directly from the Lord,&rdquo; we need to consider our relationship with the ones who work and serve together with us. It is hardly possible for us to receive a leading directly from the Lord without taking care of the ones with whom we work and serve. If we get our leading directly from the Lord without considering the fellow members of the Lord&rsquo;s Body who are laboring with us, we will surely jeopardize the oneness of the Body. We constantly need the cooperation and the coordination to keep us in a balanced situation in which we take care not only of the Lord&rsquo;s leading directly but also of the co-working ones&rsquo; realization. On the other hand, when we take care of the co-working ones&rsquo; realization, we should also seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading directly. This way of balance is the safe way and the proper way to save us from being independent, whether intentionally or unintentionally, and to keep the oneness of the Body so that the Body can be built up without the suffering of any loss.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Intrinsic Problem in the Lord's Recovery Today and Its Scriptural Remedy &nbsp; pg 30</div><br></body></html>
