Man's spirit is very unique. In the Bible man's spirit is neutral. Its characteristics take on that of the outer man, that is, the characteristics of the soul. The spirit itself transcends good and bad, right and wrong, yes and no, and good and evil. The spirit is the new capacity that God gives to the believers. It is special in the sense that it bears no characteristics of its own. It takes its characteristics from other things. When the self life is added to the spirit, the spirit manifests a certain characteristic. In one sense it does not have any characteristics of its own, but in another sense it does have its characteristics. Its characteristics are the characteristics of our soul. We judge the characteristics of the spirit by the characteristics of the things that are attached to it.</p><p>For example, water is colorless; it is pure. But if we add colored sugar to it, it will have a certain color and taste. The same can be said about our spirit. It is pure in itself. But the kind of person we are produces the kind of characteristics our spirit carries. Many times the brothers and sisters are right in their words and conduct, but their spirit is wrong because their very person is wrong. John 3 says that our spirit needs to be regenerated. John 4 follows by saying that we have to worship God with our spirit. A wrong spirit cannot serve the Lord.</p><p>D. L. Moody was a shoemaker's apprentice. He was an inexperienced and uneducated person. His sermons were patched together from what he heard here and there. He took note of these things and made them the content of his sermons. Once, in a gospel meeting, about five to six hundred people stood up to accept the Lord. A middle-aged lady came to him later and criticized him for saying the wrong thing. When Moody heard this, he said to her with tears in his eyes, "You know me the best. You should pray for me." She only knew how to criticize. While her words to Moody were right, her spirit was wrong. Moody was the opposite. His words might have been wrong, but his spirit was right. At that time Moody was at the height of his ministry. His humility was an outflow of his life. Some people are humble, but they are still soulish. Moody was a person who was always ready to deal with his soul and purify his spirit. This is the reason God greatly used him.</p><p>In Shanghai there was a brother by the name of Lee who did something wrong. Another brother by the name of Chow learned about it. He was sad and sorrowful and prayed desperately for Lee with fasting and tears for a whole week. Afterwards, he went to Lee to exhort him, intending to recover him with love, tears, and a meek spirit. He persuaded Lee to repent. Lee was convinced and repented, but it was only an outward repentance. Within he was still not subdued. After two years Chow committed a mistake similar to Lee's. When Lee found out, he wrote a letter to Chow immediately with only three words in it: "What about now?" If a man has the right spirit, he has tears, and he can rebuke others and recover them. But here was a person who could only exhort others. Although he only said three words, his spirit was wrong; it was an evil spirit. After Chow received Lee's three-word letter, he replied immediately, saying, "From this experience I have learned that man is weak and prone to fall. Without the Lord's mercy and grace, no one can stand. Therefore, we have to fear God." Here we see a right spirit.</p><p>A right spirit is something that God gives us; we do not have it in ourselves. When God gives us a word, we will not be self-assuming or proud. When we accept and obey such a word, we acquire a right spirit on that point. I hope we will learn to open up our spirit to receive the divine Spirit. If there is any mixture of our soul-life, our spirit will be defiled.</p><p>Saint Jials (?) was a simple man. He was a cook in a monastery in northern Italy in the Middle Ages. He was not educated and did not have much Bible knowledge. But he loved knowledge and was very fond of learning. He requested of the abbot that he be allowed to listen in on the sermons. The abbot did not grant him his wish and told him to be satisfied with being a cook. One year later there was a special conference. He requested of the abbot again but was turned down again. Later, he prayed to the Lord that he be allowed to attend the meetings. He came up with an idea. He had been baking bread and preparing food on a daily basis. He gathered the food he would need for two months, such as potatoes and ducks; then he cooked them ahead of time. When the mealtime came, he took the cooked food and warmed it up in a big pan. The monastery had never tasted food with such a strange taste. When the abbot heard about this, he rebuked the cook. That night Saint Jials could not sleep. The Lord shone on him, and he realized that every circumstance is from God. He saw his mistake, and he repented. He knew that the abbot had lost his voice, and he felt sorry for him. He prepared a bowl of porridge with sugar, took it to the abbot, and said to him, "I was wrong with the food. Please forgive me. You have lost your voice. I have prepared this porridge for you." The abbot was greatly touched by Saint Jials's word. He touched the spirit of self-denial in Saint Jials. That was the greatest supply the abbot had received in his whole life. Humanly speaking, when Saint Jials was rebuked, he could have resented it, but he did not have such a feeling. Instead, he felt for the abbot's pain and loss of voice. He volunteered to prepare food for him in the middle of the night. This is a clean spirit before the Lord. Its quality is very high.</p><p>Before the Lord, we must not only ask if we have a spirit but must pay attention to the quality of our spirit. From church history we find many brothers and sisters who had an excellent spirit, something that no ordinary men and women possess. If we learn our lessons thoroughly, and if we fellowship with God often enough, it will be easy for us to have a right spirit. But if we have not lived before the Lord all the time, our words will convey a defiled spirit. The quality of every person's spirit is very much related to his cumulative experience before the Lord during ordinary times.</p><p>Here I would like to say a word to the elders. In dealing with the young people, we should not ask whether or not they are smart. Human intelligence is useless. You do not have to deal with their gifts and functions either. All you need to do is consider if their spirit is clean. When disputes arise among the brothers and sisters, the issue is not who opens his mouth first or what the terms of settlement are, nor is it a matter of the rightness of words or conduct, but a consideration of the spirit. If you try to base your judgment on man's word, you will find it hard to determine if it is accurate or exaggerated. If you base your judgment on his conduct, you will find that the standard of right and wrong differs in different people. The law courts in the world are concerned with facts and conduct. However, our emphasis is not on words and conduct but on the spirit. In dealing with the young people, we have to see if they have a strong spirit and what kind of spirit they have. Sometimes they have a strong spirit, but such a spirit is also a defiled spirit, a coarse spirit, and an arrogant spirit. May the Lord be merciful to us that we would pay attention to man's spirit more than to his words and conduct.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_075.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_077.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 62: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (2) &nbsp; pg 76</div><br></body></html>
