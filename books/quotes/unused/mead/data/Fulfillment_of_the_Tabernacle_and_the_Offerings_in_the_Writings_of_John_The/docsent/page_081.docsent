   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO THE SIGNS IN JOHN EIGHT 1 Scripture Reading: John 8 THE TABERNACLE AND THE LAMB</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Gospel of John is a record showing us the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have pointed out, in the first chapter of this Gospel we have the tabernacle and the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 1:14 says, "The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is God incarnated to tabernacle among men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1:14 the word "tabernacled" is used as a verb.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to this verse, Christ Himself was the tabernacle dwelling among men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, He is a living tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1:29 John the Baptist said of Christ, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we see that the Christ who was incarnated to be the living tabernacle is also the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lamb of God is the aggregate, the totality, of all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, in two verses, verses 14 and 29 of John 1, we have the words tabernacle and Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These terms indicate that the Gospel of John covers the matters of the tabernacle and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Chapter one of the Gospel of John is a prologue or introduction to the entire book.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that what is mentioned in the first chapter of John is defined and developed in the remainder of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fact that in the prologue we have the tabernacle and the Lamb of God indicates that John in his Gospel intends to unveil the tabernacle and the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For this reason, we say that the Gospel of John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the book of Revelation, which is the conclusion of the Bible, we can also see the tabernacle and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Revelation 21:3 says, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be His peoples, and God Himself shall be with them."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As God's habitation, the New Jerusalem will be the tabernacle of God for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The tabernacle made by Moses was a type of this tabernacle, and that type was fulfilled in Christ as God's tabernacle among men.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, that type will be fulfilled in the fullest way in the New Jerusalem, which will be the enlargement of Christ as God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Within the eternal tabernacle of God, that is, within the New Jerusalem, the Lamb of God will be on the throne Rev 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Revelation 5:6 says that in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, there was a Lamb standing as having been slain.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This book mentions the Lamb many other times 5:12; 6:1; 7:9-10, 14, 17; 12:11; 14:1, 4; 19:7, 9; 21:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, in the book of Revelation we have both the tabernacle and the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a further indication that John's writings are a record of the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE UNIVERSAL REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need a clear view of the Bible as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible is a record of the universal reality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Anything that does not have reality is empty, vain.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, if we had only a physical body but did not have an inner being, we would be empty, altogether lacking in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our inner being is our reality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we had only a body with skin, flesh, and bone, we would have a "shell," but we would not have reality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the universe does not have a reality, then the entire universe is a shell.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For there to be no reality in the universe would mean that the universe would not have any content.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the universe were merely a shell, there would be nothing but emptiness and vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>King Solomon said, "Vanity of vanities; all is vanity" Eccl.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He said that everything under the sun is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is true that if we do not have the content or reality of the universe, everything will be vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now we need to go on to ask what the content of the universe is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Philosophers and other thoughtful people cannot answer this question.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is hard for anyone to tell you what the content, the reality, of the universe is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some among us may say that the reality of the universe is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, this may be merely a doctrine to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A doctrine is not reality; rather, it is also a shell.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may compare doctrine to a menu.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A menu is a description of food, but it is not the food itself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only the food, not the menu, is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When you go to a restaurant, you go there for food, for reality; you do not go for the menu.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To say that the reality of the universe is Christ may simply be a doctrine, a menu; it may not be the reality, the food.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, I definitely agree with those who say that Christ is the reality of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But in what sense is Christ this reality?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It also may merely be a doctrine to say that the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit is the reality of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This may be a doctrine that you learned in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As we shall see, according to the record of the Holy Word, the reality of the universe is actually the tabernacle and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What is recorded in the Bible from Genesis through Revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We may say that in the Bible we have God, Christ, the Spirit, the church, and the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This, of course, is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But if we get into the depths of the truth revealed in the Bible, we shall see that in these depths we have the tabernacle and the offerings.</S>
