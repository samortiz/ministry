   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE ORGANIC FUNCTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST 2 THE ORGANIC FUNCTION OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All activities in human society are organized.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, among human beings, the cultivation of young people requires organization.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the church, however, how should we produce workers to meet the need of spreading?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul and Timothy are good examples.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We will not use Peter as an example, because he was appointed by the Lord Jesus while the Lord was in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since we do not have the Lord s physical presence with us today, we cannot take Peter s experience as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible shows that after the Lord Jesus appointed the twelve apostles while He was in the flesh, He appointed Barnabas and Paul according to His invisible presence and in His status as the ascended Head.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Barnabas and Paul were appointed as apostles without any element of human work or organization.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They were appointed by the organic operation of the Lord as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul was called when he met the Lord on the way to Damascus Acts 9:1-6; 26:12-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After his conversion he served the Lord fervently, and his function was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord told Paul only that he would be sent to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Besides this, the Lord did not tell him what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible does not reveal how the Lord appointed Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The New Testament discloses very little about how the Lord s workers were appointed or how they worked, because such a record would be used for organizational purposes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After Paul met the Lord, he spontaneously and organically followed the Lord according to the divine life he had received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Ananias sought out Paul, he also was carrying out his organic function as a member of the Body of Christ and not because he was sent by men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He laid hands on Paul and told Paul what the Lord wanted him to do 9:10-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Paul went to Jerusalem, the disciples in Jerusalem were afraid to contact him because he had persecuted the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, Barnabas contacted him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This contact came out of Barnabas s exercise of his organic function in the Body, not from Peter s instruction vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>20-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Acts 9 Paul left Jerusalem and returned to Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In chapter 11 some of the disciples from Jerusalem, who were scattered abroad, went forth proclaiming the gospel, reaching as far as Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Believers were raised up in places even among the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Barnabas, according to his organic function in the Body, was sent from Jerusalem to visit the believers as far as Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After visiting the believers, Barnabas went forth to Tarsus, found Paul, and brought him to Antioch, where he and Paul remained.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In chapter 13 Paul was one of the prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul may have been perfected through Barnabas, since it was Barnabas who brought Paul into the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Acts 13 shows that in the church in Antioch there were five prophets and teachers, the first being Barnabas and the last Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no mention of elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the prophets and teachers were ministering to the Lord, the Holy Spirit said that Barnabas and Paul should be set apart and sent out to do the Lord s work v. 2 . This was the Holy Spirit s operation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible refers to Barnabas and Paul as apostles when they were sent out 14:4, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Their first journey ended in chapter 14 when they returned to Antioch v. 26 . In his second journey Paul went to Lystra, and there he met Timothy 16:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church in Lystra was established by Paul in his first journey, and elders were appointed there within a short time 14:6-7, 21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not long afterward Paul passed through again, and the brothers commended Timothy to him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the Epistles to Timothy, Paul and the elders in Lystra laid hands on Timothy 1 Tim 4:14; 2 Tim 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Timothy was a young full-timer who had a desire to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was raised up by a local church, and he was recommended to the apostle by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Their laying on of hands was not an ordination; to be ordained is organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The laying on of hands indicates identification and fellowship, in which the Spirit of life is imparted for the purpose of bestowing a spiritual gift.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Timothy s spiritual gift was not manifest at the beginning of his service.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Acts 17 Timothy s function was manifested while they were in Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul mentioned Silvanus, Silas, and Timothy as his co-workers when he wrote his first Epistle to the Thessalonians 1:1; Acts 18:1, 5; 2 Cor 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 1 Thessalonians Paul says that they were apostles 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Acts 16 Timothy was still young, but in chapter 18 he was considered to be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In 1 Timothy 5:19 Paul indicates that an accusation against an elder could be submitted to Timothy, which means that he was able to properly respond to accusations against elders.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Surely this shows that the young Timothy had been perfected to be an apostle.</S>
