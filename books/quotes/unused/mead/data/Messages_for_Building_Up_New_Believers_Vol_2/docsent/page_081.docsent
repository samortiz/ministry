   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>10.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not Expecting</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Other s Personality to Change</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many people have a wrong concept.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They think they can change someone else s personality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Please remember that this is not possible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It takes a long time for even the Holy Spirit to change a person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How much can you do?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Please remember that marriage does not bring with it the power to change a person s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many brothers and sisters know that their spouses have a different personality, and they want to change it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But after two or three years, they find that there is still no change.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If there is one hope in the world that is doomed to failure, this is certainly the one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have yet to see a husband who has managed to change his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Neither have I seen a wife who has changed her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I once said that in marriage, one can only purchase ready-made goods, not made-to-order goods.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whatever a person is, that is what you get.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You cannot order a person to be a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You must first find out if you can accept such a brother s or sister s personality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You can only find out one s present personality; you cannot expect to change it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you harbor such a hope, you will surely be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We hope that God s children will pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This will spare them many headaches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>During the ten years that I worked in Shanghai, one-fourth of my time was spent in counseling family problems.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I advise you emphatically not to put brothers and sisters with different personalities together.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If they are put together, the result will certainly be serious.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Children from such families will certainly be affected also, because they will not know which side to take when the parents are on a see-saw.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is also clear that it will not be easy for their children to be saved either.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>G. Weaknesses</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now let us consider the matter of weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The above discussion referred to differences in personality and did not involve any moral issue.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But human beings have not only differences in personality, but also weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moral Weaknesses</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is a weakness?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some are lazy, while others are diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Diligence is a virtue, while laziness is a weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some are accurate with words; accuracy is a virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Others not only are a little careless with their words but also constantly lie.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They love to exaggerate what they say.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a weakness in personality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some are tight-lipped and do not like to talk much; this is a virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Others like to criticize and correct others; this is a weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They gossip about this and that family.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is not a matter of personality, which does not involve moral values.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When a character trait involves a moral issue, it is a weakness, and it needs to be dealt with before God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some people do things quickly while others act slowly; this is a matter of personality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if a person is so quick that he becomes impatient, he has a weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some people are so slow that they become untrustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is also a weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Being impatient is a weakness, and being so slow as to become untrustworthy is a weakness as well.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Discovering the Other s Weaknesses</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What should one do about the weaknesses of the other party?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is rather hard for any outsider to decide.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before young brothers and sisters marry, they need to find out each others weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They must do this before they are engaged, not after.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is wrong to look for weaknesses after you are married; it is, in fact, very foolish to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is too late to look for weaknesses after you are married.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is better for the husband and the wife to be as foolish and deaf as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you try to discover the other person s weaknesses after marriage, you are too late, because you are already living together every day.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You will see many things without even trying.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you purposely try to search for weaknesses, you will surely find more.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The purpose of marriage is not to provide you with an opportunity for finding faults.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do not open your eyes after you are married.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Before you are engaged, while you are still choosing your mate, do not be blinded by natural attraction.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Do not allow natural attraction to veil you from the weaknesses of the other person.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do not be so hot as to overlook the weaknesses in the other party.</S>
