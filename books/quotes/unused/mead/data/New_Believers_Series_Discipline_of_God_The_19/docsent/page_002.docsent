   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Not Regarding Lightly the Discipline of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's children should not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the Lord disciplines us, we have to pay attention to it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Everything the Lord measures to us has a purpose and meaning to it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He wants to build us up through our experiences and environment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All of His discipline is for the purpose of perfecting us and making us holy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All of His discipline works His nature into our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a result, we become disciplined in our character.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the purpose of the Lord's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He does not discipline us without reason.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He disciplines us for the purpose of making us vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord does not allow suffering to come to His children without a cause.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not suffer for the purpose of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He does not give us tribulation simply to make us suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The purpose in all our suffering is that we would partake of God's holiness and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the goal of discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many children of God have been Christians for eight or ten years, yet they have never given serious consideration to God's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They never say, "The Lord is disciplining me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is dealing with me, chastising me, and molding me into a vessel."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They do not see the purpose of God's chastisement, dealing, and carving work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They go through their experiences capriciously.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are not bothered by what they see today; they let it slip by.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are not bothered by what they see the next day; they are not concerned about what the Lord's will is, and they disregard it time after time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To them it is as if God purposelessly allows people to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Please bear in mind that the first reaction of God's children should be to respect and honor God's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first thing we should do when we experience something is to find the meaning of our experience: Why have things happened this way?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must learn to respect and honor God's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not regard it lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To regard it lightly is to be careless about it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is to say that God can do whatever He wants to do and that we must simply go through these experiences mindlessly and aimlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, we should not regard the discipline lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the other hand, we should not make too much of it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the Christian life became nothing but a story of suffering and frustration, it would be too much of a discouragement to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is to make too much of our discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must learn to accept the discipline of the Lord and to see that His discipline and reproach are always meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the same time, we must not be discouraged by discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 6 says, " For whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives.'"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a quotation from Proverbs.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It reveals the purpose of the Lord's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A. Discipline Being the Arrangement of Love</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God does not have the spare time to deal with all the people of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He disciplines only those whom He loves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He disciplines us because He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He disciplines us because He wants to make us vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God has no time to discipline everyone in the world, but He disciplines His own children because He loves them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, discipline is God's provision of love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Love arranges the environment that we should be in. We call this arrangement His discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Love measures everything that comes our way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It orders the things that we encounter in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This measurement is His discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Discipline is for our greatest profit and for bringing us to the loftiest goal in God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"And He scourges every son whom He receives."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All those who are disciplined have the ground to say that they are received by God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Scourging is not a sign of God's rejection; it is a proof of His acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I say again, God does not have the time to deal with everyone; He wants to spend His time on the sons whom He loves and receives.</S>
