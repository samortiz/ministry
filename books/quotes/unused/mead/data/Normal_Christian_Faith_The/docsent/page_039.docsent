   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HE IS THE BREAD OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us read on.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 6:51: "I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here His words become more and more peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is strange enough to say that He is the bread of life which came down out of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now He says that he who eats Him, not only will not die, but will live forever.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even more intriguing are the words that say that the bread He gives is His very flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No wonder the Jews at that time said that it was a hard saying.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Who can take this?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is right!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We never heard such words before.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We never heard them from Confucius, from Mencius, from Lao-tze, from Chuan-tze, or from any other sages.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We never heard them in China or in any other country.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No man has ever spoken such words.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After Christ spoke such words, verse 52 says, "The Jews then contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us His flesh to eat?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What doctrine did Jesus preach?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>None.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All that He said was to eat His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verses 55 and 56 say, "For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You can see that He is only emphasizing Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not a set of doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, it is the eating of His flesh and the drinking of His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who eat and drink will live forever.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>HE IS THE WATER OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we come to John 7, we see the last day of a great feast.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Jesus spoke some words in front of those who were attending the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"On the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Just imagine: on one of our busy festive holidays, I, Watchman Nee, stand up in the midst of a crowd and shout, "If you are thirsty, come to me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He who believes in me, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You would surely say that I am a senseless fool from Shanghai who is talking nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But that was exactly what Jesus did and said.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There was really no doctrine; there was just the person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On that day when Jesus spoke those words, a dispute arose among the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some said that this truly had to be the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Others reasoned how Christ could come out of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In trying to answer who this man was, an argument arose among the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The argument centered around one thing: who was this Jesus of Nazareth?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A genuine Christian is one who believes that Jesus is the Christ.</S>
