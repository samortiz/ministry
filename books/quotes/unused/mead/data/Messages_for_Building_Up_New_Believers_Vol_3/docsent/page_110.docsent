   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>G. Ecumenical Union Being the Product</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of a Condemned Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you try to divide the Body into denominations and then unite them again, you no longer have the Body!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To unite something after cutting it apart results merely in an association, not the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You should not think that you will have the same person after cutting him into pieces and then putting the pieces together again.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The life is gone!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is foolish to cut the Body of Christ into hundreds of denominations and then to unite them again!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That is not the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That is just a union of organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I hope you will see before God the error of dividing the Body of Christ into many denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the members are together, it is the Body, and when they are apart, they are the members.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is all we know.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Other than these two things the Body and the members there is no intermediate organization.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no such thing as grouping members into many organizations and then uniting all these organizations into a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This kind of ecumenical union is not the Body of Christ, but human organization.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the product of a condemned conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>MAINTAINING THE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How then should this oneness be maintained?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If unbelievers were accepted into the church in Foochow, it would no longer be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We would have to call it a sect and leave it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose some churches are composed entirely of believers, yet there is the element of sectarianism in them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must also leave such groups.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then there are those who unite various organizations together to become larger ecumenical affiliations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is also the work of the flesh, and we must leave them as well.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A. The Need to Stand in the Position</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are to have the church in Foochow today, it must have a boundary that is as large as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whether or not others like it is their own concern.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whether or not others would take this way is up to them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But those who want to take this way must be faithful to take a stand; they must not be sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They must not willfully allow any unbelievers in their midst, and they must not replace the Body with ecumenical organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must stand on the ground of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Body of Christ dictates the boundary for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is our way today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the only way for God s children to take in every locality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must be clear about the position we should take.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot be sectarian or divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must not have unbelievers among us, and we cannot replace the Body of Christ with ecumenical organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Ecumenical organizations speak of the operation of light but the absence of the strength to obey this light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It tells us that there is the knowledge of God s will but the reluctance to keep this will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is God s revelation but a failure to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is nothing more than a halfway house.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God has placed us in another position, the position for all the children of God to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But others will not come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are not saying that others must acknowledge what we say we are.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are merely saying that we are taking a stand for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>B. Acknowledging the House of God</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We admit that there are brothers and sisters in the sects, the state churches, and the ecumenical organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If they are faithful, they should come home; they should take the same stand as we have taken a stand for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today our door is open to them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, we have no other choice but to keep our own standing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is the situation today?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is like a family with two young brothers who have been kidnapped by robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You cannot disband the family just because two brothers have been kidnapped.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There are still the father, the mother, and the other brothers and sisters in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The family cannot be disbanded.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, we have to say that there is no peace in the family now because two brothers have been kidnapped.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who have been kidnapped are temporarily away from the family.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, the other brothers at home should have a broad heart.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They should not shut their brothers out just because they have been kidnapped.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They should learn to open their door and their heart to them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whenever the kidnapped ones come home, they should be welcomed with open arms.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thank God, they may come back for a short time, or they may come back forever.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They may have lived a wandering life for a long time, but we have to say that this is still their home.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We cannot shut the door to them just because they have left us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some have said that too many people are wandering in the denominations today and therefore God s church has disbanded and is no longer in existence.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But God s children on earth can never be disbanded; they can never cease to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Today we must do our best to uphold our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our Father is here, our Lord is here, and the Holy Spirit is here.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As long as we have these, that is enough!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As long as we have three or five brothers, that is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Two or three brothers is enough for a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In some places, we have even more than this!</S>
