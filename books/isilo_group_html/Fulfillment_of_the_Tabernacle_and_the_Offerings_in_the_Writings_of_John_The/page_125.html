It is not sinful for our feet to be unclean. For example, it was not sinful for the leading ones to be bothered by the way that sister prayed in the meetings. But that feeling was a frustration to our fellowship. We all felt that we should write that sister a note in order to wash her feet.<p>I wish to point out that she was not offended by what we did. I can testify that afterward this elderly sister and I became quite close. This is a proof that she was helped by the note we sent her. Yes, when she first spoke to us about it, she complained that the &#8220;water was too hot.&#8221; I also had the feeling that the water was too hot. I would have preferred to have spoken to her directly. However, because Brother Nee was taking the lead and because this situation concerned his own mother, I did not want to express my opinion. In this matter, Brother Nee set an example of the way to deal with relatives, and we all learned much from it. No one was hurt, and the &#8220;muddy&#8221; situation was cleared up. This illustrates that in the church life we need foot-washing to clear away everything that hinders our fellowship with one another.<p>In the past we have also had some experience of literal foot-washing. One day, I believe in 1954, the elders in the church in Taipei were led of the Lord to wash the feet of all the brothers. That literal foot-washing recovered many who were weak. Although we washed the brothers&#8217; feet on that occasion, this has never been a regular, ordained practice. But spiritually we need to wash one another&#8217;s feet all the time.<p>One way to practice spiritual foot-washing is to be frank with one another. We may say that frankness is equal to foot-washing. This does not mean, of course, that we should rebuke others out of anger. But it does mean that we may wash one another&#8217;s feet by speaking frankly to one another. If we do this, the situation among us will be clear, and we shall have excellent fellowship with one another. Furthermore, if our fellowship with one another is clear, our fellowship with God will also be clear. This will strengthen our spirit, cause us to grow in life, and truly build us up together. In the church life we need such a spiritual foot-washing all the time.<p>Instead of washing one another&#8217;s feet, some brothers in the church life are political or practice politeness. For example, suppose brother A is having fellowship with brothers B and C. Brother A may be very nice to brother B and speak politely to him. Nevertheless, the fellowship between them is not genuine. After brother B leaves, brother A may turn to brother C and tell him that brother B is hypocritical. What should brother C do in this situation? He should look to the Lord for His grace and then, in love, speak a frank word to brother A and say, &#8220;Brother, you said that this brother is hypocritical. But when he was here, you were very nice to him. Now you tell me that he is a hypocrite. Brother, you are not being honest. Whether this brother is hypocritical or not, I do not know. However, I am certain that your behavior is not genuine. If this situation is not cleared up, how could all of us have the peace to attend the Lord&#8217;s table meeting together?&#8221; To speak in such a frank, honest way with a pure spirit is to practice foot-washing.<p>We have pointed out that in both secular and religious society today, there is no foot-washing. Suppose brothers A, B, and C are members of a religious organization. Brother C may hear brother A&#8217;s criticism of brother B. But instead of saying anything honestly to brother A, he may first keep the matter to himself. Later, he may go to brother D and tell him about brother A. This kind of behavior is common in human society, including religious society. In the church life our practice must be different. We need continual foot-washing in order to maintain our fellowship.<p>It is not easy to wash someone&#8217;s feet. Neither is it easy to have our feet washed. In other words, it is difficult to be either a washing one or a washed one. This is the reason that many behave in a political way and do not wash the feet of others.<p>Sometimes others are offended when we wash their feet. At least a few times I have offended saints simply because I washed their feet. Because others may be offended by our foot-washing, we should never be in a hurry to practice this. If we would wash someone&#8217;s feet, we need much grace. We also need to be clean ourselves. It is easy for the flesh to come in while we are dealing with someone else&#8217;s defect. Therefore, we need to be careful to be absolutely in the Spirit.<p>It is just as difficult to receive foot-washing as it is to administer it. If we are willing to be washed, we shall be blessed. We need mercy and grace both to wash another&#8217;s feet and also to receive the washing of our own feet.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_124.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_126.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 125</div><br></body></html>
