I believe that the time is near when Christ will acknowledge the ignorant nation of Israel (Rom. 11:26). The acknowledgment of the United Nations does not mean anything. What counts is Christ's acknowledgment. The day is coming when Christ will tell the world, "Don't touch the nation of Israel. Whoever touches her touches the apple of My eye. The Israelites are My brothers."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(p) Eventually Recognizing Christ</H2><P>Joseph's brothers eventually recognized him (45:15), and the Israelites will eventually recognize Christ (Zech. 12:10). Until they recognize Him, Christ will continue to deal with them patiently. Recently I read that some Jewish scholars have begun to study the case of Jesus. It seems that these scholars are eager to learn more about who Jesus is. Instead of acknowledging the Jews now, Christ is giving them a further time to consider Him. These Jewish scholars who are studying the case of Jesus admit that Christ has gained a great deal of credit for the Jewish people, for Christ came from the nation of Israel. He was and still is a Jew. If Christ had come out of your country, you certainly would be proud of Him.</P><P>If we keep all these points in mind as we follow the news in the Middle East, we shall be happy and praise the Lord. All that is happening today was foreshadowed in Joseph's dealing with his brothers. In a sense, what we are seeing today is a motion picture of what has already taken place. Even as I am speaking about these chapters in Genesis, the events foreshadowed in them are taking place in the Middle East. What is happening today is the fulfillment of what is portrayed in this portion of the Word. Praise the Lord for His wisdom and patience! He knows what He is doing with Israel. In not too long a time, Christ will make an open recognition of the nation of Israel. He will do this by descending from the heavens to the earth. The Savior out of Zion will come to the land of Israel and recognize the nation of Israel as His nation.</P><P>Now we come once again to a parenthesis covering certain matters on the line of life. I love the line of Joseph as a type of Christ, but, as far as I am concerned, the line of life is more practical. The line of the type concerns Israel, but the line of life concerns you and me.</P><P>Although there were many clear indications of Joseph's identity, his brothers could not recognize him because of their blindness and preoccupations. Because his brothers were so blind and ignorant of him, Joseph was compelled to take a further step to reveal himself to them. Joseph must have prayed concerning his dealing with his brothers. He did not deal with them according to his personal feelings or desires, but according to the Lord's leading. Whatever Joseph did to his brothers was according to the Lord's leading.</P><P>No one else could have had the patience Joseph had. As we have pointed out, it took twenty-two years for his dreams to be fulfilled. After such a long period of time, Joseph had an intense desire to see his father. How could a man have had such patience? How could he have been able to control his emotion, his love, and his desire to see his father? Joseph's patience and self-control must have been of the Lord.</P><P>After the last test, at least one of Joseph's brothers, Judah, had improved. This is indicated by the way he spoke to Joseph about taking care of their father and their youngest brother (44:18-34). When Joseph's brothers sold him, they hated him and did not care for their father or youngest brother. Rather, they acted according to their hatred. But the way Judah spoke to Joseph indicated that he cared about his father and his youngest brother. This touched Joseph very deeply and convinced him that his brothers had learned their lesson. Thus, immediately after this, Joseph acknowledged them. Prior to this time, the brothers were still learning the lessons. The lessons were not completed until at least one among them had improved and had learned to care for his father and youngest brother. Until that time, Joseph exercised great patience in testing his brothers.</P><P>In my opinion Joseph should have revealed himself to his brothers immediately after feasting with them. However, he did not do this. Instead, he charged his steward to fill their sacks with grain and to return their money (44:1-2). No doubt Joseph's brothers were happy. If I had been one of the brothers, I would have said to the others on the way back to Canaan, "What do you think about that ruler? Why was he so nice to us? He is the ruler of the whole earth and we are foreigners coming to buy food. Yet he invited us to his home and feasted with us. He even gave Benjamin a portion five times greater than what he gave the rest of us. Moreover, he seated us according to our birth. What is this all about? Who is this man?" I believe that Joseph expected his brothers to talk like this. He expected them to thoroughly consider him. But they were careless and they did not do this. There must have been certain features of Joseph's face that would have enabled them to recognize him. But his brothers were too blind to notice them.</P><P>Suddenly, much to their surprise, the steward caught up with them and said, "Wherefore have ye repaid evil for good?" (44:4, Heb.). He then accused them of stealing Joseph's cup. The brothers replied, "Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?" (44:7-8). According to Joseph's plan, the cup was found in Benjamin's sack (44:12). This should have caused the brothers to wonder why that ruler in Egypt paid so much attention to their youngest brother. Joseph's brothers were terrified. As 44:13 says, "They rent their clothes, and loaded every man his ass, and returned to the city" (Heb.). When they saw Joseph again, "they fell down before him on the ground" (44:14). This also should have reminded them of Joseph's dreams. However, they still did not understand what was happening to them.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_668.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_670.html">Next</a> </body></html>
