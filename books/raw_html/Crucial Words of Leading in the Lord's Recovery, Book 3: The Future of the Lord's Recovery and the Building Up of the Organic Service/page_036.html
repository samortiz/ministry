	 <h2 class="head1">SEEING THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST IN COLOSSIANS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being Rooted in Christ,<br />
Taking Christ as the Base in All Things</h2>
<p>If we want to grow in life, we must be rooted in Christ (Col. 2:7). The book of Colossians reveals the experience of Christ. In Colossians Christ is our life (3:4). He is also the God-allotted portion of the saints, and this portion is an inheritance (1:12). For example, in a large household the parents can allot a house to each son. Christ as our portion is our inheritance from God. Colossians also says that Christ is the mystery of God (2:2). In other words, Christ is the story of God. Christ is our life and our blessed portion; He is also the story of God. Furthermore, all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily; He is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead (v. 9).</p>
<p>We must remember that Christ is our portion, He is the mystery of God, and all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily. Such a Christ is our life, and we must be rooted in Him in all things. We must not take anything else as our base. Our living must take this all-inclusive Christ as its base. Husbands must not take their love for their wives as the base for their living, and wives must not take being submissive to their husbands as the base for their living. We must take Christ as our base in everything. A husband must love his wife with the love that comes out of Christ, and a wife must submit to her husband with the submission that comes out of Christ. Our living is not based on Chinese ethics or on ancient teachings; rather, Christ is our base in all things. We must take Christ as our base in all things, because He is our source.</p>
<p>If we see this and practice it, our living will change. In order to do anything with Christ as our base, we need to have much fellowship with Him. If we fellowship with Christ, we will discover that ninety percent of the time we do not take Christ as our base. Instead, we take ethics, ancient teachings, customs, feelings, and tastes and preferences as our base. On the surface some ancient teachings and family traditions appear to be the same as Christian teachings, but they are not Christ. We must turn away from all ancient teachings and family traditions. As saved ones, we have Christ as our life, so we must be rooted in Him in all things.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Enjoying Christ and<br />
Growing with the Growth of God</h2>
<p>Christ is our life. He is all-inclusive, He is the embodiment of God, and He is our God-allotted inheritance, so we should enjoy Him every day. Christ is in the Word, and He is the Spirit. The Spirit is the reality of the Word, and the Word conveys the Spirit. Daily we must read the Bible, which is the milk of the word. We must drink of the milk of the word daily to receive nourishment from the Bible (1 Pet. 2:2). However, we should not merely read the Bible; we must open our spirit to fellowship with the Lord. We must pray-read, and through our pray-reading we will receive the element of Christ. In this way the divine life within us will grow.</p>
<p>As a result, we will not change our behavior, nor will we rely on the cultivation of a preacher. Instead, God, who is within us, will give us more life. God Himself is life, and when the element of God increases within us, we grow in life (Col. 2:19). Due to our growth in life, we are brought into Christ in all things. This is what it means to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things (Eph. 4:15). When everyone grows, the issue is the Body of Christ, which is Christ&rsquo;s household and God&rsquo;s temple, the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESULT OF EXPERIENCING CHRIST</h2>
<p>We must also preach the gospel to bring in new ones. Strictly speaking, it is a shame to bring only one person to the Lord in a year. It would be very strange if a peach tree produced only one peach in a year. In other words, a tree is usually laden with fruit. In the same way, we should bear abundant fruit. A sister once declared that she would bring eight to ten people to salvation in one year. As a result, in only six months she brought more than ten people to the Lord. In 1966 there were many junior high school and high school students, in their uniforms, in the audience of a large gospel meeting. It should be easy for teachers to bring others to the Lord. Those who teach in either junior high or high school have a good opportunity. The students they teach should be their &ldquo;targets.&rdquo; If a teacher has thirty students and is able to bring one-third of them to salvation every year, by the end of seven years many will be saved. This is a great undertaking. Every saint who is a teacher should not only learn how to educate his students; he should also learn how to gain them. Then his students will become his fruit hanging from him as a branch.</p>
<p>Leading people to salvation may be compared to a mother giving birth to a child. After giving birth, the mother still has to raise and educate the child. After we lead someone to salvation, we need to nourish him, and we also have to teach him. This is the way to have much fruit. If we are faithful to practice this, after seven to ten years, we will gain one million people in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This is not a difficult undertaking.</p>
<p>However, we cannot merely produce numbers without the truth; otherwise, the new ones will be immature with no way to grow up, and the church life will suffer a great loss. Such a work would be of wood, grass, and stubble, and it would never be pleasing to God. For our work to spread, we must have the truth and life; we must also have the church as a support and as a home where the new ones can be brought. If we work in this way, there will be strong and living churches on the island of Taiwan that do not merely have large numbers but also have a proper testimony. There will be bright and shining lampstands. Moreover, the saints will be salt, and they will have a germ-killing function at every level of society. As a result, our country and society will be blessed. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would be able to render our proper cooperation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN ADDITIONAL WORD</h2>
<p>We need to have some fellowship concerning how to meet. When the time given for sharing in the meeting is too long, it is like giving people a large plate of dessert that is too sweet for them to eat. Hence, it is best to sing a hymn. We should sing with expression; we should not be too loud or too soft. Everyone must exercise to sing. Sometimes we can sing loudly, and at other times we can sing softly. However, we should not be habitual in our hymn singing. We must sing in order to bring out the flavor of the hymns. I hope that the brothers and sisters will know not only the Bible but will also know the hymns. Hymns are the crystallization of the truth. The young people in particular must learn how to sing the hymns. They should even memorize the hymns. Some of the hymns are on the central line of God&rsquo;s economy. We must sing these ones more often, such as <em>Hymns,</em> #499: &ldquo;Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!&rdquo; There are eight <em>what</em>s in this hymn, and we should learn to sing them with expression. For example, the first two phrases of the first stanza can be sung in a strong way, and the third and fourth phrases can be sung softly. When we sing &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s no longer I that live&rdquo; the first time, we should sing it a little softer, and when we repeat it, we can sing it stronger. If we practice this, our hymn singing will be living, and the entire meeting will also be living.</p>
