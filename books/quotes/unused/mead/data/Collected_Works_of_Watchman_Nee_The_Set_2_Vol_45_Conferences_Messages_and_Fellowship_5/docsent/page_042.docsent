   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Money</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first unrighteous thing we have to deal with is money.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Money easily brings us into unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We cannot take someone else's money as our own.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not a cent of others' money can be ours, and we cannot borrow that is, personal borrowing, not borrowing in business .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With some people, borrowing is a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is like drugs to them; they are addicted to it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Time and again they borrow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you want to be a brother to them, you should not lend anything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you lend to them, you should be ready to sacrifice your relationship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Borrowing and lending is a great temptation; they lead to unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When others transgress against us, we can be compensated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if we transgress against others, we will not receive blessing from God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot be careless in the matter of money.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There was a maid who stole over twenty dollars from her master before she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After she was saved, she felt sorry and said to a sister, "I feel uneasy about keeping this money.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I would like to offer it to God."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the sister heard this, she asked, "How do you know that God will take your booty?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She told the maid to return the money to her master.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The maid agreed, and when she did this, she became peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Another sister was asked by her sister in the flesh to let her use her admittance ticket to the park.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She did not want to do it, but eventually she gave in. After she gave in, she lost her peace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A brother was taking a tram to Wen-teh Lane.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The fare was seven cents, but he got off before he paid the fare.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later, he was condemned about this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not easy to be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I told that brother that the next time he took the tram he should buy two tickets to make up for the previous trip.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you have any unrighteous money remaining in your home, it will eat up the rest of your money and even eat up your spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is all right to bargain when you shop, but do not try to cheat on the scale and do not hope that the arm on the scale will tip over more.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Righteousness has nothing to do with whether or not others are willing to give us a bargain; it has to do with whether or not we are willing to accept a bargain.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A missionary, Miss Liu, once took a summer vacation in the Lu Mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>While she was there, someone tried to sell her bamboo baskets.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She began to bargain with the man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At a certain point she could bargain no further, because she felt that it was no longer a matter of the man's willingness to sell, but a matter of the fairness of the price.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many people are only reluctantly willing; theirs is not a heartfelt willingness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Time</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not take advantage of others in time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should render to others whatever time we owe them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is unrighteous for us to steal others' time for our own use.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many people know that they should not steal money to offer to God, but they steal time to offer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is also unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should deal with any unrighteousness in the use of our time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Responsibility</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should also be righteous in bearing our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some fathers are busy doing their own work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They have no time to be fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Their sons are deprived of the fatherly love they need.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Likewise, many mothers have often been unrighteous in neglecting their responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some mothers say that they want to be spiritual, and they do not need to care so much about their children.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They say that they are committing everything to the Lord and leaving it up to the Lord to discipline the children.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A husband has his responsibility as a husband.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a husband does not take up the financial responsibility of the family, he is being unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A wife has to bear the responsibility of the housework or else she is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every person has his or her area of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You have your sphere; I cannot decide what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But you know when you infringe on others' sphere or when you become unfaithful in your own.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to learn to be a righteous person in our responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>DEVELOPING A HABIT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should render to others whatever is due to them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we do not render it to them, we are being unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should discover new items of unrighteousness every day in our daily life and deal with them accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We may commit some accidental unrighteous acts, but we have to learn to discover them and deal with them also.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For example, we know that we should not trespass on lawns.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But many people trespass inadvertently.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to deal with such unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Righteousness is a habit which we have to cultivate; it is a way that we have to take.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to learn to deny all looseness and unrighteousnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we do this we will spontaneously live out righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should learn to be a righteous person, but we should not try to intentionally act this out.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Sometimes others can be turned off by our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Tonight we have to settle our account before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We have to discover all of our unrighteousnesses and learn to deal with them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should receive God's shining and refuse Satan's condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Sometimes unrighteous things flash before our eyes from all angles.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Some are real and some are counterfeits.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Satan tries to show us these things in an instant to crush us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is his snare; it is not God's work, and we have to reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God's work is gradual; it works step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God enlightens us gradually; He guides us to deal with things one by one with the goal of developing a habit of righteousness, of learning to take the way of righteousness according to the holy life, and of serving Him in holiness and righteousness.</S>
