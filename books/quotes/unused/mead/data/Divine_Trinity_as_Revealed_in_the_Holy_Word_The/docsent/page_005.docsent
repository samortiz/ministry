   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, the Angel is the very Elohim, the Triune God of the three generations Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Trinity is implied here because this portion concerns God s shepherding of Jacob in order to preserve the race of Israel to bring forth Christ and work Himself into man and that man may participate in and enjoy God.</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By studying the Trinity in Genesis, we can conclude that God s trinity is for His economy, which is to dispense Himself into man so that man may enjoy Him and become His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In addition, according to the revelation in Genesis, there are two crucial points concerning the Trinity.</S>
