   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY OF THE CHURCH AND THE WAY OF THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Witness Lee asked: What is the difference between the way of the church and the way of the co-workers?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Taking the Jerusalem Line</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>the Church and the Work Being One</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brother Nee answered: We have covered the way among us in 1937.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time, we spoke of the difference between the local churches and the work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our line then began from Acts 13.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But during the past few years, we have found out our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We found out that we have to begin from chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Acts of the Apostles begins from chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is wrong for us to pay attention to the difference between the church and the work before the church is ever built up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should start from the basis of the church and the work being one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our mistake lies in the order and the sequence; it is not a mistake in the truth itself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We were not wrong in the truth, but we were wrong in the timing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our work must first return to the principle of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The starting point of the church is the work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before the Lord, there is first the church, and then the giving of the gifts of the apostles and the prophets, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Ephesians 4, the Holy Spirit and Paul did not acknowledge even the existence of the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The order there is first the ascending on high of the Lord, then the giving of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These gifts are given after the church has been produced.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The prophets there do not include such prophets as Elijah, nor do they include such people as Peter before the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With Peter, he was an apostle in two different ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One was before the formation of the church, and the other was after the formation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Peter in the Gospels is the Peter before the formation of the church, and the Peter in Acts 2 is the Peter after the formation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why we say that in Ephesians 4 there is first the church and then the work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before God, first there is the church and then the work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But on earth, there was first the work and then the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There were the apostles in Jerusalem first, then the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Afterwards, there were the deacons and the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the church in Jerusalem, there were first the deacons and then the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many people become a deacon first and then become an elder afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some need to serve first in the matter of food, before they can take care of the administration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The situation in Jerusalem is different from that of an ordinary church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There we have the elders, the deacons, and the apostles as well.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Consolidating the Work and Spreading the Fruit</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Please remember that Peter carried out his work in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only Philip was sent to Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Under normal circumstances, we should send all the Philips out.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today the co-workers should come together and work in one place, whereas the brothers and sisters should be sent out.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The believers in Jerusalem should go out everywhere for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do not migrate today, persecutions may come and force us out.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>During the past years, small meetings have been raised up in many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These are not the works of the workers, but the works of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These brothers and sisters moved to these localities for the sake of their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At present, small meetings have already started everywhere, and we have to go back and deal with every one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our problem lies in the fact that we did not pay attention to the sending out of the workers right from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is why many local churches develop problems.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is true that the apostles should remain and work in Jerusalem, but their view should be enlarged to include other places.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church in Antioch is of a different principle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Antioch is the case of the church producing the work, whereas Jerusalem is the case of the work producing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today, we should first come back to take the way of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Later, we hope that some local churches can practice the principle of Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>First Corinthians 12 speaks of the Body on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It deals with the question of the church on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That is why it says that the apostles and the prophets produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today, we need both principles.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the one hand, the church produces the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the other hand, the apostles produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If our work can progress along these two lines simultaneously, we will see great blessings ahead of us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the one hand, we should consolidate the work.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the other hand, as soon as people are saved, we should tell them that they live for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should not wait until the persecutions arise.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should send them out right away.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the Lord's way.</S>
