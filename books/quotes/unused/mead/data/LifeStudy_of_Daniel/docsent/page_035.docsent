   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first section 1:3 6:28 , which comprises six cases, speaks of the victory, in their captivity, of the young descendants of God's degraded elect over Satan's further devices.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second section chs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>7 12 records the visions of the overcoming Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Daniel's faithfulness and victory gave him the position and the right angle to receive the visions from God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Daniel received vision after vision.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He received visions from God not only concerning the destiny of His elect but also concerning God's eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This book, at its highest point, touches the matter of how God intends to spend His eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In chapters two and four, Nebuchadnezzar, a Gentile king, saw two great visions a great human image and a big tree.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although Nebuchadnezzar saw these visions, Daniel was needed to interpret them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The big tree in chapter four corresponds to the head of the human image in chapter two: both signify Nebuchadnezzar.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the head was touched by God, the tree was cut down, and Nebuchadnezzar became a beast 4:16, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the first vision, the head of the great human image was gold.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Each successive part of the image was made of different metals from silver to bronze and eventually to iron.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In man's eyes these four metals represent four great human governments and cultures.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, what Daniel saw in the vision in chapter seven was very different.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead of four different metals, he saw four cruel beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to study carefully the description of these four beasts.</S>
