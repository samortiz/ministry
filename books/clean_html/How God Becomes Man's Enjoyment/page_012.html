<h2 class="head2">The Word of God Making Man Glad<br />
and Changing Man</h2>
<p>Jeremiah 15:16 says, &ldquo;Your words were found and I ate them, / And Your word became to me / The gladness and joy of my heart, / ...O Jehovah, God of hosts.&rdquo; When Jeremiah found God&rsquo;s words, he not only heard them, but he ate them as food. After he ate God&rsquo;s words, he was immediately supplied within and felt glad and joyful.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1948 I went to work in Foochow. After I finished giving a message, the saints gave me a glass of tangerine juice. Tangerine is a specialty of Foochow. As soon as I drank the juice, I was refreshed. For several weeks in Foochow I was very busy every day, and I was very tired. The tangerine juice that the saints gave me in the morning, at noon, and in the evening refreshed me. This impressed me with how much food and drink supply us. Likewise, when we eat the Lord&rsquo;s words, we are spiritually refreshed.</p>
<p>There is not one book in the world that has the ability to supply life. Only the Bible has such an ability because the words in the Bible convey the Spirit, and God is embodied in the word. Many believers have been supplied by the word of God. The word of God not only has the ability to supply man but can also change him completely. Just as the food we eat sustains our life, makes us healthy, and changes our constitution, so also the word not only gladdens and satisfies us but also gradually transforms us to the Lord&rsquo;s image.</p>
<p>Once a white man went to Africa and saw a native reading the Bible under a tree. The white man ridiculed the Bible and said that it was an outdated book of no value. The native looked at him and replied, while pointing to his own stomach, &ldquo;If it were not for this book, you would have already been in my stomach.&rdquo; Those natives were cannibals who were converted by the Bible. This shows that God&rsquo;s word is wonderful and powerful. A Christian who has believed in the Lord for years but has not had much transformation has not eaten enough of God&rsquo;s word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Speaking through Man</h2>
<p>Hebrews 1:1-2 says, &ldquo;God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son.&rdquo; God is pleased to speak through man. The words that God spoke through the prophets are the Old Testament. The words that God spoke through His Son are the New Testament. To this day God&rsquo;s Son is still speaking to us through the Spirit. Throughout the ages God has been a speaking God. He has not ceased speaking. This is His mercy, for when God does not speak, we do not have any way to know Him. God reveals Himself to us through His Word and supplies us with His word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Word Being Able<br />
to Supply Every Man&rsquo;s Need</h2>
<p>Hebrews 5:12-14 says, &ldquo;When because of the time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you what the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God are and have become those who have need of milk and not of solid food. For everyone who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness, for he is an infant; but solid food is for the full-grown, who because of practice have their faculties exercised for discriminating between both good and evil.&rdquo; <em>The oracles of God</em> refers to the words of God. All God&rsquo;s words are our food; some are like milk, and others are like solid food. If we are spiritually immature, that is, like children before God, God&rsquo;s word will be like milk to us. If we are spiritually grown, God&rsquo;s word will be solid food to us.</p>
<p>The Hebrew believers were spiritually immature; they were not full grown. Therefore, they could be given only milk to drink; they could not be given solid food to eat. The author of this book said that he could feed them only with the simple truths of God&rsquo;s word, but he could not supply them with profound truths.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 3:2 says, &ldquo;I gave you milk to drink, not solid food.&rdquo; Just as in Hebrews, in this verse both milk and solid food refer to God&rsquo;s word. The Corinthians could receive only milk, but they could not receive solid food. These verses prove that the word of God is food that can supply the needs of every kind of person.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:2 says, &ldquo;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word.&rdquo; <em>Milk of the word</em> refers to God&rsquo;s word. This verse also shows that God&rsquo;s word is nourishing and digestible food, like milk, to the newly saved, who may eat of it and grow by it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A BALANCED ENJOYMENT</h2>
<p>God has given Himself to us as a tree and a river for our enjoyment. The tree of life is food for us to eat, and the river of water of life is living water for us to drink. We can eat God in His word and drink Him in the Spirit.</p>
<p>God is the Word. God is mysterious, incorporeal, intangible, and invisible. We cannot see Him, hear Him, smell Him, or taste Him. What we can perceive with our five senses is of no avail in relation to God. The way that God has prepared for us to know Him is by the Word. Every orthodox and proper word in the universe is an expression of God. Every proper and positive thing in the universe is also an expression of God. Thus, every positive and proper word that man can comprehend is out of God and explains God. God has been expressing Himself with words throughout the ages. The crucial points, principles, topics, and content that God has spoken throughout the ages are contained in the Bible. The Bible is God&rsquo;s Word. A person who wants to know God and touch God must come to the Bible. It is impossible to know God accurately without reading the Bible. A person cannot contact God without contacting the words in the Bible. God is the Word. Hence, man must read the Bible properly in order to know God, contact Him, and eat Him.</p>
<p>We can enjoy God through the Spirit. Everything created by God is balanced with two sides. God created man with a right foot and a left foot. Man also has two hands, two eyes, two ears, and two nostrils. Everything has two sides: a top and a bottom, a front and a back, a left and a right, and an inside and an outside. God wants man to enjoy Him as the Word and as the Spirit. The Word without the Spirit is dead letter. Therefore, God is the Word, and He is the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit and the Word cannot be separated. John 6:63 says, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit.&rdquo; During the exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt, a pillar of cloud was before them by day and a pillar of fire by night (Exo. 13:21-22). The pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud were not two things. At night this pillar shined like fire and was thus the pillar of fire. During the day it did not need to shine and was thus the pillar of cloud. The pillar of fire typifies the Word of God, and the pillar of cloud typifies the Spirit. God&rsquo;s Word is light and shines on us as a pillar of fire (Psa. 119:105, 130). The cloud is a symbol of the Spirit of God (Luke 1:35). The Holy Bible is the pillar of fire, and the Spirit is the pillar of cloud. Just as the pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud are one, so also the Bible and the Spirit are inseparable. The Bible that we read is in our hands, and the Spirit that we sense is within us. When the sense within is spoken forth, it is the word, and when this word enters into others, it becomes the Spirit. Without the Spirit, the Bible is dead, and without the Bible, the Holy Spirit is intangible. Without the Bible, the Spirit cannot be expressed. Without the Spirit, the words of the Bible are dry and dead; they cannot touch us.</p>
<p>We need to see that God is the Word and the Spirit and that He is in the Word and the Spirit. The Spirit and the Word are mingled and inseparable. It is difficult to say whether it is the Word that moves us or the Spirit who moves us. Under normal conditions the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Word. Therefore, the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit.&rdquo; The Bible conveys the Spirit, and the Spirit is the essence of the Bible. The greatest gifts that God has given to us are the Bible and the Spirit. God is the Word and also the Spirit. God is expressed in the Word and made real as the Spirit. Hence, we must learn to contact the Word and the Spirit with our spirit by reading the Bible and praying. Then we will enjoy God by eating and drinking Him.</p>
