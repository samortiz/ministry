   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BLAMELESS AND HARMLESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 15 says, "That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>. The word "that" at the beginning of verse 15 indicates a result, an issue.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because we think the one thing and enjoy God's working within us to work out our salvation and do not murmur or reason, we are blameless and harmless.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are like doves, not like scorpions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Murmuring is like the sting of a scorpion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever anyone murmurs, the poison is injected into someone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such murmuring ones are not harmless.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Consider how many people have been stung by their tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through their tongue the poison of death has been spread to many others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, they are not harmless.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, when we think the one thing we are blameless and harmless, for we have the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then, actually and in a practical way, we behave like children of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>SHINING AS LIGHTS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first part of verse 16 says, "Holding forth the word of life."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this generation we shine as lights.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not shine with our own light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, we are illuminators reflecting the light of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The world is a satanic system.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the midst of this organized satanic system, we shine as illuminators holding forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no need for us to behave.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We simply need to think the one thing in order to be full of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we shall be blameless, harmless children of God without rebuke, shining as luminaries in the midst of the satanic system of this perverse and crooked generation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we shine, we are holding forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not our conduct or behavior; it is our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Most of today's Christians are far off the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are taught to behave, to conduct themselves in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But there is no need for us to behave ourselves, because we are shining as lights and holding forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not behavior; it is a spontaneous testimony, the living out of the Christ whom we experience and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 16 also says, "That I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the Lord's servant can boast in us, then everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if he does not feel positively about us, then we are in difficulty.</S>
