   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. For Separation and Protection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although the wall is mainly for expression, spontaneously it also becomes a separation and a protection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It separates us from everything common 21:27 , protects us, and keeps us in the realm of God s appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Anything that is separated is also preserved and protected.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the church life we must have God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This divine expression is our separation, and this separation is our protection and preservation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we all express God, we shall be separated from anything worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is not a mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you live in this manner, you will have the full experience of what I am saying.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If I express God in the appearance of jasper, I shall be completely separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then I shall be protected, preserved, and kept in the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some are captured by the distractions of the world because they do not express God in the appearance of jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, they express something else.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we lose the divine expression and express something of ourselves in its place, our separation disappears, and we are no longer protected.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a result, we have no wall.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then there is no expression, no separation, and no protection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Praise the Lord that in the church life today our protection is the expression of God as our separation!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>XI.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>ITS FOUNDATIONS A. A City of Foundations</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we come to the foundations of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hebrews 11:10, speaking of Abraham, says, For he waited for the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Maker is God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The city of foundations, the New Jerusalem, was designed and made by God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord s recovery has a solid foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From the time the Lord s recovery was raised up among us more than fifty years ago, this testimony has been more and more solidly founded.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During my life I have seen many Christian groups come and go.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They were raised up and formed, and then they disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many of the free groups that began in this country some years ago are no longer in existence because they did not have a solid foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church, a city of foundations, is not designed by man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is both designed by God and built by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the churches in the Lord s recovery have been designed and built by God, not by man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because we have such a solid foundation, the more we are opposed and attacked, the more solidly founded we become.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>B. Of the Apostles,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No Longer of the Prophets</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 14 says, And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These foundations are not the foundation, which is Christ, according to 1 Corinthians 3:10-11.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They are the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today the church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Eph 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since in eternity there will be no further need of the prophets, the foundations of the holy city will consist only of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we enter into the new heaven and the new earth, all the four dispensations will have been completed, and there will be no need for prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everything will have been accomplished and fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The twelve apostles here represent the grace of the New Testament, signifying that the New Jerusalem is built upon the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The entrance to the holy city is according to the law of God, and the city is built upon the grace of God.</S>
