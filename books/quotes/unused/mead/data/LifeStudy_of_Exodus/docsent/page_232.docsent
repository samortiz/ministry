   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we may give a summary of the sundry ordinances of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These ordinances require a man to preserve human life, honor parents, keep marriage pure, to be just, fair, honest, faithful, trustworthy and kind, to care for the needy, not to be greedy for gain, but to be willing to give, and to be a holy man unto God, submitting to Him and His authority and serving Him through the offerings that he may feast with Him regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The ordinances in these chapters require us to preserve human life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Human life is a precious treasure in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not damage humanity in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God would not even allow an ox to go unpunished if it destroyed someone s life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The human life was created for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For this reason, nothing is more valuable and precious to God than human life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, God requires that we preserve human life as much as possible and in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The divine ordinances also require that we honor our parents, for parents represent God as the source of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Honoring our parents signifies honoring the source of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the reason the fifth commandment, concerning honoring of parents, is grouped with the first four commandments, which are related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, because marriage is for the continuation of human life and its propagation, marriage must be kept pure.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Preserving human life, honoring parents, and maintaining the purity of marriage are all according to God s plan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The ordinances in these chapters imply the human virtues of justice, fairness, honesty, faithfulness, trustworthiness, kindness, and care for the needy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They also indicate that instead of greed, we should have the willingness to give.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we preserve human life, honor parents, keep marriage pure, and have the human virtues implied in the ordinances, we shall be holy men submitting to God and to His deputy authority and serving Him through the offerings, which typify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The ultimate issue will be that we feast with God regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Exodus 23:14-17 speaks of three annual feasts: the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of harvest, and the feast of ingathering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The feast of unleavened bread was the continuation of the feast of Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Elsewhere the feasts of harvest and ingathering are called the feasts of Pentecost and tabernacles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to feast with God, God s people must be without leaven, and they also must sow in order to have a harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a result of sowing and reaping, we shall have a harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we keep the ordinances and have the human virtues, thereby becoming holy men submitting to God and serving Him with Christ, we shall enjoy Christ with God and in God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is to feast with God by enjoying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is our feast of unleavened bread, harvest, and ingathering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the typology of the ordinances in these chapters consummates with the full enjoyment of Christ with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As those who believe in Christ, our daily life should be without leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1 Corinthians 5 Paul tells us clearly to keep the feast without leaven, but to keep it with Christ as unleavened bread to be our life and our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we shall be able to grow something of Christ and reap Christ that we may enjoy Christ with God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The most significant aspect of the ordinances in these three chapters of Exodus is that in them Christ is typified by implication.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By keeping the ordinances we become those who are holy unto God and enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, the ultimate significance of the ordinances is that we may enjoy Christ with God, that we may feast on Christ with God and in the presence of God.</S>
