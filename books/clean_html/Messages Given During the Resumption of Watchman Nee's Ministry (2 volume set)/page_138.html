<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Whole Body Serving Being<br>the Greatest Recovery Today</H2><P>We have to see that if the one-talented ones do not rise up to serve, there is no way for the church to go on. The priesthood is a universal priesthood. This is the greatest recovery of this century. Many people think that the matter of service is the work of a few people, but true service is that in which the whole Body is involved. As long as this matter is not fully recovered, we have to go on speaking.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Loss and the Recovery of the Priesthood</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God Securing the Place of Rest through the Priests</H2><P>The priests are the ones who serve God. Those who serve God are called the priests. They may do a lot of other works, but none of those works can be considered true service. Only one thing is true service, and that is to dwell in the temple. In the Old Testament, there was the tabernacle. After the tabernacle, there was the temple. Within the temple, there was the dwelling of the priests. The book of Psalms mentions seven or eight times the matter of dwelling in the house of Jehovah. The work of the priests was to go to God on behalf of men and to go to men on behalf of God. In order for God to be among men, to dwell with men, and to find rest among men, He has to have the priests. Only when God secures the priests will He find a resting place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God Calling the Israelites<br>to Be a Kingdom of Priests</H2><P>The holy place and the priesthood are the twofold requirements of God. The work of the priests is to serve God, and the holy place is the dwelling place for the priests; it is also the dwelling place of God. Melchisedec was a priest of God. But he was alone, and he could not satisfy God. What God wants is a kingdom of priests. This is why He called out a people and brought them through the Red Sea into the wilderness. The purpose was to secure for Himself a kingdom of priests (Exo. 19:6). In God's eyes, God's people and the priesthood are one and the same thing. God desires that the whole nation of Israel be a priesthood. As long as a person is one of His people, he should be a priest. This is why Moses told Pharaoh, "Let my people go, that they may serve me" (Exo. 8:1; 9:1). Every one of God's people is there to serve God. As such, every one of them should be a priest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Israelites Having Failed,<br>the Priesthood Becoming the Special Privilege<br>of the Tribe of Levi</H2><P>The law is God's testimony. What the law gives to man is what man ought to give to God. The law is God's testimony for Himself. Whatever God says to man, man should say the same thing to God. The law says that the children of Israel should be a kingdom of priests. Yet before the law was passed on to the hands of the Israelites, while it was still in the hands of Moses, the Israelites had fallen and had worshipped the golden calf. After Moses came down from the mountain, he ordered all the men to kill their own brothers and sisters. The Levites did according to what Moses said and killed over three thousand people. As a result of this, God chose the tribe of Levi to be the priests (Exo. 32:1-28; Deut. 33:8-10). Originally, it was a kingdom of priests. Now only one out of twelve tribes was to be the priests. From that time on, apart from the tribe of Levi, no one had the right to be priests. In the book of Judges, even when men had money, they could only hire the Levites as priests for them; they themselves could not be priests. In the Old Testament, one king tried to be a priest and was smitten with leprosy (2 Chron. 26:16-20). All those who serve according to their own will, will be smitten. To serve God is both a privilege and a right.</P>
