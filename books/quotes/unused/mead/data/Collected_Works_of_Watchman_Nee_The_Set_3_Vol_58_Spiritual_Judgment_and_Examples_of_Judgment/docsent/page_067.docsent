   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 47 Date:August 27, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER C. S.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was saved in 1938.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For two years after I was saved, I was a prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I went into business in my own zeal but did not accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then I became sick for a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In desperation I knelt down to pray and confessed my sins with tears.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Later I went to Chefoo and was touched by Brother Lee when he spoke on the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I began to experience the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a result, I resolved to choose Jesus and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the time the Japanese surrendered, I also surrendered myself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord lives for me, and the brothers and sisters also lived for me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They sold their possessions, lent me money, and helped my business.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Later I was able to return all the money.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I was in a bread-breaking meeting in Peking, I saw the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I knew that I could not live without the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As soon as I live unto myself, I lose my peace, but as soon as I live to the Lord, my peace comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brother Sun is a frank and zealous person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His words are bold, and he loves God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His pathway in the past has been straight.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are two ways in front of our brother.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These two ways will result in two different kinds of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today I can advise Brother Sun to take either of these two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One is to soften himself before God and to restrain his speaking a little.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This will cool our brother down a little and bridle his tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once his tongue is bridled, his spirit will be purified.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if our brother takes this advice, he may lose his zeal as well as his boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now he is released, but if he restrains himself, his thoughts may not be able to meet his needs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now he is released, and his spirit is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These factors somewhat mitigate the poverty in his thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If he restrains himself, his spirit will not be as strong, and his thoughts will not be able to meet his needs.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The other advice I can give to our brother is to tell him to continue to be strong, zealous, released, and bold.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is a delicate thing to help the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The responsibility is great.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is always the danger of emphasizing one thing while neglecting something else.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we advise him to be zealous, bold, and released, we must tell him that he must also match these things with a greater and purer spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But how can such a matching be accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I do not have a ready answer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I will instead point out a way the way of passing from death to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The way that I will point out is the way of passing through death to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all know that Peter was a strong and bold person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His words could influence others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was a born leader.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet he had not learned the adequate lessons before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God allowed him to fail miserably, even to the point of denying the Lord in front of a maid.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then his boldness was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A man who had boasted that he would die for the Lord denied Him with a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After the Lord resurrected, He went to Peter and restored him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He asked Peter three times, "Do you love Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Peter had lost all of his confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yet he passed through death to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At Pentecost he was the one among the twelve disciples who stood up to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It was he who spoke at the Beautiful Gate in the temple to the lame man, saying, "Stand up and walk."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was he who spoke at the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How bold he was when he spoke!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Moses in the Old Testament was an able speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yet at first he only had a fleshly boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He killed an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He was dealt with by the Egyptians and ran away into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After a long period of time, he became weak.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When God called him, he had lost all confidence in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He once considered himself very qualified to save the people of Israel, but when God sent him to Pharaoh, he was reluctant to take up the commission.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He said that he was slow in speech.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God comforted him and told him that Aaron would be his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Yet in Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy, we do not hear Aaron speaking; Moses always did the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The stories of both Peter and Moses show us that something died within them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, there was also something that did not die, something which rose from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If everything had died, there would have been no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, if everything remained alive, there would have been no death.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Resurrection means passing through death but not being held by death.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Something comes out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Moses died completely to his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He said that he was slow in speech.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In resurrection, however, he did all the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When the Lord asked Peter, "Do you love Me?", Peter dared not answer.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It seemed as if everything had died.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Yet eventually this same Peter fed the Lord's lambs and loved Him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we bury a book in the ground, it will remain there until the Lord comes back; it will remain dead.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we bury a seed in the ground, however, part of it will die, but part of it will not die.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The part that does not die will sprout because it has life in it.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The same principle applies to those who have God's life; there is a part in them which will not die.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This part is the resurrection life, the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Resurrection means allowing the parts that can die to die and allowing the parts that will not die to live.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In Brother Sun's case, if by weakening himself a little, he ends up being truly weakened, we could only say that there is death but no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Therefore, it is not a simple thing to exhort others to accept the dealings of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If a brother who is full of the flesh is dealt with, everything with him will be terminated; nothing will remain, because everything will have died.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If anything in him is after God's will, it will remain after passing through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Some are very zealous in the work, in the gospel, and in their love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But as soon as they are dealt with, they sink into the ground and give up everything.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Yet in Peter and Moses, we see many things which did not die.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>They passed through the cross and came out on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>What emerges from resurrection is something totally different because it bears the mark of the cross; something fresh and living emerges that is pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We can exhort Brother Sun to accept the cross so that his natural strong points can be eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Anything in him that passes through death and resurrection will be accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He still will be as bold and zealous as before, but it will be accompanied by the wound of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Some people have said that those who are good at conducting revival meetings in the denominations become powerless and quiet once they join us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We need to ask such ones how much of what they have is beyond death.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is a good test.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Peter's boldness after his experience of death and resurrection was many times greater than his boldness before death.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Previously, he was afraid of a little maid.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>But eventually he was not afraid of even Roman soldiers and prison.</S>
