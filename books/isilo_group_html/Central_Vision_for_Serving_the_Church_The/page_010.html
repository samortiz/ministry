<p>An elder who was a businessman in America once warned me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you must be careful. If you teach the American brothers all these points about the eldership, they may begin to ignore you.&rdquo; His words exposed that he was fully in the flesh. He had only a mental understanding of the church. It was no wonder that he was lacking in life and had not borne any fruit in the church. He thought that the way to maintain control of the eldership was to not teach anyone the &ldquo;secrets&rdquo; of being an elder. Although I said nothing, I knew he was finished. An elder should never be afraid of people rejecting him after they have been perfected by him. If an elder holds on to such a thought, he is finished. Many do not have fruit because of such a thought. Once this thought is present, a person is absolutely in the flesh. If we are in the spirit, we will not care for position. If the Lord wants us to be an elder, we will be an elder, but if we scheme to hold on to a position by not perfecting the brothers, we are not in the spirit. When we are not in the spirit, we have no fruit. We should yearn for others to be more capable and better.</p>
<p>Jealousy is also a problem when a person is not in the spirit. Sometimes when elders work on a matter together, one of them has a desire to do everything, and there is jealousy when another elder is given responsibility. No one is without jealousy; consequently, we must learn to live in the spirit. The result of every arrangement is in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. No matter what the result is, we should be concerned only with whether or not we are living in the spirit. If all the elders are living in the spirit, their leading will produce fruit. Fruit is produced only when we are in the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Removing Subjective, Preconceived Notions and<br />
the Tendency to Hold On to Old Things</h2>
<p>We also are subjective and tend to hold on to old things. We think that what was done in the past should never be changed. However, according to the Bible and the history of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, God never stays with things that are old. In Genesis God&rsquo;s work among men progressively advanced. In the first generation Adam was shown the way of salvation (3:21). In the second generation Abel presented offerings for fellowship with God (4:4). In the third generation Enosh began to call on the name of the Lord (v. 26). In the seventh generation Enoch walked with God (5:22), and in the tenth generation Noah received revelation from God concerning the building of the ark (6:13-16). God&rsquo;s work in man advances with every generation.</p>
<p>Some say that we are speaking about things today that Brother Nee never spoke of when he was alive. Such criticism is inevitable because, since the time of Brother Nee&rsquo;s imprisonment in 1952, the Lord has indeed given us new light. We should realize, however, that Brother Nee gained new understandings of the truth while he was ministering. For example, his book <em>The Assembly Life,</em> which was published in 1934, was edited from a Bible study that he had with co-workers in January 1934. In this book he said that there are no apostles today and that no one could appoint elders. He spoke of &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; apostles who appointed &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; elders and of the various local assemblies as being &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; churches.</p>
<p>Three years later in 1937, Brother Nee saw further light and released messages on the line of Antioch at a co-workers&rsquo; meeting in Hankow. Those messages are compiled in the book <em>The Normal Christian Church Life,</em> in which Brother Nee boldly said that there are apostles today and that an apostle is one who is sent by God to establish churches and appoint elders. He also said that the various local assemblies on the proper ground are churches. In less than three years his understanding had changed completely.</p>
<p>Another example of change involved the matter of sisters functioning in the meetings. When I was in Shanghai in 1933, Brother Nee felt that it was a great loss for the sisters to not be able to open their mouths in the meetings. We were under the influence of the Brethren, and the sisters could not open their mouths to testify or even pray in the meetings. They could only attend the meetings and sing along with the brothers. Brother Nee, however, studied the Scriptures, and he eventually felt that the sisters should be allowed to pray in the meetings. However, some brothers, who were influenced by the Brethren, did not approve.</p>
<p>One day Brother Nee said to me, &ldquo;Witness, when the sisters do not open their mouths in the meeting, the meeting is like a half-paralyzed body.&rdquo; At that time the brothers and sisters sat completely apart from each other. Therefore, all the prayers came from the brothers&rsquo; side, while the sisters&rsquo; side remained silent. The meeting truly resembled a half-paralyzed body. Because I was influenced by the Brethren and even by northern Chinese concepts, I felt that women should not stand out in the meetings. Only after Brother Nee spent much time to pray, wait, and fellowship did it become acceptable for the sisters to pray in the meetings and then only barely. Even then the sisters could not stand up to speak; they could only pray in the meetings. If the sisters wanted to speak, they had to speak in a separate meeting of just sisters.</p>
<p>Ruth Lee and Peace Wang were two very gifted sisters among us. Whenever they spoke, people were touched, and everyone loved their fellowship. Sister Lee and Sister Wang helped many people in various places, and even the brothers desired to hear their supplying fellowship. Consequently, there was soon another change. The sisters were encouraged to open their mouth to speak in the meetings, but they could not give messages or speak with a teaching tone; they could only give personal testimonies. The brothers were separated from the sisters by a folding screen so that the brothers could sit behind the screen and listen to the sisters.</p>
<p>There were also changes in the work. For example, when we visited the churches in the Fukien and Kwangtung Provinces in 1948, Brother Nee fellowshipped on the line of Jerusalem. When he spoke on the line of Antioch in 1937, he wanted the co-workers to spread to different places. Once a church was established in a locality, he charged the co-workers to go to another place. Eleven years later, however, when he spoke on the line of Jerusalem, he wanted the co-workers to stay. There have been numerous changes even among us.</p>
<p>The revelation of the Bible is always advancing; this is the case in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Gospel of John speaks of the Lord Jesus as a Lamb (1:29), whereas Revelation speaks of Him as a Lion (5:5). In the Gospels the Lord Jesus has two eyes, but in Revelation He is revealed as having seven eyes that are like a flame of fire (5:6; 1:14). The Lord is living; He is still working today, and His work and leading are progressive. It is the same with the history of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Beginning with Luther&rsquo;s recovery of justification by faith, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has advanced; no two ages are the same. If we preached only justification by faith today, we would be quite outdated.</p>
<p>If we are still meeting according to the way that we met thirty-five years ago&mdash;gathering in the Lord&rsquo;s name, calling a hymn after everyone arrives, having some prayer, remembering the Lord, giving thanks for the bread and the cup, and then worshipping the Father&mdash;and every part of our meeting is according to ritual, the saints will lose interest because the meetings are not up to date. There was once a co-worker who opposed pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord. He was determined to continue to preach as he had always preached. Eventually, however, his way was rejected and he left. Then the saints began to call on the name of the Lord, and everyone was released. Pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord are part of the flow in this age, and a flow cannot be stopped when it comes. The co-workers and elders should not be subjective. Neither should they stay with the old things or follow a crowd blindly; they should learn to live in the spirit. The spirit will spontaneously lead us to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name and pray-read His Word. Today some elders are not up to date, and others are neither solid nor stable, because they are following only in a casual way.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Vision for Serving the Church &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
