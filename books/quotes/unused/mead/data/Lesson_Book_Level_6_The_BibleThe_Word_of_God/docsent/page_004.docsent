   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ORIGIN OF THE BIBLE A. The Bible Being God-breathed</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Scripture is God-breathed 2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This tells us that the Scripture did not come out of man s thought, man s mind, but rather, it is God s breathing His thought and His word through His Spirit into and out of the writers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the Bible contains God s elements and carries His flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As Christians, our greatest joy, or shall we say, our greatest blessing, is to be able to contact God and taste Him daily through the word of His breath.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>B. The Bible Being the Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>from God by Men Borne</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>by the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since the Scripture is God s breathing His word out from men through His Spirit, no word of the Scripture can be of man s will; rather, men were borne by the Spirit and spoke out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word, men spoke from God, being borne by the Holy Spirit 2 Pet 1:21 , has a twofold meaning: first, men were borne by the Spirit; second, men spoke from God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the original Greek, being borne by the Holy Spirit means being carried along as a ship by the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The writers of the Bible received God s inspiration, and they were under the power of the Holy Spirit, being borne and carried along by Him to speak out God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, when they spoke, they spoke from within God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was the Spirit of God carrying men along to speak, and it was also men speaking from within God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, it was God speaking His own word from within men through their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second Samuel 23:2 says, The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This word was spoken by David.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He told us that the words he spoke were the speaking of the Spirit of God through him, and that it was God s word that was in his tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only the Holy Spirit spoke through him, but also God s word was in his tongue and was spoken from his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>C. The Bible Being God s Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>in the Prophets and in the Son</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Old Testament is God s speaking in the prophets; the New Testament is God s speaking in the Son, our Lord Jesus Heb 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, whether it is the speaking of the prophets in the Old Testament or the speaking of the Lord Jesus in the New Testament, both are God s speaking and both are of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>D. The Bible Being the Holy Spirit s Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John 16:13 says, But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come John 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord s word here also proves that after the Spirit s descension, what His disciples spoke and wrote was disclosed to them by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, the Lord s word here proves that after His ascension, all the books of the New Testament, written by His disciples, were of the Spirit s revelation and their divine authority was acknowledged by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Scripture, therefore, is the word written by men under God s command Exo 34:27 , the word of the Spirit of God spoken through men, the word of God spoken through man s mouth 2 Sam 23:2 , and the word spoken by men who were moved by the Spirit Mark 12:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Old Testament is the word spoken by the prophets under God s command Jer 1:7 , the word of God coming upon the prophet Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>1:3 , and the word of the Spirit of God spoken through the prophets Zech 7:7; Acts 3:18; 28:25; Rom 1:2; 1 Pet 1:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some portions of the New Testament are God s speaking in the Lord Jesus John 14:10 , while other portions are words written by the apostles as taught by the Spirit 1 Cor 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The words written by the apostles as taught by the Spirit are as sacred as the Old Testament Scriptures 2 Pet 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, the entire Bible originates from God; every word and every sentence, every iota and every tittle Matt 5:18 , are God-inspired.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, men should neither add to or take away anything from the Holy Scriptures Rev 22:18-19 .</S>
