By Partaking of Christ as<br>the Lamb of the Passover and<br>the Unleavened Bread<br>that We May Become a New Lump</H2><P>We enjoy Christ also by partaking of Christ as the Lamb of the Passover and the unleavened bread that we may become a new lump (1 Cor. 5:7-8). The Passover lamb was for redemption and initial feeding. The Israelites took the lamb, slew it, shed its blood, and cut the meat of the lamb into pieces. The blood of the lamb was for the redemption of the Israelites, and the meat of the lamb was their food. After the Passover, they had to immediately walk out of Egypt. In order to walk out of Egypt they needed strength, and their eating of the lamb supplied them with the needed strength.</P><P>The Passover lamb was eaten with unleavened bread (Exo. 12:8). According to their constitution, the children of Israel were completely leavened; that is, they were constituted sinners (Rom. 5:19a). But after their eating of the Passover lamb with the unleavened bread, they were cleansed and began to have an unleavened constitution. This change in constitution came about because of the change in their diet.</P><P>From the time of our regeneration we began to have a new constitution. Christ as the unleavened bread became our unleavened food to reconstitute us, so that we may become a new lump. Before regeneration, we were the old lump, full of leaven. But now we have become a new lump, because we are becoming unleavened. This new lump is the church.</P><P>In Leviticus 23 two loaves of bread baked with leaven were presented to the Lord on the day of Pentecost (vv. 15-17). These two loaves signify the church in two sections, one section being of the Jews, represented by the Jews at Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4), and the other section being of the Gentiles, represented by the house of Cornelius (10:24, 44). The two loaves included leaven because both the Jewish and Gentile believers still have sin. By eating Christ as the unleavened bread, we become unleavened. We must eat Christ as the Lamb and as the unleavened bread. As the Lamb He is for our strengthening and support. As the unleavened bread He causes us to be unleavened constitutionally, making us a new lump.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. By Being Joined to the Lord as One Spirit</H2><P>We enjoy Christ also by being joined to the Lord as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). First Corinthians 6:17 is one of the highest verses in the entire Bible. Today we as fallen human beings can become one spirit with the Lord. Although this may seem difficult to believe, it is nevertheless a fact. Because Paul wrote such a word in his Epistle, we must believe that we are one spirit with the Lord, who is the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound, indwelling, processed, and consummated Spirit. Because we are one spirit with Him, we experience His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. This is the way to enjoy Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_108.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_110.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation &nbsp; pg 109</div><br></body></html>
