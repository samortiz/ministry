   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT THE SIGNS IN JOHN TEN 2 Scripture Reading: John 10:1-39</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing message we saw from chapter ten the significance of the sheep vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>3-5, 27 , the sheepfold vv.</S>

   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2, 7, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let us now go on to consider other signs in this chapter of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE GOOD SHEPHERD</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The good shepherd is Christ, who laid down His psuche life for His sheep so that they may have the zoe life and may have it abundantly vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2, 10-11, 14-15, 17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 10:11 the Lord Jesus says concerning Himself, "I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 14 the Lord goes on to say, "I am the good shepherd, and I know My own, and My own know Me."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the good Shepherd, the Lord laid down His life on behalf of the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today the Lord is still our Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is important for us to realize that the Lord shepherds us not in the way of outward activity, but that He shepherds us inwardly in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that the Lord shepherds us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Inwardly we have Him as our Shepherd, as a Shepherd of life and in life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How does the Lord Jesus shepherd us?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He shepherds us in life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 10 proves that the Lord Jesus shepherds us in the way of life: "I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus is the good Shepherd to impart Himself as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He laid down His psuche life so that the sheep may have His zoe life, and now He is shepherding us in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We thank the Lord that Christ is our Shepherd and that we all are His sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we need to see that the Lord shepherds us by being life to us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We enjoy His shepherding when we live by Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, the Lord lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the other hand, we live in Him, by Him, with Him, and through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we live in the Lord in this way, we are under His shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we are under the Lord's shepherding, there will be a life consciousness within us and also an instruction, a guidance, in life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The life within us, which is actually Christ Himself, will indicate that the Lord intends to lead us in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, a young brother may want to participate in a certain form of worldly entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, through the life consciousness within him he may realize that the Lord is not leading him to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This life consciousness with its leading and instruction is an indication that this brother is under the Lord's shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The sisters need to experience Christ's shepherding in their shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Shopping can be perilous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose a sister is eager for the opportunity to go shopping on a coming Saturday.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The peril is that in her shopping she may fail to be in Christ and fail to be under His shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Throughout the week this sister may remain under the Lord's shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But while she is shopping on Saturday she may come out from under this shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then on the Lord's Day morning she may struggle to come back to the Lord, seeking mercy and grace from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In her shopping she lived in herself and by herself; she did not live in, with, by, and through the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In a very real sense, she was her own shepherd, and shepherded herself in an unruly way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The real Shepherd is the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As our Shepherd, the Lord not only gives us life He also is life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The living of the Lord within us is actually His living shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, the Lord Jesus shepherds us by being life to us and by living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to use verse 10 as the key to interpreting every matter in chapter ten.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this verse the Lord says that He came that we may have life, the divine life, and that we may have it abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This life is related to the door, the Shepherd, and the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As long as we have Christ as life within us and we enjoy and experience Him as life, we shall have Him as the door, the Shepherd, and the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The door will be our freedom, and the pasture will be our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Shepherd, who is life to us, leads us, guides us, and directs us in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, we should not be directed by anything outward, but instead should be directed inwardly by Christ who is life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This Christ is our Shepherd, our Guide.</S>
