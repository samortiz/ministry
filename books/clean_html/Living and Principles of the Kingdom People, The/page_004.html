<h2 class="head2">Being Meek</h2>
<p>A person who is poor in spirit, who hungers and thirsts for God, and who mourns is also meek. Someone who is complacent in spirit and does not mourn is not meek. A hot temper and resistance are the opposite of meekness. In Matthew 5:5 the Lord said, &ldquo;Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.&rdquo; Meekness means not being resistant and not being hot-tempered. It is easy to be hot-tempered and resistant when someone strikes us. A person can be both hot-tempered and resistant, but resistance does not necessarily include a hot temper. In contrast, a person who is not resistant will not be hot-tempered. In Matthew 5 through 7 the Lord does not want us to be resistant. If someone slaps us on our right cheek, we should turn to him the other cheek; if someone wishes to take our tunic, we should yield our cloak to him also; and if someone compels us to go one mile, we should go two miles with him (5:39-41).</p>
<p>The Lord promised that the meek will inherit the earth. After the fall of man, people must contend with one another in order to inherit the physical earth. Those who are stronger and better at contending gain more of the earth. A person who lives under the rule of the heavens and who does not contend or resist will not inherit the earth today. Others will take even what he has. However, the Lord said that those who live under the rule of the heavens neither contend nor resist but will inherit the earth. This inheriting must refer to the reward in the coming kingdom.</p>
<p>According to Hebrews 2, God in His ordination did not subject the coming world to angels but to man (vv. 5-7). Those who inherit the earth in the coming kingdom will not be the ones who are contending for earthly things today, nor will they be resistant; instead, they will be meek. They will not gain by contending but by inheriting.</p>
<p>The words <em>the earth</em> in Matthew 5:5 do not refer to the world with its material enjoyment. People do not seek the kingdom of the heavens today, because they are occupied by the world. Someone who is poor in spirit and seeks God mourns because he has not gained enough God and because he is not under God&rsquo;s rule. As a result, he regards the earth in this age as dung. He does not contend with or resist the people of the world, because he does not want the world. The Lord&rsquo;s promise in this verse shows that in order to inherit the coming earth, we must forsake the present world. In other words, those who want to receive the kingdom must forsake the world.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Hungry and Thirsty for Righteousness</h2>
<p>Being poor in spirit, mourning, and being meek are three general conditions of the heart of the kingdom people. These general conditions belong to one group. The following three conditions are specific and speak of the attitude that the kingdom people should have toward themselves, toward others, and toward God.</p>
<p>The first specific condition of the heart is to hunger and thirst for righteousness. Matthew 5:6 says, &ldquo;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.&rdquo; This verse speaks of the attitude that one who lives in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens should have toward himself. He should be righteous and desire righteousness. He should hunger and thirst for righteousness. He should not do anything that would let others down, nor should he be indebted to others in anything.</p>
<p>People in the world are unrighteous and indebted to others because they do not seek the rule of the heavens by hungering and thirsting for righteousness. For example, in buying and selling, a buyer wants the price of something to be as low as possible, and the seller wants it to be as high as possible. Both want to take advantage of the other. They are prepared to use any means necessary, including lying and cheating, in order to take advantage of the other and make a profit. This is to take advantage of others, not to seek righteousness. When people hunger and thirst for profit, they set aside righteousness.</p>
<p>Regrettably, many Christians also take advantage of others. Brothers in the church in Corinth went to court with one another because they both sought to take advantage of the other (1 Cor. 6:6); they did not seek righteousness. Two brothers might be neighbors or colleagues, but both may try to get the upper hand. It is grievous for Christians to seek to take advantage of others.</p>
<p>A person who lets the heavens rule does not seek to take advantage of others. He would rather that others would be indebted to him than that he would be indebted to others. He earnestly hungers and thirsts for righteousness. Others may be satisfied with a gain, but he is not satisfied when he is unrighteous, because he hungers and thirsts for righteousness. Such hunger and thirst force him to desire and seek righteousness, just as being poor in spirit forces someone to seek God.</p>
<p>Someone who is poor in spirit takes God as the object, but one who is hungry and thirsty in his heart takes God&rsquo;s righteousness as the goal. We are poor in spirit because we seek God, but we hunger and thirst in our heart because we desire righteousness. God is our inward satisfaction, and righteousness is our outward living. When we are poor in spirit, we gain God. When our heart hungers and thirsts, we gain righteousness.</p>
<p>We should not think that it is sufficient to be poor in spirit and seek God. If we are genuinely poor in spirit and seek God, we will eventually hunger and thirst in our heart for righteousness. Although God is man&rsquo;s satisfaction, we will not be satisfied if we seek God but do not seek righteousness. We must have God within and righteousness without. Then we will have true satisfaction. Therefore, the Lord said, &ldquo;Those who hunger and thirst for righteousness...shall be satisfied&rdquo; (Matt. 5:6).</p>
<p>Many saints seek the Lord and serve God zealously. However, they are unrighteous in their living. Furthermore, they have no feeling about their unrighteousness and do not deal with it. This is to deviate, and it is wrong. The Lord wants us to seek God and to be strict with ourselves. Righteousness is an important aspect of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. No unrighteous person can partake of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. Only those who seek God and also seek righteousness can partake of the kingdom of the heavens and be satisfied.</p>
