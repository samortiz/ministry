<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. As the High Priest<br>Bearing and Embracing God's Redeemed People</H2><P>In the Old Testament the high priest wore the shoulder plates and the breastplate. This typifies Christ as the High Priest bearing and embracing in love God's redeemed people (Heb. 4:14-15; 7:25-26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. As All the Offerings for the Believers</H2><P>The Old Testament typifies and the New Testament reveals that Christ is all the offerings for the believers (Heb. 10:5-7, 9-10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. As the Sabbath<br>and All the Feasts to the Believers</H2><P>The books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers have much to say concerning the Sabbath and the feasts. These typify Christ as the reality of the Sabbath and of all the feasts to the believers (Col. 2:16-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. As the Real Nazarite Living Absolutely for God</H2><P>Numbers 6 speaks of the Nazarite vow. Christ is the real Nazarite living absolutely for God (Phil. 2:8; Heb. 10:9; cf. Matt. 2:23 and note 2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. As the Red Heifer<br>for the Washing of the Believers' Uncleanness</H2><P>Christ is also the reality of the type of the red heifer for the washing of the believers' uncleanness (1 John 1:7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. As the Brass Serpent<br>to Take Away the Sin of the Believers<br>That They May Have Eternal Life</H2><P>John 3:14 and 15 reveal that Christ is the brass serpent to take away the sin of the believers that they may have eternal life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. As the Cities of Refuge for the Believers</H2><P>Today we may also enjoy Christ as the One who is the cities of refuge for the believers (Eph. 1:7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>13. As the All-inclusive Land<br>with the Bountiful Supply for the Believers</H2><P>Finally, Christ is the all-inclusive land with the bountiful supply for the believers (Col. 1:12; Eph. 3:8; Phil. 1:19). This is for the building up of the house of God on earth (Eph. 2:19; 1 Tim. 3:15), for the establishing of the kingdom of God on earth (Acts 1:3; Rom. 14:17), and, ultimately, for the consummation of the house of God and the kingdom of God as the New Jerusalem in eternity for the fulfillment of God's eternal economy (Rev. 21:1-2). Therefore, what is portrayed concerning the church in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers will have its ultimate consummation in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.</P>
