   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>C. The background: Ephesians has a specific position in the order of the books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It has been placed in the right position, immediately after the revelation concerning Christ versus religion Galatians , followed by the practical experience of Christ Philippians , and leading to the Head Colossians .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Galatians we see the matter of Christ versus religion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not replace Christ with anything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that it should not be our emotion versus religion or our practice versus religion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It must be Christ versus religion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ephesians comes after this revelation of Christ versus religion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The matter of Christ versus religion leads us to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is not versus religion merely for our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That is the improper emphasis of the so-called inner life people who seek Christ, not for the church, but for their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is versus religion for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The very Christ who is versus religion is not primarily for our experience, but for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Galatians 2:20 says that we have been crucified with Christ and that Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This experience must be for the church life.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Strictly speaking, God is not seeking a spiritual church, a heavenly church, nor even a victorious church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He wants a church of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Glory is the expression of God and it is altogether different from human morality and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>E. The general sketch: Ephesians covers seven aspects of the church: the church as the Body, the new man, the kingdom, the family, the dwelling place, the wife, and the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What we do does not mean very much, but what we are means a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In such a church as described in Ephesians Christ is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through such a church Christ, the Person, is lived out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In such a church there is the kingdom of God with rights and responsibilities and the family of God with life and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This church is also God s dwelling place, Christ s satisfaction, and God s warrior fighting the battle for His eternal purpose.</S>
