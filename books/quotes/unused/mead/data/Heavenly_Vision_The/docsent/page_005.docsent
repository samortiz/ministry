   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR NEED FOR THE VISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need the vision, and we should pray much that we may have the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not adequate merely to learn how to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we only learn certain things, what we learn will become something traditional and religious.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is good to learn something, but we need the vision to change what we have learned into something else.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I would ask you to pray that the Lord would grant you certain visions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, we need the vision of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all need to see Christ, not merely have the knowledge about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We also need the vision of the church, the vision of the Body, the vision of the self, and the vision of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Regarding the self, we need a vision of the self so that the self may be exposed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may have much knowledge about Christ, the church, the Body, the self, and the world, but mere knowledge about these matters does not mean anything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, a sinful person may have a lot of knowledge about the gospel, yet he is still not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only when what this sinner knows becomes a vision will he be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is the vision, not the knowledge, that saves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A person may be told how sinful he is and how evil his heart is, and others may point out his shortcomings to him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But even then he is not convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He knows about these things, but he is not saved because as yet there is no vision.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One day the vision comes to him, and under that vision he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The principle is the same with hearing about Christ, the church, the Body, the self, and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only when we have the vision of Christ, the church, the Body, the self, and the world will we have the reality of what we have heard.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once we have reality we will have deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>ASPECTS OF THE VISION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us now go on to consider some aspects of the vision of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ Being the Center of God's Eternal Plan</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need the vision of Christ to see that He is the center of God's eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In addition, Christ is the center of all things belonging to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ Being the Embodiment of the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is the very embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all know this, but to know is one thing and to have the vision of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is another thing.</S>
