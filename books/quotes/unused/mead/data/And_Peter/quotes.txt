[1]  I told the Lord that I would die for Him, and the Lord said that before the cock crowed twice, I would deny Him three times.
[2]  It may be very easy for you not to love Him, draw near to Him, or return to Him; but it is impossible for Him to forget you, forsake you, or not love you.
[3]  Therefore, if you do not have the strength to come to the Lord, as long as you are willing to believe in His words, He will give you the strength to draw near to Him.
[4]  Although it seems that you will not be able to draw near to Him anymore, remember in faith the words "and Peter," and you will be able to draw near to Him.
[5]  When you want to come close to the Lord, but feel that you are very far from Him and have no strength to come near to Him, you need to remember the words "and Peter."
