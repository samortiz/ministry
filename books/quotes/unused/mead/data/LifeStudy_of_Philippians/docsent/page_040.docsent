   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SATISFYING GOD AND MAKING HIM HAPPY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As a result of their experience of Christ and enjoyment of Christ, the believers have a constitution which Paul terms faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the eyes of God, this faith is so excellent, beautiful, and marvelous that He considers it a sacrifice offered to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul, after experiencing the Lord for so many years, especially during his imprisonment, became a constitution of heavenly wine that could cheer God and make Him happy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The sacrifice of the believers faith was satisfying to God, and the drink offering was cheering to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, the drink offering is a cheering offering presented in addition to a satisfying sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The sacrifices were very satisfying to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Old Testament, the one who offered the drink offering presented something which, in type, came not from the flock or the herd, but out of himself and his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the New Testament we see that through his personal enjoyment of Christ and experience of Him, Paul became cheering wine poured out before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His experience of Christ constituted him into wine to make God happy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 2:16 Paul expresses his concern about laboring in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to verse 17, Paul realized that his labor among the Philippians had not been in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He knew that their faith was the basic offering upon which he could pour out himself as a drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The words if even I am poured out as a drink offering indicate that Paul thought of himself as one who was continually being sacrificed for his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His use of the word even suggests that he was sacrificed to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He considered martyrdom as a pouring out of himself upon the sacrifice of the believers faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From the human point of view, Paul eventually was slain.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But from Paul s viewpoint, martyrdom was the pouring out of himself as a drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Throughout the years, he had continually been sacrificing himself for his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, it was not until the time of martyrdom that he was poured out to the uttermost as a drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although Paul had made great sacrifices, he had not poured himself out in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now if even he was poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and priestly service of the believers faith, he could rejoice together with them all.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul s word here is very touching.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I can testify that time and time again I have been deeply touched by his word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here Paul implies that he was always a sacrifice for his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We who serve the churches and minister Christ to the saints must learn of Paul to become a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If there is no sacrifice, there can be no ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not think that the more we sacrifice, the greater will be our reward.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ministry is a matter of sacrifice, not of compensation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, we need to reach the point where we can say that even if we are poured out as a drink offering, we shall be happy and rejoice together with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>MUTUAL REJOICING</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is significant that Paul says, I rejoice and rejoice together with you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The reason he speaks of rejoicing and then of rejoicing together with the saints is that two constitutions are involved: the faith of the believers as one constitution, and the apostle as a drink offering as the other.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the pouring out of the drink offering, these two constitutions answer to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not possible for there to be rejoicing on one side, but not on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The apostle rejoices, and the believers respond by rejoicing with him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This was the reason Paul could say, And in like manner you also rejoice and rejoice together with me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not normal for one of two parties to rejoice and the other not to respond with rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you rejoice before a living person, that person should respond with rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here in 2:17 and 18 both parties, Paul and the believers, were rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Paul rejoiced, the believers responded with rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who had the constitution of faith rejoiced with the one who had been constituted into a drink offering poured out upon this faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What a marvelous interchange there was between Paul and the believers in Philippi!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What a wonderful fellowship and communication!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the one hand, Paul said, I rejoice and rejoice together with you all.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the other hand, he said, You also rejoice and rejoice together with me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What a marvelous situation with everyone rejoicing together!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may be amazed that Paul s approaching martyrdom was a cause of rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul expected that the Philippians would share their joy with him by congratulating him in his martyrdom for the sake of their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul s martyrdom became a situation filled with rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This was made possible by the fact that with the believers there was the constitution of faith, and with Paul there was the constitution of the drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As we have indicated, neither of these constitutions can be produced in a quick way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It takes much time to develop them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this message we have seen that the drink offering is an offering additional to the basic offerings; that the basic offerings typify various aspects of Christ; that the drink offering is a type of Christ enjoyed by the one offering Him, an offering that fills the offerer with Christ as heavenly wine and makes him wine to God; and that the apostle became such a drink offering through the enjoyment of Christ so that he could be poured out upon the sacrifice of the believers faith.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The faith of the Philippian believers was considered by Paul a sacrifice he offered to God as a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to Romans 15:16, Paul viewed himself as a priest offering the Gentile believers to God as an acceptable sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Furthermore, the service of the Philippian believers was also considered by Paul to be a sacrifice, and Paul s offering ministry was considered a priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to 2:17 and 18, Paul and the believers in Philippi rejoiced mutually, sharing their joy with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Paul rejoiced to pour himself out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice of the believers faith, and he shared his joy with them in his martyrdom over their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then the Philippian believers rejoiced in Paul s drink offering and even congratulated him in his martyrdom for the sake of their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Actually, the believers response of rejoicing was a kind of congratulation offered to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>TWO PEAKS IN THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The two constitutions we see here that of the believers with respect to their faith and that of Paul with respect to his becoming a drink offering represent two peaks of the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the side of the believers, there is the peak of faith, and on the side of the apostle there is the peak of martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This martyrdom was Paul s pouring out of himself as a drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As one who loved the Lord Jesus and enjoyed Him to the uttermost, Paul was eventually constituted by Christ into heavenly wine poured out as a drink offering unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How meaningful and how marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Both Paul and the saints in Philippi could respond to each other with rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Paul rejoiced over the believers, and the believers rejoiced over Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This mutual rejoicing was also a mutual congratulation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They congratulated one another for their success.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Paul congratulated the believers for their success in faith, and they congratulated him in his success in martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Here in this mutual rejoicing and congratulation we see two peaks of the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>May we all go on until we arrive at these peaks in our experience and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
