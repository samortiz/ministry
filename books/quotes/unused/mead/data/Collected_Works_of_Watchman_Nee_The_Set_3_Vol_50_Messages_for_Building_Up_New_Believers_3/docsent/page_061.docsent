   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BREAKING AND CONSTITUTING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord causes many things to come our way, few of which are according to our preference.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is why the Bible charges, "Rejoice in the Lord always" Phil 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should rejoice in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the only way we can rejoice always.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Besides the Lord, what can make us rejoice always?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why does God allow all the bad things to come upon us?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is His purpose for doing these things?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His goal is to break down our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we read Jeremiah 48:11, we will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jeremiah 48:11 says, "Moab has been at ease from his youth;/And he is settled on his lees/And has not been emptied from vessel to vessel;/Nor has he gone into exile./Therefore his taste remains in him,/And his scent is not changed."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Moabites were the descendants of Lot Gen 19:36-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They were related to Abraham but were of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moab was at ease from his youth and never experienced any tribulation, trial, blow, suffering, or pain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nothing happened to him that would cause him to shed tears; nothing ever rent his heart or frustrated his way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In man's eyes this is such a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But what did God say about the Moabites?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He said, "He is settled on his lees/And has not been emptied from vessel to vessel."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For wine to settle on its lees means that the liquid is a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When wine ferments, the top part becomes clear liquid, while the lees sink to the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As soon as the vessel is shaken, the lees and the liquid mix together again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to have a clear liquid, one has to pour the wine from one vessel to another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the old days there was no filter, and the only way to remove the lees was to pour the liquid from one vessel to another.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The liquid and the lees were originally mixed together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By pouring the liquid from one vessel to another, the lees were left behind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes some lees would escape with the liquid to the other vessel, and there would be the need to pour the liquid to yet another vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This would go on and on until all the lees were gone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moab was never emptied from one vessel to another.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was like wine settled on its lees.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His "lees" were not yet removed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why it says that "his taste remains in him,/And his scent is not changed."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moab always tasted like Moab.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His scent remained the scent of Moab.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His condition had not changed since the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But God is not after the old scent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He wants to change the scent.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some have been believers for ten years, yet their taste remains the same as it was ten years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are like Moab, whose taste remained and whose scent was not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some people were sloppy when they first believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After twenty years they are still sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They lived in ignorance and foolishness the first day, and they still live in ignorance and foolishness today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Their taste remains the same, and their scent is not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God does not want this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God wants to remove our old habit, nature, and character; He wants to remove every undesirable element in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He wants to empty us from this vessel to that vessel and from that vessel to another vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After being emptied a few times, our "lees" will be left behind, and the original taste will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moab had an easy life, but as a result, "his taste remains in him,/And his scent is not changed."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Perhaps our life is not as easy as Moab's. Perhaps we have not been "at ease from...youth." Perhaps we have had to go through "many tribulations" like Paul Acts 14:22 . If so, we should realize that the Lord is removing our lees and our original taste.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord wants to take away our own taste and natural scent.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The old things must be torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord has to uproot them all.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is pouring us from one vessel to another and then to a third.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He allows this to happen to us today and that to happen to us tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord turns us from one environment to another, from one experience to another.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Each time He arranges an environment around us and breaks us, we will shed some of our old taste and scent.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Time after time we will be purified of our old taste.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every day we will be a little different than the day before, and the next day we will be different still further.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the way the Lord works in us; He tears down a little today and a little tomorrow, until all our lees are gone, our taste is lost, and our scent is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God is not only breaking us on the negative side but also constituting us on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From the life of Jacob in Genesis, we can see the meaning of constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Jacob's life began from a low point.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He struggled with his older brother in his mother's womb and strove to be the firstborn by holding on to his brother's heel.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was crafty and greedy, always deceitful and taking advantage of others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He deceived his own father, brother, and uncle.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But in the end he was deceived by his uncle and his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He tried his best to prosper, but in the end he found himself in a famine.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We can say that Jacob's way was fraught with suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some people spend their lives in ease and comfort, but Jacob's life was full of affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>While he was going through his sufferings, God was breaking him down again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He suffered one thing after another.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Every experience he went through was a suffering to him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But thank God, after going through so much suffering in His hand, he finally acquired a touch of God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We see this when he was in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There we see a gentle, humble, bright, and dignified man.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He was so meek and humble that he could ask for grace and mercy from his son.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Yet he was so crystal clear that he could utter prophecies which Abraham could not utter.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He could give blessings which Isaac could not give.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He was so dignified that even Pharaoh bowed his head to receive his blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This shows us that through God's breaking work, the lowly Jacob had become someone God could use.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Jacob had become a man of God!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After years of breaking, God constituted Jacob with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is why we can see such a beautiful picture at Jacob's deathbed when he leaned on the top of his rod and worshipped God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Though he was sick in bed, he could still lean on the top of his staff and worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This proves that he still remembered his pilgrim life and had not given up his pilgrim characteristic.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>At first he struggled to sit up, put his feet down by the bed, and prophesied.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>After prophesying, he gathered up his feet, gave up his breath, and died.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The way he died was beautiful!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is indeed a beautiful picture.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We can muse carefully upon the whole life of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>At the time he was born, I am afraid no one had a worse "taste" than he had.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But when he left the world, his old taste was gone altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>What we see is a man fully constituted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We must realize that everything that comes upon us is for our edification one way or another.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God tears us down through all kinds of sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The tearing down can be quite painful.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But after we pass through these trials, something will be constituted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In other words, when trials arise, it may appear that we are failing, but His grace will always carry us through.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In the process of overcoming our trials, something is wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>As we overcome our trials again and again, the constitution within us grows day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>On the one hand, God puts us through difficult circumstances and tears us down through our trials.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>On the other hand, something is added into us as we rise from our trials.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Thank God that we have the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>May God have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>May He break us and constitute us through the discipline of the Holy Spirit so that we may reach maturity.</S>
