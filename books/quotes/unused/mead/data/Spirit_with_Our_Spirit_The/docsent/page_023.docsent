   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As the Holy Spirit to Seal the Believers of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the New Testament, we see the compound anointing Spirit operating as the Holy Spirit to seal the believers of Christ Eph 1:13; 4:30b; 2 Cor 1:22a .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To seal means to anoint.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a person puts his seal on something, that sealing is the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit is a living seal that saturates us with the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to pray, "Lord, don't just seal me once, but saturate me all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I need Your sealing; I need Your saturating."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we live by the Spirit, we have the sense that something within us is saturating us, and that saturating is the continuous sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This sealing dispenses the divine element of the processed Triune God into the believers and saturates them with it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It also transforms the believers into the inheritance of God Eph 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is remarkable that we sinners can be transformed to such an extent that we are considered by God as His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How could we, the constitution of sin, be God's inheritance?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Surely, this implies transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our being God's inheritance, as spoken of in Ephesians 1:11, is related to Christ's redemption v. 7 . We were lost in sin, but Christ's redemption brought us out of sin and unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then we became persons in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ has become our sphere and our realm in which His element is always saturating us, and that saturating is the Spirit's sealing to transform us into God's treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today, in Christ, God considers us as His treasure to become His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The life-giving Spirit anoints us, seals us, saturates us, with the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This saturating is the dispensing, and the dispensing is transforming us, making us the treasure of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we walk in the Spirit every day, even every moment, we are under this sealing, this saturating, to transform us into a treasure for God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the Sealing Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>to Be a Pledge to the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The sealing Spirit becomes a pledge to the believers Eph 1:14; 2 Cor 1:22b , guaranteeing God as the inheritance of the believers and giving the believers a foretaste of God as their heritage.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are God's inheritance, and God is our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For us to be God's inheritance, we need the sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For us to have God as our inheritance, we need the pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In ancient times the Greek word for pledge was used in the purchasing of land.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The seller gave the purchaser some soil from the land as a sample.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, a pledge, according to ancient Greek usage, is also a sample.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Holy Spirit is a sample of what we will inherit of God in full.</S>
