   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT LEARNING THE TRUTH FOR PROPHESYING 1 Scripture Reading: Matt 28:20; Acts 2:42; 5:42; 2 Tim 3:7; 1 Tim 2:4; Col 3:16; Heb 5:13-14; 2 Tim 2:2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At present, the most important thing for the church is what Paul spoke of in 1 Corinthians 14:4: He who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but he who prophesies builds up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For the building up of the church, the most necessary thing is prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although our testimonies in all the districts of the churches may be good, the content of the meetings is not rich enough.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The content of the meetings is not rich because the speaking is not rich.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the speaking is rich in the church meetings, especially in the district meetings, the content of the meetings will also be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our problem today is related to our speaking; the proper speaking is not an ordinary speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In every district everyone is now exercising to speak, either to give a testimony or to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are trying their best to exercise to speak a short word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is good.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some speak with the help of a cane, using Truth Lessons, Life Lessons, or the Life-studies, all of which are helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the speaking is not rich enough.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, although all the brothers and sisters speak in the meetings, some speak on one topic, and others speak on another topic; at the end there is the need for a responsible brother to tie a knot, that is, to release a rich word to conclude the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is very necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are different ways to tie a knot; just as it is not simple to tie a knot, it is also not simple to conclude a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fifty years ago in mainland China, the suitcases and handbags that we carried on long trips were not as convenient and stylish as they now are.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today everything is so convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The luggage and suitcases that we carry on the plane from the United States to Taiwan vary in size and style and are all well equipped and elegant looking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, when we traveled for a long distance fifty years ago, we had to tie a knot around each piece of the old-fashioned suitcase or bag in order to secure them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes the knot was not tight enough and became loose in the middle of the journey; sometimes, because of hastiness, the knot became tangled and was difficult to untie.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, a great deal of consideration is needed in regard to properly tying a knot.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With regard to our meetings, there is the need to tie a knot at the end, that is, to conclude in a proper way; however, this requires much consideration as to who should tie the knot and how to tie it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not everyone can conclude a meeting, and not every conclusion is satisfying, supplying, and edifying.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, through careful study we have realized that in order to meet the long-term need related to the district meetings and group meetings, the concluding word of each meeting must have content.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The content depends upon the speaking, not the testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord s word is what edifies and nurtures people the most.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While testimonies may be helpful to the saints, they do not adequately nurture the saints, because they do not contain much of the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The concluding word must have the truth as its basis; such a word imparts truth into the saints so that they feel solid within.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without the Lord s word the meeting is not solid; with the Lord s word it becomes solid and secure.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not easy to speak the Lord s word in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Fifty years ago Brother Nee saw the light and realized that the big meeting on Lord s Day morning, in which one person speaks and everyone else listens, is not proper and that having such a meeting is to follow the customs of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, at that time he clearly said we should not stop this kind of meeting, because we were not able to find an adequate substitute for it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the meeting in which one person speaks and the rest listen had been stopped, we would not have known how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time he pointed out that in order for us to have the kind of meeting described in 1 Corinthians 14:26, we would need to experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once the Holy Spirit was poured out, psalms, teachings, revelations, and even tongues would come.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our change in system in these past few years is based upon our repeated study and exercise to practice 1 Corinthians 14:26.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually we have been able to change the format of the meetings from having one person speak and everyone else listen to having a meeting in which everyone speaks and listens, that is, to a meeting full of mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we delved into 1 Corinthians 14, the Lord revealed several crucial points.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First, in verse 1 Paul says, Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a saint can prophesy only when the Holy Spirit is poured out upon him, there is no need for him to desire earnestly to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To desire earnestly implies learning.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Second, to prophesy is not to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Speaking in tongues does not require much learning.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Speaking in tongues usually occurs while someone is praying, and the Holy Spirit suddenly descends upon him, causing him to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, it is a miraculous speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Prophesying is different.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is to speak forth God with ordinary words.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This cannot be acquired merely by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit; rather, it depends upon the daily learning of the speaking one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Luke 1 contains the prophecies of Elizabeth, Mary, and Zachariah.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As we ponder over their prophecies, we can see that without a foundation of God s word in their daily lives, it would have been difficult for them to prophesy with words matching the standard they displayed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Mary must have been especially familiar with the Old Testament because her prophecy quotes from the Old Testament extensively.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In 1 Corinthians 14:26 Paul also points out the way in which all can prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He says, Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This does not mean that whenever we come together, we will spontaneously have something.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>That would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even if someone has a hymn, he still needs to be familiar with the numbering and the content of the hymnal; he also needs to have a deeper learning and knowledge regarding the hymns in order to be able to call a proper hymn in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In 1 Corinthians 14:12 Paul says, Seek that you may excel for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we desire and seek to excel, we must learn.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Corinthians liked to speak in tongues, which does not require learning.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, if someone wants to prophesy, he needs to study and know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this verse Paul indicates that speaking in tongues does not excel but is relatively inferior.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In other words, although a person may have the gift of tongues, it is not an excelling gift, whereas to have the gift of prophesying is excelling.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This truly indicates that prophesying includes learning.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At the end of chapter 14, Paul says again, So then, my brothers, desire earnestly the prophesying v. 39 . I hope that we would all earnestly desire to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In regard to learning the truth for prophesying, we need to pay attention to several matters.</S>
