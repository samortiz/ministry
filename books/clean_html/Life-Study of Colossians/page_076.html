<h2 class="head1">NOT &ldquo;ORDINANCING&rdquo; OURSELVES</h2><p>Let us now look at 2:20-23 in more detail. Verses 20 through 22 are actually one sentence, three verses that make up Paul&rsquo;s question. According to verse 20, Paul asks the Colossians why they subject themselves to ordinances. In Greek the word translated &ldquo;ordinances&rdquo; is actually a verb. This indicates that Paul was asking why the Colossians were &ldquo;ordinancing&rdquo; themselves. Then in verse 21 Paul lists three ordinances about handling, tasting, and touching. In verse 22 he goes on to say that these are things &ldquo;which are all for corruption in the using.&rdquo; The Greek words for corruption and using may be rendered destruction and consumption respectively. Here Paul is saying that all material things are destined to decompose and to be destroyed through corruption when they are used (1 Cor. 6:13; Matt. 15:17).</p><p>Whenever we use a thing, that thing is eventually destroyed or corrupted through use. For example, whatever we eat is destroyed in the eating, whether it is clean or unclean according to the Levitical dietary regulations. Since whatever we eat is destroyed in the using, there is no need for us to be subject to regulations about eating. In Acts 10 Peter was still concerned about what was clean and what was unclean. But the voice from heaven told Peter that what God had cleansed he should not regard as common. In Colossians 2 Paul is encouraging the saints not to care about the regulations of asceticism regarding things which are all for corruption in the using. Whatever we use will eventually be destroyed and become nothing. In particular, when food is consumed, it is destroyed. Thus, there was no need for the saints to regulate their eating by ordinances.</p><h2 class="head1">A CLEAR VISION</h2><p>Paul could write such a word because he had seen a clear vision of the all-inclusive Christ as the one Person and of the cross as the one way in God&rsquo;s administration. Therefore, he did not care for regulations about handling, tasting, or touching. He would not be occupied with ordinances. He knew that all material things perish with the using and eventually come to nothing. Paul realized that the believers in Colosse needed to see a great vision of the all-inclusive Christ and of the cross as God&rsquo;s way in His administration. We also need a clear view of Christ and the cross.</p><h2 class="head1">ONENESS AND HARMONY THROUGH THE CROSS</h2><p>Apart from God&rsquo;s one way, we should have no ordinances and no particular ways or practices. The way God has ordained, uplifted, and honored is the cross of Christ. The cross is our only way. Do you know what can solve the problem of quarreling between husband and wife? It can be solved only by the cross. In the same principle, only the cross can enable the leading ones in a locality to be one and in perfect harmony. We all need to pass through the cross. If we do not experience the cross, we cannot have the proper church life. All the saints must learn to daily pass through the cross. By passing through all manner of crosses, large and small, we shall have oneness and harmony in the church life.</p><p>In the church life it is possible to have oneness without harmony. In order to have a sweet harmonious oneness, we all must daily pass through the cross. Do not argue that you are right and that others are wrong. The more you dispute in this way, the less you pass through the cross. To repeat, the way to our destination is through the intersection of the cross. Do not avoid any cross. On the contrary, pass through all the crosses you encounter in the Christian life, in the family life, and in the church life. In married life and in the church life in particular, you need to pass through the cross daily, even hourly. In Ephesians 4 Paul exhorts us not to allow the sun to go down on our anger. This means that we should let go of our anger by passing through the cross. If we have a daily life of passing through the cross, there will be harmony both in the family life and in the church life. Praise the Lord for Christ and the cross! God has given us one Person&mdash;the all-inclusive Christ and one way&mdash;the cross.</p>
