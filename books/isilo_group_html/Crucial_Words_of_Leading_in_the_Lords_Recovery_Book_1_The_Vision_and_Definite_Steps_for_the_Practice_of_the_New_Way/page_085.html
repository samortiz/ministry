<p>Please forgive me for saying all these things. I may appear to be a foolish man. It may seem that I am beside myself. However, I have seen a vision and have received a burden to release the truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery item by item. These truths are published in books, but these books are only sitting on our bookshelves. Meanwhile, the entire Christian world, with all the children of God, is starving spiritually. We must realize that it is to our shame that these truths have not gone out. We have wasted the Lord&rsquo;s great grace upon us!</p>
<p>Thirty-five years ago I came to Taiwan with only my two hands. Among us we had only a few books by Brother Nee and a hymnal consisting of about one hundred eighty songs. I began to publish a magazine entitled <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> and a book entitled <em>Crucial Truths in the Bible.</em> At that time there were twelve members in my family, but we lived in a studio that was big enough for only eight beds. There was no desk; I had a rattan coffee table. I prepared all the publications from that table and began the work in Taiwan in this way. During the past thirty-six years, we have published many books, but they are all sitting on the shelf. This truly grieves me. I cannot bear to think of this.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I am sharing this with the co-workers and elders. I hope we will receive this fellowship from a &ldquo;foolish&rdquo; man (2 Cor. 11:16-17). The Lord did not have a way among us in the past. The tragedy is that we know what the way of the Lord is; our eyes are clear. We know that His truth is in our hands, but who will send this truth out? You may say you can sleep peacefully, but I cannot sleep peacefully. I am an old man, yet I still want to spend and be spent. I want to be able to answer to the Lord. For years there was no progress in the work of translating the Bible into Chinese. I have been here for two months, and there is now a good foundation laid in this work. On the one hand, this is not an easy task. On the other hand, this is not that difficult a task. It all depends on whether or not the brothers are willing to pay the price. I hope that from now on, we will all make a strong resolution to advance and make progress. Strive to produce some result, and labor to spread the Lord&rsquo;s testimony.</p>
<p>Brothers, I hope we will make a strong resolution to accomplish something while we are still young and capable. We must be like those in Judges 5 who made &ldquo;great resolutions in heart&rdquo; and &ldquo;great searchings of heart&rdquo; (vv. 15-16). We must achieve something for the Lord. We must never bury the grace that the Lord has given us or the gain that we have received from our training. When the Lord returns, we will be in trouble if the treasure within us is not dug out and the talents are not utilized. I hope that we will spend all we have and will not hold back anything. If we have a talent, we should spend a talent. If we have two talents, we should spend two talents. Only then will the Lord have a way to go on. Otherwise, we can wait for fifty years and nothing will happen. Today there are almost twenty million people in Taiwan. Only five hundred thousand are saved. Are we not ashamed of this? We have been here for more than thirty years. The gospel has not spread very far. Do our hearts not ache? Perhaps we have grown numb to this fact. I hope that this word will prick our hearts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A WORD OF EXHORTATION</h2>
<p>Dear elders, there are no easy tasks. Even to be a little elder is a difficult task. We need to struggle and strive. I believe we all love the Lord. All of us are willing to consecrate ourselves to the Lord and sacrifice for the Lord. Regrettably, in the past we did not receive this kind of help. That was a great shortage. I hope we will take this fellowship and the exhortation of the apostle in his revelation concerning resurrection: &ldquo;Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:58). The word used here is not <em>work</em> but <em>labor.</em> To labor implies not being discouraged, pressing on, and striving with all that one has. For any work, before success comes, there are struggles, frustrations, and failures. One has to strive and labor before he can reach his goal. In order to build up the home meetings, the truth meetings, the community work, and the campus work there must be this kind of labor and struggle.</p>
<p>I hope every elder will struggle and strive in this way. We should not avoid the difficult path and take the easy way. Nor should we settle for the light tasks. We must endure to the end. Nothing and no one should deter us, and we should never be discouraged or dejected. Success is not measured in a day. No account is settled until the Lord comes back. We were born here, raised here, saved here, and perfected here. This is our destiny. Today it is the Lord who has honored us by making us elders. We must respect this honoring and give our all to His commission. We must not only give our money and our career; we must give our blood and our life as well. If we have this kind of spirit, we will be successful elders.</p>
<p>Based on my experience of more than thirty years, and according to my studying and observation, I can say that the three ways that we have fellowshipped today are the best and most excellent ways. In addition to these ways, we have the richest inheritance, which is the truth among us. It serves as our shield and support. Everything depends now on how we conduct ourselves in the work. I hope we will take this word of encouragement and exhortation. I hope the elders will have an elders&rsquo; meeting at least once a week to pray and fellowship much and to take up the burden of the church. May the Lord be gracious to each of us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A PRAYER</h2>
<p>Lord, we bring all the situations before You. You know everything. We believe everything is in Your hand. We believe that the recovery is Yours and that all the moves are Your moves. We believe fully that You will gain the glory in Taiwan and will spread Your kingdom here. For this reason, bless all of us. Bless the saints, bless their homes, and bless their service. Lord, especially bless the full-timers, and bless their training. May their work and walk in Your presence be burnt offerings on the altar, and may they be acceptable to You. Lord, we are full of peace and rest and are assured that this is what You want to do. You will accomplish this work for the coming of Your kingdom and the realization of Your will on the earth.</p>
<p>Lord, cover the co-workers and the elders, especially the elders in all the meeting halls, to take up this burden to build up the homes, the truth-teaching meetings, and the work in the communities and the campuses and to produce full-time trainees for the gospelization of every city. Lord, remember the brothers and sisters and bless them. May they consecrate everything on the altar for Your love&rsquo;s sake and for the sake of fulfilling Your work in this age. Lord, manifest Your riches in the midst of all the needs. May You gain a clear highway in Taiwan and gain a glorious testimony on this earth to be a model to all the churches. Lord, we look to You to accomplish this. We hide ourselves in You and exercise to put everything under Your care.</p>
<p>Lord, protect our coming in and our going out. Protect everyone and every home. Do not allow Satan any opportunity to attack, frustrate, or obstruct this move. Lord, take away our discouragement, our lack of confidence, and our fear. Make us steadfast and immovable, and give us faith in everything we are doing. We desire to see Your glory. May all the glory go to You! May the love of God, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Spirit operate among us, and may we daily enjoy the dispensing of the Triune God. Lord, gain this earth and remember Your testimony on the earth. Amen!</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_084.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_086.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 1: The Vision and Definite Steps for the Practice of the New Way &nbsp; pg 85</div><br></body></html>
