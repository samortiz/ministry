   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FORTY-EIGHT CONSTANT SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND THE INWARD OPERATION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>OF THE INDWELLING GOD Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19-21; 2:12-16</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although Philippians is a short book, it is rich and profound.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No other book in the New Testament reveals salvation in such a practical and experiential way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We know from the first chapter of Matthew that Christ became a man named Jesus and Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jesus means Jehovah the Savior, and Emmanuel means God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After I was saved, I treasured these names.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, I did not know their meaning in an experiential way until the Lord brought me into the reality of the book of Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this book we have the details of God s practical, experiential, subjective, and constant salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Philippians presents God s salvation in a way that is more practical and experiential than the way it is presented in Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans speaks of salvation more in a doctrinal way, but Philippians speaks of it more in an experiential way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE NEED FOR CONSTANT SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>IN OUR FAMILY LIFE AND CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s salvation in Christ is not only eternal, but also constant and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In a sense, eternal salvation is rather remote.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need a salvation that can be applied to our daily situations, especially to our married life and family life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Married life can be compared to a prison.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our spouse is the jailer, and our children are guards.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For such a situation, we need a salvation that is practical, constant, and experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The book of Philippians reveals a salvation that we can experience day by day, a salvation that we can enjoy in the prison of married life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to experience a present salvation not only in our family life, but also in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the church there are saints of many different nationalities and with all kinds of dispositions and personalities.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order for us to stay together in the church life, we need a present and practical salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is especially necessary if we are to experience the church not only locally, but also as the new man universally.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, we need salvation for our family life, for our local church life, and for our life in the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose you plan to visit churches in different parts of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As you come in contact with saints of different cultures, nationalities, and dispositions, you will realize how much we need to experience God s salvation in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are to practice the church life with so many different brothers and sisters meeting together as one, we need the constant salvation revealed in the book of Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 1:19 Paul says, I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a prisoner in Rome, Paul needed a practical salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose someone spoke to him about eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul could have said, Brother, don t talk about something so remote from my present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am a prisoner in chains.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I need a salvation that can be applied to this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>SAVED FROM CROOKEDNESS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 2:12-15 Paul speaks of working out our own salvation in relation to murmurings, reasonings, blame, guile, blemishes, crookedness, and perverseness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This indicates that we need a salvation from all these negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are still crooked in some way, then, whether or not we are Christians, we are part of today s crooked generation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To be saved from the crooked generation is to be saved from crookedness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all need a salvation for today, the salvation revealed in the book of Philippians.</S>
