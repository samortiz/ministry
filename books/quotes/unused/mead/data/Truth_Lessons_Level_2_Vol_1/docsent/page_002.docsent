   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His faithfulness is the guarantee of the covenant that He made with man; His might enables Him to fulfill His covenant with man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is such a mighty and faithful One who came to make a covenant with man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, the word God here in Genesis 2 is plural, indicating that although He is the only God, He has the aspect of three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit Matt 28:19 .</S>
