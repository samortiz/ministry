   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Example Three Faith in Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Mark 11:24 says, "For this reason I say to you, All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From man's point of view, prayer and petition are things of the present, and "you will have them" is a thing of the future.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is a gap of time between "pray and ask" and "you will have them."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I pray to God for the healing of a disease, for the salvation of a sinner, or for the accomplishment of a work, I do not know when the disease will be healed, when the person will be saved, or when the work will be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In man's eyes, answers to prayer belong to the future.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the Lord Jesus' word here is very unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is speaking of genuine faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In our mind, we often misread the word "have" in the phrase "believe that you have received them."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We often change it to "believe that you will receive them, and you will have them," or we change it to "believe that you can receive them, and you will have them."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sometimes we change it to "believe that you are going to receive them, and you will have them," or "believe that you will receive them in the future, and you will receive them."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But once you change it, that is no longer faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only one faith is genuine faith the faith that believes that "God is."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord's Word does not say "going to receive" but "have received them."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Believe that you have received them" means that I believe that I have received them now.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am not waiting for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do we see this?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not the future as we think of it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Christ there is no future.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brothers and sisters, do not think that this is a small teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should know that this has everything to do with our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We cannot disregard this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One day, while the Lord Jesus was on His way to Jerusalem from Bethany, He was hungry, "and seeing at a distance a fig tree having leaves, He came to see if perhaps He would find anything on it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And when He came to it, He found nothing except leaves, for it was not the season for figs.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And He answered and said to it, May no one eat fruit from you forever!"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Mark 11:12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"No one eat fruit from you forever" is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus stated a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was a flourishing fig tree, but the Lord said, "May no one eat fruit from you forever."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He spoke with such confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is the secret?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The secret is in verse 24.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What the Lord Jesus said in verse 24 is a continuation of the subject of the fig tree.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He said, "For this reason I say to you, All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is what He did to the fig tree.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He did not wait until the fig tree had died before saying such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He said, "May no one eat fruit from you forever" when the fig tree was still flourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although the fig tree was flourishing, in the eyes of faith, the Lord Jesus saw it as dead already and that no man would eat the fruit of it forever.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Though the fig tree had not died, the Lord Jesus saw the fact of its death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The faith which "believe s that you have received" is this kind of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The facts that faith sees are not in the future but in the present.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who do not know the Lord can only say that they know something when they actually see it in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But for those who know the Lord, it is a matter of today and not the future.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They know something before they have seen it; they know it within already.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to remember that in spiritual things, everything is today.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nothing is in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God is the God who now is, not the God who will be.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Mark 11:24 shows one thing: everything that God does is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to man's view there is the past, the present, and the future; this makes sense to man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But spiritual things are different.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whoever has the experience can testify with us that there is neither a past nor a future in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everything is in the present.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There are many things which, according to man's view, are in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But we say that they are in the present.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thank God, in genuine faith, everything is done.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Example Four</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Foretaste of the Power of the Coming Age</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hebrews 6:5 says we "have tasted...the powers of the age to come."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How can the coming age be moved to today?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Can all the things in the future be moved to today?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We know "the age to come" is the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hebrews 6 tells us that Christians can have a foretaste of the powers of the age to come.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The prophecies in the Bible about the millennium are wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For example, "the wolf will dwell with the lamb;/And the leopard will lie down with the kid, /And the calf and the young lion and the fatling together;/And a young boy will lead them about./The cow and the bear will graze;/Their young will lie down together;/And the lion will eat straw like the ox./The nursing child will play by the cobra's hole,/And upon the viper's den/The weaned child will stretch his hand./They will not hurt nor destroy/In all My holy mountain,/For the earth will be full of the knowledge of Jehovah,/As the waters cover the sea" Isa 11:6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At that time, "they will beat their swords into plowshares,/And their spears into pruning hooks;/Nation will not lift the sword against nation,/Nor will they learn war anymore" 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Oh, how wonderful is the kingdom age!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>From man's point of view, these things can be enjoyed only in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But Hebrews 6:5 speaks of Christians having a foretaste today; Christians can have a foretaste of the powers of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the kingdom age all the demons will be cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But today man can cast out demons also.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the kingdom age everyone will be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But today the Lord sustains the human body also.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In that day men will know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But today men can know Him also.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In that day the nursing child will play by the the cobra's hole.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Today men can take up serpents Mark 16:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The children of God can have a foretaste of the powers of the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>According to the concept of time, these things will happen in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But the church can move the future to the present, just as she moved the past to the present.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We have to shout, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Christ is the Christ who is now.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Christians are in contact with such a "now" Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We communicate with such a Lord, and we are related to such a Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Every spiritual thing to Christians is a matter of now.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We often have heavy burdens, trials, and difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We pray to the Lord, yet it seems useless.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The more we pray, the more unclear the situation becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Our petition seems to have no effect no matter how we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This is because we are standing on the wrong ground in our petitioning.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Our thought is that God will answer us in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We have limited God by time.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We wait for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>As a result, nothing happens.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But thank God that we can bring the future and the present together.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We believe that in our individual experiences, we can move the things of the kingdom to today.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>May God show us that our Lord is the God who now is.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Whoever touches this holds the key to communion with God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We need to ask God to save us from our thoughts, our cleverness, the limitation of time, the future, and the past, and deliver us from dead knowledge outside of the Holy Spirit, so that we may see that in the Holy Spirit everything is now and living.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>May the Lord lead us and bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Amen!</S>
