   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord repeated this miracle because the twelve disciples needed to be trained twice.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Had the Lord not fed the five thousand and four thousand, the disciples probably would not have been able to handle the situation at Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If a man has never experienced the feeding of five thousand and four thousand in the Gospels, he could never know about caring for the three thousand and five thousand in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who run away at the sight of bears and lions will surely run away at the sight of Goliath.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those who cannot shepherd sheep will surely not be able to shepherd Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here was a group of people who learned the lesson of feeding the five thousand and the four thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a consequence, they had no problem at Pentecost when they were called upon to take care of the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brothers and sisters, we have to go through the same training.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our hearts have to be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can hold back what we spend, but God does not want us to hold back His miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many people are too concerned about money.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They do not give others the impression that they are servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They do not resemble those who have been trained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A trained person will not make money an issue; he will not be that concerned about the money in his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brothers and sisters, the more we count, the more we deviate from God's mark, and the poorer we become.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not God's principle towards money.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need the training that the twelve and the seventy disciples received.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One of the twelve eventually became a thief, a robber; he stole money.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did not learn his lesson, and money became a major issue to him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When he saw Mary pouring the pure nard out of the alabaster flask on the Lord, he considered it a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He said, "Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To a calculating person, a flask of ointment can be sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the Lord did not go along with this calculation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead, He said, "Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be told as a memorial of her" Matt 26:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The consummate result of the gospel is the breaking of the alabaster flask and the anointing of the Lord Jesus with the ointment worth three hundred denarii.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, when a man receives the gospel and for Christ's sake does not count the cost of wasting everything on Him, it is a good thing in the Lord's sight.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is right even when he "wastes" himself on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who do not understand the gospel are always counting their money, but those who understand the gospel realize that it is right and proper to waste themselves on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is right for the Lord to receive our "wasteful" sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Who was the one who considered it a waste?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Judas.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was a man who never learned his lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His words were very reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To man, there was no profit in spending three hundred denarii in this way!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To Judas, three hundred denarii was enough to betray a man he sold the Lord Jesus for a price of three hundred denarii.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, to him, the pouring out of the ointment was a waste, and he grieved over it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He wanted to gain something from it; he was a very calculating man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But those who have genuinely received the gospel and who are absolute for the Lord will sacrifice everything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even if the sacrifice is too much in others' eyes, this sacrifice is made towards the Lord's gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Where the gospel is proclaimed, no one should bargain with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He said, "For the poor you have with you always, but you do not always have Me" v. 11 . The Lord was saying that there is nothing wrong about caring for the poor, but we cannot hold back anything when it comes to sacrificing for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even if we overdo and go to the extreme, it is still not a waste to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A brother once said, "If a new believer tries to take the moderate way once he believes, he will have no spiritual future at all."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brothers and sisters, considerations of moderation can wait ten or twenty years, but when one first believes, he should waste himself on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you are a new believer, you should offer everything you have to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You should pour out the entire alabaster flask of pure nard on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You have to sacrifice everything this way before you will have a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This was the training the disciples received.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to learn to take up a little more suffering ourselves and waste more on the Lord and on others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As God's servants, we should be very generous towards money.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should go on, with or without money.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who always count their money are not the right persons for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Acts 3:6 Peter said to the crippled man, "Silver and gold I do not possess."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord brought Peter and John to the point where they could claim, "Silver and gold I do not possess."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although we see much money being handled in chapter two, we find a testimony in chapter three: "Silver and gold I do not possess."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What did Peter say to the crippled man?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"What I have, this I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene rise up and walk."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They were so trained that even though so much money passed through their hand, they could still say, "Silver and gold I do not possess."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Brothers and sisters, if we engage ourselves in the work at all, we have to be firm with regard to money.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once we are weak in this matter, we will be weak in other matters as well.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>An underlying factor for strong and steady workers is our trustworthiness before God in the matter of money.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God can entrust such persons.</S>
