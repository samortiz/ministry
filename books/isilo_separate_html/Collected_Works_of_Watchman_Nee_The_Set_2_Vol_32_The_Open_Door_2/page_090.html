Please pray for this.</p><p>(2) News from Amoy on March 8: Brother Philip Luan, senior Mrs. Nee, and Sister Peace Wang arrived safely in Kulangsu, Amoy on March 3. The meetings will begin on March 12 and probably conclude on the eighteenth.</p><p>(3) Brother Stephen Kaung wrote on March 3 that he is clear about going to Chungking but has not fixed the date yet. He hopes earnestly that Brother Tang Shou-ling can go with him, and he sends greetings to the co-workers and asks for prayer.</p><p>(4) Brother Chao Jing-hwai wrote from Chefoo on March 4: "Brother Witness Lee returned to Chefoo from Tientsin. During his study of the kingdom, many people came to listen....Since June of last year, about ten brothers and sisters have been added to our ministry to the Lord. The Lord has also increased the number of saved ones. There was a ten-day conference starting the first day of the Chinese New Year. We had prayer meetings from 5:30 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. every day and gospel meetings from 9:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. with Brother Liu Bei-min speaking. From 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. Brother Witness preached on the subject of the filling of the Holy Spirit. The attendance was high. Now is an excellent time for us to expand the work in Chefoo. The Lord willing, Brother Witness and Brother Bei-min will travel to Chi-Hsia with two sisters for the gospel and visit the brothers and sisters there. In two weeks they will return to Chefoo and will have a special conference for the edification of believers. Please remember these things in your prayer....The brothers and sisters in Chefoo are enjoying peace under the Lord's grace."</p><p>(5) Brother Liu Ai-wu wrote from Ch'ang-sha on March 3: "Beginning January 8 Brother Han Fu-shen preached the gospel and did some work with the believers in Ch'ang-Teh....I have been learning to pray. Brother Kuo is very concerned for the work of the gospel. Thank the Lord for leading Brother Ji Dun-wu to invite him to preach the gospel in the streets of the city beginning next week."</p><p>(6) Sister Luk Tsi-tsien wrote on February 24 from Nan-Bu County: "There is only one denomination here&mdash;the Anglican Church of the China Inland Mission. It is amazing that we can find magazines published by the Gospel Book Room, including The Present Testimony, Notes on Scriptural Messages, and The Christian even in the southern part of the inland regions of north Szechuan. One pastor said that he received much help from these publications....I have just finished reading the book Rethinking Our Work and have received much help from it."</p><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2><p>[Omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</h2><p>As substitute editor, I have not done anything with the "Questions and Answers" column during this period of substitution. This column is on practical questions related to the work, the workers, and the church. These questions should be answered by experienced and enlightened brothers among the co-workers. I have recently received a cable from abroad that our chief editor, Mr. Watchman Nee, is on his way back. I also heard that the co-workers in Feng-Tien and Kirin (Manchuria) have seen some new light recently. I hope that the co-workers and the responsible ones everywhere will list the questions they have after studying Rethinking Our Work, including the difficulties they encountered in the work and in the local churches in practicing the light of this book. Send these questions to this publication so that Brother Nee or other co-workers can selectively answer them within the possible confines of this publication. However, the questions raised must be ones that have been thoroughly studied, and the difficulties mentioned must not be theoretical in nature.</p><p>The co-workers who are engaged in frontier pioneering work should put down as clearly as possible the distance of your travel and the condition of your daily living so that we can pray for you in a better way. (It would be good if you could draw a map of the places you have visited together with some explanation.)</p><p>Some letters from Southeast Asia are from small places. Please indicate the nation in which you are living so that the readers in China can better understand your location.</p><p>Ruth Lee, Shanghai, March 9, 1939</p><h2 class="head1">A REPEATED ANNOUNCEMENT</h2><p>[Omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENT 1</h2><p>[Omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENT 2</h2><p>[Omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">ADDRESSES OF A FEW LOCAL CHURCHES</h2><p>[Omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_089.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_091.html">Next</a> </body></html>
