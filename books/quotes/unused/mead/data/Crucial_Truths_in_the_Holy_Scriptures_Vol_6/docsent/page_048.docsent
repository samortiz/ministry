   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Basis the Father s Love and Good Pleasure</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What son is there whom the father does not discipline?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Heb 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God s disciplinary judgment on the believers is based upon His love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He disciplines not only because He is our Father but also because He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is not simply our Father; He is our loving Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He must discipline us because He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What children are loved by their father but are not disciplined by their father?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God disciplines us not because He dislikes us but because He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He strikes us in discipline because He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, God s love for us as our Father is the basis of His disciplinary judgment upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this reason, God s disciplinary judgment can be considered His loving discipline, His loving judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For what is profitable Heb 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the one hand, God s disciplinary judgment on the believers is based upon His love, and on the other hand, it is also based upon His good pleasure toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hebrews 12:10 says that God disciplines us, judges us, for our profit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His good pleasure for us causes Him to think about our profit and to discipline us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whatever comes to us through His disciplinary judgment is out of the arrangement and exercise of His good pleasure toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, His good pleasure toward us is also a basis for Him to judge us in His discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Result Profiting the Believers Lest They</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Be Condemned Together with the World</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For what is profitable that we might partake of His holiness...It yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness Heb 12:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The judgment of God s discipline of the believers results in profit for the believers by causing them to partake of His holiness and to bear the peaceable fruit of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Believers should be separated from the world and live a holy life that matches God s holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our behavior and actions should match God s righteousness, and we should be harmonious and peaceable toward God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, we often do not live like this after we are saved; instead, we continue to mingle with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our living often does not match God s holy nature, and our behavior does not match God s righteous procedures.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have problems and strife with God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This forces God to discipline and punish us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every time we pass through God s disciplinary judgment, however, we come out of the world a little more.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This makes our living more in accord with God s holy nature and our behavior more in accord with God s righteous ways.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It brings us into more harmony and peace with God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If everything in our life were easy, if we were healthy, if things went smoothly, if we did not have God s disciplinary judgment, it would be very easy for us to be in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It would be easy for us to be loose and to have problems with God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But when God disciplines us, we must leave these conditions because God causes us to partake of His holy nature and to match His righteous ways.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We also have more peaceable fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These are the result of God s exercising His disciplinary judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That we may not be condemned with the world 1 Cor 11:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The result of God s disciplinary judgment upon the believers is not merely to profit us but also to cause us to escape from being condemned with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God will judge all sinners, and God cannot avoid judging man s sinful actions because He is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, God does not want His children to be condemned and judged with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, before God judges the world, He will exercise His discipline to punish and judge His children, as indicated in 1 Peter 4:17, which says that God s judgment begins from the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is typified by both God s judgment of David 2 Sam 12:13-18 and God s promise to David and his descendants 7:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The judgment of the church and God s disciplinary judgment both deal with the believers for their profit in order to separate them from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Both are matters of God s governmental administration within His own household.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE JUDGMENT BEFORE</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God will also exercise judgment upon believers at the judgment seat of Christ where the actions and work of every believer will be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The sins of a believer, which occurred before salvation, were judged in the first judgment of God at the cross of Christ; after a believer s salvation, God continues to exercise judgment upon a believer s sins through the church and through His discipline in order to correct the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, after a believer is saved, his actions and work before God must also be judged at the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our actions and work after salvation must pass through a final pronouncement of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This judgment, which will occur at the judgment seat of Christ, is the fourth judgment in God s administration of His government.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since it is something that will happen to us in the future, we must pay careful attention to it.</S>
