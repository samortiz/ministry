One can come here by boat directly from Hong Kong, Amoy, Swatow, Canton, or anywhere in the coastal region. If you take a ship from Hong Kong, the fast ones only take four days and nights to get to Singapore. The slow ones take a day longer. From Singapore to Cebu takes another three days and nights by boat. At the end of the year, the trip from Singapore to Cebu can be very stormy. I know that it is the Lord's will that I should give up teaching and serve God full-time. The people here all desire salvation. Although many are called X, they unfortunately do not know the slightest thing about salvation. There are two church districts here, Cebu and Shi-Li Street, with a total of forty-eight chapels. One chapel covers a great area. Sometimes one must walk half an hour between houses. Most people take the steamboat to go to church, but they still must walk a great distance. The mountain roads are difficult to travel. When it rains, one almost always has to take off his shoes before he can negotiate the mountain roads. If it were not for the Lord, no one would want to travel through them. Thank the Lord, I have already been to eleven places. If the Lord is willing, I plan to visit them all. My elder sister likes to come with me, but she does not have anyone at home to take care of things for her. She plans to hire someone to keep house for her. There is a new sister from Shing-Hwa who also feels the Lord's leading to go with us. We started last week with our luggage, but I was sick, and it seemed that we should not go. My sister was caught up with some things and had to go back. We plan to go to Hsia-Po this time. There is a sister there from Foochow. Her last name is Lin. If the Lord is willing, we will go to her house. She is a friend of my brother-in-law. I have heard that Sister Ding has come south. There are already five or six brothers and sisters who have come from China. I believe that the Lord has already opened the door here, but there cannot be any meeting other than gospel meetings. Please help us with your prayer for all these matters. Sister Fang Chiung-ying wants to come. Unfortunately, she cannot get a visa. I do not have a copy of the first issue of The Open Door. May the Lord give grace to you and to all the brothers and sisters who are working for Him in the coastal regions, the central region, and the western regions. I believe the feeling is true everywhere that the harvest is great and the workers few. May the Lord send people out! We must pray that the Lord will give me a co-worker who can speak the Foochow and Malayan dialect and can teach the people to sing hymns. Peace in the Lord. Greet Sister Wang and Sister Chang for me.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Yu-mei<br />January 7<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">All Things in God's Hands, Hankow</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>When I took the manuscripts for the fifth issue to the Spiritual Book Publisher to be typeset and printed, the first thing they told me was that there was a lack of paper, and the price had risen dramatically. At that time a roll cost twenty-three dollars, and people were still buying it frantically. I was troubled about the problem, but I also thought that the Lord would be responsible for His own work, so I decided not to buy the paper in advance. I just prayed earnestly and waited until the manuscripts were typeset and the paper was needed. Praise the Lord! The typesetting was finished today, and fifty rolls of paper had been sent to Hankow, so the price had fallen. It is now fourteen dollars a roll. Ordinary businessmen might think that this is very common in the marketplace, but we cannot help but praise the Lord because it is His doing! God led us through a special conference during the past week. This week there is a sisters' conference which is also of God's grace.</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi<br />March 16</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>God is now leading me to watch His working day by day. He is the Lord of works. I am resting in everything. I only need to stand aside to watch His glory and works.</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi<br />March 24</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_096.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_098.html">Next</a> </body></html>
