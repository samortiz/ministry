<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>An introductory word:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;After my study of the Bible for the past sixty-nine years, what have I seen? I would say that I have seen the New Jerusalem. This is my vision, this is my revelation, and this is my ministry&rdquo; (<em>The Practical Points concerning Blending,</em> pp. 25-26):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;In these years the Lord has shown us the crystallized significance of the New Jerusalem: it is a mingling, a constitution, of the Triune God with His chosen and redeemed people&rdquo; (<em>The Governing and Controlling Visionof the Bible,</em> p. 40).</li>
		<li>&ldquo;First, we need to release the truth that God became a man so that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. Then we need to release the truth concerning the New Jerusalem. My burden is to release these two great truths&rdquo; (<em>The Application of the Interpretation of the New Jerusalem to the Seeking Believers,</em> p. 54):
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>&ldquo;The New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation of the Bible, involves God becoming man and man becoming God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead, and God and man being mingled together to be one entity&rdquo; (<em>Life-study of 1 &amp;2 Samuel,</em> p. 203).</li>
			<li>&ldquo;The New Jerusalem is a composition of God&rsquo;s chosen, redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and glorified people who have been deified&rdquo; (<em>Life-study of Job,</em> p. 122).</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>&ldquo;The ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s complete salvation is the New Jerusalem&mdash;the crystallization of the union and mingling of God with man, the processed and consummated Triune God with His regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite elect&rdquo; (<em>The Organic Aspect of God&rsquo;s Salvation,</em> p. 74):
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>&ldquo;The New Jerusalem is the embodiment of God&rsquo;s full salvation, and God&rsquo;s full salvation is a composition of God&rsquo;s righteousness as the base and God&rsquo;s life as the consummation&rdquo; (<em>Life-study of Isaiah,</em> p. 349).</li>
			<li>&ldquo;The consummation of God&rsquo;s organic salvation is the New Jerusalem&mdash;the universal incorporation of the union and mingling of divinity with humanity&mdash;the processed and consummated Triune God incorporated with His regenerated, renewed, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite elect&rdquo; (<em>The Experience of God&rsquo;s Organic Salvation Equaling Reigning in Christ&rsquo;s Life,</em> p. 41).</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>&ldquo;We should teach only that which remains in the New Jerusalem&rdquo; (<em>Crystallization-study of James,</em> p. 43).</li>
		<li>&ldquo;I hope that many of us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery would go around the globe telling people everywhere nothing else but the New Jerusalem&rdquo; (<em>The Application of the Interpretation of the New Jerusalem to the Seeking Believers,</em> p. 41).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Becoming the New Jerusalem and building the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rev. 3:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;Eventually, the triune, eternal God becomes the New Jerusalem incorporated with all of us. We do not enter into the New Jerusalem; we become the New Jerusalem. Our becoming is our entering in&rdquo; (<em>Crystallization-study of the Gospel of John,</em> p. 148).</li>
		<li>&ldquo;The New Jerusalem is built by God&rsquo;s constituting Himself into man to make man the same as God in life, in nature, and in constitution so that God and man may become a corporate entity&rdquo; (<em>Life-study of 1 &amp; 2 Chronicles,</em> p. 36):
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>&ldquo;The God-men build up the Body of Christ for the building of the New Jerusalem. We are building up something in this age&mdash;the Body of Christ&mdash;that is for something in the next age&mdash; the New Jerusalem&rdquo; (<em>The God-men,</em> p. 57).</li>
			<li>&ldquo;What I am doing is building the New Jerusalem and will be consummated in the New Jerusalem&rdquo; (<em>Crystallization-studyof Song of Songs,</em> p. 27).</li>
			<li>&ldquo;How glorious it is that we are now building up the New Jerusalem! Are you not such a builder? We all are co-builders, building an eternal dwelling place for ourselves&rdquo; (<em>The God-men,</em> p. 59).</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The New Jerusalem is the corporate God-man&mdash;the enlargement, expansion, and expression of God&mdash; the corporate God&mdash;Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10-12; Rev. 4:3; 21:10-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The New Jerusalem is a composition of divinity and humanity blended and mingled together as one entity; all the components have the same life, nature, and constitution, and thus are a corporate person&mdash;vv. 2, 10-21.</li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem is the expansion and expression of the processed and consummated Triune God with His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, built up, conformed, and glorified people&mdash; vv. 10-11.</li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem is God Himself enlarged with His redeemed by the way of constituting, uniting, and mingling&mdash;John 3:29a, 30a; 14:20; 15:4a; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem is God&rsquo;s enlargement and expansion, God&rsquo;s expression in eternity, which is the corporate God&mdash;Gen. 1:1; John 1:1, 14; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rev. 22:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In Genesis 1 God is only <em>Elohim,</em> but He planned to have Himself, the unlimited Triune God, enlarged to be the New Jerusalem as seen in Revelation 21 and 22&mdash;Eph. 1:5, 9, 11; Rev. 4:11:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In the beginning of the Bible, there is one single God; at the end there is a corporate God&mdash;the New Jerusalem&mdash;21:2.</li>
			<li>In the beginning He is the simple God, who is triune; at the end a city appears, and that is the corporate God&mdash;v. 10.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Those who participate in the New Jerusalem are all God&rsquo;s children, God&rsquo;s kind, God&rsquo;s species; hence, the New Jerusalem is the corporate God&mdash;John 1:12-13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem is the mass reproduction of the firstborn Son of God&mdash;Rom. 8:29; Rev. 21:7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ is the firstborn Son, and we are His many &ldquo;twins&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. 2:11-12.</li>
		<li>The New Jerusalem is God the Father with many &ldquo;God the sons&rdquo;&mdash;Rev. 21:7; Heb. 2:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem is the aggregate, the totality, of the many God-men&mdash;Rev. 21:7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to make the believers God-men for the constitution of the Body of Christ that the New Jerusalem may be consummated as the eternal enlargement and expression of the processed and consummated Triune God&mdash; Gal. 3:26; 4:7, 26, 31.</li>
		<li>The New Jerusalem is the God-men who have been transformed, glorified, and mingled with the processed and consummated Triune God&mdash;John 17:22-23a; Eph. 4:4-6.</li>
		<li>The issue of the Bible&rsquo;s teaching is just one entity, the New Jerusalem, as the aggregate of all the God-men&mdash;Rev. 21:7; Heb. 2:10-11; 12:22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The ultimate purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation is to work on all those whom He chose in eternity to such an extent that they become wholly like Him in the divine glory to express the glorious image of God as jasper for His eternal enlargement and expression&mdash;Rev. 4:3; 21:10-11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s purpose in creating the universe is to produce such jasper&mdash;4:11; Eph. 1:9, 11; 3:11; Rom. 8:28; 2 Tim. 1:9.</li>
		<li>We are in the process of being made &ldquo;a piece of God,&rdquo; to look the same as God&mdash;jasper&mdash;Rev. 4:3; 21:11.</li>

Rev. 22:1-2; 21:2, 9, 18-21; 22:17a</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God&rsquo;s eternal intention for us to become the New Jerusalem is seen in Genesis 1&mdash;2 as the organic blueprint, the architectural plan of the Triune God, and in Revelation 21&mdash;22 as the finished product, the organic masterpiece of the Triune God, to be the model of what we are and how we work&mdash;Heb. 11:10; Eph. 2:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man is a vessel created according to God&rsquo;s kind that man might contain and express Him&mdash;Gen. 2:7; Rom. 9:21, 23; 2 Cor. 4:6-7; Rev. 22:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God created man in His image and according to His likeness, making man a duplicate, a copy, of Himself for His glory, His expression&mdash;Gen. 1:26; Acts 17:28-29a; Isa. 43:7; Rev. 4:3; 21:11.</li>
		<li>God created man to represent Him with His dominion, His authority&mdash;Gen. 1:26; Rom. 5:17; Rev. 20:4, 6; 22:5.</li>
		<li>God created man with a human spirit to contact, receive, and contain God&mdash;Gen. 2:7; Prov. 20:27; 2 Tim. 4:22:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Within us we have two lamps, the Spirit of God and our spirit, shining and enlightening our inward parts to supply us with the divine life so that we can become the city of life&mdash;Rev. 4:5; Prov. 20:27.</li>
			<li>We become the New Jerusalem by exercising our spirit to enjoy the Triune God&mdash;Jude 19-21; John 4:14b, 24; 1 Tim. 4:7; 3:15.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>God has implanted eternity in man&rsquo;s heart&mdash;Eccl. 3:11:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Man has a deep desire for permanent things, and the only things which are permanent are the eternal things, the life of eternity, the life of God&mdash;2 Cor. 4:16-18; Eph. 3:17.</li>
			<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover us, His church, from things seen to things unseen, from things which are temporary to things which are eternal&mdash;Rom. 8:24-25; Heb. 11:27; 1 Pet. 1:8.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The tree of life is the center of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Gen. 2:7-9; Rev. 22:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The tree of life signifies the crucified and resurrected Christ who imparts life to man and who pleases and satisfies man in an edible form&mdash;John 14:6; 15:1; Exo. 15:25; Rev. 2:7; John 6:57.</li>
		<li>The principle of the tree of life is the principle of dependence on God for everything&mdash;cf. Heb. 11:8; Josh. 9:14; Isa. 9:6; Psa. 16:7-8; Matt. 14:19.</li>
		<li>Anything we do independently of the Lord is in the principle of the tree of knowledge&mdash;John 5:39-40; 2 Cor. 3:6.</li>
		<li>Every genuine believer in Christ is a miniature garden of Eden, with God as the tree of life in his spirit and Satan as the tree of knowledge in his flesh&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>A river of water of life is flowing in four branches to reach the four directions of the earth&mdash;Gen. 2:10-14; Rev. 22:1; cf. 21:13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first branch is Pishon, which means <em>flowing free,</em> revealing that the river of water of life flows freely to cause everything of life to grow&mdash;Gen. 2:11-12; cf. Isa. 55:1; Rev. 22:17.</li>
		<li>The second branch is Gihon, which means <em>a bursting forth,</em> implying the fullness of the flow of the divine life&mdash;Gen. 2:13; cf. John 4:14; 7:38.</li>
		<li>The third branch is Hiddekel, which means <em>a rapid,</em> implying power&mdash;Gen. 2:14a; Phil. 3:10; Eph. 1:19-23.</li>
		<li>The fourth branch is Perath (Euphrates), meaning <em>sweet, making fertile or fruitful,</em> revealing that the flow of the living water makes us sweet, fertile, and fruitful&mdash;Gen. 2:14b; cf. 2 Cor. 2:14; 2 Pet. 1:3-8, 11; Gal. 5:22-23; John 15:8, 16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>At the flow of the river are three kinds of precious materials for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;Gen. 2:11-12; Rev. 21:11-14, 18-21:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The New Jerusalem is built by the Triune God, as the divine Architect and Builder, with Himself and His deified people as the material to be a miraculous structure of treasure; He is God in us to make us God in Him&mdash;Heb. 11:10; 1 Cor. 3:12; 1 Pet. 2:4-5; Rev. 21:3, 22; Eph. 1:11a, 18b; 3:21:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We need to pay the price to buy gold, signifying God in His divine nature&mdash;Rev. 3:18; Zech. 4:12-14, 6; Matt. 25:8-9.</li>
			<li>We need to abide in the death of Christ and enjoy His life-secreting resurrection to make us pearls for the building of God&rsquo;s eternal expression&mdash;Phil. 3:10; 1:19; cf. John 19:34; S. S. 2:8-9, 14.</li>
			<li>We need to experience the riches of Christ through sufferings, consuming pressures, and the killing work of the cross to be transformed into precious stones for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18; 4:10-11, 16; Rom. 8:28-29.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We need to build the New Jerusalem by ministering the Triune God into others for their transformation&mdash;Acts 6:4; S. S. 1:10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The goal is the producing of a couple, a corporate, great God-man&mdash;Gen. 2:22; Rev. 21:2, 9; 22:17a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God marries the bride as the consummation of the processed tripartite man&mdash;22:17a.</li>
		<li>The processed man will match the processed God forever for His full expression and satisfaction&mdash; 21:11, 23.</li>
		<li>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate and eternal Eve, the corporate bride, the wife of the Lamb, built up with precious materials produced by the flowing, transforming, and building resurrection life of Christ&mdash; Gen. 2:22:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The building of Eve with the rib taken out of Adam&rsquo;s side typifies the building of the church with the resurrection life of Christ&mdash;cf. John 19:34.</li>
			<li>Just as Eve was a pure product out of Adam, the church is a pure product out of Christ; anything that is other than Christ is not the church&mdash; Gen. 5:2; Eph. 5:28-32; cf. 1 Cor. 1:9.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>What is revealed in these two parts of the divine revelation in the holy Scripture is the central line of the divine revelation throughout the entire holy Scripture; this central line should be a controlling principle to our interpreting and understanding of the holy Scripture.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The New Jerusalem as God&rsquo;s holy city is God&rsquo;s universal building for His new creation out of His old creation; the New Jerusalem is the building of God&rsquo;s new creation&mdash;Rev. 21:2, 10; 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the Bible there are two creations&mdash;the old creation and the new creation&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation has God within it as its life, nature, appearance, and expression.</li>
		<li>The old creation as an empty vessel has no content of God, but the new creation as a corporate vessel has God as its content&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 3:19b.</li>
		<li>The old creation is old because God is not part of it; the new creation is new because God is in it&mdash; 4:22-24.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is not just to redeem, to bring back, to repossess, the fallen old creation, but to regenerate man to make him the new creation&mdash; John 3:3; 1:12-13; 2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s goal is to produce the new creation out of the old creation.</li>
		<li>The new creation is the old creation transformed by the divine life&mdash;Gal. 6:15.</li>
		<li>The new creation&mdash;the mingling of God with man&mdash; takes place when the Triune God in Christ as the Spirit is wrought into our being; this is the mingling of divinity with humanity&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17; Eph. 3:16-17a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem is the consummation of all the works of God&rsquo;s new creation out of His old creation in four ages: the age before the law, the age of the law, the age of grace, and the age of the kingdom&mdash;Rev. 21:1-2.</li>
	<li>As the new creation, the New Jerusalem is new because it is full of God&mdash;vv. 10, 5a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Everything designated <em>new</em> in the New Testament indicates or implies that God has been wrought into these items&mdash;Matt. 9:16-17; Col. 3:10.</li>
		<li>The New Jerusalem is new because, as God&rsquo;s new creation, it has God&rsquo;s nature of newness&mdash;Rev. 21:2, 5a.</li>
		<li>Since newness is God, to become new is to become God by having God wrought into us&mdash;Rom. 6:4; 7:6; Eph. 4:24.</li>
		<li>The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate consummation of the realm of newness, which is Christ&mdash; 2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We are in the process of being thoroughly and absolutely renewed to become the New Jerusalem&mdash;4:16; Rev. 3:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be renewed is to have God&rsquo;s ever-new essence dispensed into us to replace and discharge our old element&mdash;Rom. 12:2.</li>
		<li>The mingled spirit&mdash;the renewing Spirit mingled with our regenerated spirit&mdash;is spreading into our mind to renew our entire being&mdash;Eph. 4:23.</li>
		<li>We are in transit from the old creation to the new creation; we are passing through a tunnel out of the old into the new.</li>
		<li>Through the process of renewing, we are transferred from the realm of the old creation into the realm of the new creation to become the New Jerusalem&mdash;Col. 3:10; Rev. 21:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The new creation comes into being by resurrection&mdash; 2 Cor. 5:17; 1 Cor. 15:20, 23, 45:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>First Corinthians 15:45 implies the old creation with the soul as the center and the new creation with the Spirit as the center.</li>
		<li>The germinating element of the new creation is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</li>
		<li>The life-giving Spirit is the center and lifeline of the new creation&mdash;v. 45; 2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the New Jerusalem as the consummation of the new creation, everything will be in resurrection; the entire city will be in resurrection&mdash;Rev. 21:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The principle of resurrection is that the natural life is killed and the divine life rises up to take its place&mdash; Gal. 2:20.</li>
	<li>God Himself is resurrection, and we need to know Him as the God of resurrection&mdash;John 11:25; 2 Cor. 1:9; 4:14.</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit to enter into His believers, His germination of the new creation to impart the divine life into His believers for their regeneration, and His propagation to produce the church as His reproduction&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 1 Pet. 1:3; John 12:24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The result of Christ&rsquo;s transfiguration, germination, and propagation is that He lives in His believers&mdash;John 14:19b-20; Gal. 2:20.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s germination of the new creation is His propagation, His multiplication; this germination is the reproduction of the pneumatic Christ&mdash;John 12:24; 14:17-18; 20:22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To be in resurrection means that our natural life is crucified and that the God-created part of our being is uplifted to be one with Christ in resurrection&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17a; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
	<li>We should aspire to &ldquo;attain to the out-resurrection from the dead&rdquo;&mdash;Phil. 3:11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To arrive at the out-resurrection indicates that our entire being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;is gradually and continually resurrected.</li>
		<li>To be in the out-resurrection is to leave everything of the old creation and to be brought into God&mdash; 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15.</li>

Rev. 21:2, 9-10; 22:17a</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Ultimately, we are conformed to be the wonderful Shulammite, who, as the duplication of Solomon, is the greatest and ultimate figure of the New Jerusalem as the counterpart of Christ&mdash;S. S. 6:13; Rev. 21:2, 9-10; 22:17a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Shulammite</em> is the feminine form of <em>Solomon,</em> indicating that now the overcomers have become the same as Christ in life, in nature, in expression, and in function but not in the Godhead for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Just as King Solomon became a country man to court a country girl in order to make her his queen, his duplication, God in Christ became a man to court man in order to make man God in life, nature, expression, and function but not in the Godhead to be Christ&rsquo;s bride&mdash;Matt. 9:15; Rev. 19:7; cf. Psa. 45:1-3, 9, 13-14.</li>
		<li>The Bible reveals that God became a man to court us and that now He wants us to court Him by our becoming divine for His expression through our personal, affectionate, private, and spiritual relationship with Him&mdash;Eccl. 1:2; S. S. 1:1-8; cf. 2 Cor. 2:10; Exo. 3:11; Rom. 8:4, 6; 1 Cor. 2:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Shulammite is like two camps, or armies, in the sight of God&mdash;S. S. 6:13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The phrase <em>two armies</em> in Hebrew is <em>Mahanaim.</em></li>
		<li>When Jacob was on the way to confront Esau, the angels of God met him, and he called the name of that place Mahanaim&mdash;Gen. 32:1-2.</li>
		<li>After he saw the two armies of God, Jacob divided his wives, children, and possessions into two groups or &ldquo;two armies,&rdquo; indicating that we are more than conquerors and that we bear a strong testimony&mdash; v. 7.</li>
		<li>It also indicates that God does not want &ldquo;giants,&rdquo; but only the feeble ones, the weaker ones, the women and children&mdash;2 Cor. 11:29; Rom. 9:16.</li>
		<li>All who are strong in themselves will be disqualified; those who are counted as the overcomers will be the weaker ones, who utterly depend on the Lord in the principle of the Body&mdash;Rev. 3:8; 1 Pet. 5:5; Deut. 32:30; Eccl. 4:9-12; Rom. 16:20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Eventually, Christ&rsquo;s lovers who are becoming His duplication need to share in His work (2 Cor. 6:1a) by being equipped with all the attributes of the divine life to be expressed in their human virtues:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Actually, to work with Christ we must be Christ; Paul was a real Shulammite because he lived Christ&mdash;Phil. 1:21a.</li>
	<li>The Spirit, esteeming the Shulammite as one of the royal household, reviews her virtues, presenting a beautiful portrait of the lovely lover of Christ from her feet to her head as an expression of Christ, whom she loves&mdash;Rom. 5:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;How beautiful are your footsteps in sandals, / O prince&rsquo;s daughter!&rdquo; (S. S. 7:1a)&mdash;this signifies the beauty of her action and her move in the preaching of the full gospel with its power to separate her from the defiling world&mdash;Rom. 10:14-15; Eph. 6:15.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Your rounded thighs are like jewels, / The work of the hands of a skilled artist&rdquo; (S. S. 7:1b; cf. Gen. 32:25)&mdash;this signifies her standing power and stability through the skillful transforming work of God the Spirit&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Your neck is like a tower of ivory&rdquo; (S. S. 7:4a; cf. 4:4)&mdash;this signifies her submissive will wrought by the Spirit&rsquo;s transformation with the resurrection life through sufferings for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s will&mdash;1 Kings 10:18; Col. 1:24.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Your eyes, like the pools in Heshbon / By the gate of Bath-rabbim&rdquo; (S. S. 7:4b; cf. 1:15)&mdash;this signifies that her heart is open to the light, clean, full of rest, and accessible and that her spiritual sight has been broadened and enlarged to see the Lord&rsquo;s interests in the whole universe&mdash;Matt. 5:8.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, / Which faces Damascus&rdquo; (S. S. 7:4c; cf. Lev. 21:18)&mdash;this signifies her spiritual sense of high and sharp discernment.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Your head upon you is like Carmel, / And the locks of your head like purple. / The king is fettered by your tresses&rdquo; (S. S. 7:5)&mdash;this signifies that her thoughts and intentions are strong for God (cf. 1 Kings 18:19-39) and that the Lord has become a captive to her beautiful submission, which brings in the Lord&rsquo;s kingship and authority.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Shulammite works as Solomon&rsquo;s counterpart to carry out with her Beloved the work that is for the entire world by sojourning from one place to another&mdash; S. S. 7:11; Rev. 14:4.</li>
	<li>She and her Beloved work diligently not for herself but in the churches, for others to bud, blossom, and bloom, in which she renders her love to her Beloved&mdash;S. S. 7:12; cf. 1:6b.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Because the Christ-seeker&rsquo;s heart is fully possessed by Him, she has become mature in the divine life and is filled with a hope to be raptured&mdash;S. S. 8:13-14; Psa. 73:25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>She is passing through the process of coming out of the earthly wilderness to be raptured by leaning on her Beloved, trusting in the Lord helplessly until the wilderness journey is over&mdash;S. S. 8:5a; Gen. 5:22-24; Heb. 11:5-6, 13.</li>
	<li>She realizes that whether she can endure to the end does not depend on her own endurance, but on the Lord&rsquo;s preservation, so she asks the Lord to set her as a seal on His heart, the place of His keeping love, and on His arm, the place of His preserving power&mdash;S. S. 8:6-7.</li>
	<li>She asks the Lord, the One who dwells in the believers as His gardens, to let her hear His voice&mdash;v. 13; cf. 2:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Our lives (to become the New Jerusalem) depend on the Lord&rsquo;s words, and our work (to build the New Jerusalem) depends on His commands&mdash;1 Sam. 3:9-10; Luke 10:39, 42; Rev. 1:20; John 1:1; cf. Rev. 21:2.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Jacob&rsquo;s dream was a dream of God&rsquo;s goal, a dream of Bethel, a dream of the house of God (Gen. 28:10-22), which is the church today (1 Tim. 3:15) and which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal dwelling place of God and His redeemed elect (Rev. 21:3, 22):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God had a dream, and that dream was to have the New Jerusalem, a built up city, as the consummation of His economy&mdash;Rev. 21:2.</li>
	<li>Our dream is to become the New Jerusalem as the consummation of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;vv. 9-10.</li>
	<li>The principle of a dream is that in it something impossible happens to us&mdash;cf. Luke 1:37; 18:27; Job 42:2; Psa. 126:1; Jer. 32:27:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Every spiritual vision is a dream; every spiritual experience is a dream.</li>
		<li>Most heavenly visions come in times of suffering, when we are cut off from what is of man and put our trust in what is of God&mdash;cf. Gen. 28:10-12a.</li>
		<li>The center of every spiritual dream is Christ as the ladder, the One who brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven&mdash;John 1:51.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Jacob&rsquo;s dream in Genesis 28 is the most crucial word in the revelation of God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ, in His being the heavenly ladder at Bethel, speaks to us how God desires to have a house on the earth constituted with His redeemed and transformed elect, that He may bring heaven to earth and join earth to heaven, to make the two as one for eternity&mdash;John 1:51; Gen. 28:10-22:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In His humanity Christ became a joining ladder, to join heaven (God) and earth (man) into one&mdash;Gen. 28:12-17; John 1:1, 51:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>By His coming through incarnation, the Lord Jesus brought God into man&mdash;v. 14.</li>
		<li>By His going through death and resurrection, the Lord Jesus brought man into God&mdash;14:6, 20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The building of God, the house of God, is the mutual abode of God and man; God&rsquo;s home is man and man&rsquo;s home is God&mdash;Isa. 66:1-2; 1 Cor. 3:16; Psa. 90:1; John 15:5; 14:23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The main principle of the building of God is that God is brought into us and we are brought into God.</li>
		<li>God became man through incarnation (bringing heaven to earth), and man becomes God through transformation (joining earth to heaven):
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God&rsquo;s referring to Himself as the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac implies that He would also become the God of Jacob&mdash;Gen. 28:13.</li>
			<li>The God of Abraham is the God of justification, the God of Isaac is the God of grace, and the God of Jacob is the God of transformation through the discipline of the transforming Spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:28-29; 12:2.</li>
			<li>Eventually, the God of Jacob became the God of Israel (Gen. 33:20; Exo. 5:1), the God of the transformed Jacob&mdash;Gal. 6:16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In eternity future the New Jerusalem will be standing in the whole universe as something uplifted toward the heavens upon which the angelic family will ascend and descend to bring heaven to earth and join earth to heaven for the divine traffic, the divine fellowship, between God and man&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s economy will consummate in such a ladder, a city, and this city is an incorporation of God in man and man in God&mdash;Rev. 21:3, 22.</li>
	<li>Whenever we turn to our spirit, we sense Christ bringing God (heaven) to us and joining us to God (heaven); thus, Christ as the heavenly ladder is the stairway to bring God to us and join us to God&mdash;John 14:6; Eph. 2:22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Since today our spirit is the place of God&rsquo;s habitation, it is now the gate of heaven, where Christ is the ladder that joins us, the people on earth, to heaven, and brings heaven to us&mdash;Eph. 2:22; 2 Tim. 4:22; cf. Acts 7:55-56.</li>
		<li>Whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter through the gate of heaven and touch the throne of grace in heaven through Christ as the heavenly ladder&mdash; Heb. 4:16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the duplication of Christ, we are a heavenly ladder bringing heaven to earth and joining earth to heaven, moving with God in the unshakable power of the Spirit&mdash;cf. S. S. 3:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When we minister Christ to sinners, they will appreciate Christ and receive Christ; this is to bring heaven to the earth&mdash;Rom. 15:16.</li>
		<li>When we help them to grow, we are joining them to heaven&mdash;Col. 1:28-29.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the account of Jacob&rsquo;s dream, the stone (Gen. 28:11, 18, 22), the pillar (v. 18), the house of God (vv. 17, 19, 22), and the oil (v. 18) are outstanding items:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The stone symbolizes Christ as the foundation stone, the topstone, and the cornerstone for God&rsquo;s building, His spiritual house&mdash;Isa. 28:16; Zech. 4:7; Acts 4:10-12.</li>
	<li>It also symbolizes the transformed man, who has been constituted with Christ as the transforming element to be the material for the building of God&rsquo;s house, which is the church consummating in the New Jerusalem&mdash; Gen. 2:12; Matt. 16:18; John 1:42; 1 Cor. 3:12; 1 Pet. 2:5; Rev. 21:11, 18-20.</li>
	<li>Jacob used a stone for a pillow, signifying that the divine element of Christ constituted into our being through our experience of Him becomes a pillow for our rest, the solid support within us&mdash;cf. Matt. 11:28.</li>
	<li>After awaking from his dream, Jacob set up the pillow-stone as a pillar, signifying that the Christ whom we have experienced and on whom we rest becomes the material and the support for God&rsquo;s building, God&rsquo;s house&mdash;1 Kings 7:17, 21; Gal. 2:9; Rev. 3:12.</li>
	<li>Eventually, Jacob poured oil, a symbol of the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God reaching man (Exo. 30:23-30; Luke 4:18), on the pillar, and it became Bethel, the house of God (Gen. 28:17-19, 22).</li>
	<li>Today in the church life we are in the reality of Bethel, in the fulfillment of Jacob&rsquo;s dream with the heavenly ladder, the stone, the pillar, God&rsquo;s house, and the oil; this will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal Bethel, the eternal house of God&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15; Rev. 21:3, 22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The house of God is constituted of God and man united, mingled, and incorporated together as one&mdash; John 14:23; 1 John 4:15-16; cf. Acts 17:24.</li>

			<li>The first element is the unique oneness of the universal Body of Christ, which is called &ldquo;the oneness of the Spirit&rdquo;&mdash;Eph. 4:3; cf. John 17:6, 11, 14-21, 22-24.</li>
			<li>The second element is the unique ground of the locality in which a local church is established and exists&mdash;Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rom. 16:1; 1 Cor. 1:2.</li>
			<li>The third element is the reality of the Spirit of oneness, who is the living reality of the Divine Trinity&mdash;1 John 5:6; John 16:13; Eph. 4:4-6.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Ephesians 1:22b-23a says, &ldquo;The church, which is His Body&rdquo;&mdash;this indicates that the Body is the intrinsic significance of the church:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church of God is the frame, and the Body of Christ is the organism&mdash;4:4-6:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>If there were no Body, the church would have no meaning.</li>
			<li>We need to be in the local churches so that we can be brought into the reality of the Body of Christ&mdash;Rom. 12:1-5.</li>
			<li>The local churches are nearly ninety percent physical, but they should be for something spiritual&mdash;the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12-13.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In the first chapter of Revelation, we see the local churches, but in the last two chapters, we see only one city&mdash;1:11; 21:2:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Eventually, the local churches will be over; only the Body will remain forever.</li>
			<li>The Body of Christ in its ultimate consummation is the unique tabernacle of God, as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on this earth, the unique bride of the Lamb&mdash;21:2-3.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s desire is to gain the New Jerusalem through the precursor of the organic Body of Christ produced in the local churches:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The overcoming God-men build up the Body of Christ for the building and consummating of the New Jerusalem&mdash;cf. Gen. 2:22; Matt. 16:18; Rev. 19:7; 21:2.</li>
		<li>Even today the New Jerusalem is still under construction; the organic building up of the Body of Christ consummates the New Jerusalem&mdash;1 Cor. 3:9, 12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As we grow in the divine life and minister the Triune God to others for their growth in the divine life, we are building up the Body of Christ, which will consummate the New Jerusalem:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The organic building up of the Body of Christ is the increase of the Triune God in the believers for their growth in Christ as life for them to become the New Jerusalem&mdash;Col. 2:19; Eph. 2:21-22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The organic building up of the Body is the growth of the Body through the members of the Body growing up into Christ, the Head, in all things&mdash;4:15-16.</li>
		<li>The organic building up of the Body of Christ is through the members of the Body feeding on the milk and food of the holy Word, the embodiment of Christ as the living Word of God&mdash;1 Pet. 2:2; Heb. 5:13-14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The organic building up of the Body of Christ is also through the saints being perfected to do the work of the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers for them to build the New Jerusalem&mdash;Eph. 4:8, 11-12, 16; 2 Tim. 2:1-2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The saints are perfected by the perfecting gifts with the life supply as the nourishment for the growth in life&mdash;1 Cor. 3:2, 6.</li>
		<li>The Body is built directly by all the members of Christ functioning, each in his own measure, mainly in prophesying, speaking for the Lord&mdash; Eph. 4:16; 1 Cor. 14:4b, 31.</li>
		<li>According to the type of the priesthood in the Old Testament, we need to be perfected in the New Testament priesthood of the gospel (Rom. 15:16) to do four main items:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Just as the priests were perfected to offer the sacrifices at the altar (Lev. 6:8&mdash;7:38), we need to be perfected to enjoy Christ as the reality of all the offerings and to offer the saved sinners to God as acceptable sacrifices through the preaching of the gospel&mdash;Rom. 15:16.</li>
			<li>Just as the priests were perfected to display the bread of the Presence (Lev. 24:5-8; Exo. 25:30), we need to be perfected to dispense Christ into people as their life supply&mdash;Acts 5:20; 6:4.</li>
			<li>Just as the priests were perfected to trim the wicks and fill the lamps with oil to make the lampstand shine brightly (Lev. 24:1-4), we need to be perfected to be filled with the Spirit as the oil and to minister Christ as the divine light with and in the Spirit to the saints&mdash;Acts 26:18.</li>
			<li>Just as the priests were perfected to burn the incense (Exo. 30:6-8), we need to be perfected to fellowship with God in prayer, talking to Him in a conversational way to enjoy His presence for the carrying out of His interests&mdash;Eph. 6:17-18; Dan. 6:10.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We are being perfected to do the work of the New Testament ministry, that is, to build up the Body of Christ for the building of the New Jerusalem&mdash;Eph. 4:11-12.</li>

	<li>Jerusalem typifies the church, and Zion typifies the overcomers in the church:
		<ol class="decimal">

	<li>The reality of the Body of Christ (Zion) is the corporate living of the perfected God-men, who are genuine men but live by the life of the processed and consummated Triune God, whose attributes are expressed through their virtues&mdash;Gal. 2:20; Phil. 3:10; 1:19-21a.</li>
	<li>The reality of the Body of Christ is a mingling living in the eternal union of the regenerated and transformed tripartite God-men with the Triune God in the resurrection life of Christ; this mingling living will consummate in the New Jerusalem&mdash;Eph. 4:16; Rev. 21:2.</li>
	<li>We should pay more attention to the Body of Christ than to the local churches&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12-13; 1:2; Rom. 12:4-5; 16:1, 4-5:

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The New Jerusalem is the Triune God, the Divine Trinity, as three basic factors (signified by gold, pearls, and precious stones), wrought into and structured together with His redeemed as the conclusion of the whole Bible&mdash;Rev. 21:18-21; cf. 17:4.</li>
<li>We need to be constituted with the Triune God as our intrinsic elements for us to become the New Jerusalem&mdash;Gen. 2:10-12; Rev. 21:18-21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We need to adorn and consummate the New Jerusalem (vv. 2, 19) with God the Father as its golden base, God the Son as its pearl gates, and God the Spirit for its wall of precious stones, by drinking the Spirit, the flowing Triune God, as the river of water of life, and eating Christ, the overcoming Lion-Lamb, as the tree of life with His rich and fresh supply (22:1-2):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to daily drink the Spirit as the river of water of life by exercising our spirit to call on the Lord continually and draw water with joy from Him as the fountain of living water&mdash;Isa. 12:3-4; 1 Cor. 12:13, 3b; John 4:10, 14.</li>
		<li>We need to daily eat Christ as the tree of life by exercising our spirit to pray-read His word and receive His word with much reconsideration&mdash;Eph. 6:17-18; John 6:57, 63; Jer. 15:16; cf. Lev. 11:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to pay the price to buy gold, signifying God in His divine nature&mdash;Rev. 21:18; 3:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Having the filling of the Spirit with the divine nature, signified by the golden oil in Zechariah 4:12, is at a cost, such as giving up the world, dealing with self, loving the Lord above all, and counting all things loss for Christ; if we do not pay the price today, we will have to pay it after we are resurrected&mdash;Rev. 3:18; Matt. 25:8-9.</li>
		<li>Our Christian life should be regulated by the divine nature as our unique street&mdash;Rev. 21:21b; 22:1.</li>
		<li>Through the promises of God, we can enjoy the divine nature wrought into our being as our intrinsic element&mdash;2 Pet. 1:4; cf. Matt. 6:33; Phil. 4:6-7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to experience Christ, as the reality of the pearl gates, in His redeeming and life-releasing death and His life-dispensing resurrection:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>An oyster (Christ) lives in the salty water (the world of death) and is wounded by a grain of sand (crucified for the sinner) to produce a pearl by secreting its life-juice (dispensing His life element)&mdash;cf. Rev. 21:21a.</li>
		<li>We need to daily experience the death of Christ subjectively by the power of His resurrection to be conformed to His death&mdash;Phil. 3:10; 1 Cor. 15:31b; Gal. 6:17-18; cf. S. S. 2:8-9, 14-15.</li>

		<li>For the church life, there is the need of the transformed human virtues, which have been strengthened and enriched by the divine attributes&mdash;Rom. 12:2-3; Eph. 4:1-3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to minister the Triune God into people to be their intrinsic elements for us to build the New Jerusalem&mdash;1 Cor. 3:9-12; Ezek. 22:30; cf. Num. 18:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We need to build the church for the building of the New Jerusalem with gold (God in His divine nature), silver (Christ in His redemptive work&mdash;corresponding to pearls in Rev. 21:21), and precious stones (the Spirit in His transforming work)&mdash;1 Cor. 3:12; cf. S. S. 1:10-11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Our move in the Lord&rsquo;s move should be based upon His golden nature in the flow of the Spirit, the fellowship of the divine life&mdash;Rev. 22:1; 14:4.</li>
		<li>We need to go out with God to the four directions of the earth to preach regeneration through the death-overcoming and life-secreting Christ as the entrance into the holy city (1 Pet. 1:3, 23) and remain under the killing of the Lord&rsquo;s death so that His resurrection life may be imparted into others through us (Col. 1:24; 2 Cor. 4:10-12).</li>
		<li>We need to minister the transforming and building life of Christ for the believers&rsquo; transformation and building&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18; Eph. 4:16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To build with the worthless materials of wood (the human nature), grass (man in the flesh&mdash;Isa. 40:6-7), and stubble (lifelessness) is to destroy (ruin, corrupt, defile, or mar) the temple of God&mdash;1 Cor. 3:12, 17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>All that we do in our service to the Lord should be out from Him as the source, through Him as the means, and to Him for His glory&mdash;Rom. 11:36; cf. Num. 18:1:

			<li>The result of God&rsquo;s work should be for God&rsquo;s glory, not our glory&mdash;John 7:18; 1 Cor. 10:31.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We need to be burning in spirit, serving the Lord as a slave with the fire of His life, not with strange fire, signifying natural enthusiasm, which brings in spiritual death&mdash;Rom. 12:11; Lev. 10:1-2; cf. Exo. 3:2, 6.</li>
		<li>The building work with gold, silver, and precious stones will be rewarded by the Lord at His coming back; if it is with wood, grass, and stubble, it will be burned on the day of the Lord&rsquo;s coming&mdash;1 Cor. 3:12-15.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The New Jerusalem is the destination of the flowing Triune God:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;The water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water gushing up into eternal life&rdquo;&mdash;John 4:14b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Triune God flows in the Divine Trinity in three stages: The Father is the fountain, the Son is the spring, and the Spirit is the river.</li>
		<li>This flowing Triune God is &ldquo;into eternal life&rdquo;:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The New Jerusalem is the totality of the eternal life; thus, <em>into eternal life</em> means &ldquo;into the New Jerusalem. &rdquo;</li>
			<li><em>Into</em> speaks of the destination; <em>into</em> means &ldquo;issuing in, to be, or to become&rdquo;; <em>into the New Jerusalem</em> means &ldquo;to become the New Jerusalem.&rdquo;</li>
			<li>The Father as the fountain, the Son as the spring, and the Spirit as the river flow into us and with us into the New Jerusalem to be the New Jerusalem.</li>
			<li>The Father as the fountain, the Son as the spring, and the Spirit as the river all take the New Jerusalem as Their eternal goal.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In the beginning, in eternity past, was the Word, who was God; in eternity future, the Word becomes the New Jerusalem&mdash;John 1:1; 4:14b; Rev. 21:10.</li>
		<li>The triune, eternal God becomes the New Jerusalem incorporated with all of us by the divine speaking, divine spreading, divine dispensing, of Himself into us as the flowing Triune God for our enjoyment to be our eternal blessing for His eternal glory&mdash;Rev. 22:1-2, 17; cf. Num. 6:22-27; 2 Cor. 13:14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem is the destination of the line of life throughout the Bible, and the lake of fire is the destination of the line of knowledge&mdash;Gen. 2:8-9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>At the end of the Bible we have two results, two consummations&mdash;a city of living water (Rev. 22:1) and a lake of burning fire (20:10, 14-15; 21:8).</li>
		<li>The river of water for reviving and watering proceeds out of the throne of God and will flow all positive things into the New Jerusalem&mdash;22:1.</li>
		<li>The stream of fire for judging issues out of the throne of God and will sweep all negative things into the lake of fire&mdash;Dan. 7:9-10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to exercise our spirit to enjoy the flowing Triune God within us, in the midst of an environment of heat and pressure, so that we may be transformed into precious materials for us to become the New Jerusalem&mdash;Gen. 2:10-12; 1 Cor. 3:12; Rev. 21:18-21; John 4:14b, 24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The river of water of life is the flowing out of the Triune God&mdash;the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God reaching His redeemed people for their enjoyment&mdash;Rev. 22:1; Psa. 36:8-9; 46:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s intention in His economy is to be the fountain, the source, of living waters to satisfy His chosen people for their enjoyment, with the goal of producing the Body of Christ, consummating in the New Jerusalem as God&rsquo;s fullness for His expression&mdash;Jer. 2:13; Lam. 3:22-24.</li>
		<li>Our drinking of the one Spirit makes us members of the Body, builds us up as the Body, and prepares us to be the bride of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 12:13; Rev. 22:17.</li>
		<li>By drinking the living water, we become the New Jerusalem, the totality of the eternal life, the destination of the flowing Triune God&mdash; John 4:14b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As believers in Christ, we need to drink and flow the water of life&mdash;John 4:10, 14; 7:37-39; cf. Prov. 11:25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To drink the water of life, there is the need of thirst&mdash;Exo. 17:3a; Psa. 42:1; John 7:37; Rev. 21:6.</li>
		<li>We need to come to the Lord and ask Him to give us the living water&mdash;John 7:37; Rev. 22:17; John 4:10.</li>
		<li>We need to contact God the Spirit in our human spirit and in truthfulness&mdash;John 4:23-24; cf. Jude 19-21.</li>

			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We need to practice speaking with the Lord constantly&mdash;Phil. 4:6-7, 12.</li>

			<li>We need to give the Lord the preeminence in our being&mdash;Rev. 22:1; Col. 1:18b.</li>
			<li>We need to do everything in the inner flow of the divine life, the fellowship of the divine life, according to the divine nature&mdash;1 John 1:3; Rev. 22:1; Ezek. 47:1; 2 Pet. 1:4.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to work with the Lord in the divine stream, the stream of the work of God, the fellowship, the flow, of the divine life for us to build the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rev. 22:1-2; John 7:37-39:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To have fellowship with the Triune God in the apostles&rsquo; fellowship is to put aside our private interests and to join with the apostles and the Triune God for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;1 John 1:3.</li>
	<li>The flowing of the divine life, which started on the day of Pentecost and has been flowing throughout all the generations to this day, is just one stream&mdash;cf. Acts 15:39-41.</li>
	<li>Wherever the stream of the divine life is, precious materials will be produced for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;Gen. 2:10-12.</li>
