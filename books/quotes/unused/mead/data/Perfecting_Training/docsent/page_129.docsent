   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SIN AND RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us study something further.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Two of these three facts have factors.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The body is dead has a factor, and the spirit is life has a factor also.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is a reason that the body is dead, and there is a reason that the spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The body is dead because of sin, and the spirit is life because of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are two things here: sin and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sin is the factor that our body is dead, and righteousness is the factor that our spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One verse in the New Testament, 2 Corinthians 5:21, covers sin and righteousness clearly, definitely, correctly, and accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It says, "Him Who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf, that we might become God's righteousness in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ was made sin for us, that we might become God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that God made Christ sin on our behalf, that we might become God's righteousness in Him, that is, in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This verse covers two crucial things sin and righteousness and if we would experience Romans 8:10 we must get into this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our body is dead because of sin, and our spirit is life because of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And Christ was made by God to be the sin which is the factor of our body being dead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And we become the righteousness which is the factor of our spirit being life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not easy to apprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And what is righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although we cannot cover these two matters thoroughly at this time, still I would tell you that sin is Satan, and righteousness is God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to realize that sin is the embodiment of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When sin is personified it is Satan, because sin is the very embodiment of Satan, the totality of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the same principle, righteousness is just the totality of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When righteousness is personified, it is God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jeremiah 23:6 speaks of "the Lord our Righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that the Lord God Himself, not just some kind of virtue in His divine nature, is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the New Testament, especially in 1 Corinthians 1:30, we are told that Christ today is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Righteousness is a person, a unique person God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not an angel that is righteousness, and it is not a man which is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Righteousness is a person; so sin must also be a person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are captives either of God or of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You have to realize that when Satan seduced man and entered into man, he became sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sin is the very rebel of God who seduced man and entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now we need to read Romans 7:17 and 18: "So now it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to do the good is not."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By reading these two verses in Romans 7 we can see that sin must be a person because it can deceive me, it can kill me, and it dwells in me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No doubt, this sin, this person, is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Of course, we have already pointed out that righteousness is the very divine Person of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God Himself is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When man got fallen, sin, or Satan, entered into him, into his body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why Romans 7:23 speaks of the sin in the members of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because sin is in our body, sin corrupts our body, making our body no more a pure body, but flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God never created a flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God created a body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But sin has made our God-created body a fallen flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But now we have gotten saved, and God has entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When God entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God became our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Into what part did God enter?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sin entered into our body, and sin brought in death, or issued in death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to Romans 5:12, sin entered into the world and death followed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sin brought in death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the same principle, when righteousness entered into our spirit, righteousness brought in life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>So both Romans 5:17 and 21 speak of righteousness issuing in life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This righteousness is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all have to realize that we have one person in our body, who is termed sin, and we have another person in our spirit, who is called righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sin in our body makes our body dead.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Righteousness in our spirit makes our spirit life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is not only living but even the source of being living, that is, life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>According to your Christian discovery, haven't you realized that in your body there is nothing good, that in your flesh there is nothing good?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All the things there are bad.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Also in your Christian discovery, haven't you seen that in your spirit there is life?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Not only are many good things there, but life is there.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even while you were doing something sinful, within there is a part that is vigorous.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Nothing can quench it, and nothing can put it down.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even if you try to put it down, it still jumps up.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Something vital and something vigorous is in your being, and that is your spirit being life through righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>And this righteousness is just God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>RIGHT WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Still you may ask concerning the definition of sin and concerning the definition of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is not so easy to give a satisfactory definition of these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>According to my experience righteousness means to be right with God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Why is telling a lie sin?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>And why is telling the truth righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is because telling the truth is right with God, and telling a lie is rebellion against God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What is righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is to be right with God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>What is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is to rebel against God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Even if you give a gift to a person, if that is against God, it is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You may tell the truth to someone, yet if that telling of the truth is against God, it is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Sin is rebellion against God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Righteousness is to be right with God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In the whole universe the standard is not any kind of regulation or law; the standard is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When you are right with Him, that is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When you are against Him, that is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Do you realize that even a good thing such as the preaching of the gospel could be sin?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Your preaching of the gospel might be something not according to God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It might be according to your preference and your choice.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This would mean it is not right with God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Instead of being righteousness, it would be rebellion against God.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We have to realize that in our flesh, in our body, there is nothing but just the totality of rebellion against God.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Not only when your body does bad things, but even when your body does good things, it is still in rebellion against God.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is not right with God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>But what is right with God is in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>What is in your spirit is always right with God; even that is God Himself, because God Himself is in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>As long as you have God, as long as you live God, and as long as you go along with God, you are right with God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>So you have the righteousness of God, and this righteousness is the factor causing your spirit to be life.</S>
