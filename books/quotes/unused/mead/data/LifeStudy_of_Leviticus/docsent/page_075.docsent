   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>X. THE SIN OFFERING BEING SLAUGHTERED IN THE PLACE WHERE THE BURNT OFFERING IS SLAUGHTERED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The sin offering was to be slaughtered in the place where the burnt offering was slaughtered Lev 6:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indicates that the sin offering is based upon the burnt offering, and it signifies that Christ is the sin offering for us based upon His being the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ must be the burnt offering for God's satisfaction that He might be qualified to be our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we have never enjoyed Christ as the burnt offering, we cannot realize how sinful we are.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We heard the gospel and repented, realizing that we are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But we cannot know how sinful we are until we enjoy Christ as our burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The burnt offering means that mankind, created by God for the purpose of expressing and representing Him, should be for nothing other than God and should be absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, we are not absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to realize this and take Christ as our burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only when we enjoy Christ as our burnt offering will we realize how sinful we are.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we realize how sinful we are, we will know that our love as well as our hate may be sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ethically, to hate others is wrong and to love others is right.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may think that in the eyes of God loving others is acceptable and hating others is not acceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But in the eyes of God we hate people for ourselves and also love people for ourselves, not for God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From this point of view, loving others is just as sinful as hating others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whatever we do for ourselves and not for God whether it is moral or immoral, good or evil, a matter of love or of hate is sinful in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As long as you do a certain thing for yourself, it is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God created us that we might be for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He created us to be His expression and His representation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not create us for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But we live independently of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we hate others, we are independent of God, and when we love others, we are also independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that in God's sight our hatred and our love are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, neither our hatred nor our love is from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, both our hatred and our love are from our flesh, and both are from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not think that only doing evil is of Satan and doing good is not.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Doing both good and evil may be of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to realize that anything we do out of ourselves, whether good or evil, is for ourselves, and since it is for ourselves it is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I would point out once again that sin involves a power struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may love others for ourselves for our name, position, benefit, and pride.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This kind of love is in the power struggle with God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to pray, "Lord, save me from doing anything for my pride, for my name, for my promotion, for my benefit, for my interests."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is to be saved from the power struggle with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we love others for our name and promotion, we are not for God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This kind of love is of Satan; it is in the flesh, and it is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whatever is in the flesh is sin, whatever is sin in our flesh is Satan, and whatever is done there by Satan is the power struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some may wonder about our love as Christian parents for our children.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our love for our children may be in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The New Testament charges us to raise up our children in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, we may raise up our children for ourselves and our future.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even in the church life we may do things that are not for God but for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may do something that is very good, yet deep within our hidden intention is to do that good thing for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, in giving a testimony or in praying, we may want everyone to say "amen" to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may offer a high, spiritual prayer, but our aim in doing so may be to receive the "amens."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Such a prayer is sinful because it is not absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From this we see that even in our prayer there is the power struggle with God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We desire position, not God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because we may have hidden motives in doing spiritual things, the Lord Jesus spoke concerning those who do things apparently for God but actually for the purpose of advancing themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, He said, "Take heed not to do your righteousness before men to be gazed at by them" Matt 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Concerning giving alms He said, "Let not your left hand know what your right hand is doing" v. 3 . Concerning prayer He went on to say, "When you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners that they may appear to men" v. 5 . Concerning fasting He said, "Whenever you fast, do not be as the hypocrites of a sad countenance; for they disguise their faces so that they may appear to men to be fasting" v. 16 . Even in doing righteousness, giving alms, praying, and fasting there may be a power struggle with God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To do these things for ourselves and not for God is sinful in His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Those who do such things for themselves give no ground to God; instead, all the ground is for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To take Christ as the sin offering is very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The experience of the sin offering is altogether related to our enjoyment of the Lord Jesus as our burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The more we love the Lord and enjoy Him, the more we will know how evil we are.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sometimes, when we love the Lord to the uttermost, we may feel that there is no place to hide ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Paul had such a realization concerning himself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When he was seeking the Lord, he saw that there was nothing good in himself.</S>
