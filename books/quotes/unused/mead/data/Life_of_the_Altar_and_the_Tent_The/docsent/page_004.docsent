   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECOND ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 12:8 says, "And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is Abraham's second altar.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The altar led to the tent, and then the tent led again to the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With the altar, nothing is ours any longer, and whatever is left from the altar is placed in the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nothing can occupy our heart anymore; our conscience is at peace before God, and we can boldly say to Him, "I have not held back one thing from You."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this way, the tent leads us back to the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If our possessions have taken root and we cannot drop them or move them anymore, we become bound by these things, and there can never be a second altar.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we offer ourselves upon the altar and consecrate our all to God, He leaves certain things for our use; but we have no choice as to what we can keep in the tent and what we have to take out of the tent back to the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everything must first pass the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whatever God leaves for our use, we can put in the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But we must still inquire of God concerning all the objects in the tent; we can only keep those that God allows us to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot decide to keep anything for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Everything has to pass the altar first; we must first check with God about every one of them before we can put them into the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What has been placed in the tent may go to the altar again at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If at any time God says, "You do not need this thing," we should relinquish it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we cling to it and say, "This is mine," then in our heart we have forsaken the altar and are no longer consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot return to the second altar and say to God that our life is being lived for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God demands that everything we have be placed on the altar and that we have placed what He has left for us in the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can only have the second altar when everything is in the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The most precious experience is the experience of the second altar.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is easy for us to be stirred up, to become zealous, and to consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But three or five years after this, we collect many things from the world again, and we cannot go back to the altar anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But it is very precious if we can always be tent dwellers and build a second altar.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The problem is not with possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The problem is with how our consecration stands.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>OF THE ALTAR AND THE TENT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Abraham had his failures.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In his history there was a forsaking of the altar and the tent; he went down to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But there was recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How did that recovery come about?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Genesis 13:3-4 says, "He went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai; unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Recovery is a matter of returning to the altar and the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Have any of you failed?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Have any of you slipped or betrayed your cause?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Have any of you gone down into Egypt, so that now you have your own demands, your own hopes, your own interests, and your own aspirations?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you are seeking the way of recovery, you have to come back to the altar and the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God's Word shows us that Abraham's recovery involved his return "unto the place where his tent had been...unto the place of the altar, which he had made."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Recovery is to return to the tent and to the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What happened to Abraham after his recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Genesis 13:18 says, "Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hebron is the place of fellowship with God; it is the place of eternal and continuous fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Abraham dwelt in Hebron, and in Hebron he built another altar for God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we want to be in fellowship with God, we can never forsake the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May He be gracious to us and cause us to see the importance of consecration so that we may live a life of the altar and the tent!</S>
