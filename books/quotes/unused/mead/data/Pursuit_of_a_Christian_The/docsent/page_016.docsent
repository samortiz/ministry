   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE PECULIAR LIFE OF A CHRISTIAN FOUR CHARACTERISTICS OF A CHRISTIAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A Christian has four distinctive possessions: Christ, the Bible, the church, and fellow Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In addition, a Christian has four distinct characteristics: before men, he is peculiar; within himself, he is contradictory; before God, he takes his innermost part as the starting point; and in all things, he is led by God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>CHRISTIANS BEING A PECULIAR PEOPLE TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From the Scriptures we can see that according to God's will and ordination, as well as His salvation, a Christian is an extraordinary person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a Christian is so ordinary and common that there is not the least bit of difference between him and any other human being, then something must be wrong with him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a saved one with the life of God within him, a Christian has to be an extraordinary person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Titus 2:14 tells us that Christ "gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify to Himself a particular or, peculiar people as His unique possession."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that God saves us so that we may be a particular people as His unique, peculiar possession.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This also has been our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE PECULIAR BEHAVIOR OF A CHRISTIAN</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Scripture, the reference to a Christian's being "peculiar" has two meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, it means that a Christian is peculiar in his outward behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Almost everyone has the sense that genuine Christians behave differently from the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have often said that the world is a powerful current.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In such a current, people simply follow the flow in the world, even though they do not all follow the bad examples to do bad things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, a genuine Christian, having been saved, does not go with the flow in many situations; rather, he goes against the flow and is always going upward.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, he behaves differently from others and looks peculiar to them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, when some people want to go to a movie, it is peculiar if a Christian among them does not want to go.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>People in the world all go with the tide, but not the Christians, because they have received the Lord's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE PECULIAR LIFE OF A CHRISTIAN</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second, that a Christian is "peculiar" means that within him he has a peculiar life with a peculiar nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although many Christians know that they have been saved, they do not know where the difference lies between them and the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The greatest difference lies in the fact that Christians have the Lord's life within them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all know that a certain life has a certain nature with certain innate functions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, the life of the fish has a distinctive nature which enables the fish to live in water.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we put a bird in the water, not only will it dislike the water, but even its life will be in danger.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is because birds do not have the innate ability to live in water.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Birds fly in the air, whereas fish swim in water.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The birds may consider the fish strange because the fish cannot fly in the air but can live only in water.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, this is being different.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, this difference is not merely in behavior; it is a difference in life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Fish live in water not because they are odd but because they have a life that enjoys staying in water and that is also able to stay in water.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Similarly, everyone who believes in the Lord has His life, and this life has its nature, its innate ability, which causes him to be different from the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such a difference is higher and greater than the difference between the birds and the fish.</S>
