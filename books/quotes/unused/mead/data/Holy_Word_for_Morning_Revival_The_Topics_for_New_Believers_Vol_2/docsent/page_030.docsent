   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is a mystery?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may say that a mystery is a mysterious story.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A mystery, a mysterious story, was hidden in the eternal God and in His eternal oikonomia economy; see Introduction, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>139-141 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>169 Ephesians 3:9 talks about...the economy of the mystery, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moreover, God s eternal purpose is of His will....At this point we need to ask what God s will is....God s will is what God wants....</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God wants the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God wants us for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In addition, we need to see that God s will is according to God s good pleasure 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s good pleasure is His heart pleasure, which we may call the desire of His heart....God s purpose, God s will, and God s good pleasure are interrelated....First, God had a pleasure, a desire.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then He determined purposed to carry out this desire, and this became God s will, what God wants....Furthermore, all this is a mystery, a hidden, mysterious story.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Matthew 16:18 He says, I will build My church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is the unique One who is qualified to form the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order for Christ to form the church it was necessary for Him to pass through death and enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>172 Before ...the Lord Jesus...passed through death for man s sin and...entered into resurrection...He was still in the flesh and could not enter into people to be their life.</S>
