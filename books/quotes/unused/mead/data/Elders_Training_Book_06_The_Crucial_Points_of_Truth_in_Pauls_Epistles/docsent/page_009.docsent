   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN FIRST CORINTHIANS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To pick up the crucial points in the New Testament books is the way for us to uplift the standard of the truth in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we neglect this way we will remain in a low standard of knowing and speaking the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must pick up these high, crucial points, learn to get into them, learn to teach the saints, and learn to help all the saints, including ourselves, speak these things in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To some extent I feel we are still in the basement, speaking things that are so low.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Getting into the crucial points will get us out of the basement and onto the third floor.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The last time I was in Taipei I proposed for the church there to get into the Life-study Messages on Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the first Galatians message I mentioned something about the various kinds of life being reduced during the winter season and thus prepared for further growth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such a little section is in the message.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the saints there used that message in the meeting, nearly everyone stressed the winter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In such a message there are many points, but the readers, including you and me, are too used to picking up only the convenient points.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It seems that nobody cares for the matter of God revealing His Son in us Gal 1:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Talking so much about the winter in Galatians message one indicates that you do not know much truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Based upon my consideration, I believe it is of the Lord for us to take the way of picking up the crucial points.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A great number of points have been covered in the sixteen chapters of Romans in the Recovery Version footnotes plus sixty-nine Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the saints try to study this book without help they may not know what to pick up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In these sixteen chapters we have pointed out only twenty-one crucial points, and I hope some of you who are good writers could compose each point as a message with outlines.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then we could publish a book on Romans containing these twenty-one lessons which everyone can use.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It would be marvelous if our young people who are even twelve years of age would be able to speak these crucial points.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Forget about the hundreds of subpoints in Romans which are there as sand to bury the diamonds.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, pull out the diamonds.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I believe if we all would be faithful to this way, the standard of the Lord s truth will be highly uplifted, and this will become a great attraction of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>CHRIST BEING OURS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1 Corinthians 1:2 is the expression, Our Lord Jesus Christ...theirs and ours.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ as the all-inclusive One belongs to all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The crucial point of chapter one is that Christ is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have been called by the faithful God into the fellowship of this Christ who is ours 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That Christ is ours means that Christ is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have been called into the fellowship, that is, into the participation, the enjoyment of this portion, and this portion is God s power and God s wisdom to us 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In God s economy we have been put into this portion, and God has made this portion our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE DEEP THINGS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In chapter one Christ is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In chapter two the crucial point is Christ as the deep things of God v. 10 . This one point needs the entire chapter two as a background.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Christ who is the deep things of God is the very Christ in God s mystery 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The very Christ in God s mystery whom God dispenses to us is a kind of blessing and enjoyment which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, and which have not come up in man s heart 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ as the deep things of God is Christ in God s mystery as the divine blessings dispensed to us which eye has never seen, ear has never heard, and which have never come up in man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All of this is for our glory 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To enjoy such a deep Christ is to enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is altogether God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>GOD S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In chapter three, both the growth of the plant life and the transformation of the minerals are for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The believers who have been regenerated in Christ with God s life are God s cultivated land with its plants, a farm in God s new creation to grow Christ, that precious material may be produced for God s building 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, we are not only God s farm but also God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Corporately, we as the church of God have Christ planted in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ must also grow in us and out of us produce, in the sense of this chapter, not the fruit, but the precious materials of gold, silver, and precious stones v. 12 for the building of God s habitation on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, the building of God, the house of God, the church, is the increase of Christ, the enlargement of Christ in His unlimitedness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As God s farm with planting, watering, and growing v. 6 , the church should produce plants; but the proper materials for the building up of the church are gold, silver, and precious stones all of which are minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, the thought of transformation is implied here.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need not only to grow in life but also to be transformed in life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the church God transforms us from the plant life into minerals, which is fully illustrated by the petrification of wood into stone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Transformation produces the divine, building materials of God, gold, silver, and precious stones, which signify the various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God.</S>
