 <h2 class="head2">Using Utterances of Poetic Quality</h2>
<p>Fourth, as a rule, all of our prayers should contain utterances of poetic quality. We should pray with words that bear a poetic character; it is not good to pray with words that are too plain. For example, the Canaanite woman cried out to the Lord Jesus: &ldquo;Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David!&rdquo; (Matt. 15:22). Her prayer has a poetic nature as evidenced by the utterances <em>Have mercy on me</em> and <em>Son of David.</em> She came to ask the Son of David to heal her daughter. Without the poetic characteristic, she might have asked the Lord in a rough way, &ldquo;Just heal my daughter.&rdquo; This kind of prayer is not wrong. She might have also said, &ldquo;Jesus, my daughter is ill. Go quickly and heal her!&rdquo; This would make her sound like a bandit who always speaks rudely to coerce people to do something, saying, &ldquo;You do this!&rdquo; However, although she was a Canaanite woman, when she came to pray before the Lord Jesus, her prayer was poetic: &ldquo;Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter suffers terribly from demon possession&rdquo; (v. 22). Her utterances are refined and pleasant to the ears. Hence, there is a great deal for us to learn regarding prayer.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was even more poetic in His reply. He was not like us; we might have said directly, &ldquo;Go away; I cannot heal your daughter.&rdquo; The Lord did not do this; rather, He replied in a mild way, &ldquo;It is not good to take the children&rsquo;s bread and throw it to the little dogs&rdquo; (v. 26). The word <em>dogs</em> implies many things. The Canaanite woman&rsquo;s answer was very proper: &ldquo;Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters&rsquo; table&rdquo; (v. 27). The conversation between her and the Lord contains numerous poetic utterances. There is no direct mention of the daughter&rsquo;s problem, yet the purpose of the entire conversation is for the daughter. This is being poetic. The Lord&rsquo;s response is also very poetic. He did not say, &ldquo;These Gentiles do not know God; even the children of Israel do not have such faith.&rdquo; Instead, He said, &ldquo;Great is your faith! Be it done to you as you wish&rdquo; (v. 28). The Lord&rsquo;s response is as poetic as the Canaanite woman&rsquo;s prayer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Jacob&rsquo;s blessing of his sons (Gen. 49:1-28), Moses&rsquo; blessing of the children of Israel (Deut. 33), and the prayer of Samuel&rsquo;s mother (1 Sam. 2:1-10) are passages in the Old Testament that are rich in poetic qualities. These qualities are especially evident in the Psalms. For example, Psalm 51 is David&rsquo;s psalm of repentance. He said, &ldquo;Therefore You are righteous when You speak; / You are clear when You judge... / Purge my sin with hyssop, and I will be clean; / Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow... / Create in me a clean heart, O God, / And renew a steadfast spirit within me&rdquo; (vv. 4-10). On the surface, these expressions seem to be very plain, but in actuality they possess rich poetic qualities. I hope that we will all pay attention to this matter and will be exercised in it. God is full of feeling. A person with much feeling tends to be poetic in utterance, whereas a person with little feeling tends to be rough in his expressions. The more a person touches God, the richer his feeling will be, and consequently, the more poetic his utterances will be.</p>
<p>However, do not think that merely being poetic is good enough; the most important thing concerning prayer is that it should touch people&rsquo;s spirit. The more we are in the spirit, the more feeling we have; the less we are in the spirit, the less feeling we have. The outward feeling of man is shallow; the inward feeling of man is deep. The spirit of man is the deepest part of man. The more we pray by the spirit, the more feeling we will have, and consequently, our utterances will be more poetic. Moreover, the more poetic our utterances are, the more we can touch the feelings of others. If our prayer is full of poetical utterance, it is easier for us to touch the spirit and the feeling of the saints. But if we use fancy words merely for the sake of being poetic, it will be ineffective and worthless.</p>
<p>In our service to God, we must learn to be keen and tender in our feeling. We should not use common and rough expressions. Although our prayers are neither poems nor psalms of praise, through them we can touch the Lord who has the most feeling and who is the most exalted and glorious. Therefore, when we come before the Lord to speak to Him, our utterances should be full of poetic qualities and rich in feeling.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Bringing the Saints into the Revelation</h2>
<p>Fifth, our prayers should not only move forward and upward, they should also bring the atmosphere of the meeting to the subject of the meeting. For example, the first section of the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting is for the breaking of the bread. After a few hymns and prayers, we should bring the meeting toward the bread and the cup, to the feeling of breaking the bread. However, some prayers do not turn our feeling to the Lord&rsquo;s table but rather draw our feeling further away from it. Suppose the atmosphere at the Lord&rsquo;s table is that the Lord died and shed His blood for us, yet a brother prays in tears, &ldquo;O Lord, no one but You can understand the hardship we suffer on earth.&rdquo; We cannot say that such a prayer is wrong. However, this prayer merely takes us to a Roman execution place to see the persecution of Christians; it does not show us the Lord&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>If our spirit is focused on the bread and the cup and a prayer is offered regarding the Lord&rsquo;s suffering on earth, a brother should follow the prayer and the atmosphere of the meeting to select <em>Hymns,</em> #226, &ldquo;For the bread and for the wine, / For the pledge that seals Him mine, / For the words of love divine, / We give Thee thanks, O Lord.&rdquo; This will bring us into the feeling of the bread and the cup. When we come to the fourth stanza, we should all stand up and prepare for the breaking of the bread. After singing, someone should offer a prayer of blessing to receive the bread and the cup from the Lord&rsquo;s hand.</p>
