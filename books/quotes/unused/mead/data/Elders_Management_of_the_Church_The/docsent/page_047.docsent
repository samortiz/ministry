   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX HOW TO BE AN AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have considered briefly in the last chapter the knowledge concerning authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We mentioned something concerning the matter of being the authority and of exercising authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Strictly speaking, the exercise of authority is part of the work of being the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If an elder knows how to be an authority, surely he will know how to exercise authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, in this chapter we will deal specifically with the question of being an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To know authority is for the purpose of being an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I. IN LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ephesians 5 mentions the matter of the husband as the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There it points out specifically that the husband is an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The way this matter is presented is quite unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It says that the wives have to submit to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We know that the other side of submission is domination, yet God never charges the husbands to dominate over their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He only charges them to love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The husband is an authority; he is the head.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But how should the husband behave as the head?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How should he behave as the authority?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ephesians 5 clearly tells us that the way is in love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ephesians 6 also mentions that the parents are an authority, especially the father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But there it also says that the parents should not provoke their children to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once again this is a question of love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we can see that the husbands have to love their wives, and the fathers must not provoke their children to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The husband is the delegated authority to the wife, and the father is the delegated authority to the children.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet each of the delegated authorities can only function in love and in the way of not provoking to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can see one thing clearly here: God appoints us to be the authority, yet He does not want us to take the way of discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In a family, if the parents lack love toward their children, but apply strict discipline only, surely the result will not be good.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Good parents do discipline their children, but the way of discipline is absolutely in love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The children do not feel that the parents are controlling them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the contrary, they feel that the parents love them, care for them, are concerned for them, and are mindful of them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They feel that the parents are making plans and arrangements for them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Within this loving care is the controlling and the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The same is true with husbands in relation to their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There was a brother who heard a message that wives should submit to the husband's authority and that husbands should be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He felt that he had not been the head before, and that from that day on, he had to go home and be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He went home in a serious manner, with great pomp and a stern face, and assumed to be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, you do not become the head by putting on a front or by assuming a stern face.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Neither do you do so by presuming that you are something.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be the head in this way is absolutely wrong.</S>
