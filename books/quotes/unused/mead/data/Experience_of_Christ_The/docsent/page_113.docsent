   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE IN THE EMPOWERING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Regarding the experience of Christ, the book of Philippians is the most wonderful Epistle in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Philippians 1:20 indicates that in any situation Christ can be magnified in us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the next verse Paul says, "For to me to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Chapter two takes us deeper into the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verses 12 and 13 of this chapter reveal that we need to obey the inner working of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is working in us both the willing and the working for His good pleasure v. 13, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>, but we still need to work out our own salvation daily.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Day by day, we need to be saved, rescued, and delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We work out such a daily salvation by obeying God's inner working.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In chapter three Paul proceeds to tell us that we need the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus the Lord v. 8 . This means that we need the excellency in knowing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On account of this excellency, we should count everything loss.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, we should suffer the loss of all things and count them dung in order to gain Christ and to be found in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul was a person absolutely in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, in 2 Corinthians 12:2 he refers to himself as "a man in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a man in Christ, his desire was to be found always in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Being found in Christ, he did not have his own righteousness, but the righteousness that was God Himself lived out of him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because he lived in this condition, he could know Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All this enabled him to be conformed to the death of Christ so that, by any means, he might arrive at the out-resurrection from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>BEING IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Philippians 4 Paul says that he had learned the secret both to abound and to suffer need v. 12, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>. In everything and in all things he had learned the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul can declare, "I can do all things in the One who empowers me" v. 13, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>. Thus, at the end of the book of Philippians, we find a man who could do everything in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The secret of doing all things is to be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>John 15:5 affords a contrast to this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this verse the Lord says, "Apart from Me you can do nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, Philippians 4:13 says that we can do all things in Him, and John 15:5 says that apart from Him we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all need to learn to say, "Apart from Him I can do nothing, but in Him I can do all things."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The secret is to be in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE SECRET OF BEING IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am concerned that many of us do not know how to be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You may say, "Today, we are all in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yes, doctrinally we are in Him, but experientially we may not be in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Corinthians 1:30 says that of God are we in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, Romans 6:3 and Galatians 3:27 say that we have been baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, we have all been put into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, the Bible also says that after we have been put into Christ, we need to abide, remain, stay, in Him John 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be put into Christ is one thing, and to remain in Christ is another.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Being put into Christ does not depend upon us; it is a sovereign act of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How we thank God that we are in Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To abide in Christ, however, does not depend on God; it depends on us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now that God has put us into Christ, we need to abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But after we have been put into Christ, we may stay there for only a short time and then not remain in Him.</S>
