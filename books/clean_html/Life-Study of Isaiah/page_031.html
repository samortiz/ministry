<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Response of Isaiah</H2><P>In Isaiah 6:5 we have the response of Isaiah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Realizing That He Was Finished</H2><P>Isaiah responded to the vision of Christ in glory by saying, "Woe is me, for I am finished!" (v. 5a). As a result of seeing this vision, Isaiah was terminated, finished.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Realizing That He Was a Man<br>of Unclean Lips and That in the Midst<br>of a People of Unclean Lips He Dwelt</H2><P>Isaiah went on to say, "For I am a man of unclean lips, and in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell" (v. 5b). By this we can see that we must pay attention to our lips, to our speaking. Every day we talk too much. A great percentage of the words we speak are evil, because most of our words are words of criticism. Nearly every word that we speak concerning any matter or any person is a word of criticism. This is the reason that our lips are unclean. Unclean things such as gossip, murmuring, and reasoning make the church life taste like vinegar. If we eliminate gossip, murmuring, and reasoning, we may find that we have very little to talk about. Like Isaiah, we need to realize that our lips are unclean.</P><P>Everyone who truly sees a vision of the Lord is enlightened. The vision he sees immediately exposes him and brings him into light. When Peter saw the Lord in Luke 5, he immediately said to the Lord, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord!" (v. 8).</P><P>How much we realize concerning ourselves depends on how much we see the Lord. For this reason, we need a revival every morning. The morning revival is the time for us to see the Lord again. The more we see the Lord, the more we see what we are. We realize that there is nothing good within us and that everything within us is without splendor or virtue.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Knowing That He Had Seen the King,<br>Jehovah of Hosts, with His Eyes</H2><P>Although Isaiah knew that he was finished and that he was a man of unclean lips, he nevertheless knew that he had seen the King, Jehovah of hosts, with his eyes (Isa. 6:5c).</P>
