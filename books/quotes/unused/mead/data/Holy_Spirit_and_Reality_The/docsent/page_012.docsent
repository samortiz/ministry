   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The goal of the work of the Spirit is to lead us into that which is real, the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the one hand, the Spirit gives us the revelation and brings us into that which is real so that we will see what we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the other hand, the Spirit gives the discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It seems that some Christians are lacking in something.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It seems that there is very little work and very little constitution of the Spirit in them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It seems that they can hardly help themselves, let alone help others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It seems that they can hardly supply their own needs, let alone supply the needs of others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a Christian wants to help others, he must allow the Lord's Spirit to lead him into reality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to lead him into spiritual reality, the Lord's Spirit will have to lead him into much discipline and trials.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>David said, "O God of my righteousness;/You made room for me when I was in straits" Psa 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God allowed David to fall into straits in order that he would be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>James 2:5 says, "Listen, my beloved brothers: Did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which He promised to those who love Him?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God chose the poor of this world in order that they could be rich in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God has no intention to always leave His children in distress.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has no intention to leave them in poverty all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He intends to enlarge His children through straits and enrich them in faith through poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Revelation 21 tells us of the future condition of the church before God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What kind of condition will it be?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The New Jerusalem will have "the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal" v. 11 . "And the building work of its wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"And the city lies square, and its length is as great as the breadth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And he measured the city with the reed to a length of twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal" v. 16 . This shows us the riches and the enlargement of the church when it appears before God one day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What does it mean to be enlarged?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Psalm 4:1 tells us that while one is in straits, God can enlarge him until he can enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that enlargement brings in the enjoyment of God, and that straits will never press one down.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who see the fourth person walking in the midst of the fiery furnace Dan 3:25 are the ones who enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Such persons are enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who are imprisoned and whose feet are secured in the locks, yet still pray and sing hymns of praise to God Acts 16:24-25 , are the ones who enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such ones are the enlarged ones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although the gate of the prison was locked, those who were inside could still enjoy the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These are the enlarged ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit enlarges us through distress.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Unfortunately, sometimes when we are in distress, we cannot deliver ourselves out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We know that the Lord allowed Job to suffer in order to bring him to the Lord's end James 5:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Job indeed reached the Lord's end. But unfortunately, many people end themselves before they reach the Lord's end! Some stumble in their trials while they are being tried.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are in distress, but they are not enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some murmur against God the minute they are tried; they complain that God is not being fair to them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a result, they are trapped by their own trials, and they are not enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some Christians are not in distress, yet they are very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They lack spiritual reality, and what they have is not sufficient for their own use, much less for helping others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, some Christians are rich, and one cannot fathom their depth or exhaust their measure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When anyone brings their problems to them, they can always render some help.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It seems as though no problem is unsolvable before them, and it seems as if no one who goes to them comes away without receiving help.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One can only bow his head and thank the Lord for giving such rich ones to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Their riches are greater than the problems and poverty of others; they are well able to render the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They are rich; therefore, they can render the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are rich because they have touched reality.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whether or not a church can be the golden lampstand and a testimony depends on how many enlarged believers are in that church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It depends on how many believers are rich in faith, who can supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When a friend comes to us at midnight to borrow loaves, and we have nothing to set before him, we can go and knock on our other friend's door Luke 11:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But sometimes, when others need the loaves, the Lord tells us, "You give them something to eat" Matt 14:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How many loaves do we really have?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can often pray for provisional supplies, and the Lord can grant mercy to us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But provisional prayers cannot replace riches.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we do not have any increase in spiritual riches over a year or even five years, we are indeed in poverty!</S>
