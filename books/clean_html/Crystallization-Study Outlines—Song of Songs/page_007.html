<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S.S. 3:6-11</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Moving with God&mdash;3:6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As an overcomer, a representative of God&rsquo;s elect, as a person in the unshakable power of the Spirit (pillars of smoke&mdash;cf. Exo. 14:19-20).</li>
	<li>Coming up from the wilderness of Egypt&mdash;the world.</li>
	<li>Perfumed with the sweet death and fragrant resurrection of Christ and with all the fragrant riches of Christ as a merchant.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>United with Christ&mdash;illustrated by three items:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The bed&mdash;3:7-8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The lover of Christ, signified by the bed, and Christ, signified by its sleeper, are in a union of love.</li>
		<li>The bed is for rest in the night&mdash;v. 8b.</li>
		<li>It is in the wartime, signified by the sixty mighty men surrounding the bed&mdash;vv. 7-8a.</li>
		<li>The bed for the night in the wartime indicates that the lover of Christ is an overcomer along with the sixty mighty men who can afford Christ a resting vehicle in the fighting with victory.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The palanquin&mdash;3:9-10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The lover of Christ, signified by the palanquin, and Christ, signified by its rider, are in a union of triumphant celebration.</li>
		<li>The palanquin is for travel in the day.</li>
		<li>As the palanquin for Solomon to be manifested in the triumphant celebration of his victory, the lover of Christ is composed of:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ&rsquo;s renewing resurrection, signified by the wood of Lebanon, as the palanquin&rsquo;s main structure.</li>
			<li>Christ&rsquo;s redeeming death, signified by silver, as its supporting posts.</li>
			<li>God&rsquo;s divine nature, signified by gold, as its base.</li>
			<li>Christ&rsquo;s kingship, signified by purple, as its seat.</li>
			<li>The inside of the palanquin is inlaid with the love of Christ&rsquo;s seekers, signifying that the lover of Christ is one with all the seekers of Christ in love in the principle of the Body of Christ.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Solomon&rsquo;s espousal&mdash;3:11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The lover of Christ, signified by the Shulammite, and Christ, signified by Solomon, are united to be one in the bridal love and marriage life.</li>
		<li>This portrays the church and Christ being united to be completely and fully one organically in the mingled spirit (1 Cor. 6:17):
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In the present church age as a precursor.</li>
			<li>In the coming kingdom age as the practical wedding for one thousand years.</li>
			<li>In the eternal age as the full marriage life signified by the New Jerusalem for eternity.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The union of the lover of Christ with Christ has made her God&rsquo;s new creation in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Her union with Christ is in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection has made her God&rsquo;s new creation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
