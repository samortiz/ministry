   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MATTHEW CHAPTER SIX</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verses 1-18: This section, the main subject of which is righteousness, is divided into three subsections: 1 alms-giving, 2 prayer, and 3 fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 1: "Take care not to do your righteousness before men in order to be gazed at by them."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the general subject.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not only do righteousness, but we should do it in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we do something, we should govern our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The preceding passage emphasizes that we should love our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This passage says that all our righteous deeds should be hidden from men.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this way we will receive a reward from our Father who is in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Germany there was once a great battle, and some soldiers arrived at a place where some good Lutheran believers were.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The soldiers asked one believer to lead them to the best wheat field in order that they could cut some wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When they were led eventually to one field, they were told to cut there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The soldiers looked around and asked why they were not led to those fields on the side.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The believer answered that those other fields were not his, and that only that patch was his.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the principle of the second mile.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The central teaching in Matthew 5 7 is reward.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verses 2-4: This is concerning alms.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Sound a trumpet" in verse 2 is probably an idiomatic expression.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of course, this cannot be interpreted literally.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What it means is that we should try our best to avoid giving alms before men, even to the extent that seemingly our left hand does not know what our right hand is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Repay" may also be rendered "reward."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All our righteous deeds before God should be done only before God in secret .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 5: "When you pray."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord did not command us to give alms, pray, and fast, because these things are what the believers should do at the least.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What the Lord said here is how to give alms, pray, and fast in order to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Hypocrites."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The root of this word in the original language is "an actor, one who play-acts."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hypocrites are actors.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, they are not very earnest when they pray, yet they act as if they are very earnest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This kind of acting is condemned by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the "synagogues" are many zealous people; on the "street corners" are many ordinary people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Synagogues and street corners are stages for the hypocrites, since performers have to perform before men.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that they want to gain the praise of both the insiders and the outsiders.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"So that they may be seen by men."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the purpose of their performing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To hide shortcomings is the natural act of the fleshly man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, grace requires us to hide our good points.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>New Christians like to hide their shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, after having deeper experiences, they are willing to reveal their shortcomings before others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then, further on, because of the grace of God they will be transformed, and their shortcomings will thus be eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are two different times for reward: 1 today and 2 in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There are two kinds of reward: 1 reward from men and 2 reward from God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We cannot have both kinds of reward.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we want to receive reward from men, we will not be able to receive reward from God in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We cannot enjoy a big name in the world and also have a position in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today there are some zealous ones who give alms in order to gain glory and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, they will not be able to receive reward from God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, we should refuse the present reward.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>People in the world are willing to be zealous and to suffer because they want to gain something today.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are not careful, we may have the same inclination in our giving of alms and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What can we gain from the praise of men?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If our eyes are open, we will seek only the glory before God and before His angels.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All other things do not count.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 6: "When you pray, enter into your private room, and shut your door."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some say that prayer involves the matter of place and that therefore it is necessary to build a prayer room.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, Paul told Timothy that men should "pray in every place" 1 Tim 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The "private room" refers to the bedroom, where there are not too many people.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is quiet during the day when people go out to work; it is also quiet at night when people are asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This means that we need to pray in a place where there are few people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When the Lord was on the earth, He did not have a place to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, He often used the wilderness and the mountains as His private room Matt 8:20; Mark 1:35; Luke 5:16; Mark 6:46; Luke 6:12; 9:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>David said, "I...am as a sparrow alone" Psa 102:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>"Your Father who sees in secret will repay you."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is human nature to call people's attention to one's good points.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But God sees in secret; He cannot even forget a cup of water Matt 10:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The good points that we remember today may not be counted by God in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What we have forgotten today may be remembered by God in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Greek word for repay means "reward."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This does not refer to what is commonly called "answers to prayer."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Rather, it points to the reward in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God cannot answer prayers that are not according to His will and therefore do not deserve His answer.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, God considers all our prayers in secret as righteous deeds and will reward us in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Verse 7: "And in praying do not babble empty words as the Gentiles do."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This means that we should not use many meaningless words to make our prayers long.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It does not mean that we should not pray with the same words.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord prayed three times using the same words Mark 14:36, 39, 41 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Therefore, we know that when we are genuinely burdened in our spirit, we often pray many times with the same words.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The prayer of those who know best how to pray is original and not natural.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>There is a bad tendency among the believers today.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We think that our prayers cannot be effective unless they are long.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore, we prolong our prayers so that they will be heard by God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, most of the prayers recorded in the Bible are short; for example, "Lord, save me!"</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Matt 14:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Thus, we can see that short prayers are very important.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When we are at a critical point in our gospel preaching to sinners, or when we have an urgent need, short prayers are most effective.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>"For they suppose that in their multiplicity of words they will be heard."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Probably this is what today's believers think.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When we have the time, we may pray long prayers privately.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>However, we should not think that we will be heard because of our multiplicity of words.</S>
