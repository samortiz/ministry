   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SCRIPTURE A. All God-breathed</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 16 says, "All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Greek words rendered, "All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable," may also be translated "Every Scripture God-breathed is also profitable."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To confront the death, corruption, and confusion in the church's decline, the eternal life upon which chapter one is based vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1, 10 , the divine truth emphasized in chapter two vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>15, 18, 25 , and the holy Scripture highly regarded in chapter three vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>14-17 are all needed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The eternal life not only swallows up death, but also renders the life supply; the divine truth replaces the vanity of corruption with the reality of all the divine riches; and the holy Scripture not only dispels confusion, but also furnishes divine light and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, in this book the apostle stresses these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The expression "God-breathed" indicates that the Scripture, the Word of God, is the breath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's speaking is God's breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, His word is spirit John 6:63 , pneuma, or breath.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, the Scripture is the embodiment of God as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit is therefore the very essence, the substance, of the Scripture, just as phosphorus is the essential substance in matches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must "strike" the Spirit of the Scripture with our spirit to kindle the divine fire.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the embodiment of God the Spirit, the Scripture is also the embodiment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is God's living Word Rev 19:13 , and the Scripture is God's written word Matt 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>B. Profitable</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to verse 16, all Scripture is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Reproof here means conviction or confutation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Correction denotes setting right what is wrong, turning someone to the right way, or restoring a person to an upright state.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instruction refers to discipline or chastisement in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means to discipline or chastise in the element and condition of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>C. To Complete the Man of God</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 17 Paul says, "That the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have seen that a man of God is one who partakes of God's life and nature John 1:13; 2 Pet 1:4 and thus becomes one with Him in His life and nature 1 Cor 6:17 and thereby expresses Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This corresponds to the mystery of godliness, which is God manifest in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through the God-breathed Scripture, the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Complete here means complete and perfect in qualifications, and equipped denotes being fitted out, furnished, made ready.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to know the Bible not merely according to letters in black and white, but also according to the divine revelation and heavenly wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not think that having an advanced degree qualifies anyone to understand a book such as Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we study this Epistle only in letters, we shall not be able to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For a proper understanding of this book, and for the Bible as a whole, we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was the reason Paul prayed, "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him, the eyes of your heart having been enlightened" Eph 1:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We thank the Lord that for more than fifty years we have been receiving such a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a result, the messages put out in the Lord's recovery always contain something fresh and new.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These messages are given not merely according to the black and white letters of the Scripture, but according to the spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We in the Lord's recovery do not treasure theology, tradition, or the councils.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We honor, respect, and treasure the holy Word under the shining of the heavenly light which comes by a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because we depend on God's enlightenment, His Word is opened to us.</S>
