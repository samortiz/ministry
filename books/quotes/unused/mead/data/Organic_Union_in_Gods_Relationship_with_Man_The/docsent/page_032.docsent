   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>By Being Joined Together</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>through Every Joint of</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Rich Supply</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Body builds up itself by being joined together through every joint of the rich supply Eph 4:16b .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These joints of the rich supply are the gifted persons, as mentioned in Ephesians 4:11: the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These gifted persons are rich joints, full of Christ as the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are a factor to join the saints together.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the first kind of joining together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By Being Knit Together through</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>the Operation in the Measure</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>of Each One Part</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Body builds up itself also by being knit together through the operation in the measure of each one part Eph 4:16b .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the second kind of joining.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first kind of joining, the joining through the joints of the rich supply, is like putting pieces together to form the frame of a building.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After framing a building, there are many openings that need to be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second kind of joining, the knitting together through the operation of each one part, is like filling in all the openings after a building has been framed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Knitting is to interweave until all the openings are filled up by the interwoven pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The parts of the Body that are knit, or interwoven, together are not the gifted persons but the common members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The gifted persons are joined together to form the frame; the common parts function in their measure to be knit and interwoven in order to fill up all the holes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not merely a doctrine; I have practiced this, I saw this, and I experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is possible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you have the heart, pray to the Lord: "Lord, have mercy upon me and grant me the adequate grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I want to live You organically."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then go and meet together with the saints in your place.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There may be a number of other saints who are the same as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As you meet together there will be a growth among you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This growth equals the building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some gifted persons will be joined together to form the frame, and the rest will do their part by functioning in their measure.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way the church is built up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Love</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Body of Christ also builds up itself in love Eph 4:16c .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The little phrase in love is used in the book of Ephesians six times 1:4; 3:17; 4:2, 15, 16; 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God chose us in eternity in love 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His predestinating us unto sonship in eternity past was also in love v. 5 . Without love God would not have chosen or predestinated us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today we need to grow in love, and we also need to build up the Body in love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We love the Lord, we love the church, and we love every member.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Regardless of how weak certain members may be, or even how evil they may be, we love them because they are members.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our attitude should be that we do not like to expose them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We desire instead to cover them in love.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is growth and this is building.</S>
