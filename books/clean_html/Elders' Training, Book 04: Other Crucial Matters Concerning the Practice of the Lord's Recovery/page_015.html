<h2 class=head2>An Example from Our History</h2><p>I would like to give an illustration of what I mean by relating a situation among us in the past. There was a certain local church which I loved and did my best to help and to keep it on the right way. The Lord knows and some of the other brothers know how much I did my best to keep that church from going astray. Some information came to me about this particular locality which said that this locality thought they had the best way to practice the church life. They claimed that the church in Los Angeles was just the training center and that it did not have the proper practice of the church life. This kind of fellowship went to Atlanta and that bothered the brothers there. Therefore, the brothers passed on the information to me.<p>One day the leading brother of this locality, who thought they had the best way to practice the church life, came to see me. I told him that if he felt that their way was the right way to practice the church life, I would not say anything. I also told him, though, that I did not think it was wise for him to go out and particularly to go to Atlanta and tell the saints there that Los Angeles is only good for a training center and does not have the proper church life. I told him that it was not wise to tell other churches and other saints that the best way to practice the church was in their locality. I also told him that this would damage him and cause trouble to the churches.<p>To some extent this brother promised not to do this anymore. Then, I myself went to visit there purposely to see whether what I heard was true or not. When I was there, they told me that they were going to have the Lord’s table early in the morning because they wanted to take care of the infants. When I went to attend their Lord’s table, I saw that they even fed the infants with the bread. When I saw that, I had the full realization that this was off. However, I did not criticize and I did not tell anybody. I kept this in my heart, thinking that as long as they practiced this way by themselves it would be all right. I did not want to adjust them, and I did not want to bother them.<p>A good number of the saints from this locality came for the summer and winter trainings. After they had attended the trainings, they were troubled when they went back to their locality. On the one hand, they were in their locality for a half a year under that certain kind of practice. When they came to attend the training for ten days, however, they tasted the general flavor in the Lord’s recovery. Because of this they did not feel so good about the particular situation when they went back. Then there was an attempt in their locality to limit the number of the saints who could come to the trainings. This caused a lot of trouble and the trouble reached a certain degree where the leading brother in this locality could not tolerate it any longer. As a result, two brothers were excommunicated.<p>When I heard this, I had nothing to say. These two brothers then came to me and told me that they did not consider what was in their locality as a church in the Lord’s recovery. Actually, it was not, but it was a sectarian thing. Then these brothers asked me what they should do. I asked them what they felt, and they said they felt that they should begin to meet as a church in the recovery and not as something sectarian. I told them that if they felt this way they had no choice but to be faithful to their feeling according to the Lord’s leading. When they began to meet, to their surprise about one-half of the saints there immediately came to stand with them.<p>Who can be blamed for this division? The brother who took the lead in that locality should blame himself. His practices actually were sectarian because they were hard for the Body to swallow. The Body could not take it. It is not just that the ministry could not stand it. The ministry stood up with it as much as it could. I did not say a word, but eventually the Body could not swallow it.<p>The brother in that locality may have thought that this was absolutely a local matter and that the church there had a local administration. I admit that there was a local administration there, but what happened there affected the Body and affected the testimony. A number of saints would not agree with feeding the Lord’s table to infants of one or two years of age. I hope this gives us a further realization not to think that the church in our locality has the full jurisdiction to do whatever it feels is right. You have the right to do it, but you must consider the result, the issue, and the effect.
