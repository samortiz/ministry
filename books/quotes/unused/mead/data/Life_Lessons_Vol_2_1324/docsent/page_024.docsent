   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And when he ran up " Acts 8:29-30 .</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to preach the gospel with results, one cannot be limited by time.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Loving others, spending and being spent for them, is also a wonderful and excellent way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>6 Speaking the word of God " spoke the word of God with boldness" Acts 4:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Speaking God's word and not our own is a great secret to successful gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To this end, the booklet "The Mystery of Human Life" published by Living Stream Ministry is highly recommended.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>7 Visiting from house to house to find the sons of peace "The harvest indeed is vast, but the workers are few; therefore, beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order that the gospel may be preached in a widespread manner with plentiful results, the most excellent way is to visit from house to house by knocking on doors to find the sons of peace and to bring them to believe, to be baptized, and to be saved.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The reward here surely includes the crown of righteousness mentioned by the Apostle Paul who also wrote these words in 2 Timothy 4:7-8.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is difficult to ascertain what else this reward will include.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In any case, it will surely be glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>XI.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said that woe would be to him if he did not preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do not know what woe may come, but surely it will not be a comfortable or honorable thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This should serve as a warning to us!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>2 Being taken away "Every branch in Me the Lord that does not bear fruit, He the Father takes it away" John 15:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These are the Lord Jesus' personal words of warning to us, saying that the Father will take away every one of His branches which does not bear fruit; thus, this one will lose all the supply and blessing of being His branch and of abiding in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What a warning this is!</S>
