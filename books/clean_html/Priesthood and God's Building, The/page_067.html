<h2 class="head2">Praying with Praises</h2>
<p>Our prayer should not be limited to just confessing our sins. Some people say, &ldquo;I do not need to pray right now because I have confessed my sins already.&rdquo; Our prayers, however, should not be focused on just our sins; we should also consider the Lord&rsquo;s glory, greatness, virtues, kindness, mercy, faithfulness, and power, and offer praises to Him. We may not be able to praise the Lord seven times a day as David did (Psa. 119:164), but we can praise Him at least once a day. When we consider our vast and unlimited Lord, how can we be without topics for prayer? Each of His attributes can be a topic of our prayer, including His holiness, righteousness, light, and life. He is worthy of our praise.</p>
<p>If we do not have words of praise for Him, it is only because of our lack of exercise. When we are first learning how to do anything, we need to practice. For example, it is rather easy to ride a bicycle, but it is not easy if we have never been on a bicycle. If we want to learn how to ride a bicycle, we must practice. If we are short in our exercise of praising, extolling, and giving thanks to the Lord, no words will come forth when we want to praise. Some brothers and sisters can only say, &ldquo;Praise and thank the Lord,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Thank and praise the Lord,&rdquo; because they do not practice regularly. We can practice praising by turning the content of the Psalms into praises. We do not need to recite them methodically; we can simply turn the verses into praises. With practice we will be able to turn to our spirit and praise God like the psalmists.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Turning Bible-reading into Prayer</h2>
<p>When we read the Bible, we should turn the words in the Bible into prayer. According to my experience, we should pray more than we read the Bible. When I was young, I spent too much time reading the Bible and not enough time praying. Sometimes I would spend eight hours a day to read the Bible but not even eight minutes to pray. I cultivated a habit of reading the Bible; I especially enjoyed studying the numbers in the Bible. Although I liked to study the numbers in the Bible, as soon as I began to speak about them, an inner voice would stop me. Studying numbers in the Bible nurtured my mentality, but it did not strengthen my spirit. Even though I went through several copies of the Bible, my spirit was not strong, and when I prayed, my spirit could not come forth.</p>
<p>I hope that the young saints would devote the same amount of time to prayer as they do to reading the Bible. Every sentence and every word should be turned into prayer. Every verse that touches us should be turned into prayer. Even if only a few verses touch us when we read a chapter, we should turn these into prayer. Every verse in the Bible is able to touch me. When we are willing to turn every verse into prayer, every verse will be an inspiration to us. As soon as we turn a verse into prayer, inspiration will come. For example, when we read Matthew 1:1, which says, &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham,&rdquo; we may not have much feeling related to it, but when we turn the verse into prayer, inspiration will come. It is hard to know how the Spirit will use this verse to inspire us, but the Spirit will be able to speak when we pray. The inspiration that the Spirit gives to one brother may be different from what is given to another brother, but the Spirit will be able to inspire everyone.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Praying in Addition to Listening to Messages</h2>
<p>Similarly, after listening to a message, we must pray. If we do not turn the content of the message into prayer, we are like a person who sees food but does not eat it. No matter how many gospel messages a person hears, he must pray in order to be saved. This is an irrefutable law. The gospel is useless to a person who does not pray, no matter how well the gospel is preached or how much a person is touched by it. Not praying after hearing the gospel is like not eating food that has been presented to us. This also is the case with listening to messages. If we hear a message and are touched, we need to pray in order to receive the edification. If we do not pray, the messages will not be received in a deep way or leave much of an impression in us.</p>
<p>For example, when we attend a meeting and see that the subject is &ldquo;The Importance of the Spirit,&rdquo; we can immediately turn this subject into prayer, saying, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for the importance of the spirit; show me this matter more fully.&rdquo; Even with such a short prayer, there will be a sense of the Spirit&rsquo;s moving in us. This kind of inspiration cannot come from just listening to a message.</p>
<p>We should pray when we listen to a message, when we read the Bible, and when we are in a meeting. There are too many items for which we can pray. When we help the young saints to learn to pray, we should teach them to use the words of the Bible. If they feel that they do not have words for prayer, we can read the Bible with them, musing and chewing on the words of the Bible and turning the words into prayer. Gradually, they will have more utterance in their prayers. The Bible contains all the subjects that we need for prayer. If we practice praying with the words of the Bible, I believe that the brothers and sisters will be strengthened in their spirit. Whenever we come together to meet, we should not wait for others to pray; every saint should be a person of prayer. The reasons that we wait are because our spirits are not connected, and we are not skilled in prayer. We all must use our spirit to pray.</p>
