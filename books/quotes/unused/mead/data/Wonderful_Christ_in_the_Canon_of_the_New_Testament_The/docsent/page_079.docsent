   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LIFE SUPPLY TO BE LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Jesus told John that He is the living One.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is not only the ancient One, but also the living One.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He has passed through death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was dead, but now He is living forevermore!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is shining, and He is also living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be living not only requires life, but also the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If I did not eat anything in the last seven days, I would not be so living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But since I have been eating three good meals a day I am quite living and energetic.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>My energy comes from my eating.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the seven epistles, the concept of religion is doctrine and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the concept of the living One is eating and feasting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not doctrine, but the tree of life and the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The tree of life is in the paradise of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is just God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today, on the earth, God s dwelling place is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The tree of life is in the church, and it is Christ as our food and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Where then is the hidden manna?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In typology, the hidden manna was in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Holy of Holies is also the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the church life Christ is our hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is really hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All those outside the church simply do not know what we are doing week after week.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They also do not know where we get our energy to have meetings almost every night, as well as many mornings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our energy comes from the hidden Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we come into the church, we enjoy something hidden, the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ today is the hidden manna, not for teaching, but for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>OVERCOME THE LOST LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jesus said that to him that overcometh He will give to eat of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nearly all Christians have misinterpreted the meaning of the word, overcometh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Most think that this means we must overcome our temper, our family problems, our self, our flesh, our weak points, our sin, the world, and even Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But according to the context, to overcome is not to overcome all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here it means that we must overcome the degraded situation of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the church at Ephesus, the first love was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, we must overcome the losing of our first love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must pray, O Lord Jesus, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I love You first, and I love You the best.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>My first love belongs to You.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>O Lord Jesus, I give the priority of my love to You.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we look at today s Christianity, we do not see such a love.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, we must overcome this kind of degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we will obtain the reward, which will be to enjoy Christ as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To him that overcomes the situation of the church at Ephesus, Christ will give to eat of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The first love will bring us to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is a kind of exchange.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we give our first love to the Lord Jesus, He will give us to eat of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our love is His enjoyment, and the tree of life is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>OVERCOME DOCTRINE</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To overcome the degraded situation in the church in Pergamos is to overcome all kinds of doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this church there was this kind of doctrine and that kind of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is something we all must overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Almost all those in the church life must overcome doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even now I am concerned that some of the dear ones among us still hold on to some kind of doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Of course some will say that we should not hold on to the wrong doctrines, such as the doctrine of Balaam and the doctrine of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These are certainly wrong, devilish doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, they continue to say that we must hold on to the right doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But how do we know that the doctrines which we hold are right or wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No person will hold on to a doctrine that he knows is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If I have a false twenty dollar bill, surely I will not keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If I do, it means that I think it is genuine, though it is false.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sometimes the counterfeit money looks better than the genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only the experts can discern that it is false.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How can you discern whether the doctrine you hold is right or not?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is really difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, we must forget the paper money and take the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the divine wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As long as we hold the gold, we can never be cheated.</S>
