   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Enoch's City and Noah</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that God's purpose and intention in creation was to have a group of people as the center of His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God intended to have the corporate man to express Him and to represent Him by dealing with His enemy, thus recovering the lost earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But Satan intervened and damaged man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Satan captured man and carried him away from God's purpose, then utilized him to raise up a counterfeit of God's intention.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This issued firstly in the city of Enoch, a counterfeit of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was God's purpose to transform man by the flowing of His life into precious materials for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But Satan crept into the garden of Eden and stole this man, usurping him to build a city in opposition to God, a counterfeit of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most of us today do not realize the real meaning of the fall of man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The enemy's goal in causing man's fall was to utilize the fallen race to construct a counterfeit in opposition to God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God intended to build man into a corporate expression of Himself, but Satan kidnapped this man and utilized him as material for a counterfeit city.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus immediately following the fall of man in Genesis 3, the city of Enoch was built by the fallen race in Genesis 4.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All sinful things were invented there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The city of Enoch was the source of all the evil occupations of the human race warring, pleasure, amusement, polygamy, and all fleshly enjoyments.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How much corruption and sinfulness have come out of that city!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The city of Enoch was the very center of the first civilization; it was the first culture invented by the fallen race.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God could not tolerate that; so He sent a flood to judge that generation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But before destroying the city, God asked Noah, a righteous man who walked continually with God, to build a structure absolutely different from Satan's counterfeit Gen 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Fallen man built Satan's city, but Noah built an ark according to God's specifications.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was entirely different from the city both in material and in purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was a full type of Christ in human nature mingled with the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The ark included His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Hebrew word for pitch, which covered the ark, is the same as the word atonement.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus the ark portrays Christ with His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Following the flood, Noah did not attempt to build a city.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, he lived in a tent and erected an altar to serve God Gen 9:21; 8:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was a miniature of the coming tabernacle which God was seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Babel, Sodom and Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not long after the flood, Noah's descendants fell into Satan's hands.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They were formed as one body and utilized by Satan to build the second city Gen 11:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Babel was Satan's second counterfeit of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God completely frustrated and judged Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Out from the fallen people of Babel, God called and separated Abraham Gen 11:29 12:5 and brought him to an elevated place called the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There God asked him to build an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Abraham also lived in a tent, while he served God through the altar Gen 12:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is an example of that which God is seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, Abraham's companion, Lot, drifted away from this position into another city.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lot was separated from Babel, the city of idols, but he drifted into Sodom, the city of sin Gen 13:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is typical of many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the one hand there is the danger of living in the city of idols, and on the other hand the danger of drifting into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From an elevated position, Lot could either fall into Babel on his right hand or drift into Sodom on his left.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A man standing on a plain, though he falls to the right or the left, is relatively safe; but in an elevated place he must exercise care.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If I am standing on a table, I must be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From an elevated position, the danger of a fall is increased.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Lot drifted from this position into Sodom, a city full of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But Abraham was kept from falling; he lived in a tent with an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His son Isaac Gen 26:25 and his grandson Jacob Gen 33:18-20; 35:7, 21 did the same.</S>
