   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS OF THE ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can we prove from the account in Ezekiel that God and man and all the creatures died on the altar, on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can we prove that the death of Christ was such an all-inclusive death?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can prove this according to the design and the measurements of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The clear details of the altar are a special characteristic of Ezekiel's vision.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In earlier books, the Bible did not speak specifically about the measurements of the altar, but Ezekiel gives us details concerning the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>See altar detail.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to Ezekiel's vision, the altar has four sections: the base, the lesser ledge upon the base, the greater ledge upon the lesser ledge, and the upper altar upon the greater ledge.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The upper altar is also called the hearth of God, the place where something burns for God and by God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The base of the altar is one cubit high.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since we know that the number one signifies the unique God, we therefore see that God is the base of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that the cross was initiated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The lesser ledge, which is upon the base of the altar, is two cubits high.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here, the number two signifies not only testimony, but also the second Person of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is the second Person of the Triune God as a witness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because the third section, the greater ledge, is four cubits high, it signifies all the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The upper altar on top of the greater ledge is also four cubits high.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates not only the creatures, but also something more.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The top of the altar is a square, twelve by twelve cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Twelve is composed of either six times two or of three times four.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this case both of the meanings are used.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The number four signifying the creature, the number six signifying man, and the number three signifying the Triune God are all here.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, God is here, Christ is here, and all the creatures including man are here.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God as the base included Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ included man and all other creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Christ died upon the cross, all the creatures including man and God died there with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This altar signifies the all-inclusive death of Christ: man died there, all the creatures died there, Christ died there, and God died there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are many different opinions concerning the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>An unbelieving Jew may simply say that a man whose name was Jesus, the Nazarene, died there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some believers in the denominations may say that their Redeemer died there.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some advanced Christians may say that Christ, their Redeemer, and they themselves died there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But I would like to declare to you that not only Christ, my Redeemer, and I died there, but also all the creatures and even God Himself died there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The whole universe with the Creator passed through death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everything passed through death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By passing through death everything was tested.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whatever could be terminated through death was terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must realize that only God was able to pass through that test of death!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I was terminated there, you were terminated there, the whole creation was terminated there!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God was able to pass through the test of death!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The all-inclusive death of Christ was a mingling which brought man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In that death God died in man to be released, and man died in God to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hallelujah for His releasing and terminating death!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In His death we were terminated, and in His death God was released.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Hearth</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The top of the altar is twelve cubits square and is called the hearth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the fireplace of God, the place to burn things for God, to God, and by God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is meaningful that the hearth measures twelve cubits by twelve cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the first time the number twelve is used in the temple measurements.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have seen the numbers two, three, four, five, six, eight, and ten, but we have not seen the number twelve until this point.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The number twelve is the number of the New Jerusalem and is composed of three times four.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The number three is the number of the Triune God and the number four is the number of man as the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Twelve signifies the Triune God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The New Jerusalem will be the consummate mingling of the Triune God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The church life today is also the mingling of the Triune God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Greater Ledge</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The greater ledge, which is the section directly under the upper altar, has an edge on either side which measures one cubit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is why the greater ledge is fourteen cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The number fourteen is composed of seven times two or ten plus four.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Seven is the number of completion, two is the number of testimony, and ten is the number of fullness in perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Four, of course, is the number of the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By putting these numbers together we can realize that the creature in fullness bears a complete testimony.</S>
