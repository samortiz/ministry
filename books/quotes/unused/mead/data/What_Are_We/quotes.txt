[1]  Actually, all the truths are in the Bible; there is not one truth that is not in the Bible.
[2]  He was a vessel raised up by God to unveil the truth of justification by faith.
[3]  God dug up this buried truth from all the traditions, human opinions, and creeds and caused this truth to be known and preached once more.
[4]  If a person were born in that age, what he should have done was preach this truth and exhort others concerning this truth.
[5]  THE RECOVERY OF TRUTH FROM THE SIXTEENTH TO THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
[6]  In 1524 the Anabaptists, a group of believers who proposed re-baptism after infant-sprinkling, were raised up in Germany.
[7]  They were followers of the earlier brothers from Lhota who preached the baptism of believers.
[8]  These Anabaptists not only preached the truth of justification by faith, but they went on further to baptize the believers who were justified by faith.
[9]  After the Anglican Church was established in England, these people told others that the church should not have anything to do with politics.
[10]  By reading his Bible, Spener found out that the church at his time was full of human opinions, something forbidden by God.
[11]  At that time men were not allowed to preach in the open air but could speak only in a church sanctuary because the church at that time considered that the holy Word could be proclaimed only in a holy sanctuary.
[12]  THE DISCOVERY OF GOD'S TRUTH IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
[13]  When we consider the present-day church organizations, we see many human traditions and opinions and little direct leading of the Holy Spirit.
[14]  Later God began to show us one by one the different truths, that is, the truths that we mentioned earlier.
[15]  From 1926 on, we began to release many messages concerning salvation, the church, and the cross, and we testified much concerning these things.
[16]  We should answer as John the Baptist did that we are a voice in the wilderness John 1:23 .
[17]  All of the truths that we preach today have the church as the starting point.
[18]  May God be gracious to us so that we do not become the castaways of the "present truth."
