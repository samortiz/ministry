   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RESOLVING ALL THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD Injustice</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This world has many fundamental problems that man cannot solve.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They can only be resolved when the Lord comes again.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first thing that will be resolved when He comes again will be justice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this world, there are oppressors and there are the oppressed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are exploiters and there are the exploited.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not only is there injustice in material things but also in nonmaterial things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Throughout history we find people who were so oppressed that they could suffer no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a result, they rose up, rebelled, and revolted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sadly, however, they became oppressors once they became the kings and the rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Isaiah 11:4 says that in the future, the world will be filled with justice and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is what the Lord will do when He comes again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>War</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second, when the Lord comes again, all the wars in this world will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One problem with this world is war.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Human history is full of wars.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since the dawn of human history, there have only been 268 years when there was no war on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are international wars and national wars.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The two greatest wars were the First World War and the Second World War.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now there is still a chance of a third World War.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The world is full of big wars and small wars.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>War comes from passions; it is the result of man's constantly unfulfilled passions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Isaiah 2:4 says that when the Lord comes back again, all the swords will be beaten into plowshares and all the spears will be turned into pruning hooks.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No nation will wage war against another nation, and no one will learn war any more.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is salvation of the entire society.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sickness</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Third, when the Lord comes back, all the sicknesses in this world will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There will be no more sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today the world is full of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Science has invented all kinds of medicines, but with the increase of medicine, there has also been an increase of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many viruses and bacteria improve their immune system with the introduction of more antibiotics; there is no way to eradicate them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A man can be healed by one kind of medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But he can become sick again and need further treatment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No matter how hard man tries, he cannot get rid of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to Leviticus and Deuteronomy, sickness has much to do with sin; it is the result of judgment on sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Lord comes again and eventually in the new heaven and new earth, there will be the tree of life whose leaves will heal the nations Rev 22:2; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>47:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the coming world, there will be no sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Famine</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Fourth, when the Lord comes again, He will remove famine from humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Old Testament tells us that the earth does not yield to man because of man's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Vegetables do not grow naturally by themselves; they have to be cultivated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, useless thorns and thistles flourish.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is interesting to note that all vegetation that is beneficial to man does not grow naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The only vegetation that flourishes naturally is the kind that is not beneficial to man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today famine is found everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even when man applies all kinds of fertilizers, he is not guaranteed good harvests.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It seems that man must struggle with the environment before he can find food.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such problems will be solved when the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Isaiah 35:1 and 6 say that the desert will flow with rivers and the earth will no longer bring forth wild weeds.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now, whatever man does not cultivate will not proliferate.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then, man will no longer have to wrestle with nature.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Education</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Fifth, when the Lord comes again, the question of education will be resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today some are educated while others are not.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today's education does not help man to know God but to know good and evil and to turn from evil to good.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But education cannot solve the problem of sin within man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today some people know God while others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But when the Lord comes back again, no one will need to teach his fellow citizen or brother to know God; from the little one to the great one, all will know Him Heb 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When the Lord comes back again, all will know God.</S>
