   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GETTING SINNERS SAVED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH OUR PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BY VISITING THEM IN THEIR HOMES Making the New Testament Priesthood</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>of the Gospel a Part of Our Daily Life</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To carry out the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we first must get sinners saved through our preaching of the gospel by visiting them in their homes Luke 10:1-6; 19:1-6, 9-10; John 4:3-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to make the New Testament priesthood of the gospel a part of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To get sinners saved is the work and the life of a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to save sinners and offer them to God as spiritual sacrifices 1 Pet 2:5 habitually, regularly, and constantly 2 Tim 4:2; 1 Cor 9:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This must be our habit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just as we take three meals a day regularly, we have to preach the gospel regularly and constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the New Testament priests, we are also the branches of the vine-tree, Christ John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The purpose of the branches is to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are not bearing fruit, this is evidence that we are not abiding in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As branches of the vine, we need to bear fruit for the glorification of the Father John 15:8 , and as priests, we have to gain new ones, offering them to God as spiritual sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To have living and spiritual sacrifices to offer to God for His acceptance, we must go to the human ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord told Peter that He would make him a fisher of men Matt 4:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All of us need to go to fish for men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to go where the fish are.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead of going fishing, we may send out invitations, spreading them in the ocean and asking the fish to come to our gospel preaching meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead of going to the fish, we invite the fish to come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not logical for us to labor in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to go where the fish are.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus was the first fisherman.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not sit on the throne in the heavens and ask the fish to come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead, He left His throne in the heavens and came to be a man so that He could visit man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He came to be a man according to God s ordained New Testament principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the almighty God, He entered into the womb of a human virgin, staying there for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the process that He passed through so that He could come to preach the gospel to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was born with two natures, divine and human.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He became a God-man to live God and to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This God-man lived in Nazareth for approximately thirty years, seemingly not doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He passed through such a marvelous human living in order to be completed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the age of thirty, He began His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He did not build a big meeting hall or a big cathedral and send out invitations inviting people to come to hear Him speak.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a humble Nazarene without a reputation or a degree, He visited village after village.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>People wondered how He learned so much and how He could speak in the way that He did.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Visiting people for the preaching of the gospel is God s ordained way, and this is also the way practiced by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord came down from heaven to save sinners 1 Tim 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He went to visit Zaccheus with His dynamic salvation Luke 19:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He entered the home of Zaccheus and stayed in his house, bringing Zaccheus to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He went to visit the Samaritan woman and bring her the living water John 4:3-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He went purposely from Judea to Samaria and sat by a well, waiting for this woman to come to draw water.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His visiting this woman was His knocking on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The essence of knocking on doors is to meet people where they are.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Zaccheus was a sinful tax collector, and the Samaritan woman was an immoral woman.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord visited both of them to bring salvation to them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This should be our pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to go to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord also sent His disciples to people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He sent the twelve to go to the cities and villages to visit the lost sheep of the house of Israel and bring them peace Matt 10:5-8, 11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then he sent the seventy to go to every city and seek the sons of peace Luke 10:1-6 , whom God the Father had chosen in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord Jesus told us that we would be as lambs in the midst of wolves v. 3 . This means that we have to sacrifice ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to carry out the priesthood of the gospel, we have to go to the wolves because among the wolves there are some sons of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The sons of peace that we gain will one day welcome us into the eternal tabernacles Luke 16:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today it should be easy for us to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can go to visit our close relatives first, and then we can visit our neighbors, friends, and classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Always Having Two or Three</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Newly Baptized Ones under Our Care Year-round</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should always have two or three newly baptized ones under our care year-round.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should not bring forth too many new ones because we will not be able to care for all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In a good sense, we have to exercise birth control.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>One brother said that he had a good month in the gospel because he baptized twelve people.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, to have twelve infants to care for will burden a person beyond what he is able to bear.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If a mother had twelve deliveries within one month, this would be a misfortune to her.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we get two or three baptized, we need to stop producing more new ones in order to care for these two or three.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we take care of them, they will grow in life properly.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have to carry out the preaching of the gospel in the new way by controlling the rate of birth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Humanly speaking, we tend to be at one extreme or the other.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On the one extreme, we may not go to preach the gospel, saying that it is too difficult to visit people by knocking on their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After three months, however, we may get excited and go out to knock on doors to get twelve baptized in one month.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have to be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We need to go out to preach the gospel in a regular way, but we also need to exercise to control the new births.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we get three baptisms in the first week, we should stop and go back to the baptized ones twice a week to nourish and cherish them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need to go back to them in a sober way with much prayer and fellowship with the Lord to help them by feeding them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Nursing mothers know that they need to feed the babes a little bit at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If each one of us brought forth two new ones yearly, the increase in the churches would be very good.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After the delivery of her first child, a mother learns how to feed the newly delivered babe.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In the past, we may not have known how to feed a new one properly.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We did not know how to talk with the newly baptized ones.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We were not trained to talk in a proper way to feed the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I would beg all of us to put our old way aside.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After we preach the gospel to some and they get saved, we should pray, Lord, how should I go to these new ones?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In what way can I feed them properly?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We need to pray to the Lord concerning our care for the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We should not exercise our knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We may have been in the church for fifteen years, and we may think that we know nearly everything.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, we must learn to know nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The new way is the organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We have to learn how to feed the new ones organically.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If you are visiting a new sister whose husband persecutes her, how are you going to feed her?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>What are you going to say?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>You must pray and learn.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>A sister may be burdened to preach the gospel to her grandfather.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If she went to her grandfather to tell him doctrinal things, she would fail.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If she prays and opens herself to the Lord, she may go to her grandfather with tears and say, Dear grandfather, I owe you something.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I have been saved for many years, but I have never talked to you about the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Even without speaking about the Lord yet, this sister s grandfather would be touched by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Her speaking would open him up to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We have to learn to pray to the Lord and to seek the very anointing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Then we can go to speak a word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This kind of speaking is the organic feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I cannot tell you what to say, but I can tell you that the way is to pray, forgetting about what you know.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>What you know means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>That does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>You must pray to get the instant feeling of the anointing, to get the instant, new utterances to say something to the ones whom you are going to visit.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Then what you say will be organic and living.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>You do not need to talk too much.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Perhaps twenty minutes is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Furthermore, do not try to solve their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Since you yourself have many problems that have not been solved, how can you solve others problems?</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>You may tell a new one, I cannot solve your problem because I may have more problems than you do.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This new one may ask you what you do.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>You can tell him, I can do nothing except pray to the living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This word is an organic feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>After you leave, this new one may pray immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>This is evidence that the new one was fed by you.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>To feed someone does not mean that you have to give him a lecture, a message, a doctrine, or even a small booklet.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We should not depend on all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We must learn how to be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We ourselves have to be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>The way to organically build up the Body of Christ begins with visiting people where they are to get them saved through our preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Then we need to go back to the new believers and feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>To feed them, to nourish them, is to cause them to grow, and to cause them to grow is to build them up.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>After a newborn babe is delivered, the mother continually feeds him, and this feeding causes him to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>His growth is his organic building up.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>If we visit the new ones, but do not minister Christ to them, this will cause them to starve, so there will be no growth, no building up.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>When we go back to visit the newly baptized ones, we need to feed them with the milk of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>First Peter 2:2 says that the newborn babes should long for the milk of the word that they may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>If we visit them regularly and feed them with the milk of the word, they will grow, and by their growth they will be built up and established in the Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>We have to meet with the new ones in their homes regularly until they become established in the faith Acts 5:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>After six months of continual care, they may be settled in their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Until they are settled in their faith, we should not stop going to them.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>To feed them is to feed the Lord s lambs John 21:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>In John 21 the Lord Jesus asked Peter if he loved Him.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>When Peter said that he did, the Lord charged him to feed His lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>To feed the lambs is to feed the infants, the little ones.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Such a top apostle as Peter was charged by the Lord to be a nursing mother to feed the small lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>According to 1 Thessalonians 2:7, we need to nourish and cherish the new ones as nursing mothers.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>To cherish is to nurture with tender love and foster with tender care.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>To cherish a new one is to make him comfortable and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>When a mother cherishes an infant by putting it into her bosom, she makes the infant happy and comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>In such a cherishing atmosphere, the little one can be nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>We must learn how to cherish the new ones to make them happy and comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>We also have to bring them up and lead them to present themselves to God as living sacrifices, according to the Apostle Paul s charge in Romans 12:1.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>After a child is nourished for a period of time, he becomes a teenager.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Once we have nourished and cherished the new ones for a period of time so that they can grow to become teenagers, we need to lead them to present themselves to God as living sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>At the time of their conversion, we offered them to God as spiritual sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>After feeding them for a period of time, we have to lead them, to beg them, and to help them offer themselves to God as living sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>Paul s speaking in the book of Romans is progressive according to the maturity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>By the time he comes to chapter twelve, the believers who were babes have become teenagers.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Therefore, in Romans 12 there is the Body life in which all the members function.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>Some prophesy and others teach vv.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>This Body life can be experienced in the home meetings with the new beginners.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>We need to bring the new ones into the experience of Romans 12:1.</S>
