[1]  FOR THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 1:3-10, 22-23; 3:9-11; Rom 8:17-23; Rev 21-22
[2]  Nearly all of the things revealed about God s eternal plan for the church are found in the two books of Ephesians and Colossians.
[3]  In chapter one of 1 Corinthians we are told that Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God v. 24 . Then in Colossians chapter two, we see that in Christ, God has hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge v. 3 .
[4]  There are three main items concerning the church in the economy of God.
[5]  Ephesians 1:5 says that God predestinated us unto sonship.
[6]  By this divine birth we become the sons of God because we have the life of God.
[7]  By spiritual birth we have received the life of God, but by the birthright we will inherit all that God is and all that He has planned and accomplished.
[8]  The second item of the purpose of God for the church is to deal with His enemy.
[9]  In chapter one of Ephesians there is the positive side of God s purpose for the sonship, and in chapter three there is the negative side against the enemy, that the enemy may be subdued and come to know God s manifold wisdom.
[10]  God is not sorry that there is such an evil one as Satan, because without such a one, God s manifold wisdom could not be manifested.
[11]  It is through all the troubles originating from Satan that God has a chance to show forth His wisdom.
[12]  The best translation of Ephesians 3:9-11 is: And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church, according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[13]  The third main aspect of the church in God s economy is the heading up of all things in Christ.
[14]  We have seen that the first item of the sonship is for the church positively.
[15]  The second item is that the church might make known to the rulers and the authorities the multifarious wisdom of God, in defeating the enemy negatively.
[16]  It is God s eternal purpose that in the economy of the fullness of the times He might head up all things in Christ.
[17]  This will be the consummation of God s eternal purpose for the church: when the sonship of God is fully fulfilled that God may be fully expressed, when the enemy of God is cast out that all of God s problems may be solved, and when all things are headed up in Christ through His Body that all of the creation may be in full harmony, freed from the bondage of corruption and brought into the liberty of the sons of God.
