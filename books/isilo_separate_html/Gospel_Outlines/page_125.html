<h1 class="title">NO OTHER NAME WHEREBY WE MUST BE SAVED</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Acts 4:12</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Only Jesus is both God and man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Men commit sins, and the forgiveness of sins is the exclusive authority of God.</li>
	<li>In order to save men, God had to become a man. Because it was men who committed sins, God had to become a man to bear sins for men. Although as God He had the authority to forgive sins, yet He would have made Himself unrighteous had He forgiven men their sins without first becoming a man to bear those sins.</li>
	<li>The Savior not only has to be a man, but He also has to be God. As a man He can bear sins for men. As God He can forgive men&rsquo;s sins. If the Savior were only God and not man, then He could not bear sins for men. If He were only man and not God, He could not forgive men&rsquo;s sins. In order that He could both bear sins for men and forgive sins, He must be both God and man.</li>
	<li>Only the Lord Jesus is both God and man. Only He can bear sins for men, and at the same time forgive men&rsquo;s sins. Only He can be man&rsquo;s Savior. Therefore, besides Him, there is no other salvation.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Only Jesus died and rose again
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Since men have committed sins, men have to die according to the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteous law. Because there is death, men cannot escape the punishment of sins.</li>
	<li>Men cannot stop sinning because of the sinful nature of man. They cannot stop trespassing God&rsquo;s righteous law.</li>
	<li>Thus the Savior had to die. Only death could take away the punishment for sins. There also had to be a life for men to receive, so that men could overcome the sinful nature.</li>
	<li>Only the Lord Jesus died for men&rsquo;s sins to take away the punishment for sins. He rose from the dead, giving life to those who believe in Him, freeing them from their sinful nature. Therefore, only the Lord Jesus can be men&rsquo;s Savior. Besides Him there is no salvation.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>There is no salvation apart from Jesus
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>All the founders of religion are merely men and not God. Regardless of how perfect, good, and kind they are, they cannot bear sins for men, much less can they deliver men from sin. (I and II are the base and III and IV are the main emphasis of the message.)</li>
	<li>All founders of religion can only teach. They can only teach methods of self-denial. None of them could die for man. None of them could give life to the dead. They cannot save men from the punishment of sin, much less free men from their sinful nature.</li>
	<li>Only Jesus is both God and man to be the Savior, the resurrected One from the dead. Only He could die to bear men&rsquo;s sins and to give life to men. He can take away the punishment of sin and free men from their sinful nature. Only He can be the Savior. Therefore, besides Him, there is no salvation. <em>This must be said emphatically.</em></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to be saved
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Repent and confess your sins.</li>
	<li>Believe in Jesus&rsquo; name. The Scripture says, &ldquo;For neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, wherein we must be saved.&rdquo;</li>
