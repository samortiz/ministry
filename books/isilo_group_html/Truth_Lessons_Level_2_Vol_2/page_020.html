of All Man-made Organizations</h2>
<p>Hence, the city of Babel is a negative type, signifying that all man-made organizations among the human race, whether secular or religious, are for making a name for man himself and for opposing God, and that they are full of fornication and idolatry.

<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Nimrod was a descendant of Ham, who was cursed, and he also took Cain&rsquo;s way of godlessness and death. Hence, according to his genealogy, he was cursed, and according to the godless way that he took, he deserved death and God&rsquo;s destruction. He became a mighty one on the earth, one who was utilized by Satan, took the lead to abuse the authority given to man by God, set himself up as a king, ruled over others, and built a kingdom, bringing in division among Noah&rsquo;s descendants. At Babel he brought in many idolatrous things and invented a most evil emblem, the Madonna with her child, which has been utilized by Satan to deceive fallen people and rob them of their worship to God. He was indeed a negative type, indicating that all those after him who took the godless way and were independent of God were like him&mdash; they were born under the curse, walked in death, became mighty ones, formed nations, and brought in idolatry.</p>
<p>Babel was the birthplace of idolatry on earth. The city of Babel was the dwelling place and protection of the idolatrous people, and the tower of Babel was for the purpose of making themselves a name. As a result, they were judged by God&mdash; their language was confounded and they were scattered throughout the earth. Later, Babel developed into Babylon, which destroyed God&rsquo;s city and temple and was cursed by God, becoming an evil and devilish place. In the New Testament, the material Babylon, which came out of Babel, is mixed with the religious Babylon. At the end of this age, Antichrist will persecute the religious Babylon, the Roman Catholic Church, annihilating her altogether. At His coming, Christ will destroy the material Babylon, the city of Rome. Hence, Babel signifies that all man-made organizations among the human race, whether secular or religious, are for making a name for man himself and for opposing God, and that they are full of fornication and idolatry. Because of this, they will be judged by God&mdash;they will be confounded and scattered.</p>
