   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE THE SUFFERINGS OF WATCHMAN NEE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Watchman Nee endured much suffering for the sake of his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was absolute in following the Lord and faithful in fulfilling his commission.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because of his faithfulness and absoluteness, he was continually mistreated and underwent many hardships.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because he continually fought the battle for the Lord's recovery, he was continually under attack from the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the same time, he was also under God's sovereign hand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The sovereign arrangements of God in his environment were also a source of trouble and a means by which God dealt with him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For these two reasons, he lived a life of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For the most part his sufferings came from the following sources:</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I. POVERTY</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the early years of Watchman Nee's ministry, the economic situation in China was very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Still, he was enlightened to the extent that he was able to fulfill the Lord's calling by serving Him entirely by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The light he received made it impossible for him to work as an employee for anyone: not for a mission, denomination, so-called church, or individual.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because of what he saw, he was exercised to live purely and singly by faith in God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In those days, this was not an easy way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In that kind of financial situation, he came to learn what poverty was.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the early days of his ministry in Shanghai, there were times when he had nothing to eat but a little bread.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>ILL HEALTH</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Nee also suffered frequent ill health.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He began his ministry before 1923 and was not married until 1934.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There was a period of eleven years when he had no wife to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>During those years he lived by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was during this period that he became afflicted with tuberculosis of the lungs and suffered for several years from this disease.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was also afflicted with a stomach illness and with a heart ailment called angina pectoris.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was never cured of the heart disease.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He told me that a number of times before a conference meeting he was forced to lie on his bed until the time arrived to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only then would he rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Immediately after speaking, he would return to bed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because of his ill health, Watchman learned how to be greatly dependent upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He learned how to live by resurrection life in order to meet his physical needs.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many times he ministered not by physical strength but by resurrection life.</S>
