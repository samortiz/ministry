   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DO YOU KEEP YOUR REPENTING PRAYER CONTINUOUSLY?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Repenting prayer is a particular kind of prayer which we must keep continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If there is any prayer without repenting, that prayer is nearly in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Medical doctors tell us that we should always wash our hands before eating.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the same way, we should not pray without repenting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Praying without repenting is like eating without washing our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even if we do not lose our temper or speak evil words, we are still sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So when we come to pray, to take the spiritual food, we have to wash our hands, and to wash our hands is to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should say, "Lord, I still need Your forgiveness, and I still need Your cleansing with Your precious blood."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then we can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After our hands are washed, we can eat.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all need some particular time to repent so that we can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The degree to which we can pray depends upon the degree to which we have repented.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Daniel, in his book, has set up a good example.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Daniel 9 we see that he made a long repentance and confession when he prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>While he was praying and confessing, he received a revelation of the seventy weeks, but Daniel 9 is mostly occupied with his confession.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He repented and confessed not only for himself but also for his people and for his forefathers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So quite often when you repent for yourself, you have to repent for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not forget the church, because you are one with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you are dirty, surely your church is dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you ask me how many times we should repent and confess, my answer is that the number of times is countless.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to repent and confess throughout the day and every day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In a general way, we should first pray, "Lord, I still need Your forgiveness of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I still need Your cleansing with Your blood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Lord, particularly, I need Your forgiveness for my not walking strictly in the Spirit for the whole day."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a particular confession.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes at the end of the day, I can recall that I was not in the Spirit in certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Romans 8:4 says that the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in those who walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you have the assurance that all day you do everything in the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I must tell you that no one can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But you can pray a prayer of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No one can always keep his hands thoroughly clean, but he can wash his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need a continuous washing in the precious blood of Christ 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A number of Christians think that as long as they believe in the Lord everything will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They believe that Christ is their righteousness regardless of what sinful and worldly things they do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such Christians, needless to say, are very loose and unhealthy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They have never seen, especially in the New Testament, that there will be a time of discipline for the loose Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The New Testament says that the unfaithful, loose Christians, at the Lord's coming back, will be cast into outer darkness Matt 8:12; 25:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some may wonder how we believers who have been saved could be thrown into outer darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are walking, living, and behaving ourselves in darkness today, how could we hope that in the coming age the Lord will bring us directly into glory?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Bible is not a sugar-coated book.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is full of warnings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The book of Hebrews has five big warnings 2:1-4; 3:7 4:13; 5:11 6:20; 10:19-39; 12:1-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to be vitalized so that we can be brought on to maturity to receive the Lord's reward in the next age instead of His discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why we have to keep our repenting prayer continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>HAVE YOU AND YOUR COMPANION MADE A NAME LIST OF ALL YOUR POSSIBLE CANDIDATES?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You and your companion need to make a name list of all your possible gospel candidates.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>HAVE YOU ALL PRAYED FOR YOUR CANDIDATES AND RECEIVED THE LORD'S LEADING CONCERNING WHOM YOU SHOULD CONTACT?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to pray for our candidates and receive the Lord's leading concerning whom we should contact.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then we need to carry out the Lord's leading by going to contact these ones.</S>
