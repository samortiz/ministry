   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If believers desire to see their prayers becoming effective in the spiritual realm and if they desire that their prayers would not be fleshly, they should confess their weakness, acknowledging that they do not know how to pray Rom 8:26 , and ask the Holy Spirit to teach them to pray.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many times prayers are only the exercise of the mind; they do not have the inspiration of the spirit.</S>
