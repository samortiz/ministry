Those brothers and sisters who are joining us as guests should only come with their ears. They should not be mouths, nor should they take what they hear and use it as subjects for gossip. Tonight we want to speak honest words before the Lord and speak the truth in love.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT BEING CONTROLLED BY EMOTIONS</h2><p>Brother Chang Yu-zhi: (1) I find it easy for me to lose my temper and to criticize; (2) I always have strong feelings for injustice in others.</p><p>Brother Nee: Brother Chang is easily swayed by his emotions. He does not have much problem with his will. We cannot be influenced by our emotions. What we learn in sickness is a discipline from God through our environment.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING DIRECT AND SIMPLE IN ONE'S MIND</h2><p>Brother David Hsu: (1) I always experience conflicts of various kinds; (2) whenever something happens, I fall into much consideration and my thoughts become very complicated; (3) I also experience conflict between my heart and head.</p><p>Brother Nee: We should have thoughts that are like straight lines. A straight line is the shortest distance between two points. We should not have circumventing thoughts. Once light comes in and we see ourselves, we should apply the dealing right away. If we do this, our mind will become simple.</p><h2 class="head2">Having a Definite Burden in Our Spirit<br />and Speaking into Others' Spirit</h2><p>In serving the Lord, we have to seek for definite burdens in our spirit. We must have the Lord's words within before we can speak His word without. Our words are not just spoken for the ears of others. The real speaking is one in which deep calls unto deep. On the one hand, we should have the spiritual burden within us. On the other hand, our words should be conveyed to the depths of others.</p><h2 class="head2">The Need for Our Speaking<br />to Be Short and Direct</h2><p>The problem with Brother Hsu is the conveying. I have no way of knowing how much burden there is within him. However, he has used so many words and so much time, and yet that which is in his spirit is not yet conveyed to others. This is because there is not enough practice. As a result, his mind is poor. When we speak, our words have to be short and simple. Brother Hsu's problem is not a problem in the basic matter; it is a problem with his speaking. If he practices more, he will avoid the complications and hesitations. Brother Witness Lee's prayers are "light'' in time and "heavy" in content. If a man needs a glass of water, simply give him a glass. There is no need to lay a fifty-yard pipeline first and then put the glass to it.</p><p>It is not easy for you to take such words. It is not easy for me to speak such words either.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A STRONG SPIRIT<br />TO RENDER OTHERS THE PRACTICAL HELP</h2><p>Brother Jih Yung-tung: I am learning to mingle myself with the other co-workers, but sometimes I become withdrawn because of others.</p><p>Brother Nee: Brother Jih needs to be strengthened in his spirit. Real love for the brothers has to do with our being absolute toward the Lord. This requires that our spirit be strong. Those who do not have a strong spirit cannot render others much help in the church. They cannot build others up, and they cannot cause others to waste themselves on the Lord. Only those who have a strong spirit can render others the greatest amount of help. We should not give others fragmentary and defective help. Rather, we should render them practical and definite help. This requires a strong spirit on our part.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> </body></html>
