<h2 class="head1">THE SUBJECT OF ROMANS&mdash;THE PURE GOSPEL</h2><p>F. W. Grant said that the book of Romans is a complete and accurate thesis on the gospel. Everything spoken of in this book is an argument and counterpoint against any possible objection. The more precious and fundamental a truth is, the more men will summon their wisdom to overthrow it. Paul uses this Epistle to defend the gospel. The subject of Romans is the pure gospel. First, it points out that both the Gentiles and the Jews are under sin and cannot stand before the judgment seat of God. Next, Paul points out God's righteousness. This is the very thing that a condemned sinner is afraid of, but it becomes the very shelter and protection to an enlightened sinner when Christ's sacrificial work is revealed. By faith we are justified, and God's righteousness become ours. This gospel not only forgives the sinner of his sins, but secures a new position for the believer. The first part of Romans reveals the power of the blood which Christ shed for the sinner. When we believe in Him, our sins are forgiven. When Christ resurrected, the believers were justified by God. We stand on new ground in Christ and experience God's grace. Once a man receives this precious gospel, he can do nothing but preach it.</p><p>Grant is one of the most famous Bible expositors. Darby is also an able expositor. The former is short in stature while the latter is tall. There is another one, Frederick Louis Godet, who was an orthodox theologian. He represented the continental European school of theology. He was also a very spiritual man.</p><p>One brother said that the King James Version does not pay much attention to the difference between Jesus Christ and Christ Jesus. The same is true with Darby's translation.</p><p>Brother Yu: The Greeks spoke of peace in their salutation. But Paul spoke of blessing. He spoke about his ministry and calling first because he did not know the Christians in Rome that well, and he had to recommend himself and declare his status. The word slave is used also in Galatians 3:28 and 1 Timothy 6:1.</p><p>Watchman Nee: Martin Luther said that the word slave denotes modesty and majesty. In Revelation 22 John wanted to worship the angel, but the angel said that he was a fellow slave (vv. 8-9). It is a glory to be a slave of Jesus Christ! The word serve in Greek denotes a respectful and willing service. This word is used to describe the service of the prophets and kings. The service of a slave is the lowliest and meanest work; it is a work that unties others' sandals. When Paul said that he was a slave of Jesus Christ, he had the same spirit as that of John the Baptist.</p><p>The expression the gospel of God does not merely mean that the gospel speaks of God or that it is about God. Rather, it means that the gospel is established by God and initiated by Him (cf. Rom. 15:16; 1 Thes. 2:2, 8-9).</p><h2 class="head1">CALLED TO BE A STEWARD OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD</h2><p>Paul was a slave of Christ. Paul testified that he was happy to render his service to the Lord as a slave bought by the blood of Christ. At the same time, he was an apostle appointed by God and called by Him unto the service of the gospel. Like it or not, he was separated unto the gospel. He was not solicited by God; he was drafted by Him into the army. He was drafted and enrolled to meet God's need. This is the reason Paul was called to be an apostle. Being separated means being set apart from all men, things, and events, and being made different. This separation happens in three stages. First, in Galatians 1:15 we are told that Paul was separated by God from his mother's womb. This is like the firstborn of Israel being separated unto God in the Old Testament (Exo. 13:12; 22:29-30). Second, in Acts 26:16-18 Paul was separated by the Lord to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. This proves Romans 1:1 which speaks of being separated unto the gospel of God. Third, in Acts 13:2, he and Barnabas were separated by the Holy Spirit unto the work that He had prepared. In these three separations, Paul was called by the Father, the Son, and the Spirit respectively, and all the separations were for the gospel.</p><p>The word gospel means the glad tidings. This is the sum total of the divine economy. The first eight chapters of Romans deal with the matter of salvation. Chapters one through five cover the gospel of grace. Chapters nine through eleven cover God's selection, which relates to His sovereignty in His divine economy. From chapter twelve onward, the book covers the fellowship of the church and various guidelines related to it. Paul was called unto this gospel. This does not mean that he was called to speak at the podium, but that he was called to be the steward of the entire gospel of God. He labored and endeavored for the entire gospel.</p><p>Next time, before we come together again, we have to digest all the reference materials at home first. We cannot wait until we are here to digest the material.</p>
