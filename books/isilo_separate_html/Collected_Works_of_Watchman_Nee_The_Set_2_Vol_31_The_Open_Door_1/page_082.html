My mother's health is fairly good. The brothers and sisters in Tientsin are living and growing. They wrote a letter inviting Brother Witness Lee to come here, but Mr. Lee said that he did not have a burden to come yet. I also heard that the brothers and sisters in Peking invited Brother Philip Luan. Perhaps Mr. Luan will come soon. Thank God, He is never wrong. Brother Sia, one of the responsible brothers in Tientsin, mentioned that he wanted me to have a few days of sisters' meetings. I will be staying one or two months in Tientsin, so I will be praying with the sisters every Friday in the sisters' prayer meeting. The rest of the time I will have much contact with the sisters. Brother Hsia agreed to this. Sister Fu-ru also intends to come north. I have already asked others to look for a house that she can rent. We will see how God leads and arranges. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Hwei-fen<br />February 14<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Peking</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings to our dear Brother Tsi-yi in the Lord:</p><p>I received your letter. We have already received one hundred copies of The Open Door and distributed them to the brothers and sisters.</p><p>We prepared X dollars for the use of The Open Door a long time ago. However, wiring it was a problem, so we did not send it until the twenty-first. We sent it through the Shanghai Bank. Please follow it up. The condition of the assembly is quite good for the most part. Thank and praise the Lord! Please pray for the work here. Peace in the Lord. Please send subsequent issues of The Open Door to the meeting hall for us to distribute to the brothers and sisters. This will save you postage.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Hsiao Lu-yuan, Ping Sin-wo<br />January 22<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Brother Watchman:</p><p>May the Lord give you more spiritual gifts, power, and light, and may the number of believers increase and the work spread. Amen. Thank the Lord and thank you for your love. Yesterday, I received the second issue of The Open Door which you sent. I read the article on the principles of the work and felt that Christians today really need principles like this concerning the truth of the church. It also inspired me to write this letter. Thank and praise God that His faithful servant has already explained everything. Therefore, I am sending a subscription form to order one copy so that I may read everything. Please send me a copy of the first issue as well. I am enclosing my subscription form and one dollar for postage. Peace!</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Ding Jun-jih<br />January 26<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(We printed only one thousand copies of the first issue, and they are all gone. Could you go to 5 Foreign Ministry Street and ask the brothers if they have a copy?&mdash;Editor.)</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_081.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_083.html">Next</a> </body></html>
