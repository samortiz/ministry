   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE A SKETCH OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE GOSPEL OF MATTHEW Scripture Reading: Matt 11:25-30; 12:19-20; 22:41-46; 26:39, 41; 27:41-43; 28:16-20; 5:3; 10:19-20</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The record that Matthew gives us of Christ is not superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is altogether deep.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Most Christians simply realize that Matthew tells us Christ was born of a virgin to be our Savior, He was crucified for our sins, He was buried and resurrected, and now He is our redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is indeed what Matthew tells us, but only what is on the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is something much deeper than this superficial record.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>JEHOVAH PLUS</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we need to see the real structure of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first chapter tells us that Christ was the son of David and the son of Abraham, and He was born of a virgin, Mary, and given the name Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet, His name shall be called Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jehovah is included in the name Jesus, and God is included in the name Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>So in both of the names of Christ, Jesus and Emmanuel, Jehovah God is included.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that this wonderful son of David and Abraham is not simply human, but also divine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is God Himself plus something more.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Jewish people have God, but they do not have God plus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They have Jehovah, but they do not have Jehovah plus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But we have God with us, and we have Jehovah the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is something in addition to what the Hebrews have, and this is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hallelujah for such a wonderful One!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A LONG JOURNEY</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For Jesus to be Jehovah plus and God plus, there was the need of a long, long journey.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He started this journey from Genesis 3:15, just at the time Satan came into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The incarnation of Jesus was purposeful, planned by God in eternity past, even before the heavens and earth were created.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In eternity past God made a plan with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then He came to accomplish His plan firstly by creation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And God said, Let us make man in our image Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It seems that God had a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is only one God, yet this mysterious one God is triune!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He had a conference with Himself in order to make man in His image.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why did God make man in His image?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is because man was made to be God s container, and the container must be in the form of the content.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If something is square, we would not make a round container.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A glove is made according to the image of a hand, because a glove is made for a hand to be put into it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Praise the Lord, man was made in God s image with the intention that one day God would be put into him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Romans 9:23 tells us that we are vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are God s vessels; we are God s container.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God purposed that one day He would be incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then He created man in His image and built a wife for him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the wife became the back door through which the subtle one came into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He thought that he had caught man, but he did not know that he was the one that was caught.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Humanity eventually became a trap to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He got into man, but he was also caught in man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, immediately after Satan came into man, the prophecy concerning the incarnation of Christ began.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Genesis 3:15 says that the seed of woman will bruise the serpent s head.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore Hebrews 2:14 tells us that Christ in the flesh through death destroyed the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>FORTY-TWO GENERATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now we can see the purposeful plan of the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Genesis 3:15 the incarnation was prophesied.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After many generations it was repeated to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then from Abraham to Mary, after forty-two generations, it was fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Forty in the Bible means temptation, trials, and sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Israel was in the wilderness for forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord Jesus fasted in the wilderness for forty days.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever this number is used, there are always sufferings, trials, and temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The number forty-two means that the trials and the temptations are over!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Revelation we see the prophecy of the last three and a half years of the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Three and a half years are forty-two months.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the forty-two months are past, Christ will come and the tribulation will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That will usher in the rest of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From Abraham to Mary is forty-two generations.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then Christ comes!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Before Mary, the previous forty generations were all trials, sufferings, and temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There was no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But when Christ comes, forty is over, and the rest begins.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The incarnation was not an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It was planned and scheduled from eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>And, praise the Lord, it was accomplished!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>And by the accomplishment of incarnation, a wonderful Person came.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As soon as He was born religion rose up against Him, and He was forced to go to Galilee of the Gentiles Matt 4:15 to settle in a small, poor, and lowly town by the name of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is why He was called a Nazarene according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He was a wonderful Person, yet He became a Nazarene Matt 2:23 .</S>
