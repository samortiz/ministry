   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST LEAVING THE DISCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With John 14 a change comes in. The Lord told the disciples He was going away v. 2 . This news was disturbing to them, for they enjoyed being with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He went on to tell them that it was better for them that He went away.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After all, He was only among them, not in them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As long as He was there with them physically, He was outside them, even though He was in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His longing was to enter into them and be their life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter ten He had said, "I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly" v. 10 . He came not merely to enjoy their companionship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The disciples were happy to be in His presence, but they still did not have His life in them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He could not enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How could He enter into them?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was God, but one day He became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a man He went about meeting the needs of man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His disciples were happy to be with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They loved Him and rejoiced that He was among them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet for Him this was not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As long as He was external to them, He could not be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>More than twenty years ago my family and I were living in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One winter day I bought a huge watermelon, We were from the northern part of mainland China, where such melons were not available in the winter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Taiwan, however, the climate was tropical, and all year round watermelons could be bought.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was happy to buy one and take it home.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I put it on the dining table, and my eight children gathered around, excited to see it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Suddenly I picked it up and took it to the kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The youngest one cried, "Daddy, don't take it away!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We like it."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I said to her, "Little one, if this melon stays on the table as it is, you can't eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Wait just a few minutes and it will be ready for you to eat."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the kitchen the maid cut it into slices.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When it came back out, it was all ready to be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In less than twenty minutes the whole melon was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It had entered into all my children.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Peter, James, and John, do you understand this?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is good for Me to be here with you, but how can I enter into you?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I need to go to the kitchen and be cut.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I need to be cut on the cross for you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I need to die for your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I need to die to destroy the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I need to be cut that My life may be released.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I must go away, but I will be back.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I will not leave you orphans.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After three days I will return in another form.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now I am in the flesh, but when I come back it will be in another form.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I will come back in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I will return to you as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you read John 14, 15, and 16, you will see that this thought is behind the Lord's words to His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He did leave them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He died.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The disciples lost Him for three sad days.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the morning of the third day, however, one of their number, a sister, saw Him at His tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He talked with her and sent word to His brothers that He would meet with them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They only half believed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After all, only three days before they had seen Him crucified and then buried in a tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Others of their number also met and talked with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They did not know what to make of it all.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then on the evening of that same day they came together, keeping the doors tight shut for fear of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What they talked about is hard to imagine.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Perhaps they just sat there looking at each other, wondering about the strange happenings.</S>
