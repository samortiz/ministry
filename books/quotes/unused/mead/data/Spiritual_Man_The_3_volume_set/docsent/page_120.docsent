   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Holy Spirit indwelling man's spirit is a very important thing.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If a believer does not know that the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit is in the deepest part of his whole being, which is deeper than his mind, emotion, and will, he will surely seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit in his mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we understand this, then we will know that we were deceived before and were wrong in looking outward, outside the spirit in the soul, or inside or outside the body for guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Holy Spirit is indeed dwelling in the deepest part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, His work can only be expected to be seen there; His guidance can only be found there.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our prayer is toward the "heavenly Father," but the heavenly Father is within us leading us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our Comforter is within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, His guidance also issues from there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we seek a sign from a dream, vision, voice, or feeling outside of our spirit, then we will be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many believers often look inwardly, searching into their own thinking, feeling, and opinion to see whether they have peace, how much grace they have received, or what kind of progress they have made.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not of faith, and it is very harmful.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This causes the believer to turn his eyes away from Christ to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But there is another kind of inward looking which is different from the one just mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The greatest deed of faith is to look to the guidance of the Holy Spirit, who dwells in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The believer's mind, emotion, and will cannot sense the things within him, yet even in darkness he must believe that God has given him a new spirit, within which dwells the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Just as God who dwelt behind the dark veil was believed, feared, and yet not seen by man, the Holy Spirit indwelling man's spirit also cannot be sensed by his soul and body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After seeing this, we know what is the real spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not many thoughts and visions in the mind; neither is it many enthusiastic, joyful, and happy feelings in the emotion; nor is it sudden shakings, penetrations, and contacts brought by outward forces upon the body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, it is a life issuing from the Spirit which is in the deepest part of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A real spiritual life is deeper than the mind, the feelings, and the consciousness of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is in the deepest part of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Truly walking according to the spirit is knowing the moving of the innermost spirit and following it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No matter how wonderful experiences in the mind, emotion, and will are, if they are just outward, not even deeper than feelings, then these experiences are not of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only the effect produced by the work of the Holy Spirit in man's spirit can be counted as a spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Anything else is just thought and feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A spiritual living needs faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Romans 8:16 says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit" not the heart or the soul "that we are children of God."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man's spirit is the part where man works together with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How do we know that we have been saved through regeneration and are the children of God?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We know because our spirit has been made alive and the Holy Spirit lives in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our spirit is a regenerated and renewed spirit, and He who dwells in, yet is distinct from, our spirit is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He bears witness with our spirit within us.</S>
