However, it cannot prevail against the church, for the church is the Body of Christ, the Head, who sits on the throne in heaven. All authority in heaven and on earth is given to Christ. Since the church is His Body, the gates of Hades cannot prevail against the church. This ascended Head has already been crowned with glory and honor on the throne (Heb. 2:9). He has also received authority from God the Father and has been made Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36) and the Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:5). Now He operates by His Spirit, which is the sevenfold intensified Spirit (Rev. 4:5; 5:6), to apply all that He has accomplished and obtained to us for the building up of His Body. This is the work of Christ in heaven. Heaven, where He is, is joined to our spirit. The spirit within us is linked to heaven. The book of Genesis in the Old Testament records the story of Jacob when he dreamed of a heavenly ladder in the wilderness. On the ladder there were angels of God ascending and descending (Gen. 28:12). The heavenly ladder is a type of the ascended Christ. The place where the ladder was set up was called Bethel, and it was the gate of heaven (Gen. 28:18-19). Hebrews 4:16 tells us that we can come boldly to the throne of grace. We are now living on earth. How then can we come to God&#8217;s throne in heaven? The key is the spirit mentioned in verse 12 of Hebrews 4. The Christ who is sitting on the throne in heaven is now also in us (Rom. 8:10), that is, in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). God&#8217;s dwelling place is this spirit. Bethel is the house of God, the habitation of God, and the gate of heaven. There Christ is the ladder, linking earth to heaven and bringing heaven down to earth. Since our spirit now is God&#8217;s dwelling place, this spirit is the gate of heaven. Here Christ is the ladder, joining us, the people on earth, to heaven and bringing heaven to us.<p>Sometimes when you wake up in the morning, you feel very weak. But when you call &#8220;O Lord Jesus,&#8221; immediately the ascended Christ will be transmitted into you like electricity, and you will be strengthened within. Sometimes you feel tired and do not want to come to the meetings. But as soon as you say softly within, &#8220;Lord!&#8221; something will start moving within you, and you will end up coming to the meeting. The more you come to the meetings, the more you will be joined to heaven, and the stronger you will become. All the tiredness will be gone. This is Christ bringing heaven to us within, enabling us to overcome Satan&#8217;s might of death.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE ASCENDED HEAD GIVING GIFTS TO MEN</h2><p>Ephesians 4:8-11 shows us that this ascended Head gave gifts to men. After Christ ascended, He first gave some gifted persons to the church. These gifted persons are people who &#8220;stir up&#8221; churches and also perfect others to &#8220;stir up&#8221; more churches.<h2 class=head2>Some Apostles</h2><p>The ascended Head gave four kinds of gifts. The first class is the apostles (Eph. 4:11). These apostles receive the revelation of God&#8217;s New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church (Matt. 16:16-18; Gal. 1:11-12, 15-16; Eph. 3:3-4, 8-11; 5:32). First, they receive the revelation, and the revelation makes their spirits burning and causes them to forget about themselves. They then go out to preach the revelation that others may also be burned. These apostles also preach the gospel of Christ to save the sinners chosen and called by God, bringing them to Christ (Gal. 1:16a; Eph. 3:8; 2 Cor. 11:2). They do not preach the superficial gospel, one that tells people about going to heaven instead of hell; rather, they preach to others the all-inclusive Christ as the gospel. Furthermore, the apostles are able to establish local churches and to appoint in them the elders for leading, shepherding, teaching, and overseeing (Acts 14:23; 1 Tim. 5:17; 1 Pet. 5:2). They are also able to determine doctrines, to release the truth, to perfect the saints, and to build up the Body of Christ (1 Tim. 2:7; Eph. 4:11-12). These are the four things that an apostle should do.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Economy of God and the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
