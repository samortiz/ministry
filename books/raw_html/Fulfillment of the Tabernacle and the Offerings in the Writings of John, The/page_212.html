<h2 class=head2>Bearing the Cross without Rejection</h2><p>John 19:17 says, “And bearing the cross Himself, He went out to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.” When the Lord Jesus was forced to bear the cross Himself, He did not reject it, even though He had not slept the previous night and had not eaten anything. He did not protest, as we might have done, saying that He had done nothing wrong or complaining that He had to bear His own cross. The Lord behaved in such a way as to show His opposers and His disciples that He is the resurrection. In His behavior the Lord showed that as the One who is the resurrection, He could pass through the process of death without being afraid of anything.<h2 class=head2>Tolerating the Stripping Silently</h2><p>Those who were persecuting the Lord Jesus first took off His garments and then mockingly put a purple garment on Him. Later, they took off the purple garment and put His own garment on Him. Eventually, when the Lord was crucified, He was stripped of His garments (vv. 23-24). Silently He tolerated this stripping. Then after they nailed Him to the cross, the soldiers took His garments and made four parts, a part for each soldier (v. 23). But because the Lord is the resurrection and the life, He did not have any reaction to being stripped of His garments.<h2 class=head2>Caring for His Mother While Undergoing Crucifixion</h2><p>Even while the Lord Jesus was suffering on the cross, He cared for His mother. “Jesus, seeing His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by, said to His mother, Woman, behold, your son. Then He said to the disciple, Behold, your mother. And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home” (vv. 26-27).<p>We also see the Lord’s care in the garden when He was arrested: “Jesus answered, I told you that I am; if therefore you are seeking Me, let these go away” (18:8). Even under the suffering of the betrayal of His false disciple and the arrest of the soldiers, the Lord still took good care of His disciples. This reveals His easy manner in passing through the process of death. The principle is the same with His caring for His mother while He was undergoing crucifixion.<p>Once again we see that the Lord was not afraid of death or weak in the presence of death. He was bold, strong, and vigorous because He is the resurrection and the life.<h2 class=head2>Taking the Vinegar Offered to Him in Mockery</h2><p>When the Lord Jesus said, “I thirst,” He was given vinegar to drink (vv. 28-29). The vinegar was offered to Him in mockery. Nevertheless, the Lord took the vinegar that was offered to Him in this way.<p>Every aspect of the Lord’s behavior in this chapter indicates that He was strong, bold, and not afraid of death. He passed through death and overcame it, manifesting the fact that He is the resurrection and the life.
