   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ Becoming Everything</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because of man's reaction, God, who had hired everyone, eventually fired everyone that He might replace everyone with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When everyone and everything is replaced with Christ, Christ becomes everything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, He becomes to us both the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Isaiah, everything is fired, discharged by God, and then the discharging God comes in to replace everything with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is Paul's concept in Colossians 2:16 and 17: "Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here Paul is telling us that our food and drink, feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths are all shadows of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ, therefore, is the replacement of all the things in God's Old Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God put all things in place, and then He fired them all.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He put all the kings in place, and then He fired them all and made Christ the unique King.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, the kingship of Christ is a corporate kingship; it includes Christ and those who are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the same way, the priesthood is a corporate matter: Christ is the High Priest, and we are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way God replaces everything with Christ, and we are joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the one hand, we are fired, and on the other hand, we are not expelled; for Christ comes to live in us, with us, by us, and through us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is Immanuel replacing everything and being everything in God's economy.</S>
