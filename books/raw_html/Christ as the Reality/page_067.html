<h2 class=head1>A BALANCED HUMANITY</h2><p>Look at the corruption and lawlessness of today’s situation, especially among the young generation. The young people long to be liberated and free in everything. They want to be liberated from the yoke of their parents, from the yoke of their schools, from the yoke of the police, from the yoke of the neighborhood, and even from the yoke of the constitution of the country. Their concept is that the more wild they are, the more free they are. They do not want to be bound in any way. But have you realized that this kind of concept comes from Satan, the source of lawlessness? He is the source of all the rebellion against authority, because he hates the kingdom of God.<p>For God to have a kingdom on the earth among the younger generation, there is the need of a group of people to be redeemed and regenerated in order to take the humanity of Jesus. By this humanity they are balanced in all things. For example, not long ago the neckties were quite narrow. But today, they are wider than ever. They look like a big fan. Don’t you think that is rather extreme? Of course, outward adjustment will never work, but if we take the humanity of Jesus, I do believe that we will not be that extreme. By taking the Lord’s humanity, we will never be out of balance. We must be under God’s heavenly ruling. If we are, even our neckties will manifest our balance. Our shoes and our clothing will give others the impression that we are absolutely sane, healthy, and sober. We are sober and balanced. Everything is properly proportioned. We know what kind of shoes we must wear; we even know how much we can spend to buy a pair of shoes. We are so balanced, so moderate, so sober, and so healthy. We must be able to make such a declaration to the whole universe. All the demons know the true situation much better than we do. If we make such a declaration, they may point to our hair. Our hair may indicate that we are not so sound. They may point out the pair of shoes that we bought last week. We may say that we are balanced, but actually we may not be. We may be simply following the modern ways of today’s evil generation. When they wear strange things, we follow and wear them too. Only unbalanced people do this. This is why there are many mental cases. However, we are under the covering of the Lord’s prevailing blood. By His victorious grace we can boldly declare to Satan that we are not mental cases. We are moderate in everything. But it is not because of us; it is by the humanity of Jesus. We enjoy His humanity in our daily walk.<h2 class=head1>A MAN TO JUDGE</h2><p>The Son of Man is sitting on the throne not only in Ezekiel, but also in Daniel 7:13-14: “I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.” Daniel saw this vision of the Son of Man coming to the Ancient of days to receive the kingdom. We know that this is the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus Himself told us of the time when the Son of Man will sit on the throne (Matt. 19:28), and John 5:27 tells us that God gave Him the authority to execute judgment because He is the Son of Man. As a man, He is qualified to execute God’s judgment.
