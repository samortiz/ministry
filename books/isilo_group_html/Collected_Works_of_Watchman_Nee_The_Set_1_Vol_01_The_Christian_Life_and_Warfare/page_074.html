Gordon. It originally appeared in The Overcomer, published by The "Overcomer" Office Leicester, England, August 1910.)</P><P>"Be earnest and unwearied in prayer, being on the alert in it, and in your giving of thanks..." Col. iv. 2. Weymouth.</P><P>The great thing that makes the difference is not the service, not the life, but God's touch upon them. God always needs human agency. He must have someone to use always.</P><P>He mostly talks to men through men, and He will use us if we will let Him, but the great thing in all the using is not the agency but Himself.</P><P>We all need power, the power of the Holy Spirit. There is no power apart from Him-He must be in full control of all power-bodily, mentally and spiritually.</P>	<div class="left20">	<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="400">	<tr>	<td width="150">Five outlets of power.</td><td width="250">Five avenues.</td>	</tr>	<tr>	<td>1.-The Life.</td><td>What we are.</td>	</tr>	<tr>	<td>2.-The Lips.</td><td>What we say.</td>	</tr>	<tr>	<td>3.-The Service.</td><td>What we do.</td>	</tr>	<tr>	<td>4.-The Gold.</td><td>What we do not keep.</td>	</tr>	<tr>	<td valign="top">5.-The Prayer.</td><td>What we claim in the Lord Jesus,<br>the Victor's Name.</td>	</tr>	</table>	</div><P>The greatest is number five. The greatest thing anybody can do is to pray. The man pleads only as much as he loves.</P><P>The greatest thing anybody can do is to pray, but it is not the only thing, but it is the first thing, and the chief thing.</P><P>If a man must change things by prayer he must first of all be right in his touch with the Father, and that is only possible through our Lord Jesus.</P><P>Prayer and then the serving, and the sacrificing, and the offering will grow out of prayer.</P><P>The greatest people in the world are the people who pray-I do not mean those who speak about prayer, or believe in prayer, nor those who can explain nicely about prayer, but I mean the people who take time and pray.</P><P>Prayer is to give the cream of your thought-of your strength, to the quiet time alone with God for prayer.</P><P>Take time from something else, something else less important, and there are people who take time, first time for prayer, they are the followers to-day, who are being used of God in defeating the great traitor prince of this world.</P><P>The word to-night is this. That the full purpose of prayer is not upwards but outwards.</P><P>The chief purpose of prayer is not Godward, but it is Satanward, i.e. the prayer is always directed to God the Father, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and in dependence on the Holy Spirit, but the effective drive of the prayer is upon the vast world.</P><P>All prayer begins yonder, then to a man here, and then back to God. Prayer does not influence God's purpose, but it does influence His actions, because it gives Him the liberty through our willingness to carry out His plan down here in the world-the whole driving purpose of prayer is this:-To join hands with God to defeat the Evil One.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_073.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_075.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 01: The Christian Life and Warfare &nbsp; pg 74</div><br></body></html>
