   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As believers, we have been appointed for afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To suffer afflictions is our destiny because this is God s ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1 Thessalonians 3:3 Paul encourages the believers not to be shaken by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed for this.</S>

   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>L. Not Fearing Those Who Kill the Body</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>but Are Unable to Kill the Soul,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because They Are of More Value</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Than Many Sparrows, and Even Their Hairs</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Are All Numbered by Their Father</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Matthew 10:28 the Lord Jesus said, Do not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is the only One who is able to destroy both the soul and the body in Gehenna.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are sent by the Lord and fail to endure persecution, we will be disciplined by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This will take place at the Lord s return 2 Cor 5:10; Rev 22:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not fear man s persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Matthew 10:29-31 says that not one sparrow will fall to the earth without our Father s permission, but even the hairs of our head are all numbered by our Father; therefore, we should not fear, because we are of more value than many sparrows.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>M. In Affliction Enjoying the Peace of Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Who Has Overcome the World</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By experiencing the dispensing of the processed Triune God, the believers in affliction enjoy the peace of Christ who has overcome the world.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the world you have affliction, but take courage; I have overcome the world John 16:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this world there are only trouble and persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the Lord died and resurrected so that we can have peace in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No matter how much this world troubles and persecutes us, we do not need to worry, nor do we need to fear, because the Lord has overcome the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord is the peace that we enjoy in affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>N. Suffering Ushering Them into</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perfection and Glory</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peter says that the suffering we experience will usher us into perfection today and into glory in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The God of all grace, He who has called you into His eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground you 1 Pet 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We like to have perfection and receive glory without suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, God knows how much suffering we need.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God is the God of all grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In His economy and according to the many steps of the divine operation on us and within us, He ministers to us the riches of the bountiful supply of the divine life in many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The initial step is to call us, and the consummate step is to glorify us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Between these two steps are God s loving care while He is disciplining us and His perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding work within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we are persecuted, the God of grace will perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us after we suffer a little while.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He has called us into eternal glory, a glory that is unlimited in both space and time.</S>
