<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Campus Work in Shanghai</H2><P>Today, if we send all the co-workers left behind in Shanghai to the campuses, it will not be enough to meet the need of the three universities alone. I venture to say that it is not suitable for the co-workers here in Shanghai to go to Foochow. In Chiao-tung University, National Medical University, and Shanghai Medical University alone, we have enough work to do already. Chiao-tung University has two to three thousand students. Shanghai Medical University has a thousand. In the past, when the Western missionaries came to preach the gospel, they had to build their own houses and hire their own people. But now everything is ready. The ones to preach the gospel are there, and the ones to hear the gospel are also there. The chairs and the lights are all there in the auditoriums already, and everything is so convenient. Today among us, we have seventy to eighty university students. In Chiao-tung University, sixty students are breaking the bread there. In National Medical University, we have a few dozen students. But we are short of people, and we are short of money. We are short of these two things. Recently we bought a car, two passenger vans, and a big bus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Campus Work in Nanking</H2><P>In Nanking, we have not officially started our work yet. But at present, there are five hundred people breaking the bread there already. We notice that in Nanking there are students who come from the remote regions of China. At present, there are some brothers in the church who can speak the native Sinkiang language. Once when I was preaching the gospel there, the dean of a certain school stood up to receive the Lord. After these brothers and sisters receive four years of spiritual education, they can become our "commando" units when they graduate. If we do not let them go, then there is nothing to it. But if we let them go, these ones will go back to their home provinces to preach the gospel. They will go to Mongolia, Sinkiang, and Tibet. The problem is still the lack of money. These schools are in Shia-kwang district. It is a problem for the students to come up with enough money to come to the meeting. Today, God has done much work on the campuses, and the door of the gospel is wide open.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BROTHER NEE'S FELLOWSHIP</H2><P>Brother Nee: Perhaps Brother Lee will say that I have left too few co-workers in Shanghai. But it is not an easy thing to make arrangements. I have opened up my spirit to the brothers, and I hope that the brothers will also open up their spirit to me. At present, the need in Shanghai cannot be met yet. Brother Lee's family cannot move here yet, and Brother David Hsu's family cannot move here either. Brother Chang Yu-tse said that he will have to return home. Brother Kang has quit his job at the China Textile Corporation, and he can no longer live in its dormitory. Brother Tang Shou-ling will also quit his teaching job soon. We have a big need in preparing the outward matters to match the spiritual move. Many people criticize us in a cheap way. In the end, they will not move even a little finger. We co-workers are working with a burden on our shoulders; we are not working in a light-hearted manner. Some people are here only as spectators. Our words are not for you.</P><P>Today in the Northwest, some still have to testify to their faith by their own blood. We can only help them in our prayers.</P>
