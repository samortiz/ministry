[4]  CHAPTER ONE A MYSTERY CHRIST MAGNIFIED THE MYSTERY OF GOD
[5]  In the New Testament Christ has a particular title.
[6]  But in Colossians 2:2 we see a very particular title of Christ the mystery of God.
[7]  My burden in this message is not to share about the mystery; it is to have fellowship with you concerning the experience of the Christ who is the mystery of God.
[8]  But in this verse we do not have merely the Spirit of Jesus nor the Spirit of Christ, but the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[9]  To magnify Christ is to express Christ without limitation.
[10]  It is to show to the whole universe that the very Christ who is our life and by whom we live is unlimited.
[11]  The experience of Christ is a mystery, and whatever we experience of Christ is unlimited.
[12]  If we see this vision, it will not only control our life, but also strengthen our Christian walk.
[13]  For example, we may speak by Christ, but our speaking by Christ is a mystery.
[14]  This type of mysterious experience produces the genuine growth in life.
[15]  The so-called wonderful experiences actually do not help us to grow in life.
[16]  It is these mysterious experiences of Christ that help us to grow.
[17]  The experience of Christ is altogether a mystery, and this experience is unlimited, for it is Christ magnified.
[18]  According to our concept, to experience Christ we must clear the past, consecrate ourselves to Christ, open to the inner anointing, and obey the anointing.
[19]  We human beings are not simple, but complicated and intricate.
[20]  In chapter one of Philippians, a chapter on the fellowship in the gospel, Paul says that some preach Christ out of envy, strife, and rivalry vv.
[21]  Notice that in Philippians 1:19 Paul speaks not of the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jesus, or the Spirit of Christ, but of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[22]  The first two chapters of Philippians are related to the Spirit of Jesus, and the last two are related to the Spirit of Christ.
[23]  The first verse says, "If there be therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions" Gk.
[24]  We have seen that the book of Philippians is a book on the experience of Christ.
[25]  Many Christians point to Paul's word in Philippians 3 about counting all things loss for Christ and knowing Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.
[26]  At this point we can make a distinction between the experience of Christ and the enjoyment of Christ.
[27]  The experience of Christ is a matter primarily in our spirit, but the enjoyment of Christ is in our soul.
[28]  To experience Christ is one thing, and to enjoy Christ is another.
[29]  Our need today is very similar to that of the Philippians.
[30]  In chapter one Paul said of the Philippians, "I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy" vv.
[31]  For years, we have spoken about the experience of Christ and the enjoyment of Christ, but we have not seen the detailed way to enjoy Christ.
[32]  The last part of Philippians 1 and the first part of Philippians 2 are actually one portion and should not be separated.
[33]  In verse 2 we find not only the matter of the mind, but also the matter of the emotion, for love is a matter of emotion.
[34]  Verse 3 says, "Let nothing be done by the way of rivalry or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves" Gk.
[35]  In the first message we saw that Philippians is a book on the experience of Christ.
[36]  Chapter one reveals that the way to experience Christ is through keeping ourselves in the fellowship in the gospel by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[37]  If we would remain in the fellowship in the gospel by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, we need to be in one spirit with one soul.
[38]  Being one in soul is not only for the experience of Christ, but even the more for the enjoyment of Christ.
[39]  Our experience of Christ should also be an enjoyment of Christ.
[40]  The longer we are in the Lord's recovery, the more we shall learn and the more experiences we shall accumulate.
[41]  When many of us saw the light regarding the Lord's recovery, we dropped everything of the past and came together to practice the church life.
[42]  The experience of Christ is for the church life.
[43]  The Christ revealed in chapter two and pursued by Paul in chapter three is not for individual experience, but for the Body life.
[44]  Philippians 2:12 says, "Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
[45]  This one thing is clearly revealed in chapter three, where Paul speaks of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus the Lord v. 8 . To experience Christ as our enjoyment for the church is excellent.
[46]  When we all think this one thing, we shall be one in soul.
[47]  Verse 13 says, "For it is God which worketh in you both the willing and the working for his good pleasure" Gk.
[48]  Verse 15 says, "That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world" Gk.
[49]  Verse 17 says, "But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all" Gk.
[50]  The drink offering is not only the objective Christ, like the Christ offered to God in the burnt offering or meal offering, but the subjective Christ who has been taken into us.
[51]  Recently we have been unjustly accused of being mind benders.
[52]  In the church life we help all the saints to think one thing the enjoyment of Christ for the church life.
[53]  Philippians 3:2 says, "Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision."
[54]  We have seen that in verse 2 three matters are mentioned.
[55]  Verse 3 also mentions three items: worshipping by the Spirit of God, boasting in Christ Jesus, and having no confidence in the flesh Gk.
[56]  Because we contact God and worship Him by His Spirit, we are not dogs, and because we are in Christ and boast in Him, we are not rebels or evil workers.
[57]  In Philippians 3:4-6 Paul presents a clear picture of the flesh.
[58]  After saying that he had reason to trust in the flesh, Paul proceeds to list seven aspects of the flesh: being circumcised the eighth day, being of the stock of Israel, being of the tribe of Benjamin, being a Hebrew of the Hebrews, being a Pharisee as concerning the law, being a zealous persecutor of the church, and being blameless according to the righteousness of the law.
[59]  As we have pointed out, a dog is an unclean person.
[60]  But we, the sons of God, are clean, and our food is Christ.
[61]  But if we do not reject ourselves and our plans, we shall not have any Christ to eat, for our self and our plans will fill our being and not leave any room for Christ.
[62]  In order to know what the excellency of the knowledge of Christ is, we need to see that the main comparison in chapter three is between the law and Christ.
[63]  In verses 7 and 8 Paul uses the words "on account of" three times: on account of Christ, on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, and on account of whom, referring to Christ.
[64]  When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, he knew nothing of the excellency of Christ.
[65]  Rather, he thought that the law was marvelous, and, as a Jew, he was proud of it and zealous for it.
[66]  If you compare the sum total of all people and all things with Christ, you will gain the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, and Christ will become all the more dear to you.
[67]  When some Christians speak about experiencing Christ, they become greedy and desire to swallow all of Christ at one time.
[68]  But it took Paul more than thirty years to enjoy Christ.
[69]  However, some of the young people are impatient in the experience of Christ and complain about enjoying only a little of Him at a time.
[70]  Now we come to the fellowship of Christ's sufferings.
[71]  In the previous message we saw five crucial items in Philippians 3: the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith, the power of Christ's resurrection, the fellowship of Christ's sufferings, and the conformity to Christ's death.
[72]  These five matters relate to one concept living by Christ that we may obtain Him.
[73]  The word "obtain" in Philippians 3:12 Gk. implies the experience of Christ and the enjoyment of Christ.
[74]  One day the Lord Jesus brought His disciples to Caesarea Philippi and asked them who people were saying that He was.
[75]  They told Him that some said that He was Elijah, Jeremiah, John the Baptist, or one of the prophets.
[76]  But when He asked them who they thought He was, Peter immediately replied, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[77]  After Peter declared that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus told His disciples that He would be crucified and resurrected on the third day.
[78]  Paul also desired to gain Christ, to obtain Him, to take possession of Him.
[79]  Therefore, by eating Christ, Christ gets into us and then comes out of us.
[80]  Furthermore, when we take Christ into us by eating Him, Christ becomes the resurrected One within us.
[81]  If we want to participate in Christ, experience Christ, and enjoy Christ, we must repudiate our flesh.
[82]  The greatest obstacle to enjoying Christ is our natural heritage.
[83]  For example, the greatest hindrance for a naturally gentle brother to enjoy Christ is his gentleness, for he may repudiate all things except his gentleness.
[84]  Although we have enjoyed Christ to a certain degree, we all have been frustrated and hindered by our natural heritage.
[85]  The Apostle Paul said, "I pursue, if also I may obtain that for which I have been obtained by Christ Jesus" v. 12, Gk.
[86]  . Christ has obtained us that we may obtain Him.
[87]  Christ has taken possession of us, not that we may go to heaven or be good Christians, but that we may obtain Him.
[88]  Some of these expressions are "the excellency of the knowledge of Christ," "the power of His resurrection," "the fellowship of His sufferings," and "being conformed to His death."
[89]  In verses 13 and 14 Paul said, "One thing I do, forgetting those things behind, and stretching forth unto those things before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize of the above calling of God in Christ Jesus" Gk.
[90]  The meetings of the church should be a testimony of our daily living and our daily walk.
[91]  In our meetings we need to have some genuine testimonies of our experience of Christ and enjoyment of Christ.
[92]  Verse 15 says, "Let us therefore, as many as are full-grown, think this: and if anything otherwise ye think, God shall reveal also this unto you" Gk.
[93]  The one thing we need to think is forgetting everything of the past and stretching forth to pursue the goal of the best experience of Christ that we may receive the prize.
[94]  We need to be occupied with how to be filled with Christ and how to take the lead in the experience of Christ.
[95]  In verse 16 Paul says, "Only this: whereto we have attained, let us walk by the same rule" Gk.
[96]  I appreciate the fact that Christ lives in us.
[97]  As we practice this secret, we should not have any preference concerning what we do in Him.
[98]  We, however, may prefer to do certain things in Him, but not other things.
[99]  If you love the Lord, you need to practice doing everything in Him.
[100]  This is the way to gain Christ and to eat Him.
[101]  In order to magnify Christ, we need to live by Christ and do everything in Christ.
[102]  Of all the Epistles written by Paul only Philippians is clearly and definitely related to the experience of Christ.
[103]  This indicates that in order for us, the members of the Body, to reach the Head, we need the experience of Christ.
[104]  In the book of Philippians Paul was bold to speak not only in a positive way, but also in a negative way.
[105]  Many Christians today do not know the Holy Spirit.
[106]  The second contrast in verses 2 and 3 is the contrast between the evil workers and those who boast in Christ.
[107]  Whatever we do for God, no matter what it is, is an evil work if it is not Christ.
[108]  In Matthew 7 the Lord Jesus said that many will come to Him and say that they prophesied in His name, cast out demons in His name, and did many mighty works in His name.
[109]  Hence, anything we do that is not Christ Himself is evil in the eyes of God, and when we do things that are not Christ we are evil workers.
[110]  Paul's intention in verses 2 and 3 is to lay the foundation so that in the following verses we may know how to experience Christ.
[111]  In order to experience Christ, we need to see that everything we do must be by the Spirit of God, in Christ, and with no trust in the flesh.
[112]  In this message we shall consider the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.
[113]  Also in the Greek, the word translated "on account of" used three times in verses 7 and 8: on account of Christ, on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, and on account of whom Christ .
[114]  The Bible teaches us the law in a negative sense and Christ in a positive sense.
[115]  If we do not know the law negatively and Christ positively, we do not know the Bible.
[116]  When we worship by the Spirit of God, boast in Christ Jesus, have no trust in the flesh, and have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus the Lord, we have the proper basis for the experience of Christ.
[117]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN TO GAIN CHRIST AND BE FOUND IN HIM
[118]  In the previous message we covered the three occurrences of the phrase "on account of" in Philippians 3:7 and 8.
[119]  On account of Christ, Paul counted as loss the things which were gain to him; on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus the Lord, he counted all things loss; and on account of Christ Jesus the Lord, he suffered the loss of all things and counted them dung.
[120]  One day, He, the Word, became flesh, full of grace and truth v. 14 . According to Colossians, Christ is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of every creature, and the One in whom all things were made and in whom they consist Col 1:15-17 . Christ holds together in Himself the entire universe.
[121]  Therefore, Darby translates verse 8 this way: "That I may have Christ as gain."
[122]  To gain Christ means to have Christ as gain.
[123]  But on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, I have forsaken all these gains so that I may obtain Christ as my gain."
[124]  This is the reason that after speaking about gaining Christ, Paul said, "And be found in him" v. 9 . To see Christ is one thing, to gain Christ is another thing, and to be found in Christ is still another thing.
[125]  To be found in Christ actually is to live in Christ.
[126]  He wanted the angels, the Judaizers, and everyone around him to see that he was one who lived in Christ, that he not only gained Christ, but was to be found in Christ.
[127]  Paul saw Christ and paid the price for Christ in order that he might gain Christ.
[128]  Third, we need to live in Christ, remain in Christ, lodge in Christ, speak in Christ, act in Christ, and move in Christ.
[129]  As he was in Christ, having his being in Christ, and moving, walking, and doing everything in Christ, Paul lived out God.
[130]  I have been crucified with Christ, Christ lives in me, and the life which I live I live by the faith of Christ Gal 2:20 .
[131]  In Philippians 3:8 Paul speaks of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.
[132]  Paul took Christ, not only as his life, but also as his faith.
[133]  In Galatians 2:20 he said that he was crucified with Christ, that he lived no longer, and that Christ lived in him; he continued on to say that the life he lived was by the faith of the Son of God who loved him and died for him.
[134]  This verse reveals that Christ lived in Paul and that Paul lived not only by Christ's life, but also by Christ's faith.
[135]  Second Corinthians 2:10 says, "To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ."
[136]  What does it mean to say that Paul forgave in the person of Christ?
[137]  Second Corinthians 10:1 says, "Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and considerateness of Christ" Gk.
[138]  . This verse does not mean, however, that Paul was imitating Christ.
[139]  In 2 Corinthians 12:2 Paul said, "I knew a man in Christ."
[140]  Paul referred to himself as a man in Christ.
[141]  Thus, four things are included in this verse: Christ, the power of His resurrection, the fellowship of His sufferings, and the conformity to His death.
[142]  The mystery of the Christian life is related to the fact that both Christ and we have two lives, the divine life and the human life.
[143]  Christ was God, but one day He became man.
[144]  Concerning this matter of the power of Christ's resurrection, as in so many other matters, many Christians are missing the mark.
[145]  When the Lord put Himself under death, this death gave the best opportunity for the divine life within Him to come forth.
[146]  As we have pointed out, the first thing the Lord Jesus did when He came out to minister was to be buried by John the Baptist.
[147]  At this point we need to differentiate between two kinds of sufferings, the sufferings of Christ and the sufferings that come from our mistakes.
[148]  We have seen that on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, we should count all things loss that we may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having our own righteousness out from the law, but the righteousness that is God Himself lived out of us Phil 3:7-9 .
[149]  The purpose of this is that we might know Him, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.
[150]  But Paul does not stop here; he continues by saying, "Being conformed unto his death" v. 10 . The excellency of the knowledge of Christ, the counting loss of all things, the gaining of Christ, being found in Him, knowing Him, knowing the power of His resurrection, and knowing the fellowship of His sufferings all issue in one thing being conformed to His death.
[151]  This is the reason that in Matthew 3 the Lord Jesus said that He had to be baptized in order to fulfill all righteousness Matt 3:15 .
[152]  Nevertheless, in answering God's ordination, He did not live by His human life, but by God Himself.
[153]  As long as we live by Christ, whatever we do and wherever we go is all right, because it is actually not we who are doing a certain thing or going to a particular place, but Christ who lives in us.
[154]  We have seen that at the end of His life, the Lord Jesus literally entered into death and was buried.
[155]  As we are being conformed to Christ's death, temptations will come to induce us to live by ourselves instead of by the divine life within us.
[156]  In Philippians 3:10 we see that Paul desired to be conformed to Christ's death.
[157]  In addition to the accomplishment of redemption, Christ's death has accomplished twelve things for us.
[158]  In Luke 12:50 the Lord Jesus said, "But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!"
[159]  The Lord's death not only releases the divine life, but also multiplies it.
[160]  By His all-accomplishing death, the Lord Jesus has stripped off principalities and powers Col 2:15, Gk.
[161]  Philippians 3:10 and 11 speak of both death and the out-resurrection from among the dead Gk.
[162]  . The death here is the lovable, all-accomlishing death of Christ.
[163]  Bible expositors have had a difficult time understanding the word "resurrection" in Philippians 3:11.
[164]  Let us now consider Paul's situation regarding this matter when he wrote the Epistle to the Philippians.
[165]  As long as we are not in resurrection, we cannot experience Christ, because Christ today is in resurrection.
[166]  Even if you are a Christian, you cannot experience Christ if you remain in the natural life.
[167]  But when you are willing to be conformed to Christ's death and are spontaneously brought into resurrection, you will meet Christ in resurrection.
[168]  If you are being conformed to His death, you will be in resurrection, and in resurrection you will meet Christ, experience Christ, and enjoy Christ.
[169]  Other verses prove that the out-resurrection spoken of in Philippians 3:11 is not merely a future event, but a present process.
[170]  Romans 6:4 and 5 say that as we have been buried in the likeness of Christ's death, so we shall also walk in the newness of life.
[171]  Romans 8:10 and 11 say that we have Christ within us, that our body is dead because of sin, but that our spirit is life because of righteousness.
[172]  In Philippians 3:8-11 a number of matters are covered.
[173]  Nevertheless, there is just one outstanding point to be conformed to the death of Christ so that, by any means, we may attain unto the out-resurrection from among the dead.
[174]  For this, we first need the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.
[175]  The experience of Christ is not something so superficial as merely receiving grace, obtaining help, or enjoying love from the Christ in the heavens or from the Christ in us.
[176]  In verse 12 Paul says, "Not as that I have already attained, or have already been perfected: but I pursue, if also I may obtain that for which also I have been obtained of Christ Jesus" Gk.
[177]  In order to experience Christ, in this sense we need to persecute Him.
[178]  When some hear such a word, they may say, "It is heresy to say that we, the lovers of Christ, should persecute Him."
[179]  Therefore, the enjoyment is Christ, the experience is Christ, the goal is Christ, and the prize is Christ.
[180]  The prize spoken of in Philippians 3:14 is the prize of God's above calling Gk.
[181]  When some hear that we should think the one thing, they may ask about things such as foot-washing or speaking in tongues.
[182]  Although the situation in Philippi was very good, unlike the situation in Corinth, there was still a problem because the saints there were not all thinking the same thing.
[183]  Thus, Paul besought Euodias and Syntyche, two of his co-workers in the gospel, to think the same thing.
[184]  According to the Bible, death and resurrection are vital both to our Christian life and to God's economy.
[185]  The second point concerning the way to die is that God wants us to live out not our human life, but the divine life.
[186]  In other words He does not want us to live out ourselves; He wants us to live out Him.
[187]  We have seen that God wants us to die, that He wants us to live Him out, and that the most pleasing thing to Him is that we not only live for Him, but live by Him.
[188]  Romans 6:3 says, "Or are you ignorant that as many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?"
[189]  The whole of Romans 6:4 says, "We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into death that as Christ was raised from among the dead through the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."
[190]  When we remain in the death of Christ, it is not the end; it is the threshold of resurrection.
[191]  Whenever I remain in the death of Christ, this death brings me into resurrection, and Christ rises up with me.
[192]  The problem is that we do not remain in the death of Christ.
[193]  If we do not stay in His death, Christ cannot rise up in us.
[194]  If we would know how to die, we must also see that we have a powerful life within us and that this life is Christ.
[195]  Second Corinthians 13:3 says, "Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you."
[196]  Many brothers and sisters have been baptized into Christ's death, but they do not remain in death.
[197]  In this message we come to our need to cooperate with the Spirit.
[198]  Many years ago I read some books which said that we need to crucify ourselves.
[199]  But these messages were not accurate, for they taught us that we had to crucify ourselves in order to be crucified with Christ.
[200]  The more we die, the more living we become.
[201]  Along with crucifying the flesh and putting to death the practices of the body, we need to deny the self.
[202]  Regarding the experience of Christ, the book of Philippians is the most wonderful Epistle in the New Testament.
[203]  Philippians 1:20 indicates that in any situation Christ can be magnified in us.
[204]  In the next verse Paul says, "For to me to live is Christ."
[205]  In chapter three Paul proceeds to tell us that we need the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus the Lord v. 8 . This means that we need the excellency in knowing Christ.
[206]  The first secret in this message is that in order to do all things we need to be in Christ; the second secret is that to be in Christ we must abide in Him.
[207]  For us to be in Him is to abide, remain, stay, in Him.
[208]  In doctrine we may be very clear about this, but we may not practice it in our daily life.
[209]  I am not concerned for doctrine, but for your living.
[210]  In your daily life do you live the life that Christ is living within you?
[211]  This brings us to still another secret, the secret of staying on the cross.
[212]  Remember, Philippians 3:10 speaks of knowing Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings; it also speaks of being conformed to His death.
[213]  In this message we have seen five secrets: the first is that to do all things we need to be in Him; the second, that to be in Him we need to abide in Him; the third, that to abide in Him we need to take care of the anointing; the fourth, that to take care of the anointing we need to remain on the cross; and the fifth, that in order to stay on the cross we must depend upon the indwelling Spirit.
[214]  Although we have seen these five secrets, we must still consider a sixth the secret of how to enjoy the indwelling Spirit.
[215]  In order to be healthy, we need to keep four legalities: eating, drinking, breathing, and sleeping.
