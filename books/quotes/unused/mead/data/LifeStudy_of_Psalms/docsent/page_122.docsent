   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Trusting in God for His Saving</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Shining upon Him</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>David said, "But I trust in You, O Jehovah;/I say, You are my God./My times are in Your hand" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>14-15a .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a very good word, but the New Testament revelation is higher than this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>David's times were in the hand of God, but our entire being is in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>David's times were in God's hand, but we are now in Christ, the embodiment of God 1 Cor 1:30a; 2 Cor 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is much higher to be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 16a says, "Cause Your face to shine upon Your servant."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>David was seeking God's face to shine upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He wanted to be pleasant to God, and he wanted God to be happy with him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This verse is in the context of his desire to be delivered from his enemies and for them to be put to shame vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>15b, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, the shining which David sought in Psalm 31 is not the kind of shining for which we are seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The kind of shining which we need to seek is the shining that exposes us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we are under God's shining, we will see that we are ugly, not pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we get into the shining of God, we will prostrate ourselves on the ground to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>D. Blessing God and Exhorting His Godly Ones</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>to Love Him and to Be Strong and Encouraged</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verses 21-24 David blessed God and exhorted His godly ones to love God and to be strong and encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>IN EXPERIENCING GOD'S FORGIVENESS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Psalm 32 David expressed his sentiment in his experience of God's forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A. Experiencing His Confession</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>and God's Forgiveness of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verses 1-2a say, "Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven;/Whose sin is covered./Blessed is the man to whom / Jehovah does not impute iniquity."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This implies a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If there were no Redeemer, how could the righteous God not impute our iniquity to us?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If God did this without a Redeemer, God would be unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's not imputing our iniquity to us is based upon Christ's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>David said that the blessed man is the one to whom Jehovah does not impute iniquity and "in whose spirit there is no deceit" v. 2b . On the one hand, David indicated that he had been forgiven of his sins, yet on the other hand, he indicated that in his spirit there was no deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is altogether unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If there were no deceit within man, he would not be a sinner in need of God's forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since you need God's forgiveness, you must realize that you are full of deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Who is the one that does not have any deceit in his spirit yet should confess his sins?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is not logical.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verses 3-4a say, "When I kept silent, my bones wasted away/Through my groaning all day long./For day and night Your hand/Was heavy upon me."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>David's expression here is good in showing us that God was dealing with him concerning his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He continued by saying, "My life sap was dried up/As in the drought of summer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Selah./I acknowledged my sin to You,/And I did not cover my iniquity./I said, I will confess my transgressions to Jehovah./Then You forgave the iniquity of my sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Selah" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>4b-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The iniquity of his sin refers to the effectiveness of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God forgave not only our sin but also the effectiveness of our sin which was deserving of His punishment.</S>
