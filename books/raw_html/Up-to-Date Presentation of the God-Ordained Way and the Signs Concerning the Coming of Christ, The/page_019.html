<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Needing to Learn</H2><P>First Corinthians 14:31 says, "For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged." God's desire is that every believer would prophesy. For this reason, we should not only earnestly desire this gift but also make an effort to learn and exercise.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>All Having the Capacity</H2><P>Every saint has the capacity to prophesy for God. God has given this gift to us. All believers possess this gift, and all can prophesy for God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>All Having the Obligation</H2><P>First Corinthians 14:23-25 shows us if all prophesy in the church meetings, this will cause people to be convicted and to be brought back to God. However, if we do not prophesy, we owe God something, we owe others something, and we even owe ourselves something. In the church meetings, the thing that edifies people the most is prophesying. Furthermore, what we prophesy edifies ourselves the most. If in a meeting you stand up to prophesy for God, you feel that that meeting is good; otherwise, you may not feel that it is good. Actually, whether a meeting is good or not does not depend on the meeting itself, but on whether or not you prophesy for God. The reason is that once you speak, the meeting is yours, and all the riches become your supply. Therefore, if we want to be blessed and edified, we should pray and prophesy in the meetings. This is our duty to God and man.</P><P>That God wants us to speak for Him is based on the principle of incarnation. Under the grace of the New Testament, God does not want to do things by Himself; He wants man to cooperate with Him. God and man, man and God, coordinate mutually and cooperate together. When we speak, God speaks. This truly benefits man and glorifies God. Therefore, I encourage all of you to prophesy for God. Do not be afraid or be shy. One who is shy cannot learn to speak a foreign language well. The same is true with our prophesying for God. Do not be afraid; regardless of this or that, speak and keep speaking. Do not be afraid that people will laugh at you if do not speak well. The more you speak, the more you will be able to speak. Furthermore, we can learn from one another and teach one another. We all are students and we all are teachers. Consequently, we all are being perfected and are becoming good prophets.</P><P>If we do mean business to learn to prophesy, I would propose to you that every week you set aside two hours and come together with eight or ten to teach one another and to learn from one another. For this reason, every one of you should have a morning revival every day. There is a publication that is very suitable for this, The Holy Word for Morning Revival, which contains Scripture text, portions from footnotes, and portions from Life-study Messages for our pray-reading and enjoyment of the Lord every morning. When you have a morning revival every day in this way, you will surely have some inspiration which you may jot down. When the weekend comes, you may put together the portions that you have written down, read them over, and do a little polishing so that it will be approximately three minutes long. This becomes a very good draft for your prophesying. Doing this is something very basic, and it will be of great benefit to you.</P><P>Furthermore, in order to prophesy for God, we need to know more of the Bible. Therefore, we need to memorize the best Scripture verses. If you learn to memorize one or two verses a day, you will have an accumulation of the Word. Then, unconsciously, your prophesying will be strengthened. In addition, when you prophesy, avoid wordiness or common words; instead, speak God's word and speak concise words. Eight or ten of you may take turns to practice, to adjust one another, and to learn from one another. Within half a year or a year you will do very well. At that time, when you come together, you will be able to speak for God; you will be able to speak to the point and speak with substance. Furthermore, you will be able to speak forth God so that people can understand, and you will be able to speak God into people so that they can receive the benefit. If in a meeting twenty people can prophesy in this way, no individual preaching can compare with their speaking. When you practice this, in the beginning it may not be so good, but that does not matter. We should simply encourage everyone to speak. It does not matter if we have to "sacrifice" the meeting somewhat. After some practice, gradually the proper condition will be manifested and the improper condition will disappear. After you have learned to prophesy and the ability has been developed, you will receive great profit. Not only will you be able to speak in the meetings, but even your speaking in your daily life will be helped.</P><P>We receive the inspiration in our daily life, and then we can present it in the meetings for the building up of the church. Therefore, our prophesying is not our instant inspiration; it is to prepare something from what we have received of the Lord in our daily life and to offer it in the meetings for others' benefit and for the church's building up. I put these words before you. As long as you mean business to practice this, I am confident that you all will be able to prophesy for God and become New Testament priests of the gospel who fulfill their responsibility.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia on November 6, 1990)</P>
