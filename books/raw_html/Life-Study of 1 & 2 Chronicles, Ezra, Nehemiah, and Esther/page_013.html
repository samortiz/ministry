<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST<br />
AND SECOND CHRONICLES</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SUPPLEMENT TO THE HISTORY OF DAVID</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Chron. 22:2&mdash;29:30</h1>
<p>First Chronicles 22:2&mdash;29:30 is a supplement to the history of David.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. DAVID&rsquo;S PREPARATION OF THE MATERIALS<br />
FOR THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE<br />
OF GOD IN ABUNDANCE</h2>
<p>David&rsquo;s preparation of the materials for the building of the temple of God in abundance typifies Christ&rsquo;s provision for the building of the church of God with His unsearchable riches (22:2-5, 14-16a; 29:2-5a). All the riches provided by Christ are Christ Himself. David was a type of Christ, fighting the battle and gaining the victory. Christ is the unique One who is qualified to provide the materials for the building up of the church of God. The spiritual significances of all the materials provided by David are covered in the life-study of 1 Kings 5&mdash;7.</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s preparation in his affliction, in his trials, and in the victory of his fightings typifies Christ&rsquo;s rich provision for the building of the church of God in His trials and victory over Satan with his power of darkness. According to the record of the New Testament, Christ lived a fighting life, fighting mainly against God&rsquo;s enemy Satan. In His victory He prepared all the materials for the building up of the church of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. DAVID&rsquo;S CHARGE TO SOLOMON</h2>
<p>In 1 Chronicles 22:6-13, 16b we have David&rsquo;s charge to Solomon for the building of the temple of God in peace. The father David was a fighter to gain the provisions. The son Solomon was not a fighter but a peaceful king. In peace he enjoyed what was gained and attained through his father&rsquo;s victories.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. DAVID&rsquo;S CHARGE TO ALL THE LEADERS OF ISRAEL</h2>
<p>In verses 17 through 19 David charged all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon in building the temple of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. DAVID&rsquo;S ARRANGEMENT OF THE ORDER<br />
 OF THE SERVICES OF THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES</h2>
<p>Chapters twenty-three through twenty-six are a record of David&rsquo;s arrangement of the order of the services of the priests and the Levites. This typifies that as the Head of the Body Christ has set up an order in His Body for all the members to keep. We need to realize that there is an order in the Body of Christ, with the various members set in a particular place. The arrangement in the Body is not a matter of who is higher and who is lower; rather, the arrangement is altogether a matter of what has been ordered by Christ. We need to realize that all the members of the Body are necessary and useful, and we should be content with where Christ has placed us in His Body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Making Solomon His Son King over Israel</h2>
<p>David made Solomon his son the king over Israel, indicating that all the priests and Levites were under him (23:1).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Priests Being Ordered<br />
in Twenty-four Divisions</h2>
<p>The priests, the sons of Aaron, were ordered in twenty-four divisions, or sections (24:1-19). In the church life today we serve in different sections.</p>
