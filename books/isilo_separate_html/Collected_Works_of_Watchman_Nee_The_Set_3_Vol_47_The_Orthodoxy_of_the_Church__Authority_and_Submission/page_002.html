It includes: (1) Bible studies given by him during the period when his ministry was not active (The Orthodoxy of the Church); (2) messages released during the resumption of his ministry in 1949 (The Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry); and (3) messages released after the resumption of his ministry, including all of his training messages given at Kuling Mountain (Authority and Submission, Messages for Building Up New Believers, Church Affairs, The Character of the Lord's Worker, How to Study the Bible, The Ministry of God's Word, The Breaking of the Outer Man and the Release of the Spirit, Spiritual Judgment and Examples of Judgment, etc.), as well as conferences and service trainings given in Hong Kong (Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery). In addition, some magazines published during this period are also included in this set (The Ministers, The Open Door, and The Present Testimony). Watchman Nee's ministry during this period blossomed into full maturity, providing an invaluable contribution to the building up of the church. May the One who gave Himself for the church anoint these pages through the all-pervading Spirit and bless the readers with the unsearchable spiritual riches revealed in them, and may their eyes be opened to see God's eternal will, His goal, and His way through the revelation entrusted to His faithful servant.</p><p>The Editor<br />June 1, 1994</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
