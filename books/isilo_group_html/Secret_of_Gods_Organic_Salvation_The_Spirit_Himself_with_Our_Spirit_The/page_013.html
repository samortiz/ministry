Col. 3:10); hence, they are God&rsquo;s new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15).</li>	<li>But this new creation is out of God&rsquo;s old creation, of which so many old things should be renewed to become new.</li>	<li>In fact, the creation of the new man has been completed by Christ on the cross (Eph. 2:15); but in practicality, the believers, who are the members of the new man, should apply to themselves what Christ has completed by being practically renewed in their living.</li>	<li>Renewing is implied in sanctification, which makes the believers new while it is going on within them.</li>	<li>Renewing is the continuation of the washing of regeneration&mdash;Titus 3:5.</li>	<li>The means of renewing:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>By the renewing Spirit (Titus 3:5) mingling with the believers&rsquo; regenerated spirit indwelt by Christ as one spirit to spread into the believers&rsquo; mind (Eph. 4:23) to renew their entire being as a member of the new man.</li>		<li>By the believers&rsquo; walking in the newness of the divine life in resurrection&mdash;Rom. 6:4:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Putting off the old man, that is, by renouncing and denying their old self (Matt. 16:24)&mdash; Eph. 4:22.</li>			<li>Putting on the new man, that is, by applying what Christ has accomplished in creating the new man, by living and magnifying Christ through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:24; Phil. 1:19-21.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	<li>Renewing is through the consuming by the believers&rsquo; environmental suffering&mdash;2 Cor. 4:16:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Killing their outer man.</li>		<li>Renewing their inner man day by day.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The believers must be thoroughly and absolutely renewed that they may be practically the genuine new creation of God and for God&mdash;Gal. 6:15.</li>	<li>The believers should be renewed to be as new as the New Jerusalem since they all will be the consummating part of the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rev. 21:2.</li>	</ol></li><li>The secret of transformation&mdash;the fifth section of God&rsquo;s organic salvation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Regeneration has added the divine life to the believers&rsquo; redeemed life, making the two a &ldquo;grafted&rdquo; life; thus, the believers participate in God&rsquo;s divinity.</li>	<li>Sanctification has sanctified the believers, especially in their nature, with the holy nature of God to change their nature; thus, they also participate in God&rsquo;s divinity.</li>	<li>Renewing has renewed the believers mainly in their mind to change their mind with the mind of Christ; thus, they also participate in God&rsquo;s divinity.</li>	<li>Transformation transforms the believers&rsquo; entire being, by the transforming Spirit in their spirit filled with Christ, into the glorious image of Christ, that they may fully participate in God&rsquo;s divinity:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>It is by renewing (Rom. 12:2b); it is the issue of renewing.</li>		<li>Renewing is mainly in the believers&rsquo; mind (Eph. 4:23); transformation is in the believers&rsquo; soul for their entire being.</li>		<li>It is not any kind of outward correction or adjustment.</li>		<li>It is a kind of metabolism, by the addition of the element of the divine life of Christ into their being, to be expressed outwardly in the image of Christ.</li>		<li>It is accomplished by the Lord Spirit (the pneumatic Christ), transforming the believers into the image of the glory of Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18.</li>		<li>The believers should behold the Lord with an unveiled face and reflect Him like a mirror to express Him.</li>		<li>The believers should live and walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25) and walk according to the mingled spirit (Rom. 8:4b), that the divine life of Christ may have the way to regulate them and transform them into the image of the Lord in glory.</li>		<li>Transformation should be consummated by conformation, which is maturity in the divine life for the believers to be conformed to the image of Christ, the firstborn Son of God; thus, they manifest God in life, in nature, in inward thinking, and in outward expression.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Secret of God's Organic Salvation: 'The Spirit Himself with Our Spirit,' The &nbsp;
