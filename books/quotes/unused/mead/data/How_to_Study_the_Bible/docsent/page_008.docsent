   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING EXPERIENCED IN PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hebrews 5:14 says, "But solid food is for the full-grown, who because of practice have their faculties exercised for discriminating between both good and evil."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word practice can be translated as "habit."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is one condition to receiving God's word a man must be full-grown.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only a full-grown man can eat solid food.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why must a man be full-grown before he can eat solid food?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This has to do with his habit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A full-grown man can take solid food because he is used to it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His faculties are exercised, and he can discriminate between both good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 13 speaks of being experienced in the word of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To be experienced in the word of righteousness means to be experienced in the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word experienced in Greek has to do with industrial skill; it means to be dexterous.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some workers are unskillful, while others are dexterous.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A dexterous worker is one who has passed through much training and who has become skillful in his trade.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A person who is experienced in God's word is one who is well trained and skillful in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a man wants to study the Bible and understand God's word, he must be experienced in his practice.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible exposes our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The kind of person we are determines the kind of Bible we read.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we want to know what a person is like in character and habit, all we have to do is to show him a chapter of the Scriptures and see what he gets out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The kind of person he is will determine the kind of reading he will have.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A curious man will find the Bible full of curious things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>An intellectual person will find the Bible full of reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A simple-minded person will find the Bible merely a collection of verses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is a fact that a man's character and habit are often revealed through his reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a man is not disciplined by God in his character and habits, he will fall into total error, and his reading of the Bible will be spiritually fruitless.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What kind of character and habits must a person have in order for him to read the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A. Not Being Subjective</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every reader of the Bible should learn to be objective.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No subjective person can understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A subjective person is not suitable to be a learner.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we speak to an objective person, he will understand after we speak once.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But a subjective person will not understand after we speak three times.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many people do not understand what others are saying, not because they are unintelligent, but because they are too subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They live entirely in their mind and cannot take in others' words.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are full of thoughts, opinions, and proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Others' words cannot find any ground in them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Their mind may be focused on water, while others may be speaking about mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They interpret what they hear and take the mountains to mean mountains with water.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A subjective person cannot understand men's word accurately, let alone hear God's word!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He cannot understand worldly things, let alone spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One interesting thing about those who are good at studying the Bible is that they are all quick to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once others say something, they understand exactly what has been spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>An objective person can listen to others, and he can also understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In contrast, some people do not have any idea what others are saying even after listening once or twice.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They have too many things in their head.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are full of thoughts, opinions, and proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Others can repeat the same thing to them once or twice, but they will still not get it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to find out if we are subjective, we only need to ask ourselves if we understand what others are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Can we understand what others are saying even if they speak very briefly?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our days on this earth are limited.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are subjective, the time that is available to us will be greatly reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>An objective man can get more from reading the Bible one time than a subjective man can from reading it ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A subjective man will miss what he reads even after he reads it once, twice, or even nine or ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Bible will slip by him and not leave any impression in him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Recall the story of Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the Lord called him, he went to Eli again and again because he thought Eli was calling him 1 Sam 3:4-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God was calling him, but he thought that Eli was calling him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He had heard Eli's voice many times, but this time it was surely not Eli's voice.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Could he not tell the difference?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Samuel's subjectivity made him think that Eli was calling him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the reason he could not differentiate between Eli's voice and God's voice.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The problem with many people is that they will not allow God to break down their subjectivity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>No matter how much they study the Bible, they cannot form any impression of it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It seems as if they never hear God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we go to the Lord to read His word, our mind must be open to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our opinions, feelings, heart, and everything we are must be open to Him as well.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In other words, we cannot be subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must realize the importance of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If a man is not dealt with in this matter, he cannot read the Bible well.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>An objective person is full of waiting; he waits for God to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>His inward being waits quietly for God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If a man is in this state, he will easily understand what God is saying when he opens to His word.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is unnecessary to ask whether or not a man is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All we have to ask is what he has received when he reads a certain chapter of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Some cannot tell us what they have received.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This proves that they are subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is not easy for a subjective person to listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He is like those in Hebrews 5:11, who are "dull of hearing."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Some people are full of many things, and others' words cannot find any room in them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Subjectivity is a very serious problem.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>A subjective man cannot hear God's word and cannot touch spiritual things.</S>
