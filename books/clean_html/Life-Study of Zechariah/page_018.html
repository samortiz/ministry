<H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) The Stone That Jehovah Set before Joshua</H2><P>Zechariah 3:9 goes on to say, "For behold, this is the stone that I have set before Joshua: upon one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave its engraving, declares Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day." This stone (Zerubbabel) set before Joshua also typifies Christ (Isa. 28:16; Matt. 21:42). Zerubbabel was a stone set before Joshua to carry out God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>a) Seven Eyes Being upon This Stone</H2><P>Upon this one stone (Christ) are seven eyes (Zech. 3:9a; 4:10). These seven eyes signify the sevenfold intensified Spirit (Rev. 5:6). Christ is the stone with the seven Spirits as His eyes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>b) Jehovah Engraving the Engraving of the Stone</H2><P>Jehovah will engrave the engraving of the stone (Zech. 3:9b). This indicates that God will work on Christ as the stone for God's redemption, salvation, and building. To engrave is to cut. When Christ was on the cross, He was engraved, cut, by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>c) Jehovah Removing the Iniquity<br>of the Holy Land in One Day</H2><P>Furthermore, Jehovah will remove the iniquity of that land in one day (v. 9c). This indicates that the Christ on whom God has worked will redeem the sin of the land of Israel in one day, the day of His crucifixion (1 Pet. 2:24). Through His death on the cross, Christ the Lamb of God took away the sin of the world (John 1:29).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) Each of the Children of Israel<br>Inviting His Neighbor to Come<br>under the Vine and under the Fig Tree</H2><P>Zechariah 3:10 concludes, "In that day, declares Jehovah of hosts, each of you will invite his neighbor to come under the vine and under the fig tree." After our sin has been taken away and our situation with God has been appeased, there is peace between us and God, and we can come together to enjoy the vine and the fig tree. This portrays how we enjoy Christ as the vine, the tree of life, and as the fig tree, full of the fruit of life. Christ first came to accomplish redemption, bearing the Spirit and being cut by God on the cross. This then issued in His redemption for our enjoyment of Him as the vine and as the fig tree. The measuring carried out by Christ as the Angel of Jehovah issues in such a wonderful situation.</P>
