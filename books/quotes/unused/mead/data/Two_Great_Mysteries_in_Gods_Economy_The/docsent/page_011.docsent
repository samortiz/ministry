   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Ephesians 5 there is a verse telling the wives to submit and a verse telling the husbands to love, but there is another verse v. 18 that says, "Be filled in spirit." Firstly, be filled in spirit with God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Be filled in your spirit with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When you and I are filled in spirit, surely we can love.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>WALK ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
