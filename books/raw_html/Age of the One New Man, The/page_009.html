        <h2 class="head1">LEVEL TWO&mdash;<br />
THE JOY OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>When we are satisfied deep within, we experience the joy of salvation. After experiencing the joy of salvation, we will sense that we have another need, and we will desire to fellowship with the branches of Christ the vine (John 15:1, 5). If we touch Jesus and meet with Him in the morning, we will go to the meeting in the evening. This is to be in the church. Those who have the joy of salvation still need to experience a deeper and higher joy, which is the joy of the church. If we do not go to the meetings to fellowship with other branches, the joy that we obtained at the time of our salvation becomes weaker, fades, and vanishes. However, as soon as we come to a meeting of the church and fellowship with other Christians, our initial joy not only returns but also becomes higher and more satisfying than it was at the time of our salvation. This is to go further to experience the second level of joy&mdash;the joy of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEVEL THREE&mdash;<br />
THE JOY OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>If we only attend meetings and fellowship with the saints, we will soon realize that there is a deeper demand within us to know the church in a deeper way, that is, to progress from the church to the Body of Christ. The church is not only an assembly of the called ones; it is also the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). If the church were merely an assembly, an organization, then we would merely be members in an outward way. Then if someone is agreeable to us, we will like him, but if he is disagreeable to us, we will dislike him. At first we will cooperate with those who are agreeable to us, but if they later become disagreeable, we will become cold toward them. Then we will find someone else who suits our taste. If this is our situation, we cannot obtain the deeper, richer joy that touches more of the Lord&rsquo;s presence. The church is not only an assembly of called ones; it is, even more, the Body of Christ. In the Body of Christ we are not merely members of an organization but members of the Body; our relationship with one another is inseparable.</p>
<p>Sometimes I do not like my feet. I need my two feet when I walk, but for some reason I do not like them when I am sitting. I am not happy with some members of my body. Nevertheless, I cannot say to my feet, &ldquo;You do not suit my taste, and you do not get along with me. Therefore, you are you, and I am I.&rdquo; The relationship between me and my feet cannot be severed, because my feet are members of my body. They cannot be separated from my body simply because I dislike them.</p>
<p>If we see the church merely as an assembly of called ones but do not recognize that the church is also the Body of Christ, then our joy in the church will not be deep or long lasting; rather, our joy in the church will fade away. I can testify that when I see that the church is not merely an assembly but also the Body, of which I am a member, then I accept the other members of the Body whether I like them or not. If we see the Body, we can neither be independent nor can we separate ourselves from those whom we dislike. This is the way for our joy to advance to the third level&mdash;the joy of the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEVEL FOUR&mdash;<br />
THE JOY OF THE ONE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>After we have seen that we are members of the Body, we will again eventually feel that something is missing. Although we have the joy of salvation and have advanced to the joy of the church, we will not be satisfied with having just the joy of the church. After we see the Body of Christ, the joy of the church will be uplifted to the joy of the Body. I believe that many brothers and sisters are saved, are in the church, and have seen and experienced the Body. However, having been in the Body for a period of time, they have a sense deep within that they still need to go forward. We are members of the Body and have Christ as our life. If we go further and take Christ as our person, the Body will become the one new man (2:15; 4:24). In the one new man all the differences and distinctions among the members disappear, and Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:10-11). The Lord wants to show us that the church is not merely an assembly of the called ones or the Body; the church is the one new man. When we see the one new man and become the one new man, our joy will advance and be uplifted from the joy of the Body to the fourth level&mdash;the joy of the one new man.</p>

            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
