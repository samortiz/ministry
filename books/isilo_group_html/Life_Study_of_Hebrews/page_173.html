By Looking unto Jesus<br />Who Is Now Seated at the Right Hand<br />of the Throne of God in the Heavens</h2><p>Paul told the Hebrew believers to look &ldquo;away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of faith, Who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.&rdquo; From 1:3, this book points us continually to the Christ seated in heaven. In all his other epistles, Paul mainly presents to us the Christ who dwells in our spirit (Rom. 8:10; 2 Tim. 4:22) as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45, ASV) to be our life and our everything. But in this book, he points us particularly to the Christ seated in heaven with so many aspects to care for us in every way. In Paul&rsquo;s other epistles, the indwelling Christ is versus our flesh, self, and natural man. In this book, the heavenly Christ is contrasted with the earthly religion and all earthly things. To experience the indwelling Christ we need to turn to our spirit and contact Him. To enjoy the heavenly Christ we need to look away from all things on earth unto Him who is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. By His death and resurrection He has accomplished everything that is needed for both God and us. Now in His ascension He is sitting in the heavens, in the Person of the Son of God (1:5) and the Son of Man (2:6), in the Person of God (1:8) and man (2:6), as the appointed Heir of all things (1:2), the Anointed One of God (1:9), the Captain of our salvation (2:10), the Sanctifier (2:11), the instant Helper and constant Succor (2:18), the Apostle from God (3:1), the High Priest (2:17; 4:14; 7:26), the Minister in the true tabernacle (8:2) with a more excellent ministry (8:6), the Surety and the Mediator of a better covenant (7:22; 8:6; 12:24), the Executor of the new testament (9:16-17), the Forerunner (6:20), the Author and Perfecter of faith (12:2), and as the great Shepherd of the sheep (13:20). If we look unto Him as such a wonderful and all-inclusive One, He, ministering heaven, life, and strength to us, will transfuse and infuse us with all that He is to enable us to run the heavenly race and to live the heavenly life on earth, carrying us through all the lifelong pathway and leading and bringing us into glory (2:10).</p><p>The wonderful Jesus, who is enthroned in heaven and &ldquo;crowned with glory and honor&rdquo; (2:9) is the greatest attraction in the universe, like an immense magnet drawing all His seekers unto Him. It is by being attracted by His charming beauty that we look away from all things other than Him. Without such a charming object, how could we look away from so many distracting things on this earth?</p><h2 class="head2">F. By Considering Jesus<br />Who Has Endured Contradiction<br />from Sinners against Himself</h2><p>Verse 3 says, &ldquo;Consider Him Who has endured such contradiction from sinners against Himself, lest you grow weary, fainting in your souls.&rdquo; This short word refers us to the four Gospels, where we see how Christ endured such contradiction from sinners. At that time, the sinners were all the religionists, Judaizers, priests, scribes, and elders of the people. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He confronted all these opposers who were doing their best to frustrate or stop Him from the way of God&rsquo;s new covenant. But He was not frustrated; rather, He cut the way, slaying it by suffering the death of the cross.</p><h2 class="head2">G. By Resisting unto Blood,<br />Struggling against Sin</h2><p>Verse 4 says, &ldquo;You have not yet resisted unto blood, struggling against sin.&rdquo; Sin here must refer to something evil in the sight of God that frustrates the believers and holds them back from the new covenant way, for it needs to be resisted, even unto blood.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE APOSTLE PAUL<br />BEING AN EXAMPLE OF RUNNING THE RACE</h2><p>Because Paul&rsquo;s background was exactly that of the Hebrew believers, he was qualified to be an example in running the race. Galatians 2:2 and 1 Corinthians 9:26 and 27 show how he began to run the race. Philippians 3:5-8 and 12-14 show how he was still running the race. In Philippians 3 we see that Paul was a typical Hebrew believer running the race away from the old Jewish religion. In 2 Timothy 4:7 and 8, written shortly before his martyrdom, he told us that he had finished the race.</p><p>As Paul was running the race, he said, &ldquo;I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway&rdquo; (1 Cor. 9:27). Although a saved person can never perish, it is quite possible for him to be a castaway. To be a castaway is to fail in the race, missing the opportunity of reaching the goal. Paul feared that he might be a castaway. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;castaway&rdquo; also means a reprobate, one not qualified or approved. Paul seemed to be saying to the Hebrew believers, &ldquo;Hebrew brothers, you must be careful. Although you have been saved, it is possible that you will be a castaway, one who is disapproved.&rdquo; This concept fits in with that of reaching the goal and winning the prize as a reward. But there is the possibility that a runner may be a castaway and not be approved for the reward. In Hebrews 12 Paul was warning the Hebrew brothers and encouraging them, giving them a great incentive to run the race. We, like them, must not only walk the way but also run the race.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_172.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_174.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Hebrews &nbsp; pg 173</div><br></body></html>
