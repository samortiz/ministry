   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD HAPPY WITH THE INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As happened when the foundations of the earth were laid, the heavenly hosts rejoiced also at the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The angel of the Lord brought "good tidings of great joy" to the shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men" Luke 2:9-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What made God so pleased with the advent of the "Savior, which is Christ the Lord" v. 11 ? Before the incarnation, the earth was the earth, man was man, and God was God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But at this point God made Himself one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jesus is the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"They shall call His name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us" Matt 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How regrettable it is that the glorious fact of the incarnation has been corrupted into the Christmas celebration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christians, for the most part, have only the understanding that a Savior was born to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That God has been brought into man and made one with man escapes them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Jesus was living on this earth, He was a wonder.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was the great God mingled with His creature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible is silent, except for one occasion, concerning the first thirty years of the life of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was called a carpenter Mark 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In those thirty years He did not do any great work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The lesson in this is that God has no interest in our works.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If God wants anything done, He speaks, and it is done Psa 33:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He does not need us to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>GOD HAPPY WITH CHRIST'S BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ began His public ministry by being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On this occasion "the heavens were opened to Him and behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is My beloved Son, in Whom I delight" Matt 3:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word delight here is from the same root as good pleasure in Ephesians 1:5 and 9.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Father took pleasure in this One who turned Himself over to John the Baptist to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By receiving baptism He was symbolically receiving the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is apparent from his questions to the sons of Zebedee much later: "Can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Mark 10:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By baptism He meant His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the eyes of God, then, the death of Christ was pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God delights in the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From week to week as we have the Lord's table, we display this pleasant death to the universe 1 Cor 11:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>GOD HAPPY WITH THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Christ was transfigured, "behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, in Whom I delight; hear Him!"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Matt 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The transfiguration was a foreshadowing of the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The changing of His form also typified His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He asked the two on the road to Emmaus, "Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Luke 24:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can see from this verse that entering into His glory was the same as His being resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God took pleasure in the resurrection and glorification of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>GOD HAPPY WITH HIS SON REVEALED IN US</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"It pleased God to reveal his Son in me" Gal 1:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's good pleasure is wrapped up with us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There was joy in heaven the day we were saved because the Son of God was then revealed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This pleasure of God relates to all the other things that made God happy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If there had been no earth, how could Jesus have lived in Nazareth?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Without the creation of man, how could there be Emmanuel, God with us?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Without the earth and man, there could not have been the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was by His mingling with man that He became the Son of Man, instead of remaining as only the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When He came into us, the meaning of the earth, of man, of the incarnation, of the crucifixion, and of the resurrection all became our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Where is Christ today?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is universal.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is in the heavens and on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At one time we were ordinary people, insignificant sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But now there is something wonderful about us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is hard for us to explain to others what we are, who we are, and even where we are!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Son revealed in us has brought us into the meaning of the earth, of man, and of the incarnate, crucified, and resurrected Lord.</S>
