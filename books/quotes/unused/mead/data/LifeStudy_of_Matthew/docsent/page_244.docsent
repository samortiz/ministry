   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE SIXTY-SEVEN PROPHECY OF THE KINGDOM 7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to 25:31-46, the Lord s word concerning the judgment of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>CONCERNING THE NATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the first two sections of the Lord s prophecy of the kingdom, the Lord covered the Jews and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the end of this age, the people on earth will be in three categories: the Jews, the believers, and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word but at the beginning of verse 31 indicates that what is spoken from verse 31 to verse 46 is another section, the section concerning the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the Lord s prophecy turned from the Jews to the church in 24:32, the word but was used to indicate this change.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The same is true in 25:31.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the Lord s prophecy had covered only the Jews and the church, it would not be complete, for there would be nothing about the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to make His prophecy all-inclusive, the Lord had to say a word about what would happen to the nations at the close of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many Christian teachers have mixed up the Lord s word in the three sections of the prophecy of the kingdom, with some applying the verses concerning the Jews to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both the word to the Jews and the word to the Gentiles have been applied to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many have taught that the judgment of the nations is the final judgment that the Lord will execute upon us all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the past I heard certain Christian teachers warn us not to be goats.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We were told to love the poor and suffering ones so that when the Lord Jesus came back we might be regarded as the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Otherwise, He will consider us the goats.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thank the Lord that in His prophecy He used the little word but in two crucial places, in 24:32 and in 25:31.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This word indicates that the prophecy turns from the Jews to the believers in the first case and then from the believers to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A. Christ on the Throne of Glory</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 31 says, But when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He shall sit on His throne of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Son of Man is the title of Christ for His kingdom, the Messianic kingdom 13:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His judgment here in these verses is a preparation for that kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The coming spoken of in this verse is the open aspect of the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It will be the continuation of His coming mentioned in 24:30.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His glory comprises the glory of His divinity John 17:22-24 , the glory of His humanity Psa 45:3 , the glory of His resurrection John 7:39; Acts 3:13-15 , and the glory of His ascension Heb 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The throne on which He will sit is the throne of David Luke 1:32-33 , which will be in Jerusalem Matt 19:28; Jer 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>B. Judgment on All the Nations 1.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the Nations Being Gathered</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>before Christ s Throne of Glory</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 32 says, And all the nations shall be gathered before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the nations are all the Gentiles who will be left at Christ s coming back to the earth after He destroys at Armageddon those Gentiles who follow Antichrist Rev 16:14, 16; 19:11-15, 19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They will all be gathered and judged at Christ s throne of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This will be Christ s judgment on the living before the millennium Acts 10:42; 2 Tim 4:1 , differing from His judgment on the dead at the great white throne after the millennium Rev 20:11-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This judgment on the living will occur after His judgment on believers at His judgment seat in the air Matt 25:19-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 32 says that the nations, the Gentiles, will be gathered before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Lord spoke of the ten virgins, however, He did not say that they would be gathered.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, He said that they came.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As we have pointed out, coming denotes rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In speaking about the slaves who received the talents, the Lord also said that they came.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the nations will not come; they will be gathered.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In a parable equivalent to the parable of the sheep and the goats, the seventh parable in Matthew 13, the fish are also gathered out of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the nations will be gathered to Christ s throne of glory to be judged there.</S>
