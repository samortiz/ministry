   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>g. Oneness Based on the Judgment of Sins</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the beginning, when these dissenting ones separated themselves from the state churches, they were branded as divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because they held different opinions, they were labeled divisive ones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, they were not the ones who were divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The state churches had become too broad; too many categories of people were included.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order for God's children to follow Him, they had no choice but to separate themselves from these state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to see that oneness is not based on tolerating sins but on judging sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today the oneness spoken of by some is based on tolerance of a certain sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A sin is discovered, and one tolerates it and then another tolerates it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All those who tolerate such sins form a oneness based on tolerance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When everyone tolerates a sin, no one has any problem with anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are many things within the state churches which are not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A person may be touched by the Spirit in his conscience to reject such a sin, but others will not reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The one who rejects it then bears the name of a divisive one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, the problem is not with the one who has seen something, but with the ones who have not seen anything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If all of God's children would rise up to exercise judgment, they would be one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The oneness among God's children should not be based on their oversight.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must first be one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If God's children are careless in judging sin, they may have a oneness among themselves, but they have certainly lost their oneness with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The history of Protestantism shows that God is continually raising up men here and there to seek His heart and to exercise judgment on sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Others may not see what they see, or they may refuse to see.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result, the ones who see something are branded as divisive through their obedience to God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If every child of God judged sin today and dealt with everything that is not of God, they would be one with one another and one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Please bear in mind that the judgment of sin is the real foundation of our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>h.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Blessing in the First Generation,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Organization in the Second,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>and Degradation in the Third</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Another phenomenon among Protestants is this cycle: A person is raised up during a certain generation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This person receives much grace and blessing from the Lord; much blessing is manifested in his generation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After his generation passes away, the second generation remains somewhat good.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But by the end of the second generation, men begin to pay attention to other things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They begin to say, "We have received so much grace from the Lord; we should think of some means to preserve this grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should form an organization to carry on and maintain this grace."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By the second or third generation, organization comes in. Sometimes organization comes in even by the end of the first generation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They believe that God is the Giver of grace, but they do not believe that God is also the Preserver of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They believe in God's blessing, but they cannot believe in God's continual blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As a result, human creeds, regulations, and ways and means are introduced in an effort to maintain the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the fountain is closed, the water in the pool dries up sooner or later; the water level no longer rises.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By the third generation, the condition becomes quite dead, and everything reverts to the same condition as before, a condition which they originally came out of.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then God has to go to another person or to a few persons who will seek new vision, new blessing, new separation, and new grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This will bring in another period of revival.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This cycle repeats itself: blessing in the first generation, organization in the second generation, and degradation in the third generation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>i.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Swinging between Life and Death</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At first, some left the state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Later, the ones who left were, in turn, left behind by others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Originally, those who left the state churches did so because the state churches were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then those who left became dead themselves and were left behind by others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The entire history of Protestantism is a history of being living in name but dead in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is a history that swings back and forth between life and death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some became living, and some became dead.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not all are dead, for there are always a few who have not defiled themselves, who are the prominent ones chosen and used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These are the giants in Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They are worthy to walk with the Lord in white.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the entire history of Protestantantism.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The church in Thyatira was rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sardis was rebuked as well.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What is the way for the believers to go on?</S>
