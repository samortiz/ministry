   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN PRACTICAL LESSONS FOR THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture reading: 1 Timothy 3:15 WHAT TO DO WITH DENOMINATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last chapter we have seen something regarding the attitude we must have toward the saints who are still in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On one hand, we must be so general and so open to all saints regardless of their background.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But on the other hand, if they are still in the denominations, it is rather difficult for us to identify ourselves with them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the responsibility is not ours, but theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As long as we return to the proper ground of unity, we are absolved from all responsibility of division.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this reason we can do nothing to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All we can do is to return to the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Positionally speaking, this is the right place for us to be identified with all the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But actually speaking, it is impossible because so many of them are still in the divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now we must see what we should do with the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some brothers who have seen that the denominations are wrong still insist that we must stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They say that if we do not remain in the denominations, we will be charged with causing division.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They also say that we must stay to help others, for if we leave, they say, there will be no way to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At least some who have seen that the denominations are wrong speak in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I know some dear saints who are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Well, are the denominations right or wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If they are wrong, should we stay in them?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Should we remain in something wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you cannot leave because others will say that you cause division, I am afraid you are the biggest politician on earth!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You are not faithful to what you see.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You know the denominations are wrong, yet you still remain because you are afraid of what others will say.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not honest or faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may say that we must be careful not to cause divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But to leave Babylon and return to Jerusalem is not causing a division.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To abandon what is wrong and come back to what is right is not causing a division.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all must have a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Regardless of how much you say you are careful, I say that you are political.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In your heart you condemn the denominations, yet you still remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not believe that Christians should hold this kind of attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And if you stay, what kind of work will you do?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Will you stay in a denomination and do a work which is absolutely against that denomination?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not be this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Presbyterians, for example, exert much energy to build up their Presbyterian denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you agree with them, you should stay.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if you do not agree with them, you should plainly tell them that you cannot stay.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must be honest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not pretend that we are one with a certain denomination, yet day by day undermine it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not right and this is not honest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually, all such people will be expelled by the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Suppose you are a pastor of a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Would you allow a member of your denomination to remain and yet undermine your work?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You would have to dismiss him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everything must be after its kind according to Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are for the denominations, we must remain with the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if we are not for them, we must be faithful and honest to tell them so.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 1927, I was elected a member of the executive committee of the denomination I was in. But I told them frankly that I could not accept the position and that I was going to leave them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That was the end of my denominational life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I still believe that this way is right.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are the children of light, and we must be honest to ourselves and to others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must abandon the idea of remaining in the denominations to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we stay, we are not honest.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suppose you are a missionary, and the mission sends you out as a missionary to work for that mission.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You must be honest to them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you work honestly and faithfully for the mission, you are right.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You should not go to the field, yet work in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is not honest.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You may say that you are doing something for Christ, but I do not believe the Lord needs such underhanded servants.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must be after our kind.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we are denominational, we must be one hundred percent denominational.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If the denominations are wrong, we must leave them at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have to be what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not pretend to be something.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>That is being political.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Let us be so simple, so faithful and so honest to God, to others and to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must let people know what we are and where we stand.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should not pretend to be anything.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we prefer the denominational way, then we must stand for it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord never respects pretension.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must be what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Of course, if we are so frank, we may offend some people.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But eventually, if we do not declare what we are, we will offend them more.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>From the beginning we must let others know what we are and where we stand.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I say this because it is so easy to consider it better to remain in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I frankly tell you that this does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There are some who say this is right.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They agree that they should not stay in the denominations to undermine their work.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But they say that we must stay to pray for them and improve them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is a good intention, but I have never seen anyone who has succeeded in so doing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you do not believe my word, you may go and waste your time.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Try a few years and see whether you can improve them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I am sure that you cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must not involve ourselves in so many things; it is just a waste of time.</S>
