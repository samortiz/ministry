Because she is living so much in the Lord&#8217;s will, she can say, &#8220;We have....&#8221; She knows that her concern is the Lord&#8217;s concern. Therefore, she says, &#8220;We.&#8221; She knows that what she wants is also what the Lord wants. Therefore, she says, &#8220;We.&#8221; The union is complete; there is no more separation. Hence, prayers are no longer requests, but a speaking forth of God&#8217;s will.</p><p>Verse 9 says, &#8220;If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.&#8221; &#8220;If she be a wall.&#8221; If there is anything that is of God, which causes her to build a separation between herself and that which is not of God, like a wall, then &#8220;we will build upon her a palace of silver.&#8221; We will build upon her everything that is high and noble that comes from redemption. If she has established a life of separation through the Holy Spirit, we will build upon her the fruit of redemption. If she is a door, others will enter into God&#8217;s knowledge through her. &#8220;We will inclose her with boards of cedar.&#8221; We will add Christ&#8217;s heavenly humanity to her. (Wood signifies humanity, whereas cedar is tall. Hence cedar wood signifies Christ&#8217;s heavenly humanity, His glorified humanity, and His heavenly human life.) She no longer does the things that she wants to do; she does them together with the Lord. Although the words are out of her mouth, they represent the Lord&#8217;s mind.</p><p>Verse 10 says, &#8220;I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favor.&#8221; &#8220;I am a wall.&#8221; I am already a separated person; the Lord has separated me from everything unclean, common, and ordinary. &#8220;My breasts like towers.&#8221; My faith and love are based on my separation from the world. The Lord has established me, and my two breasts are no longer undeveloped; they are like towers. I have come to the point where I am a person who has obtained peace in His eyes (&#8220;found favor&#8221; can be translated &#8220;found peace&#8221;). This means that I can be at rest. Hence, a life of peace is based on a life of separation, which is based on the development of faith and love. She gives a short testimony and shows that there is no thought of self-contentment. She can say that she is a wall, and she can say that her two breasts are towers, but in the Lord&#8217;s eyes, she considers  herself as one who has obtained peace.</p><p>Verse 11 says, &#8220;Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.&#8221; Before the believers are raptured, the Holy Spirit wants them to pay attention to one thing&#151;the reward of the work. Solomon has his vineyards; they are his fields, and he leases them out to the keepers. The Lord&#8217;s work is not ours; our position is  forever that of a steward. We are merely keeping watch over His business. When He comes, what He entrusted to us will return to Him.</p><p>&#8220;Baalhamon&#8221; means &#8220;the lord of all.&#8221; This shows us that the Lord, like Solomon, is the lord of everything; He is also our Lord. Solomon&#8217;s charge was that the keepers would have the fruits; but for the fruits that they harvested, they would have to give Solomon a thousand pieces of silver. The Lord will also give us the fruit of what we keep, tend, and raise for Him today; that will be our reward. Nothing that we do for the Lord is in vain. Even a cup of water that we give away will be rewarded.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_064.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_066.html">Next</a> </body></html>
