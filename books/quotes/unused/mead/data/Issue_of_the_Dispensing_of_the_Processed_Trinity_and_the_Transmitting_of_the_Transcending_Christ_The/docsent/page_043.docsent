   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH BEING GOD'S GOAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE TARGET OF THE ENEMY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is the need of such a transmission, because there are layers of opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Hades there is opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On this earth there is opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the air there is opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is opposition from the evil one, who would even go to the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Mainly all this opposition is against the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we would speak only about the threefold dispensing, the triune dispensing, everyone would think this is wonderful, but once we speak about the church, opposition rises up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is because the church is God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I first came to this country, I was warmly welcomed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1964 I was invited to speak to a group of people in Dallas.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I was there for a week of conference meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>My host and hostess exhorted me to speak only on Christ and not touch the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They said that if I touched the church, no one would come the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the end of this week, I realized that the Lord was burdened for me to speak on the church, so I made a strong resolution to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before I spoke, I asked them to read Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By reading Romans 12 the host and the hostess realized that I would speak on the church, so they dropped their heads.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That bothered the congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But there was a young man there by the name of Benson Phillips.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, through that whole week, he was and still is the unique one caught by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>So actually, I spent the whole week there just to catch him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After he came in, he took the lead among the saints in Texas, and now he has been sent to Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Would you speak on the church?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is a battle to touch the church, to speak about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church is the goal of God, and the church is the very target of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Throughout my over sixty years of ministry, I have been warned not to speak about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was advised to just speak concerning the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church is a bothering matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE NEED TO SEE THE ONE BODY,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE ONE CHURCH OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Look at today's situation with the thousands of divisions among the Lord's people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is a "church market" full of division and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Anaheim there is a division called the Church of Taiwan in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In my home town of Chefoo in mainland China, there was a division called the Church of England in China.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Logically, the Church of England should be in England, and the Church of Taiwan should be in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What confusion this is!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today there are not only divisions but also confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>People have argued and have been divided over whether to have wine or grape juice at the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They have also been divided over what kind of bread to use at the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the recent past, there was a different teaching among us which said that the local church should be autonomous.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we receive such a teaching, this means that we have not seen that the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Can any part of our physical body be autonomous?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the various parts of our body were autonomous, this would mean that our body was cut into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How could we make our blood circulation autonomous?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The circulation of our blood is throughout our entire body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the same way, no part of the Body of Christ can be autonomous.</S>
