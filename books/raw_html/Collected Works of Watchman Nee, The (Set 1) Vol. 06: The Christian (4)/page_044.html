<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Third Way to Hell:<br>Being Nominal</H2><P>Many who are sitting here are Christians. Many are even preachers and pastors. We have to be careful not to think that only people outside the church will go to hell. I am afraid that there are many in the church who will go to hell! The people inside Sodom and Gomorrah were burned by brimstone and fire. Yet outside the city, Lot's wife also lost her life on the plain. It is most pitiful that many who have come into the church are only nominal. They have not genuinely believed in the substitutional death of the Lord Jesus; they are not yet saved and do not have eternal life. They are only church members nominally and are not real Christians.</P><P>We can read a few verses now. These words are spoken by the Lord Jesus Himself. "Not every one who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens. Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power? And then I will declare to them: I never knew you. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness" (Matt. 7:21-23). In this passage of the Scripture, our Lord Jesus describes the situation at the time of the coming judgment. There will be many Christians—not only Christians, but many preachers and miracle workers—who will be driven away by the Lord. They will marvel and wonder why people like them will not be able to go into the kingdom of the heavens. But the Lord Jesus will tell them, "I never knew you." For this reason, my Christian friends, be careful. Do not have the thought that because you are a Christian, however nominally, that your portion will be different from that of the heathens. Let me tell you: this thought is something in your imagination only. It is not in the Bible.</P><P>Many Christians sing hymns along with others, saying, "Lord, Lord." They think that singing this way will secure the question of their salvation. But the Lord said that those who say, "Lord, Lord," with their mouth only will not enter the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Many may think they can pray. After everyone prays, they will say, "Amen." They even say, "Lord, Lord," and call on the Lord. They may think that they are saved. But the Lord said that not everyone who says, "Lord, Lord," will enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Many people preach the Word and call themselves servants of the Lord. They preach to others once a week and labor in many works. When they preach, they speak concerning the Lord. We may think that such people are more advanced than ordinary believers and are probably saved. But the Lord said that some who call Him "Lord, Lord" will not enter the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Some people are not just nominal church members. Sometimes they may possess supernatural powers that enable them to cast out demons and perform miracles. They may think that they will surely enter the kingdom of the heavens. Little do they realize that they may say, "Lord, Lord," with their mouths, cast out demons, and perform miracles in His name, but still not enter the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Therefore my friends, ladies and gentlemen, those who are sitting here, please be careful. Do not think that you are saved just because you are a member of a church, can pray and sing, always come to the services, always offer money, and even occasionally exhort others to join the church. Please do not be so assured! Not every one who behaves as a Christian outwardly will be saved. Many in the church will end up in the same hell as the pleasure-seeking men and women in the prostitution houses, cinemas, and amusement places!</P><P>According to the Lord's word, what kind of people will enter into the kingdom of the heavens? He said it will be "he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens." What is God's will? Listen to this verse: "Who desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth" (1 Tim. 2:4). The initial will of God is for one to be saved. The way to be saved is not by singing, praying, preaching, or giving. Please note that I am not saying that you should not sing, pray, preach, or give. Every Christian should at least do this. However, these things will not save you. Please note that salvation does not come from singing, praying, preaching, or giving. How then can one be saved? "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved" (Acts 16:31). Salvation is nothing other than believing in the Lord Jesus. There is no other way to salvation than by believing in the Lord Jesus. If you believe in His death, you will be saved. If you do not act according to God's will for your salvation, you will surely go to hell. You may know many religious formalities and church ordinances. But if you do not trust in the Lord Jesus as your Savior and are not saved according to God's will, whatever you do and whatever denomination you belong to cannot grant you the possibility of salvation.</P><P>Please pay attention to the great scriptural principle mentioned by the Lord in this passage. When the day of judgment comes and these types of people come to the Lord, they will only talk about themselves: "We...! We...! We...!" When they go before the Lord, they do not talk about what the Lord Jesus Christ has done. Instead, they talk about themselves. They do not mention that the Lord Jesus died for them or that they were saved through trusting in the merit gained by His blood. Rather, they say, "We prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power." There is no better work than prophesying, casting out demons, and doing works of power. Yet this did not save them. The Lord said to them, "I never knew you. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness." "Workers of lawlessness"! What does this mean? Were they not prophesying, casting out demons, and performing works of power? Can these things be lawless? But the Lord said that even though these may be the best of works, they cannot save a man. Salvation does not depend on how many good works one has before God; it depends on the accomplished works of the Lord Jesus before God. Salvation is not what you have done for the Lord. It is what the Lord Jesus has done for you. Salvation is not the wage you earn from your labor; it is the gift bestowed upon you through the accomplishment of the Lord Jesus' labor.</P><P>These ones err. They think that they can exchange their own works for God's salvation. They think that salvation is merchandise and that they can buy eternal life through their works. Little do they realize that unless God first accepts us through the Lord Jesus, He will not accept the works which come from ourselves. Unless we are accepted first, our works will not be worth anything before God. We must first be saved, and then there is the possibility that our works will be accepted. Even if our works are the best and we nominally bear the name of God's children, we will not please Him. Dear friends, have you accepted the Lord Jesus as your Savior? Did you become a Christian because you were afraid of the coming wrath and were trying to flee the eternal death? If you want to go to hell, I have nothing more to say, you can go on in your present nominal way. You do not have to change and believe with sincerity in the Lord Jesus as your Savior. Please do not mistakenly think that everyone going to hell is weighed down with sin and evil. This is a mistake. You can try your best to do good, be zealous, attend services, sing, pray, preach, and give. But if you do not act according to God's will and believe in the Lord Jesus as your Savior, you will surely go to hell.</P>
