[1]  In this chapter we will cover an important subject head covering.
[2]  First Corinthians 11:2-16 does not speak of believers as brothers and sisters; rather, it speaks of them as men and women.
[3]  It does not speak about our status in Christ, but rather of God s order in His creation.
[4]  It is not a relationship between God the Father and God the Son in the Trinity of the Godhead, but a relationship between God and the One whom He sent to earth and anointed to be the Christ.
[5]  In the beginning there was only one language for all men.
[6]  But after man built the tower of Babel to demonstrate the united power of man, God confounded human language at Babel so that men would no longer speak the same language.
[7]  LEARNING TO ACKNOWLEDGE GOD S GOVERNMENT A. Adam Being
[8]  After God prepared the garden of Eden, He created Adam and Eve and charged them to guard the garden.
[9]  I cannot persuade you to cover your head if you do not know anything about God s government.
[10]  If you do not know the meaning of God s government, you will not know the significance of head covering!
[11]  Once you see God s government and see that such a system of divine government is revealed in the Word, you will realize that head covering has much to do with this government.
[12]  First Corinthians 11:4-5 says, Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraces his head.
[13]  But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head; for it is one and the same as she who is shaved.
[14]  The significance of head covering is that one puts himself under God s government; he acknowledges this position.
[15]  He would never annul God s government just because he has received His grace.
[16]  Just as Christ accepted God as His Head, so also every man should accept Christ as his Head.
[17]  In reality, Christ s head is covered before God, and every man s head is covered before Christ.
[18]  The woman s covering before God is equal to Christ s covering before God.
[19]  First Corinthians 11:6 says, For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off; but if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered.
[20]  Here Paul seems to ask the sisters in particular, After hearing this word and realizing that in God s government God is the Head of Christ, Christ is the Head of every man, man is the head of the woman, and God has appointed the woman to be a representative of Christ before God, do you still think that it is fitting for a woman to pray with her head uncovered?
[21]  I would like to point out two things to you: Since God gave women long hair for a covering, Paul indicated that the woman should add a head covering to this covering, because God wants her to be covered.
[22]  Verse 16 says, But if anyone seems to be contentious, we do not have such a custom of being so, neither the churches of God.
[23]  This is the same as saying that God s headship over Christ is a Corinthian matter, not a universal matter; this is the same as saying that Christ s headship over man is a Corinthian matter, not a universal matter; and this is the same as saying that man s headship over the woman is a Corinthian matter, not a universal matter.
[24]  Thus, for man not to cover his head and for woman to cover her head was a commandment uniquely given by God s apostles and a custom unique to the churches of God.
[25]  One is that we walk as individuals before God, and the other is that we walk in the capacity of a representative before God.
