THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness&#8221;</b> (Gen. 1:26).</p><p>The word God here is still Elohim. It is in the plural, denoting that this God, Elohim, is the very Triune God to be revealed later in the Bible. Hence, in this verse in Genesis 1, God called Himself &#8220;Us.&#8221; Several times later in the Bible God also called Himself &#8220;Us&#8221; (Gen. 3:22; 11:7; Isa. 6:8; John 17:21-22). These verses indicate that though God is uniquely one, He also has the aspect of three. He is the Triune God.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&#8221;</b> (Matt. 28:19).</p><p>After Christ resurrected and passed through all the necessary processes, it is shown here in plain words in this verse of the Bible that the unique true God is triune, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Although the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three and are distinct, they are one unique God. Although the name in this verse is of the Three, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, it is singular, indicating that the Three are still the one unique God despite the distinction between them.</p><p><b>3) &#8220;Except Him [the Son] who is from God, He has seen the Father&#8221;</b> (John 6:46). <b>&#8220;I [the Son] am from Him [the Father]&#8221;</b> (John 7:29).</p><p>In these two verses, Christ the Son of God says that He is from the Father. This proves that the Father is the source.</p><p><b>4) &#8220;I [the Son] am from Him [the Father]&#8221;</b> (John 7:29).</p><p>In the Greek text, the word &#8220;from&#8221; has the meaning of &#8220;from with.&#8221; This reveals to us that the Son is not only from the Father, but from with the Father. When He came to earth, He brought the Father and the Father came with Him.</p><p><b>5) &#8220;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&#8221;</b> (John 1:18).</p><p>This verse clearly states that the Son who brought the Father is the manifestation of the Father. The Father is the source, and the Son is the manifestation. Therefore, &#8220;I [the Son] and the Father are one&#8221; (John 10:30).</p><p><b>6) &#8220;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality...He abides with you and shall be in you. I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you...and I in you&#8221;</b> (John 14:16-20).</p><p>This section shows us that the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son to be the reality of the Son, coming to abide with the disciples and to be in them. His being in the disciples is the Son in them. Therefore, the Spirit is the reaching and entering in of the Son. This indicates that the Son and the Spirit are also one. The Father is the source, the Son is the manifestation of the Father, and the Spirit is the reaching and entering in of the Son with the Father. The Three are just one God, who was manifested from the source to come among men and who reached the disciples to enter into them. This signifies that God is triune for the purpose of working Himself into those who believe into the Son to be their life and everything and to become their divine enjoyment.</p><p><b>7) &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all&#8221;</b> (2 Cor. 13:14).</p><p>This is the blessing of the Apostle Paul to the believers that they may enjoy the triune care of the Triune God in love, grace, and fellowship. The love of God the Father became the grace of Christ, God the Son, in the fellowship of God the Spirit, to be the daily blessing and enjoyment of the believers.</p><p><b>8) &#8220;But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father&#8221;</b> (John 15:26).</p><p>The word &#8220;from,&#8221; as we have mentioned before, means &#8220;from with.&#8221; The Spirit of reality sent by the Son from the Father is actually from with the Father. This proves that the Spirit is not only one with the Father but also one with the Son, who is one with the Father. This verse also demonstrates that all Three, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, coexist from eternity to eternity without succession.</p><p><b>9) &#8220;I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me&#8221;</b> (John 14:10).</p><p>This word shows us how the Father, the Son, and the Spirit not only coexist but also coinhere. Coexistence indicates distinction whereas coinherence signifies mingling as one. This confirms that despite a distinction among the Three, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, They are still one God; They are Three yet one, and all three are one. This is strongly proven by the following verses:</p><p><b>1. &#8220;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called...The mighty God, The Father of eternity&#8221;</b> (Isa. 9:6).</p><p>This word clearly says that the Son is called the Father, proving that the Son and the Father are one.<p><b>2. &#8220;And the Lord [Jesus Christ] is the Spirit&#8221;</b> (2 Cor. 3:17).</p><p>This word also plainly shows that Christ the Son is the Spirit, proving that the Son and the Spirit are one.</p><p>Therefore, the Bible reveals that although the true God is uniquely one, He is three, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; and while the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are distinct, They are still the one unique God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life Lessons, Vol. 1 (#1-12) &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
