   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE QUESTION OF FINANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is a remarkable fact that, while the book of Acts supplies many minute details regarding the work of an apostle, the one subject which from a human standpoint is of paramount importance in the carrying on of any work is not dealt with at all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No information whatever is given as to how the needs of the work or the personal needs of the workers were supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is certainly amazing!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What men consider of supreme importance, the apostles regarded of least consequence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the early days of the Church, God's sent ones went out under the constraint of divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Their work was not just their profession, and their faith in God was not intellectual, but spiritual; not just theoretical, but intensely practical.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The love and the faithfulness of God were realities to them, and that being so, no question arose in their minds concerning the supply of their temporal needs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today as then, the matter of finance will present no problems to those who have a vital faith in God and a real love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This question of finance has most important issues, so let us devote a little time to it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In grace God is the greatest power, but in the world mammon is the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If God's servants do not clearly settle the question of finance, then they leave a vast number of other questions unsettled too.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once the financial problem is solved, it is amazing how many other problems are automatically solved with it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The attitude of Christian workers to financial matters will be a fairly good indication as to whether or not they have been commissioned of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the work is of God, it will be spiritual; and if the work is spiritual, the way of supply will be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If supplies are not on a spiritual plane, then the work itself will speedily drift on to the plane of secular business.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If spirituality does not characterize the financial side of the work, then the spirituality of its other departments is merely theoretical.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no feature of the work that touches practical issues as truly as its finance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You can be theoretical in any other department, but not in that one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LIFE OF FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every worker, no matter what his ministry, must exercise faith for the meeting of all his personal needs and all the needs of his work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In God's Word we read of no worker asking for, or receiving, a salary for his services.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul made no contract with the church in Ephesus, or with any other church, that he should receive a certain remuneration for a certain period of service.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That God's servants should look to human sources for the supply of their needs has no precedent in Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do read there of a Balaam who sought to make merchandise of his gift of prophecy, but he is denounced in no uncertain terms.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We read also of a Gehazi who sought to make gain of the grace of God, but he was stricken with leprosy for his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No servant of God should look to any human agency, whether an individual or a society, for the meeting of his temporal needs.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If they can be met by the labor of his own hands, or from a private income, well and good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Otherwise, he should be directly dependent on God alone for their supply, as were the early apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The twelve apostles sent out by the Lord had no fixed salary, nor had any of the apostles sent out by the Spirit; they simply looked to the Lord to meet all their requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The apostles of today, like those of the early days, should regard no man as their employer, but should trust Him who has sent them forth to bear the responsibility of all that the doing of His will involves, in temporal as well as spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a man can trust God, let him go out and work for Him; if not, let him stay at home, for he lacks the first qualification for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is an idea prevalent that if a worker has a settled income he can be more at leisure for the work, and consequently will do it better; but as a matter of fact, in spiritual work there is need for an unsettled income, because that necessitates intimate fellowship with God, constant clear revelation of His will, and direct divine support.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In worldly business, all a worker needs by way of equipment is will and talent; but human zeal and natural gift are no equipment for spiritual service.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Utter dependence on God is necessary if the work is to be according to His will; therefore, God wishes His workers to be cast on Him alone for financial supplies, so that they cannot but walk in close communion with Him and learn to trust Him continually.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A settled income does not foster trust in God and fellowship with Him; but utter dependence on Him for the meeting of one's needs certainly does.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more unsettled a worker's living is, the more he will be cast on God; and the more an attitude of trustful dependence on God is cultivated, the more spiritual the work will be.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So it is clear that the nature of the work and the source of its supply are closely related.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a worker receives a definite salary from man, the work produced can never be purely divine.</S>
