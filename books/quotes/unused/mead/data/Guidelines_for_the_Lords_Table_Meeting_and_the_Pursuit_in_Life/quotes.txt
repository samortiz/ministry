[1]  Guidelines for the Lord's Table Meeting and the Pursuit in Life CONTENTS
[2]  Concerning Breaking the Bread in Remembrance of the Lord
[3]  The content of the church is Christ, and the intrinsic reality of every single matter in the church is Christ Himself.
[4]  If we do not touch Christ and gain Christ, even our worship and service will be meaningless.
[5]  Just as the reality of believing in the Lord is Christ s coming into us, and the reality of baptism is our union with Christ, so also all the services in the church should be related to Christ.
[6]  When we remember the Lord in the Lord s table meeting every Lord s Day, concentrating in our mind to meditate on the Lord Jesus silently, does this mean that we all love the Lord, are spiritual, and have the Lord s presence?
[7]  To eat the Lord s body and drink His blood is to eat and drink of the Lord Himself.
[8]  As a result, they contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us His flesh to eat? v. 52 . Then the Lord Jesus said, He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life...For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.
[9]  Every time we came to the Lord s table, we contemplated His being God, His becoming flesh, His living on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, His dying on the cross, His being raised in three days, His ascending to the throne, and His waiting to come again.
[10]  The Lord does not want us to meditate on Him or contact Him with our mind; rather, the Lord wants us to contact Him, eat Him, and drink Him with our spirit.
[11]  In breaking bread, when we see the symbols, we turn to our spirit and receive the Lord again and again.
[12]  Every time we break bread, we receive the Lord anew, and every time we break bread, we again contact the Lord who died and resurrected, touching Him in our spirit.
[13]  If we truly see this, the next time we break bread, we will realize that inwardly we have been filled with many other things so that the Lord is not able to find any place, any empty room, in us.
[14]  When we realize this, we need to pray, O Lord, remove all the things that should not be in me so that You may have a place in me.
[15]  The revelation we see will expose our inward problems and cause us to tell the Lord spontaneously, O Lord, I am glad to pour myself out and empty myself.
[16]  Every time he came to the Lord s table, after singing a hymn and calming down, he would begin to pray, Lord, You are God, who took the form of a sinner and humbled Yourself for us.
[17]  When we receive Him into us, He becomes our life and strength within, enabling us to love those whom we cannot love, to do what we cannot do, to be what we cannot be, and to live in a way that we cannot live.
[18]  CHAPTER TWO THE LEADING IN THE MEETINGS THE IMPORTANCE OF MEETINGS
[19]  Many Christians do not understand the reason they need to meet, but meetings are of supreme importance to Christians.
[20]  In chapter 16 we see that the foundation of the church is Christ as the rock v. 18 . Then in chapter 18, concerning the church life, the Lord said, For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst v. 20 . In the same chapter He also said that if an offending brother refuses to hear the brothers reproof, the brothers should tell it to the church vv.
[21]  The prerequisite of leading a meeting is that we must first enter into fellowship with the Lord.
[22]  We will bring in death if we have not entered into fellowship with the Lord before coming to a meeting.
[23]  In some localities the responsible brothers always sit in the front at the Lord s table meeting.
[24]  In the entire course of a meeting we need different hymns for different sections of a meeting.
[25]  First Corinthians 14:23-26 says, If therefore the whole church comes together in one place,...indeed God is among you...Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.
[26]  HOW TO BEAR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE MEETING Having Fellowship with the Lord
[27]  How can we exercise our spirit in a meeting?
[28]  To bear responsibility in a meeting, we must first prepare our spirit and have fellowship with the Lord.
[29]  When we come into a meeting, we should be prepared in spirit, our entire being should be open to the Lord and to the meeting, and we should exercise our spirit to touch the atmosphere of the meeting.
[30]  For example, in a Lord s table meeting someone may choose a hymn for the worship of the Father while we are still remembering the Lord, or in a prayer meeting someone may choose a hymn of praise.
[31]  We cannot sing a hymn that expresses a certain feeling if we do not have one.
[32]  This means that when we touch a certain atmosphere, according to the prevailing feeling in the meeting, we should select a hymn from the hymnal that expresses that feeling best.
[33]  Even though Hymns, #544, Lord Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine, is a good hymn, after singing it we will not be left with a strong feeling because this hymn does not touch the Lord s love but touches our lack of love for the Lord.
[34]  The more we sing this hymn, the more we will feel that even though we are cold toward the Lord, He is never cold toward us; that even though our heart may often change, His love will never depart; and that even though we do not care for the Lord, He cares very much for us.
[35]  One time there were many attendants in a Lord s table meeting, but the atmosphere of the meeting was plain and somewhat indifferent.
[36]  Someone selected hymn #128 in the Chinese hymnal, I prostrate, Lord, before Thee, / Marvel at boundless grace, and a brother changed it to Hymns, #213, On that same night, Lord Jesus, / When all around Thee joined.
[37]  In our prayer, we need to bring the saints feeling deeper into the Lord, in order for them to sense that we remember the Lord because He first remembered us.
[38]  At the climax of the Lord s table meeting, in order to maintain the spirit of the meeting after the bread and the cup have been blessed and passed, there is the need to fill up the rest of the time with hymns and prayers.
[39]  For example, in the first section of the table meeting if we have seen the Lord s redemptive love that seeks and brings us back, we should turn to the worship of the Father with this feeling.
[40]  If we have seen the Lord s redemptive love, when we turn to worship the Father, the feeling of such worship should be based upon the Father s sending His beloved Son to redeem us.
[41]  Like the singing of hymns, the prayer in the table meeting has different sections.
[42]  There are opening prayers, introductory prayers, strengthening prayers, spirit-uplifting prayers, spirit-maintaining prayers, turning prayers, correcting prayers, time-filling prayers, concluding prayers, and sending-off prayers.
[43]  I hope that we will remember this principle and will practice it diligently so that we may function in the meeting, like an experienced basketball team.
[44]  If the feeling of the saints is plain and indifferent at the Lord s table, we can select Hymns, #213, On that same night, Lord Jesus, / When all around Thee joined / To cast its darkest shadow / Across Thy holy mind.
[45]  For example, after singing a hymn of praise to the Lord for His glory and greatness, a sister may pray in tears, O Lord, I am really suffering, but I thank and praise You for the cross You have given me.
[46]  If we consider these exercises for the meetings as something too difficult and not worthwhile, there is nothing further to say.
[47]  But if we think that these exercises are worthwhile, we should apply ourselves, spend our time, and learn to put ourselves aside particularly in this matter.
[48]  On the one hand, it gives us a sense of the Lord s coming to seek us and His giving Himself up for us; on the other hand, it stirs up a sense of gratitude in our hearts and a desire to offer up our praise to the Lord.
[49]  If we are touched in our spirit after singing and have entered into the feeling of the Lord s seeking us and giving Himself up for us, a brother should offer a prayer according to this feeling in his spirit.
[50]  Fourth, as a rule, all of our prayers should contain utterances of poetic quality.
[51]  We should pray with words that bear a poetic character; it is not good to pray with words that are too plain.
[52]  If our spirit is focused on the bread and the cup and a prayer is offered regarding the Lord s suffering on earth, a brother should follow the prayer and the atmosphere of the meeting to select Hymns, #226, For the bread and for the wine, / For the pledge that seals Him mine, / For the words of love divine, / We give Thee thanks, O Lord.
[53]  Sixth, we should avoid formal prayers at the table meeting; instead, we should use words of revelation and words that convey spiritual facts.
[54]  For instance, at the beginning of the table meeting, a brother may pray, O Lord, once again we come to Your table.
[55]  When we pray, we should simply say, O Lord, we thank You for the bread and for the cup; we are here in remembrance of You.
[56]  The Lord Jesus hands and feet were nailed not merely because our hands and feet have sinned but because our entire being has sinned, including our ears, our eyes, our tongues, etc. Because of Hymns, #93, we can say to the Lord, On the cross You measured sin s distance.
[57]  IN THE LORD S TABLE MEETING 2 OFFERING STEADY PRAYERS
[58]  We may begin the table meeting with a hymn, follow the hymn with some prayers, and then sing another hymn.
[59]  While the bread and the cup are being passed, if the spirit of the meeting remains very strong with the sense of the Lord in glory, another hymn might give us a feeling of being out of breath.
[60]  If the atmosphere of the entire meeting has reached a high point and we have been led to the subject of the meeting, with the bread and the cup having been passed, we should remain in a quiet spirit to be in steady fellowship with the Lord, meditating on Him and remembering Him.
[61]  While we are exercising to offer this kind of prayer, we must remember to link our prayers with the bread and the cup and bring everyone s feeling toward the Lord s table.
[62]  For example, when the bread and the cup are being passed, we can pray, O Lord, as we take the bread and the cup, and as our hands touch the bread and the cup, we sense that You are the Lord of glory.
[63]  If we stand on our relationship with the Lord and pray according to this relationship, it is easy to pray with revelation.
[64]  For example, we may pray, Lord, You are in glory, but we are still here.
[65]  If we are afraid that the feeling of the saints is not strong enough or that our words are not clear enough, we may add a few sentences, Lord, it seems that today only You are in glory and that we are not.
[66]  Some have asked whether we should first pray or first sing a hymn to begin the worship of the Father after breaking the bread at the table meeting.
[67]  Although God is both the Lord and the Father, when we speak of the Lord, we sense the aspect of His being the Lord; we do not sense the aspect of His being the Father.
[68]  I hope that we would all apply ourselves in these matters.
[69]  If we have a personal reserve, we will be able to draw from it and use it in the meetings.
[70]  Many times, we cannot open our mouths and pray, because on the one hand, we do not have the inspiration, and on the other hand, we do not have enough reserve.
[71]  It is not that we lack a burden in our spirit to pray; rather, it is that we do not have the utterance for prayer or a reserve for prayer.
[72]  Some saints are not clear concerning matters such as Christ s being in us and Christ s being in the church; therefore, we would like to have some fellowship focusing on their questions.
[73]  Answer: If a person is walking on the right path while pursuing the Lord, sooner or later he will see that throughout the ages God s work in His plan is primarily to work Christ into man, whether in creation or redemption.
[74]  We either do not love the Lord, or once we love the Lord, we think we should be zealous, humble, work diligently, preach the gospel for the Lord, fellowship with the brothers and sisters, and build up the church.
[75]  When we hand ourselves over to Christ, we should not hope that He will help us control our temper and make us gentle, nor should we pray that He will help us become useful in His hand and enable us to do something for Him.
[76]  Question: What steps must we take before we can see these two points?
[77]  Answer: It is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy Rom 9:16 .
[78]  Question: Is it possible to enter into the experience of Christ s living in us immediately?
[79]  For example, with the experience of salvation some can say that they were saved on a specific date, but others, mainly those who grew up in Christian families, become clear regarding their salvation gradually.
[80]  When Paul wrote the book of Ephesians, he prayed that God would grant the saints a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him, in order that we might know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, and know the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all cf.
[81]  Concerning the pursuit of spiritual life, we should not take the easy way.
[82]  As we are dealing with life, which is something living, we should avoid any dead condition.
[83]  We should not think that objectively we need to know that our flesh has been crucified with the Lord, and subjectively we need to experience the crucifixion of the Lord when we are losing our temper.
[84]  Question: Is there a distinction between receiving that is according to knowledge and receiving that is according to the spirit?
[85]  We have these kinds of questions in our mind because we have not seen the Lord s all-inclusive death on the cross.
[86]  Romans 6 shows that we who are baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death.
[87]  We are a group of people identified with the death of Christ: Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled v. 6 . Galatians shows that I, the flesh, and the religious world have been crucified.
[88]  Question: I realize that it is wrong to say that we have not seen anything of the Lord s death on the cross, yet I feel that our seeing is not clear but rather blurry.
[89]  When we hear that the Lord s death on the cross has dealt with all things, we should simply bow our head and say, O Lord, I praise You.
[90]  Answer: If we were to ask Paul whether he saw Christ when he saw the great light on the way to Damascus, or whether he saw Christ later when he wrote 2 Corinthians 3, he would definitely say that he does not know.
[91]  From that time Christ in His resurrection has become our life.
[92]  He brought His death and resurrection into us, completing the work of the cross that we need to bear.
[93]  God in His eternal plan determined to perform a great surgery to terminate all things through the death of the cross.
[94]  Question: When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was obedient even unto death.
[95]  Do we also need to be obedient unto death?
[96]  This means that once we receive the Lord as our Savior, the first thing we need is to be baptized.
[97]  The first thing that God wants us to do, after receiving the Lord, is to enter into the death of the cross of Christ, to be baptized into His death.
[98]  After we believe into the Lord, we need to be baptized; after baptism, we need to begin living a life of obedience and taking the way of obedience.
[99]  After we believed in the Lord, He put us into the death of Christ, and from that point forward we could begin to obey God.
[100]  If we have seen what it means to be baptized into Christ s death, we will know that we are in the Lord s death, and this death has been wrought into us even after our baptism.
[101]  TWO ASPECTS OF THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
[102]  Sometimes we sense that our will is too strong and that we should suppress it so that it would not be so strong; sometimes we also feel that our emotion is too strong and that we should change it so that we would not lose our temper easily.
[103]  CHAPTER TWELVE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS CONCERNING CHRIST AND THE CROSS
[104]  In this chapter we will speak concerning Christ and the cross.
[105]  Question: In my experience I have an uncomfortable feeling when I am rebuked, but this feeling vanishes when I set my mind on the spirit.
[106]  To be baptized into Christ s death is to be baptized into Christ, that is, to grow together with Him in His death and resurrection v. 5 . Then chapter 8 speaks of those who are in Christ Jesus v. 1 . Hence, we see that chapter 8 is a continuation of chapter 6 and that chapter 7 is only a parenthetical word.
[107]  In brief, we need to see that we are in Christ, we need to see that we are in Christ s death and resurrection, and we need to see that the Holy Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, the law of the Spirit of life, is in us.
[108]  Question: In my experience it takes me a long time to set my mind on the spirit.
[109]  In our experience, however, because of our inadequate seeing of the flesh, the Holy Spirit, the cross, and Christ in our daily living, we may be inwardly troubled, and it is difficult for us to set our mind on the spirit.
[110]  First, on the positive side, we must see that we are in Christ, that we grow together with Christ in His death and resurrection, and that we are in God s life.
[111]  However, because of the Lord s mercy, we have seen that we are in Christ, that we have died and have been raised with Him, and that the Spirit of life dwells in us.
[112]  Question: Does a person still need the outpouring of the Holy Spirit after experiencing the cross?
[113]  However, when we have an adequate amount of experience of the cross, we will no longer need to plead for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
[114]  If we experience the cross and pray more in spirit, we will not need to pray for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, but the Holy Spirit will certainly be poured out.
