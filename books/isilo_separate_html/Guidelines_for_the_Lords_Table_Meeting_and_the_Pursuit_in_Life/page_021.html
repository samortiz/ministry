<h1 class="title">A PRACTICAL EXERCISE OF PRAYING<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S TABLE MEETING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYER BEING THE BEST WAY TO BEGIN<br />
THE WORSHIP OF THE FATHER</h2>
<p>Some have asked whether we should first pray or first sing a hymn to begin the worship of the Father after breaking the bread at the table meeting. In practice, it is easier to begin with singing and more difficult to begin with prayer. If we are able to have a good beginning with prayer, it is best to begin with prayer. If the prayer is strong enough to touch the spirit of the meeting, even to touch this particular section of the meeting, then prayer is the best and the sweetest way to begin this section of the meeting. We should remember that this is the beginning of a section and not the beginning of a meeting. Thus, for the sake of spiritual elegance and height, it is best to begin with prayer.</p>
<p>It is best to use a hymn, not prayer, at the beginning of a meeting, because at the beginning the spirit is relatively low, and it is difficult to pray. In principle, however, prayer is the best way to begin, because a hymn is not as high as a prayer. But when we are unable to offer suitable prayer, we must use a hymn. After the breaking of bread, if the attendants are high in their spirit and able to follow the Lord Jesus to come before God, then it is not so good to start the worship of the Father with a hymn. We should have a prayer of continuity, a prayer that continues the flavor of the preceding section, that follows the Lord Jesus to come before God and to offer up praises to Him. Such praise turns the entire meeting from the first section to the second section, from remembering the Lord to worshipping the Father. It would be very elegant and beautiful for us to sing a hymn after such praise and continue with two more prayers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO TOUCH<br />
THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE MEETING</h2>
<p>The most precious point concerning a meeting is that we learn to touch the atmosphere, the feeling, of the meeting. Suppose the atmosphere of the meeting has already brought us to the point where we want to follow the Lord to take the way of the cross before us. This means that we have seen the Lord on the throne in glory, and we want to follow Him to take the way of the cross. In such an atmosphere, it would not be so appropriate for us to turn the meeting to enter into the worship of the Father by simply calling a hymn; this would not be elegant. However, if we can use a prayer to turn the feeling of following the Lord to an atmosphere of worshipping the Father, the praising spirit will be stronger, and we can then choose a hymn to express the spirit of praise and worship.</p>
<p>In such an exercise we still need to pay attention to the spirit and pay attention to praying with continuity. It is difficult to have the proper utterance for prayers in this section. For example, it is not proper for us to begin a prayer by saying, &ldquo;O Lord.&rdquo; A prayer that begins with &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; is addressing the Lord, not the Father. Therefore, such a turn is not adequate. It is very difficult to make a turn after we have used the title <em>Lord.</em> If we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name in the section on the worship of the Father, the flavor will be weakened. Although God is both the Lord and the Father, when we speak of the Lord, we sense the aspect of His being the Lord; we do not sense the aspect of His being the Father. Thus, when we are worshipping the Father, it is best to call Him Father.</p>
<p>Our prayer should contain more revelation and fewer doctrines. Prayer is not preaching; rather, prayer is speaking forth a spiritual matter we have seen. Prayer is related to revelation, not doctrine. It is doctrine when someone tells us that the meeting hall is in such and such a condition. But it is revelation when he takes us to the meeting hall and shows us the glass windows and the planters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FEW PRINCIPLES CONCERNING PRAYER<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S TABLE MEETING</h2>
<p>How should we pray in the table meeting? If we firmly grasp a few principles, we will be able to offer proper prayers. First, there is &ldquo;initiating&rdquo; prayer, which means that the meeting does not have a particular subject, but we feel something in our spirit and express it with a prayer. For example, no one may have expressed a feeling concerning God&rsquo;s love, but one may have an inward, spiritual inspiration concerning God&rsquo;s love, a feeling that is as strong as an atomic bomb. If he expresses this feeling with a prayer, everyone will have a feeling concerning God&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Second, there is &ldquo;expressive&rdquo; prayer, which means that all the brothers and sisters have a certain feeling, such as the love of God; however, there is the need for someone to express this feeling with a prayer. This kind of prayer needs expressive utterance in order to speak forth this feeling. For instance, while sitting in the meeting, one may clearly sense that everyone has a feeling concerning God&rsquo;s love; therefore, he offers a prayer to speak forth, to express, this feeling. Whereas initiating prayer is for revelation, expressive prayer is a speaking forth, to pray forth the sense that is within everyone.</p>
<p>Third, there is &ldquo;motivating&rdquo; prayer. If we are in an atmosphere of remembering the Lord, but it is time to begin worshipping the Father, we need to be motivated in order to turn the atmosphere to the worship of the Father. Our spirit of worship cannot make a proper turn if we are not properly motivated; therefore, there is a need for motivating and strengthening. Previously the saints were in a spirit of remembering the Lord; now we should use a prayer to motivate, to draw out, the spirit of worship and strengthen it. Then we can go on to worship the Father. Thus, in the table meeting there are prayers for initiating, for expressing, for motivating, and for strengthening.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
