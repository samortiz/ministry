   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Release at the End of Every Seven Years</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Deuteronomy 15:1-6 Moses gave a charge concerning the release at the end of every seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"At the end of every seven years you shall issue a release" v. 1 . Every creditor was to release that which he had lent to his neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>An Israelite was to do this even if he had lent something to his neighbor shortly before the year of release.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This requirement regarding the release at the end of every seven years is related to God's way of balancing the social wealth and natural resources among His people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may say that God was practicing a "divine communism."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"This is the manner of the release: Every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor; he shall not exact it from his neighbor or his brother, for Jehovah's release has been proclaimed" v. 2 . However, there was a limitation to the heavenly communism: the children of Israel were to release their brothers only, not the foreigners v. 3 . If God's people released that which they had lent to their brothers, they would bring in God's blessing that there would be no poor among them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Further, because of God's blessing, they would lend to many nations and rule over many nations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Jehovah your God will bless you as He has promised you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And you will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow; and you will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you" v. 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lending to the Poor Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's people were not only to practice the release every seven years; they were also required to lend to the poor brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Deuteronomy 15:7-11 speaks about the lending to the poor brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some of the people might have lost money during the year of release.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result, they might have decided never to lend anything again.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, there was the need for an ordinance to govern the requirement regarding lending to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>a. Not Hardening Their Heart</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>nor Closing Up Their Hand from the Poor Brother</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The children of Israel were not to harden their heart nor close up their hand from the poor brother v. 7 . Suppose a poor brother had once asked an Israelite for a loan, and this brother was released from his debt in the year of release.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If this poor brother should ask the same person for another loan after the year of release, that person might harden his heart and close up his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, this was forbidden by the ordinance governing lending to the poor brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Opening Their Hand to the Brother</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>and Lending Enough for His Need</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The people were required to open their hand to the poor one and to lend enough for his need in whatever he lacked v. 8 . Today we should not be reluctant to give to the poor brothers among us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we give to meet the needs of the poor brothers, the Lord will return to us much more than we gave.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the believers who give willingly can testify of this.</S>
