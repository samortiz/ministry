The Perfected Saints</h2><p>The perfected saints share the burden of the perfecting, gifted persons. Thus, the builders include Christ, the gifted persons, and the perfected saints.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Entire Body</h2><p>The entire Body also is a builder (Eph. 4:16). The entire Body builds through every joint of the rich supply, through the operation in the measure of each one part, and by the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. How then can anyone claim that Christ is the only builder? Unless the entire Body builds, the Body cannot be built up. The whole Body has to build the Body itself in love.</p><h2 class="head3">5. Christ Making His Home in the Saints&rsquo; Hearts</h2><p>Christ makes His home in the hearts of the saints through the strengthening with power through the Spirit into their inner man unto the fullness of the Triune God for His expression (Eph. 3:16-19). Christ not only builds up the Body; He also seeks to make His home in the hearts of the believers. Is Christ now making His home in your heart? If He is to make His home in your heart, you need to be strengthened by God the Father with power and through His Spirit into your inner man. Then Christ will build up His home in your heart &ldquo;unto all the fullness of God&rdquo; (v. 19). Christ&rsquo;s making His home in our heart results in our being filled unto all the fullness of God for His universal expression.</p><h2 class="head3">6. The Triune God Building the Abodes</h2><p>The Triune God builds the abodes in the Father&rsquo;s house through the Spirit remaining within the lover of Christ, and the Father and the Son visit the lover of Christ to make the mutual abode (John 14:23). In the Father&rsquo;s house there are many abodes, which are built by the Triune God through the Spirit. This abode is a mutual dwelling place for the believer and the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Foundation of the Divine Building</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Redeeming and Saving Christ</h2><p>The foundation of the divine building is the redeeming and saving Christ (1 Cor. 3:11). He is the unique foundation, and, as Paul says, &ldquo;another foundation no one is able to lay.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Revelation Given<br />to the Apostles and Prophets</h2><p>The foundation is also the apostles and the prophets with their revelation received of Christ as the rock and their teaching (Eph. 2:20; Matt. 16:18; Acts 2:42; 1 Tim. 1:4). In Matthew 16:16 Peter declared, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus told Peter that he was blessed to have received such a revelation, and then, referring to this revelation, He went on to say, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (v. 18). From this we see that the foundation is not only Christ Himself but also the &ldquo;rock&rdquo; of the revelation received by the apostles and prophets and the apostles&rsquo; teaching, which actually includes the entire New Testament. Therefore, the foundation for the building is both Christ and the revelation given to the apostles and prophets. This is the foundation upon which we are building today.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Secret of God's Organic Salvation: 'The Spirit Himself with Our Spirit,' The &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
