   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Peter 4:12 says, "Beloved, do not think the fiery ordeal among you is strange, which is coming to you for a trial, as a strange thing happening to you."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek word for fiery trial, purosei, means burning, signifying the burning of a smelting furnace for the purification of gold and silver Prov 27:21; Psa 66:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Peter considered the persecution the believers suffer as a burning furnace used by God to purify their life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is God's way to deal with the believers in the judgment of His governmental administration, which begins from His own household 1 Pet 4:17-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Greek word for strange in 4:12 is xenizo.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Fiery persecution is common to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They should not think it is strange or alien to them and be surprised and astonished by it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This persecution is a trial, a testing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Peter's use of the metaphor of a burning furnace indicates that today the Lord is using persecutions and trials to serve a positive purpose the purification of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can be compared to gold and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, we still have some amount of dross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we need purification.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As gold and silver are purified through burning, we also need to be purified in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Peter tells the believers not to regard the fiery ordeal as strange.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As Christians, we need to realize that fiery ordeals are common.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Persecutions and trials are the common experience of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such things are not strange, alien, foreign, to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the contrary, they are common, for we have been appointed to them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is our destiny to suffer in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 4:13 Peter continues, "But according as you share the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, that at the unveiling of His glory you may also rejoice exultingly."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although persecution is a trial that purifies us through burning, Peter says that by experiencing such a fiery ordeal we share, participate in, the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we were not Christians, we certainly would not suffer the kind of persecution described in 4:12 and 13.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such persecutions are due to the fact that we are Christians, men of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because we believe in Christ, love Christ, live Christ, and bear testimony to Christ, witnessing of Him in this age, the world rises up against us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This age is under the hand of the evil one, and for this reason unbelieving ones persecute those who believe in Christ and witness of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the sight of God this kind of suffering is regarded as the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ lived a life of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we are His partners Heb 3:14 , living the same kind of life, cooperating with Him in living a life of suffering and following Him along the way of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that what Christ suffered, we also suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, when we suffer for Christ in this way, our sufferings are counted by God as the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not be discouraged because we must suffer as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These sufferings are positive and very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today we should be Christians, followers of Christ, who undergo the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to participate not only in the riches of Christ but also in the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we take this view, we shall be encouraged whenever we suffer for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may face fiery ordeals, but these are the sufferings of Christ in which we have the privilege to participate.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 4:13 Peter says that as we share the sufferings of Christ, we should rejoice so that at the unveiling of His glory we may rejoice exultingly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that we shall not only be joyful inwardly, but we shall sound out our joy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At the time of the unveiling of the Lord's glory, we shall exult.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We shall be excited to the uttermost, beside ourselves with joy.</S>
