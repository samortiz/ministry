<h2 class="head1">BEING BUILT UP IN OUR CHARACTER</h2>
<p>We must be built up as proper human beings. This is a matter of our character, that is, our behavior and habit. A person who has been properly built up is a right person with a right character. Today, many young people have been damaged with respect to their character. It is because of this that we have a children&rsquo;s work for the children. We need to build up our children&rsquo;s character. From their youth they must learn to honor their parents, love their brothers and sisters, and respect others. We do not need to give the young ones too much knowledge of the Bible. We should rather build them up with the proper ethics and morality that will constitute a proper character. Many people today are short of such a proper training. (<em>The Exercise and Practice of the God-ordained Way,</em> pp. 295-296)</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF CHARACTER</h2>
<p>Whereas our words represent our person, our character is our very person. A person&rsquo;s usefulness, the things that can be entrusted to him, the responsibilities he can bear, and the things he is able to accomplish altogether depend on his character. A carpenter determines the use of a piece of wood based on its quality. Laziness ruins one&rsquo;s usefulness. Accordingly, character has very much to do with the Lord&rsquo;s service. Consider those persons in the Bible whom God used. They were used by God because they possessed a character that was fit for His use. Their character was simply their person. They became persons useful to God because their character could be used by Him. Since Abraham, Moses, and Paul all had an excellent character, God greatly used them. The destiny of our usefulness to the Lord hinges on our character. Whether we are useful before God depends upon the suitability of our human character. (<em>Character,</em> p. 17)</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF OUR CHARACTER</h2>
<p>In 1953 while I was holding a training, I used an illustration to explain the matter of character. Almost all textile products, whether cotton or silk, must be put into dyeing tubs to be dyed. The dye, when used on the coarsest and worst fabric, does not appear beautiful, but when the same dye is used on the best Chinese silk, the outcome is beautiful and shiny. There is no difference in the dye. Rather, the result or manifestation of the dyeing is altogether related to the quality of the fabric. Today the Spirit is like the dye. We all have been put into the Spirit, yet our manifestations are different. These differences are not due to the Holy Spirit whom we have received, because we all have the same Holy Spirit. Rather, the differences are due to us who are being dyed. This is related to the matter of our character.</p>
<p>The reason the apostle Paul could enjoy the Spirit of God as much as he did was because he had a good character and was diligent in all things. The brother in 1 Corinthians who had committed fornication undoubtedly had less enjoyment of the Holy Spirit because he had a poor character and was indifferent toward everything. The difference between these two people was not due to a difference in the Holy Spirit they had received but due to a difference in their character. The reason a person commits a fallen act is somewhat related to his character. Hence, those who truly love and pursue the Lord, not to mention those who serve and work for the Lord full time, must pay attention to the matter of character if they desire to live the Body life.</p>
<p>Many of the teachings of the Lord Jesus and of the apostles in the New Testament, beginning with Matthew, reveal the matter of our character, even though the word <em>character</em> is not used. You cannot inspire a piece of stone or motivate a piece of wood because neither has a living character. Character is a serious matter. The measure of grace we receive of the Lord and the degree to which the function of that grace is manifested are determined by the kind of character that we have. (<em>Vessels Useful to the Lord,</em> pp. 153-154)</p>

<p><em>As a new Christian and the mother of four children, I would like to know how much scriptural teaching I should impose on them and how much I should insist on their behaving properly.</em></p>
<p>This is a very practical matter. As human beings, we fell and need the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. After the fall, God came in to restrict man. For example, God imposed restriction on the woman because the fall had come in through her (Gen. 3:16); this restriction was actually a protection. In human society today, chaos would prevail were it not for the restraints of ethical teachings, the police, and the law courts. These have been ordained by God to limit the fallen race. Since our families are part of the fallen race, we as parents must exercise God&rsquo;s ordination to restrict our children by ethical teachings, regulations, and discipline. For proper human living in your home, you must teach your children to behave properly by honoring their parents, caring for their brothers and sisters, respecting their neighbors, and not stealing.</p>
<p>Do not say that ethical teachings are apart from Christ and therefore worthless. The necessities of our human existence are one thing; the experiences of Christ, another. For our human living we must buy groceries, do laundry, lock our doors to prevent burglaries, be careful about fire, open and close windows, and cook and eat. Besides taking care of these earthly matters, we are also learning to experience Christ. These are two different areas; both are needed.
