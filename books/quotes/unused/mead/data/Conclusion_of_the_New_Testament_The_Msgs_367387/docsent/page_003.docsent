   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hebrews 1:3 speaks of Christ the Son as the effulgence of God s glory and the impress of His substance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God s glory is God expressed, and God s substance is that which exists intrinsically in His divine being.</S>

   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Likewise, we should never consider the Son as separate from God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Son is the expression of God Himself; Christ the Son is God expressed.</S>
