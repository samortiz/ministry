   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DROPPING OUR OLD CONCEPTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND PICKING UP THE NEW VIEW</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE LORD'S PRESENT RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to go on, we all need to drop our old concepts and pick up the new view of the Lord's present recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For the building up of the Body of Christ, we need the material.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Haggai the Lord charged the Israelites, "Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified" 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today we need to go to knock on doors because we need the material for God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am sharing this with the hope that we could be rescued from the wrong understanding and wrong position.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all have to admit that there are many ways to preach the gospel, but to visit people in their homes is the best way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord told us in Luke 14:23, "Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The higher class people are not in the hedges.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only those who are lazy and idle will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1 Corinthians 1, Paul says that God has not called many wise, powerful, or wellborn people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, most of the people God has chosen are the weak of the world, the lowborn of the world, and the despised vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Luke 14 the Lord told us to compel these people to come in.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may be fully biased in our understanding and yet still believe that we are enjoying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we have not been bearing fruit for years, we may be cut off from the vine without realizing it John 15:2a, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may be in a self- deceiving position.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are really enjoying Christ, we will surely bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Where has our fruit been in the past years?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For our local church to remain at the same number year after year is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I must be honest to the One whom I serve and to the ones whom I serve.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are too biased.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must come back to the straight way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First, we have to visit people to gain them for the Lord's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second, we must keep going back to visit them to have home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Regardless of how little we think we know, we still must contact them as much as we can and minister to them as much as we know.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After a child is born, the mother must immediately begin to care for him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must go back again and again to visit the new ones begotten through us to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to Ephesians 5:29, the Lord knows how to cherish and nourish His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to follow the Lord to cherish and nourish the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Third, we also have to have small group meetings to teach and perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Fourth, we have to perfect them to speak for the Lord, to prophesy, in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Regardless of a person's ability, as long as he will labor, there will be some result.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have received a view of the Lord's present recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now we must put this view into our practice.</S>
