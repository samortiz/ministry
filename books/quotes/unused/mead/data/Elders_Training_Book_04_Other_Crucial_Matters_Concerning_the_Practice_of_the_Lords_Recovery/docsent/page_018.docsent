   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE REGION OF THE WORK 2 THE LOCAL CHURCH AND THE BODY, THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Epistle to the Ephesians was not written in a clear way to tell us exactly to which church this book was addressed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This has been a debatable subject in church history.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"In Ephesus" v. 1 is not found in earlier manuscripts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is a question as to when the words "in Ephesus" were inserted into the manuscript.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some good Greek manuscripts indicate that this Epistle was not definitely written to Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, it was not written definitely to a particular local church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this entire book of six chapters the only definite reference to the local aspect of the church is in 2:22.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The building in verse 21 is universal and the building in verse 22 is local.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word "also" in verse 22 indicates these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Undoubtedly, this book was written to a certain locality, but the general concept of the book is concerning the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Chapter two of Ephesians is actually concerning God's universal dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Concerning the practice of the church life, we must stress the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Without the local church, you could not have a practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, concerning the testimony that the church bears, we must stress the Body, which is the universal aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These two aspects are definitely and distinctly revealed in Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first eight chapters of Romans cover two main items justification and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These items are mainly concerning the individual believers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everyone must be justified and sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The second half of Romans is also of eight chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Chapters nine through twelve are on the Body and chapters thirteen through sixteen end with the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Concerning the testimony of the church, we must stress the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Concerning the practicality of the church, we must stress the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without the local church, the Body would be something in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It would not be practical.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With the testimony of the church, however, we must be extra-local and the Body must be stressed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes expositors might be forced to say that a church in a locality is a local Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This may be said temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, not one local church is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every local church is a part of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Body can never be divided into localities, but in the sense of the churches, they are in different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are many local churches but there are never many bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must see this and we must be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The tragedy is this: when Christians should pay attention to the local churches they take Ephesians as a refuge, saying that the church is universal; when they should take care of the universal testimony, they "run away" from Ephesians and take Revelation 1:11 as a refuge, saying that every local church has its own jurisdiction.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 are all different from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The seven lampstands, however, are absolutely not different.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They are altogether the same in nature, in shape, in makeup, and in function.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today when Christians talk about the church, they should cover the local churches, but they run away from Revelation and go to Ephesians, taking Ephesians as a refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When they should bear the testimony of the one Body, they run away to Revelation and give up Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Revelation 2 and 3 every local church is different, but in chapter one the seven lampstands are not different in any aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are absolutely the same in size, in quality, in standing, in shape, in makeup, and in function.</S>
