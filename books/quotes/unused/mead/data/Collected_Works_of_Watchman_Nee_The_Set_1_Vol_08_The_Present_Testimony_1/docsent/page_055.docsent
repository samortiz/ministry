   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Ephesians 2:8 says, "For by grace you have been saved."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is the past salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 8:24 says, "For we are saved by hope" KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that we are in the process of being saved; this is the present salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans 5:10 says, "For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We thank and praise God that we have been saved!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, there are still two kinds of salvation which we have not yet achieved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we need to pursue further.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some may not think that they are saved, so we tell them that once they believe they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This refers to being saved from the punishment of hell.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have been saved from hell, but we still need to be delivered from the power of sin and pursue after the glory in the future kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we should work out our salvation with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Dwight L. Moody was a very powerful preacher and extremely capable in saving souls.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In his lifetime he said that he had never seen a lazy person be saved!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even if a person desires to be delivered from the punishment of hell, he cannot obtain it if he is lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Therefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you" Eph 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the past few weeks I have mentioned many times that we are incapable in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If it is up to us to do anything, it will be very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if we are willing to surrender and believe, then Christ will do it on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>While one should listen to this side of the truth, there is another side of the truth: to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is our responsibility for, if we do not do this, we are off.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No doubt, Christ has died on my behalf, shed His blood on my behalf, and resurrected and ascended on my behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some may think that since this is the case, all we need to do is just worship and be absolutely passive.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no need to pray, read the Bible, and donate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, we need to know that since God has done this, we can work out our salvation even more fervently.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since God has done it, we should work it out.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How can we work it out?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The following verse tells us the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Philippians 2:13 says, "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verses 12 and 13 are two sides of a most glorious truth; they include everything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you look at the first verse, you think that we should do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if you look at the second verse, it seems that God will do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On one hand, we should work out our salvation, and on the other hand, God will work it out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not contradictory, but complementary.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 12 says that we should work out our salvation, and verse 13 says that God is able to make us do what we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These two verses explain two very important aspects of truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In one aspect there are many severe commandments in the Bible from God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He commands us to do this and do that.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It seems that God has given us a hard burden that we can hardly bear.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It seems almost impossible to take any step forward.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We seem pressed to death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But in the other aspect there are many promises from God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They tell us that this and that are taken care of by God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everything is God's grace and God's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It seems it is not necessary for us to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Due to a lack of understanding of these two aspects of truth, some people tend to go to the extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some think that everything is a commandment from God and that they must do it all by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They see God's commandments as heavy burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They are not able to bear them, yet they are afraid not to bear them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They seem to be pressed to death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Others think that everything is according to God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everything is God's doing, and everything is done by God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They themselves do not need to bear any responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This invariably leads to laxity toward themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When man deviates it does not matter which way he deviates there is a danger that he will neither abide by God's commandments nor receive God's promises in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God's truths are balanced on both sides.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God is working inside of us, and we are working outwardly working out what God has done within us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we only let God work inwardly, without our working outwardly, we cannot receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if we are working outwardly, and nothing is being done by God inwardly, we cannot achieve anything.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All things in our human life are covered by these two matters: the willing and the working.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To will is an inward decision; to work is an outward behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Whatever is decided within, we fulfill without.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the willing and the working.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Willing refers to our inward situation; working refers to our outward living.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But both our inward willing and outward working are God's operating within us, which operates until we fulfill His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All our willingness is according to God's operating, and all our working is also according to God's operating.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Oftentimes, we want to obey God, but we cannot do so.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, God says, "I am operating in you; therefore, it is possible to obey; you can do it."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Many Christians suffer so much because they cannot do so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many times they tell God, "It is such a suffering to obey You.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I just cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I want to forsake the world, but I cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I should not hate someone, but I cannot help it."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, God has no intention for you to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He wants to operate within you until you can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, you should tell God, "Although I cannot obey You, and I cannot give up the world, nor do I know how to love others, I ask You to work within me until I am willing to obey You, until I am willing to give up the world, and until I am willing not to hate others."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you believe after you pray this way, there surely will be changes.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Even if you have things which you have not been able to overcome for years, by committing and believing this way, you will be able to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When Mr. Chapman first began his ministry, his congregation grew day by day, and he had a large chapel built.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When Mr. Moody heard of his name, he took a train to listen to his preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After Mr. Moody arrived at the meeting hall, he sat there silently listening.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>At the end of the meeting, Mr. Chapman, who knew Moody, came down from the platform to Moody to ask his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Mr. Moody said, "Brother, what you have ministered is a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is not a success.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There is some flaw in your life."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When Mr. Chapman heard this word, he was not happy.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He thought, "Mr. Moody should not have criticized me in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He has no authority to say that."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>However, Moody had said what he said.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>At any rate, Mr. Chapman knew that there was one weakness in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He realized that he was too attached to his wife and children.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He felt bad for two or three weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Finally, he said to God, "I have no way not to love my wife and children, but I pray You would work until I can."</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>From that day on, he learned how to love his wife and children.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Later, he ministered effectively.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Someone asked him to give a testimony, and he said only a few words: "If I know how to preach the gospel and minister, or if there is anything good in me, I know where it came from.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It came from that time when I obeyed."</S>
