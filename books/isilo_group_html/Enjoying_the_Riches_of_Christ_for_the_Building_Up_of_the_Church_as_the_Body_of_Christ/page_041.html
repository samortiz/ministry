I was his co-worker for twenty years. When I was speaking in tongues in 1936 in North China, he sent me a cable, saying, &#8220;Not all speak in tongues.&#8221; He had the position to send such a cable to me because he was senior to me, and I was his junior. He advised me to be careful concerning tongue-speaking. Brother Nee never spoke in tongues. Some have said that speaking in tongues is the unique manifestation of the gifts, but he strongly disagreed with this. Many spiritual giants never spoke in tongues. We should not be fooled. Some fundamental teachers, however, following the teaching of J. N. Darby, say that speaking in tongues and other manifestations of the gifts are dispensationally over. We do not agree with this; it is too extreme. We cannot say that the gifts are over. They are still here, but they need to be genuine.<h2 class=head1>THE PRIMARY NEED IN THE LORD&#8217;S RECOVERY</h2><p>At certain times in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, and according to the need, the Lord has given us knowledge and teaching, and He also has given us certain gifts. In the past, we have had healings, but the Lord has made it very clear to us that the primary need in His recovery is not teachings or gifts but life. Life is Christ Himself as the all-inclusive Spirit. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery, we need the growth in life. Therefore, if you speak in tongues, I do not oppose you and I do not want to bother you; however, I advise you not to become addicted to it.<p>If we read and pray-read the New Testament again and again, we will see that our primary need is Jesus Christ, who became the life-giving Spirit as our life and life supply. At a certain point, for a certain need, the Lord may allow us to have certain teachings, and He may also allow us to have certain gifts as a kind of help. These, however, are not the normal things. The normal Christian life is a life of living by Christ. &#8220;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&#8221; (John 6:57b). It is by this that the members of Christ are produced; it is by this that the Body of Christ is built up; and it is by this that the bride will be prepared for the Bridegroom.<h2 class=head1>LIFE, NOT GIFTS AND TEACHINGS, IN THE WRITINGS OF JOHN</h2><p>In Genesis the bride is mentioned in type. In the Gospel of John and the book of Revelation, however, the bride is mentioned in fulfillment. In his writings, John never touched anything of the gifts or of mere teachings. John had a ministry of life. He wrote, &#8220;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit&#8221;; this refers to regeneration, which is for the increase of Christ to prepare the bride for the Bridegroom (John 3:6, 29). John also tells us that Christ is the unique grain of wheat who fell into the earth, died, and produced many grains (12:24). We are these many grains. We are the reproduction, continuation, spread, growth, and increase of Christ not by teachings or gifts, but by Christ Himself as the life and life supply.<p>In the book of Revelation we do not find mere teachings or gifts; rather, we find life. Revelation 2:7 says, &#8220;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life,&#8221; and 2:17 says, &#8220;To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna.&#8221; Then 3:20 says, &#8220;If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me.&#8221; Moreover, there are no teachings or gifts in the New Jerusalem. There is only the flow of the living water, and on either side of the river of life grows the tree of life, producing twelve fruits (22:1-2). The river and the tree become the full supply to the entire city. This is the clear picture in the Bible.<p>We all have to be preserved in the proper realization of the church life. The Lord&#8217;s recovery of the church life is absolutely by Himself as our life and life supply. We must never be distracted by any teaching or gift from Christ as our life and life supply. It is by Him as our life and life supply that we can be the members of His Body, and it is by Him as our life and life supply that the bride can be prepared for His coming back. May the Lord be merciful to us. I pray that we all will see a clear vision and not merely have an understanding of certain teachings or doctrines. The church as the Body of Christ is the increase of Christ. We have to take Him, we have to eat Him, and we have to live by Him. Then we will be prepared as the bride for His coming back.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Enjoying the Riches of Christ for the Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 41</div><br></body></html>
