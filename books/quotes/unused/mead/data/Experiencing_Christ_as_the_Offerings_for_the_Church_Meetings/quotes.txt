[1]  Experiencing Christ as the Offerings for the Church Meetings CONTENTS
[2]  Meeting to Do the Will of God and Fulfill His Purpose
[3]  All the offerings the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering were the means for God s redeemed ones to enter into God s habitation where they dwelt in and with God as a mutual abode.
[4]  May more and more of the Lord s children become those who are experiencing and enjoying Christ day by day as all the offerings for the church meetings, having Christ as their practical entrance into the Triune God as their dwelling place John 17:21 .
[5]  CHAPTER ONE MEETING TO EXHIBIT CHRIST IN HIS VICTORY Scripture Reading: Exo 5:1; 10:9; 23:14; Psa 42:4; 122:1; Acts 2:46-47; 1 Cor 14:26; Heb 10:25
[6]  How we thank You for all the churches with all the saints in this area.
[7]  The second new light is this: the meeting is a testimony of the victory of Christ.
[8]  Some dear ones who have a tender heart and who sympathize with the saints may say that some have a job and they work long hours and then they have a long drive and so they are worn out.
[9]  I agree with this, but why in Elden hall was the attendance that high?
[10]  AND FULFILL HIS PURPOSE Scripture Reading: Exo 15:13, 17; Deut 12:11; Psa 73:16-17; 1 Cor 14:26; Heb 10:25
[11]  Apparently the verses above from Exodus, Deuteronomy, and Psalms have little to do with the matter of meeting.
[12]  Exodus 15, we know, is a section of the victorious praises offered to God by the released people.
[13]  Have you noticed that in Exodus 15:13 two predicates are used?
[14]  First of all it says that the Lord led them forth.
[15]  You have to realize this plantation was the gathering and the habitation of God.
[16]  When God looked upon Mount Zion and saw all His chosen and redeemed people staying there, He was so happy!
[17]  How can I say that the mountain in verse 17 refers to Mount Zion?
[18]  It is because that is the dwelling place of God.
[19]  The sanctuary that God dwells in is the temple.
[20]  But you have to remember that in 2 Corinthians 8 Paul reckons our regular job to the gathering of manna.
[21]  CHAPTER THREE MEETING TO SATISFY GOD WITH CHRIST Scripture Reading: Deut 12:5-7, 11-12; 14:22-23; 16:16-17 IN THE OLD TESTAMENT TYPES
[22]  In the Old Testament the church was still a hidden mystery within God.
[23]  In the Old Testament God did not reveal the church to anyone.
[24]  In the Old Testament you have a collective people typifying the church.
[25]  One of the primary things this people should impress us with is the matter of meeting.
[26]  Do you want to get rid of your anxiety?
[27]  A part was for God s food and a part was for the offerer s food, and another part was for the ministering priests food.
[28]  CHAPTER FOUR MEETING TO ENJOY CHRIST WITH GOD 1 Scripture Reading: Deut 12:5-7, 11-12; 14:22-23; Lev 2:1-3; 3:9-11; 6:9, 12, 26; 7:5-6, 15, 19b, 29-34
[29]  In this message we come to this point, that is, when we meet, we meet to enjoy Christ with God.
[30]  When most people go to a Christian gathering or a Christian meeting, they wouldn t say that they go to offer something to God, or even to enjoy something.
[31]  My mother s grandfather was saved and became a Southern Baptist.
[32]  He brought us to a meeting in the place designated and chosen by God Himself with two main things: His name should be settled there, and His habitation would be there.
[33]  The place which God has chosen for us to meet is with His name and His habitation.
[34]  And there is only one center where we should meet, and that center is God s habitation.
[35]  What shall you do when you come to the meeting?
[36]  We all have to learn to say that we come to the meeting first of all to feed God.
[37]  Secondly, we come to the meeting to eat before Him, with Him, with one another, and also to rejoice in what we eat.
[38]  To meet is to be filled with Christ and to come together to feed God with Christ and to feed one another with Christ, even to feed yourself with Christ, and to rejoice in this feeding.
[39]  I believe that you already know that you have to labor on Christ all the day long.
[40]  And you already know that you need to come to the meeting with Christ filling your hand and filling you inwardly.
[41]  But now I would like to fellowship with you about this one point: you should have some amount of faith to believe that you do have some portion of Christ.
[42]  In the past messages we have seen that the worship God desires is for us to offer Christ to Him in the meetings.
[43]  The destination of our salvation is a feast with God.
[44]  In this message we need to consider what are the groceries used in preparing a feast with God.
[45]  Some of the groceries for preparing a feast for God are listed in Deuteronomy 12:6: And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks.
[46]  Now we need to go to Deuteronomy 14:23 to find more items of the groceries.
[47]  And thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the Lord thy God always.
[48]  Now let us go on to Deuteronomy 26:9-11.
[49]  This is a word spoken by the children of Israel, yet they were charged by God to speak this.
[50]  Then we bring the top portion, the top tenth, of this Christ whom we have labored on, whom we have sown, whom we have reaped, and whom we have enjoyed to the meeting to present Him to God as food and to have a feast for all the saints to eat together with God.
[51]  In this message we need to consider how to have Christ increased that we may offer Him in the meeting as so many different offerings.
[52]  According to Leviticus chapters one, two, and six the first offering among the five basic offerings is the burnt offering.
[53]  The trespass offering may be likened to washing your hands during the day.
[54]  You take a shower once in the morning, but you may wash your hands many times during the day as they become dirty.
[55]  During the day whenever you realize that your hands are dirty you need to wash them again.
[56]  This is like applying Christ as the trespass offering.
[57]  According to the fact we know that Christ redeemed us 1900 years ago.
[58]  Every morning when we begin our day the first thing we need to do is to offer Christ as our sin offering.
[59]  In like manner, in the morning you must have a proper offering of Christ as your sin offering.
[60]  If you live a life every day in such a practice, you will be so rich with Christ as your sin offering and your trespass offering.
[61]  Then you will come to the meeting with such a Christ.
[62]  Especially at the Lord s table you will appreciate and see the Lord as your sin offering and as your trespass offering.
[63]  You will realize that you have no merit and no goodness to justify you and to cause you to be accepted by God, but Christ is your sin offering and your trespass offering.
[64]  If you don t have this kind of practice experientially, when you come to the meeting you don t have Christ.
[65]  I hope that this word could help us to see how we can raise Christ to be the groceries for us to cook a course for God as either the sin offering or the trespass offering.
[66]  AND TRESPASS OFFERING 1 Scripture Reading: Lev 5:1-19; 6:24-30; 7:1-7 PUZZLES CONCERNING THE OFFERINGS
[67]  The more you read them, the more puzzled you would be.
[68]  For example, have you ever imagined or heard that the fine flour made of wheat could be a trespass offering?
[69]  Leviticus 5:7 presents another puzzle: And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring his trespass offering for that wherein he hath sinned; two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the Lord, one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering lit.
[70]  Have you noticed also that with every kind of trespass offering, there is the mentioning that it is the sin offering?
[71]  For example, if you did something wrong in offering your tithe to God, then you have to offer a ram for your trespass offering.
[72]  In the preceding message we pointed out that the sin offering is mainly for God s satisfaction and that your enjoyment of the sin offering is just the sprinkled blood at the altar.
[73]  When we offer Christ to God as our sin offering and as our trespass offering, in our experience we surely realize such a Christ is good for eating.
[74]  I offer Christ as my sin offering to begin my day and all the time during the day I offer Christ as my trespass offering.
[75]  Now we need to come back to solve some of the problems related to the trespass and sin offerings.
[76]  Have you noticed that with the lamb for the trespass offering there is no mention of the burnt offering?
[77]  Let me repeat: when you offer Christ as your trespass offering under the regular size with two small pigeons, you feel so grateful to the Lord that even though you are so poor and unable to do what you should do regularly, you still are accepted.
[78]  This means that while you are enjoying the very Christ whom you offered for your trespass offering, you also enjoy this One at least fifty percent as a burnt offering.
[79]  According to your experience, when you offered Christ as your trespass offering, didn t you realize that that trespass came out of your sinful nature?
[80]  CHAPTER EIGHT HOW TO ENJOY CHRIST AS OUR SIN OFFERING
[81]  In this message we come to a big, big problem that seems to be against the scriptural principle.
[82]  But according to Leviticus 5:11-13 the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour, which, of course, has no blood, could be offered for a sin offering.
[83]  So according to the context of the verse you have to translate it into a kind of offering, whether you call it a trespass offering, a transgression offering, or a guilt offering.
[84]  In the last message we saw that part of the trespass offering could become a burnt offering and the other part of the trespass offering could become a sin offering.
[85]  You have to realize that these few chapters on the offerings are not written based only upon God s requirement.
[86]  But I would ask you a question: Have you ever appreciated the Lord in any other way?
[87]  According to the New Testament and according to the types in the Old Testament, the preciousness of Christ is not only in His being an excellent man in His humanity, but also in His being a bullock, laboring, working, sacrificing, and eventually being killed on the cross not only to satisfy God s requirements, but also to meet our needs and to satisfy our need.
[88]  With the grains of wheat there was no way to fulfill God s purpose and no way to satisfy God s requirement and no way to solve your problems before God.
[89]  Christ was offered to God once for all to be our sin offering, and that offering had a lot of blood.
[90]  AS OUR PEACE OFFERING 1 Scripture Reading: Lev 3:1-5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17; 7:11-14, 28-34
[91]  In this message we come to the matter of the peace offering.
[92]  We have given messages on the peace offering in the past, but this time we will apply it to the meetings.
[93]  But without the offerings there could not be any bread on the table.
[94]  The tabernacle portrays how Christ brings God to us.
[95]  The tabernacle mainly signifies that God was available for you to experience, not for you to enjoy and not for you to take in. As the tabernacle God is available for you to enter into Him, but He is not available for you to take Him into you.
[96]  But now there is the need of someone to cook the groceries to be the offerings.
[97]  A single man needs a house, he needs groceries, and he also needs a wife to cook his groceries.
[98]  You have to realize that Christ as the High Priest is the cook.
[99]  Christ is our tabernacle, Christ is the offerings as our food, and Christ is also our Priest preparing the food.
[100]  In the same way the meal offering is for the trespass offering.
[101]  The meal offering is a type of Christ s humanity.
[102]  This means that when you experience Him as the sin offering, you realize at the same time He is the burnt offering so absolute for God that He is qualified to be your burnt offering.
[103]  The first two offerings, the burnt offering and the meal offering, support the last two offerings, the sin offering and the trespass offering.
[104]  When you experience these matters and when you enjoy these things, spontaneously you will realize that to be such a complete trespass offering, Christ needs to be so perfect as the meal offering.
[105]  In other words you cannot enjoy Christ as the peace offering if you have not enjoyed Him as the sin offering and trespass offering based upon the burnt offering and the meal offering.
[106]  Before we get into the details of the enjoyment of Christ as our peace offering, we need to see something concerning the basic divine principles.
[107]  We who are believers in the Lord Jesus all know that God is our portion.
[108]  If you spend some time to cover all the sixty-six books of the Bible, you can pick up many wonderful nouns and terms and names ascribed to God.
[109]  If you don t know how to enjoy God as your portion, you surely don t know how to possess God as your portion.
[110]  It tells us that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[111]  The basic prerequisite to enjoying God is to take the offerings.
[112]  But you shouldn t consider that the five offerings are separate offerings, having nothing to do with one another.
[113]  The sin offering always directs us to the burnt offering, and the burnt offering is always reflected in the sin offering.
[114]  So when we realize that we have sin in our nature, that our being is just sin, then we realize that we need the Lord Jesus as our sin offering.
[115]  If you offered Christ as your sin offering this morning, you surely realized that the Lord Jesus is also your burnt offering.
[116]  You have a sweet sensation in you that you are acceptable to God not because of what you are, but because of Him and because of what He is.
[117]  If you would offer these two offerings, the sin offering and the trespass offering, again and again and again, eventually you would have all five offerings.
[118]  This means that within the peace offering you have the sacrifice of the sin offering and the sacrifice of the trespass offering and the sacrifice of the burnt offering and also the present of the meal offering.
[119]  In the peace offering there are many different kinds of cakes.
[120]  You treasured Him more, you appreciated Him more, and you realized that you were not for God at all, even though you may have been doing things for God.
[121]  AS OUR PEACE OFFERING 3 Scripture Reading: Lev 7:11-15, 28-34; Eph 1:2; John 1:14, 16; 14:27; 20:19, 26 THE PICTURE OF THE TABERNACLE
[122]  Surely the record concerning the tabernacle and all the offerings shows us clearly that the Bible is the divine revelation of God.
[123]  Then you need something to fill you up, to enable you, to energize you, to strengthen you to enter in. So there is another category of types, the category of all the offerings.
[124]  Verse 14 says that when the tabernacle came in the flesh, He was full of grace.
[125]  Then it says, Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world v. 29 ! This is the first item of grace! The first item of grace is the Lamb of God taking away the sin of the world.
[126]  Nicodemus had come to the Lord Jesus, but this immoral woman didn t come to the Lord Jesus.
[127]  She said that she didn t have a husband, so the Lord helped her to confess: You have well said, I don t have a husband; for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you said truly vv.
[128]  In the very next chapter, chapter twelve, a feast was set up.
[129]  Do you realize that feast was the feast of the peace offering?
[130]  After nine cases had been covered up through chapter eleven, in chapter twelve they were enjoying Christ as their peace offering.
[131]  They had already participated in Christ as their sin offering John 1:29 .
[132]  Only this enjoyment of Christ as the offerings qualifies you to enter in. The Gospel of John shows you the tabernacle and also shows you how to apply Christ as all the offerings so that you may participate in Him and you may be qualified to enter into God.
[133]  Just as you have learned how to pray-read the Bible, now you must learn how to take Christ as your sin offering, as your trespass offering, as your burnt offering, as your meal offering, and as your peace offering.
[134]  Spontaneously you will apply the Lord Jesus as your trespass offering and sin offering that you may enter into the rich enjoyment of God as the tabernacle.
[135]  AS OUR PEACE OFFERING 4 Scripture Reading: John 6:38; 7:16-18, 32, 45-46; 18:38b; 19:4, 6; 14:2-3, 6, 23 CHRIST AS GOD S DWELLING PLACE
[136]  The entire Bible of sixty-six books shows us a complete picture composed with the tabernacle, many offerings, and a high priest.
[137]  According to the teaching of the Old Testament, this dwelling place of God was not only for Him to dwell in upon this earth, but also for God s people to enter into so that they might enjoy God and experience God and even stay with God.
[138]  Very few Christians realize that for Christ to be our Savior and our Redeemer He has to be the five basic offerings plus all the subordinate offerings, including the wave offering, the heave offering, and the drink offering.
[139]  In the same chapter John declares that this One who is the Word and who is God and who became flesh and who is the tabernacle is also the Lamb of God v. 29 . He is both the tabernacle and the Lamb of God.
[140]  Among all the five offerings the most basic one is the sin offering.
[141]  The first case concerning the offerings in the Gospel of John is the case of Nicodemus.
[142]  Where then is the meal offering in the Gospel of John?
[143]  The meal offering has a character of fineness, evenness, and perfectness.
[144]  The meal offering was mainly made of fine flour which had been ground so fine, so even, and so perfectly.
[145]  The Gospel of John shows us that the dear One portrayed is not only altogether absolute to God, but in the eyes of God He is altogether fine, even, and perfect.
[146]  AS THE OFFERINGS Scripture Reading: John 14:2-3, 6, 10, 16-20, 23; 15:4-5; 16:13-15; 17:1-2, 12, 14, 17-18, 20-24 THE FULFILLMENT OF THE TYPE
[147]  Chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of John are very mysterious!
[148]  In these chapters the Lord Jesus disclosed a mystery to us: the Triune God wants to be our dwelling place.
[149]  He wants to be our home, our tabernacle, that we may enter into Him and abide in Him and even dwell in Him.
[150]  In chapter fifteen He went on to tell His disciples that they should abide in Him, and that He would abide in them.
[151]  They should make Him their home, and He would make them His home.
[152]  I believe we can all testify according to our daily experiences that we have the realization we are in the Lord, and the Lord is in us.
[153]  This kind of sensation comes spontaneously after you offer Christ as your sin offering and your trespass offering.
[154]  In chapter seventeen the Lord Jesus is at the incense altar.
[155]  He was given authority over all flesh, that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him v. 2 . What a blessing to know that the Father has given all of us, the entire church, as a gift to the Son! The Father has given all the chosen ones as a gift to the Son, that the Son may give the Father s life to them.
[156]  Some aspects of the truth concerning the matter of the meeting of God s people have been somewhat hidden and missed by Christians for centuries.
[157]  First of all those messages have opened the veil to show us that in God s redemption His intention is to have a people on the earth who are meeting as a feast unto Him.
[158]  In John 14:2 the Lord Jesus said, In My Father s house are many abodes.
[159]  The Father s house is firstly the incarnated Christ.
[160]  The Lord Jesus continued to speak of reality in chapter fourteen: And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality, Whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you vv.
[161]  In John 14 the Lord Jesus suddenly told His disciples that He was going away from them vv.
[162]  And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, that where I am you also may be.
[163]  The Gospel of John, in chapter one, has the Word, and it has God.
[164]  There is the Word becoming flesh as the tabernacle of God 1:14 ; there is the Lamb of God 1:29 ; there is the brass serpent 3:14 ; there is the living water 4:14 ; there is the bread of life 6:35, 51 ; there is the door 10:9 ; and there is the pasture 10:9 .
[165]  I do hope that the Lord would grace you to put all that you have heard concerning the matter of the meetings into daily practice, that you would take the Lord as all the offerings the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and eventually the peace offering.
[166]  We all have to realize that the divine goal of the Triune God in the Gospel of John is to bring us all into Himself, that we may dwell in Him to enjoy all the riches in Christ, that we may take Him as our dwelling place and let Him take us as His dwelling place.
[167]  By doing so, we can be one with Him to realize the eternal life with the holy name of the Father, and to experience the sanctification of the Word of God, and also to participate in the Father s glory that we will express only Him and nothing else so that we all could be perfectly one in the Triune God, that the Son may be glorified in the church and that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
[168]  Then we have the surplus of the experiences of Christ for us to come together to exhibit Christ, to offer Christ to God, and to enjoy Him with God one with another, that Christ may be fully expressed even in this age as a testimony, not only among the human beings, but also a testimony to the principalities, the powers, the authorities in the air, and all the angels.
