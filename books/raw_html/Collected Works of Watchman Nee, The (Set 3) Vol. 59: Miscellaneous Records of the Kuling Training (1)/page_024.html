<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">MAMMON</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 2, 1948<br />Place:Customs Lane, Foochow</h1><p>All the co-workers should speak the same thing concerning mammon when they set out for the work. There is only one way to deal with mammon, and no one should change it at will. We have to go on together in the same way. We should have the same view towards mammon. The Bible is very clear about this subject. Let us take a look at what it says.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING MAMMON</h2><h2 class="head2">It Being an Idol</h2><p>First, the Bible describes mammon as an idol. The Bible always places mammon in opposition to God. There is no true atheist in this world. The Bible does not recognize non-Christians as adherents of other religions. It classifies men into only two categories: those who are serving God and those who are serving mammon. Other religions, such as Buddhism, Mohammedanism, Taoism, etc., are counterfeit religions. There are only two true objects of worship: mammon and God. Therefore, mammon is an idol; it is an object apart from God that is being worshipped. It is unthinkable for a Christian to pray and read the Bible on the one hand, and bow to Kuanyin (a Buddhist goddess) and burn incense to her on the other hand. The minimum requirement of being a Christian is to turn from idols to serve the living God (1 Thes. 1:9). We all agree that we have to cast down all idols. Yet we do not consider mammon to be an evil thing. This is a gross mistake. We must be clear that we cannot worship idols, and we must equally be clear that we cannot worship mammon. We cannot serve God and mammon. Mammon is an idol.</p><p>We must never tell others that they need to offer their mammon because we need to build meeting halls or because we need to take care of the work or the poor. We should never lower the meaning of consecration to the level of satisfying needs. This denigrates the meaning of consecration. We deal with mammon not because of our need but because it is an idol. A man can say that he does not want to offer money for building meeting halls. He also can say that he does not want to care for the poor brothers and sisters, but he must not worship idols. Dealing with mammon is not a matter of being rich or poor; it is a matter of idolatry. When we sing, we have to start with the right pitch. It is wrong to start with a pitch that is too high or too low. In the same way, our pitch has to be right with respect to the way we handle mammon. We have to see that mammon is diametrically opposed to God. We should not tell others to give up mammon because we are short of money. If this were the case, they might conclude that they can worship mammon when there is not a lack of money. We must rid ourselves of mammon because mammon is God's enemy. It is terribly wrong for a Christian to remain in a temple of Dagon. It is equally wrong for the idol of mammon to remain in the saints' homes. We are not speaking about being rich or poor. We are saying that mammon as an idol must be removed.</p><p>We have to show Christians that mammon is an idol; it is something that demands worship. It is something apart from God. This problem must be addressed. The Bible does not say that all those who are poor are blessed; it says that those who are poor in spirit are blessed. Being poor in spirit is being poor voluntarily. All the beggars in this world are not poor in spirit. Even those who do not have money can still worship it as an idol in their heart. Mammon indeed usurps man's worship. We must discuss this matter in a thorough way. Mammon is an idol, and Christians must deal with mammon in a thorough way. This matter must be settled.</p>
