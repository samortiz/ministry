   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY TO CARRY OUT THE DIVINE ECONOMY FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF THE DIVINE PURPOSE Scripture Reading: Col 1:18-19; Phil 2:6-8; John 5:19, 30b; Heb 10:7; John 15:26</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these days I have been considering the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity to carry out the divine economy for the fulfillment of the divine purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These four divine items the divine dispensing, the divine Trinity, the divine economy, and the divine purpose can be seen in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are not explicitly mentioned in John, but the reality and fact of these items are there.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our God is One but Three.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is one God, yet He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the thought and the structure of the divine Trinity were taken away from the New Testament especially from John, Romans, 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, and Colossians it would become an empty book.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Just as a building has a steel frame, the divine Trinity is the intrinsic frame of the divine revelation in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE DIVINE TRINITY IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Gospel of John is probably the top book that speaks of the divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then verse 14 says, "The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This shows that the Word, who was God, became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1 Timothy 3:16, Paul said that God was manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No doubt, this refers to the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul said that the incarnation was God's incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in Romans 8:3 Paul said that God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the one hand, Paul told us that God was incarnated, manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the other hand, he said that the incarnation was God sending His own Son.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John 3:16 is a definite verse telling us that God gave His only begotten Son to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In John 14 Philip asked Jesus, the Son, to show them the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Son responded, "Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father...The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the same chapter, the Son told His disciples that He would pray to the Father, and the Father would send them another Comforter, the Spirit of reality vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Son is one with the Father, but He said that He would pray to the Father, asking the Father to send a third one, the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Spirit of reality is one with the Son, because the Son said that the Spirit's being in the disciples would be His being in them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>17, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 14 unveils a very clear structure of the divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This portion of the Word reveals that the Son is the embodiment of the Father, so the Father and the Son are one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then the Comforter, the Spirit of reality sent by the Father, is the reality of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, the Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit.</S>
