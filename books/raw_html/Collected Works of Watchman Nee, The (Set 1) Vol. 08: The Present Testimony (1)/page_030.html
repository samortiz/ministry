<H1 CLASS=TITLE>A LETTER ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(By Ruth Lee)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 10</H2><P>We humbly and devoutly send out the message of this issue. At the same time, we are prepared to be taught in soberness and trembling. We also need the edification of the truth as much as all other children of God do. May the cross of Christ do a deeper work in every one of us through the Holy Spirit.</P><P>During the summer holidays, this magazine will be published and mailed as usual. If readers are away during the summer and do not receive this magazine, please claim it from your original address. Although we have printed two thousand copies every issue, at present they are barely enough to meet the need. We are afraid that we cannot send you any extra copies. Please take note of this and bear with us for the inconvenience.</P><P>The first issue of this magazine has long been out. There are only a few copies left of the second issue. Other issues are likewise down to a few copies. All those who ask for back issues will only receive what we have. In the near future, we may decide to print three thousand copies, and then no brother or sister will be disappointed. The expense for every issue has always been met through the Lord's grace. We believe all burdens that are according to God's will are easy. We thank the Lord!</P><P>Although Brother Watchman Nee is still resting and waiting for the timing in the Lord's will, thank God the Father that He has not allowed His servant to waste his days! We ask all the brothers and sisters who are concerned for Brother Nee's health to continue to pray for him so that he can serve God more faithfully through the renewed grace that he receives.</P><P>August 9, 1929</P>
