   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SEPARATING WALL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is another point regarding the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The wall of a city is not only for protection, but also for separation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The wall is a separating line.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the wall is built up, it separates what is within from what is without.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Genesis 2, there was a garden without a wall, so it was so easy for the enemy, the creeping one, to creep in. Satan crept in because there was no wall.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But at the end of the Bible, there is a city with a wall one hundred forty-four cubits high.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That is twelve times twelve, the number of eternal perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is a perfect wall to separate what is holy from what is common.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Anything that is common has no entrance into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The separation of the wall is not built up with regulations, but with transformed precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The New Jerusalem is a city built up with transformed stones, not pieces of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is not one brick made of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The separation of the wall is the building up of the transformed stones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more we are transformed, the more we are separated, and the transformation eventually becomes the separating line.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not by regulation, but by transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not have any regulations in the church concerning how long our hair ought to be or whether our members should shave or not.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today there is quite a discussion not only among Christians, but also among unbelievers about the length of the ladies' garments.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some are so devilishly and hellishly short.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But should we make regulations about the length of our garments?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No, if we were to have that kind of regulation, we would become a long-garment religion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Of course, this does not mean that we agree with the short dresses.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But our trust is in the growth in life and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Transformation is the separating line.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not have regulations, but we do have the transforming life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This transforming life will bring forth much separation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the wall of the New Jerusalem, there is nothing of regulation, but there is the building of the transformed precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we would pray-read all the verses in Revelation 21 and 22, we would see so much related to life: the flow of life, the feeding on life, the drinking of life, and the transforming of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the church with the wall built up by transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why the enemy hates the building up of the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Until the wall is raised up in the local churches, there is no safety, safeguard, or defense.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need the building up of the wall to have every man realize the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everyone must keep his position for the building up of the wall and must learn how to work with one hand and fight with the other.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Building is not an easy job; it can only be carried on by fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE SUBTLE WILES OF THE ADVERSARIES</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we begin to build the wall, we will really see the subtle wiles and devices of the adversaries.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, they will pretend to be good to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They will call a conference and say that we must meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This sounds good, but many, many times we will be cheated by this kind of proposal.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not take it; this is not something of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have learned that such conferences are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What can come out of such a conference?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What can come out from these conferences for the Lord's interest?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You will find that these conferences are just snares set up by the enemy to deceive.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must learn the wisdom of Nehemiah.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He told them that he was too busy working on the wall to attend their conference.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But they made not just one, but four proposals!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is easy to reject the first, but it is not so easy to reject the second, the third, and the fourth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am afraid that most of us would accept the fourth proposal.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In all the local churches we must learn the lesson to never engage in any conference with the adversaries.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are in the Lord's way, then let them take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If they do not think it is, then let them go their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is no margin, no compromise, no conference.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We simply do not have the time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If they are willing to take the Lord's way, they will take it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Never accept the proposal to go down to meet with them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No, they must come up to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We will never go down.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Let them come up.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Oh, how subtle the adversaries are!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some of the returned ones even corresponded with them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The high priest was involved in a marriage relationship with them, and some of the priests even opened the temple of God so that the adversaries might dwell there!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But when Nehemiah returned the last time and discovered that one of the adversaries was dwelling in a chamber of the temple, he kicked him out!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some might think that this was being too rough, but Nehemiah could pray, "Lord, remember what I have done for these people and for Thy house."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord remembers.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is not a matter of what others say, but what the Lord remembers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>THE SECOND PURIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After the building up of the wall, Ezra came in again to help the people to be purified once more.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Ezra was a priestly teacher and gave the people priestly teaching to help them be purified.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He read the Word of God to the people, and they were inspired.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They all agreed to sign a covenant that they would give up all the strange mixtures.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the local churches, every bit of mixture must be excluded.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must be thoroughly purified from all mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Anything common and anything contradictory to the heavenly nature must be cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord's recovery must be pure.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After the building up of the house, we need purification, and after the building up of the city, we need to be purified again.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This purification was not only realized and carried out by Ezra, but also by Nehemiah.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There are at least two purifications under Ezra and one under Nehemiah.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We need the recovery of the wall, and we need the purification.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the need today in all the local churches.</S>
