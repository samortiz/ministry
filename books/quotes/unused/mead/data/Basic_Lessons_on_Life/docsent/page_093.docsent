   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A WILLING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Also in Psalm 51, in David's repentance and confession, he prayed that God would give him a willing spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>David connected the willing spirit with the joy of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He asked the Lord to restore unto him the joy of salvation and sustain him with a willing spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A willing spirit depends upon the joy of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we have the joy of salvation, we spontaneously will have a willing spirit to go along with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What the Lord wants, what the Lord desires, what the Lord asks of us, we will have a willing spirit to answer, to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This willing spirit always come from our rejoicing, our joyful spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need the joy of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No doubt, in David's fall he lost the joy of his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now he was repenting, so he asked that God would restore unto him the joy of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That means God would bring him back to the enjoyment of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then from this enjoyment and this joy, he could have a willing spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A willing spirit is an issue of his being happy and joyful in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans 14:17 says, "The kingdom of God is..righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we have joy in God's Spirit, our spirit will be willing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We will have a willing spirit to fellowship with the Lord, to worship Him, and to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whatever can please the Lord, we will be happy to do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means we have a willing spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A BROKEN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Psalm 51:17a David said that the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, in God's eyes a broken spirit is more precious than sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the second part of verse 17 David said that God would not despise a broken and contrite heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A broken spirit is a spirit that repents, that feels very sorrowful for any sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, a broken spirit is a real repenting spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be broken means to not be whole.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here it does not mean to be broken into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It means that you do not consider yourself so perfect or complete.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you consider that you are perfect and complete, you would not repent or confess your weaknesses and your failures.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When your spirit is repenting, your spirit is broken, contrite, and feeling sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After sinning, many would not have a broken spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, they would have a spirit that is stubbornly whole.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because they feel that they are perfect and complete, they would not repent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They would not confess.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should have a spirit which is always broken.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even if we do not feel that we have sinned, we still need a broken spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even if we have not sinned in a great way, we still could be wrong in a small way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In our words, our attitude, our thoughts, our feelings, and our talk with others, many times we are wrong, even unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>So we always need to keep a broken spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not consider yourself as being whole, complete, and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No one is perfect, so we always need a broken spirit to repent and confess.</S>
