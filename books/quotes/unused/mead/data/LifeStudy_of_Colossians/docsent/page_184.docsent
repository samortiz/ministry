   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Resurrected Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The one life we share with Christ is also a resurrected life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nothing, including death, can suppress it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, in resurrection there are no tears.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Suppose a sister begins to cry when she is criticized for the way she cleaned a room in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is this the resurrected life?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the resurrected life there is no place for weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if this sister lives a resurrected life while she is cleaning in the meeting hall, she will not be troubled if someone criticizes her work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is another difference between the resurrected life and the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A Hidden Life</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If our natural life has not been dealt with, our service in the church will not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we serve in the natural life, we shall be easily offended, and eventually we shall stop serving.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if our life in serving is a life that is crucified and resurrected, nothing will be able to defeat it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, the life Christ has is a life hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we have pointed out, only the divine life can be hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I appreciate this word hidden 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The life Christ has is not a showy life; it is a hidden life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you serve by this life, you will not want to be seen by others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the contrary, you will prefer to serve in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our natural life is the very opposite of this, for it is fond of making a show.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today s religion appeals to this element in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, it is a common practice in raising funds to give public credit to those who donate large amounts, whereas little or no mention is made of those who donate a small amount.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Religion nourishes the natural life, but in the church the natural life is put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whatever we do in the church should be done by a life hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Matthew 6 the Lord Jesus speaks of doing things in secret, not before men vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>1-6, 16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even in presenting our offering to the Lord, we should be hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In all that we do we should live a hidden life, a life hidden with Christ in God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>ONE LIVING WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let us now consider the matter of having one living with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It seems that there is no indication of this in 3:1-4.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The word living is not even used.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But Paul does tell us to seek the things which are above and to set our mind on them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This refers to our living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Seeking the things above and setting our mind on them are matters of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are not to live in an earthly way or in a worldly way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead, we should live in a heavenly way, seek the things which are above, and set our mind on them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>CHRIST S TWO MINISTRIES</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At this point we need to see that the Lord Jesus has two types of ministries, His ministry on earth before His resurrection and His ministry in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He carried on a tremendous ministry and did a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the course of this ministry, He accomplished redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to Hebrews 1:3, having finished His ministry on earth, the Lord sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although His earthly ministry has been completed, His ministry in heaven is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ today is ministering in a higher and more extensive way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As the High Priest, He intercedes for us and cares for all the churches, transmitting into them the heavenly supply.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ is more busy now than when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On earth He cared mainly for His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But in heaven He is caring for a great many churches and for millions of saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Not only does He intercede for us as the High Priest, but He ministers on our behalf as the heavenly Minister.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, according to Revelation 5, He as the heavenly Administrator is executing God s universal government.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is the Lamb with seven eyes carrying out God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As the High Priest He intercedes; as the heavenly Minister, He ministers; as the Redeemer with the seven eyes of God, He administers the government of God for the accomplishment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These are the things above on which we are to set our mind.</S>
