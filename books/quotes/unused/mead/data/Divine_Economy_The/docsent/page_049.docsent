   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When they asked me whether or not we had the manifestation of the Spirit in our meetings, I pointed out to them from the Word that the topmost items of the manifestation of the Spirit are not speaking in tongues or interpretation of tongues but the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In every meeting the first manifestation of the Spirit we have is the word of wisdom and then the word of knowledge.</S>
