<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in a young people&rsquo;s conference in Hong Kong from late July to early August in 1959. The messages were published in Chinese in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> magazine from 1960 to 1961. Two messages from this conference, which were previously published in <em>Leading the Young People with the Word and the Spirit</em> (chapters 13 and 14), are not included in this book.</p>
