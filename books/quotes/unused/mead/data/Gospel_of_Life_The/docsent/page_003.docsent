   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>13 And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>14 And He found in the temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting there.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>16 And to those who were selling the doves He said, Take these things away from here; do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>17 His disciples remembered that it was written, "The zeal of Your house shall devour Me."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>18 The Jews then answered and said to Him, What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>20 Then the Jews said, This temple was built in forty-six years, and You will raise it up in three days?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>21 But He spoke of the temple of His body.</S>
