   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>To Be Glorified That God May</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Be Glorified in Him</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Furthermore, Christ's resurrection was His glorification that God might be glorified in Him John 12:28; 13:31-32; 17:1; Luke 24:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A carnation flower is an illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a carnation seed is sown, in a sense the carnation blossom is concealed within the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when the plant blossoms, the glory of the carnation flower is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This blossoming is the glorification of the carnation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Similarly, when Christ became a man, God's divine life was concealed in His human shell.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Christ's death broke His human shell, His divine life was released.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This releasing of the divine life was the glorification of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the same time it was also the glorification of the concealed God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Luke 24:26 says, "Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This word refers to His resurrection 1 Cor 15:43a; Acts 3:13a, 15a .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, this verse tells us that through His resurrection Christ entered into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before He ascended to the heavens, Christ had already entered into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ was glorified in His resurrection, and in His glorification God was also glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To Become the Life-giving Spirit That He May</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Enter into His Believers</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In His resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit that He may enter into His believers 1 Cor 15:45b; John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>While He was in the flesh, He was only able to be among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He had no way to enter into Peter, John, or any of the other disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But in resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit, and on the day of resurrection He came back to the disciples and breathed Himself as the Spirit into them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Becoming the life-giving Spirit to enter into the believers was another great work of Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>HIS ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ accomplished a great deal in His death, in His resurrection, and in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, His work in His ascension has not yet been completed, but will continue until He comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To Be Made Lord</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ's ascension made Him the Lord Acts 2:36a .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just as Christ is both God's only begotten Son from eternity past and God's firstborn Son in resurrection, so Christ being the Lord is also in two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From eternity past, Christ is the Lord because He is the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But this Christ who is the very God one day put on humanity through incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then, as we have seen, this humanity was sonized through Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was then in Christ's ascension as a man that God made Him the Lord, not only in His divinity but also in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now the One who is the Lord of the entire universe is not only God, but also a man, the God-man.</S>
