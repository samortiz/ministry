<h2 class="head2">Meeting of a Few Co-Workers in Northern Kiangsu</h2><p>We trust by the Lord that you continually remember us and are concerned about our situation before God our Father. For this reason, we are writing this letter to tell you about the matters concerning us so that your hearts may receive comfort and joy. The God who bears our burdens has heard our prayers and answered the prayers of His children. Glory to Him forever and ever! Amen.</p><p>In the region north of the Yangtze River, the churches of God seem to be boats on the sea. In the past few years many storms have suddenly arisen, and the churches have almost been covered by the waves. We have had failures, weaknesses, foolishness, and unfaithfulness in these situations. However, God allows these things to happen for His purpose. "We know that all things work together for good to those who love God." If there were no storms, how could our weaknesses be exposed? How could the Lord's ability to rebuke the wind and the waves be manifested without a storm? Therefore, we praise the Lord for allowing these things to happen to us. We hoped that the co-workers could come together for fellowship. Thank the Lord! We did not plan for it, but He gathered us together in Yi-Lin on April 6. We met together that evening. The Lord was with us. He caused us to remember the truth we received in 1928. It was all the Lord's grace. At the same time, He showed us that we each come short of the glory of God. If we do not put ourselves aside, if we do not keep the flesh and the enemy from having an inch of room in us, it will be difficult for the Lord to accomplish His work in northern Kiangsu. Thank the Lord. He is victorious. He overcame not only the enemy but also us. On the next morning, we met again. The Lord told us to go out together in one accord to visit the churches in each locality. Thank God. He gave us a heart of oneness through the Holy Spirit. Please pray for us and ask the Lord to preserve us until He comes.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Ji Yung-tung, Chiu Ri-jien, Wu Wei<br />April 19<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Revival Work, Shanghai</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>God Himself is working among us as never before. (This is in reference to our locality.) Two weeks ago the women's gospel meeting was changed from Tuesday afternoon to Saturday afternoon. One reason for the change was that there were not enough sisters to care for the many sinners who came on an individual basis, and more sisters could get off work to help on Saturday. The other reason was that we had hoped to use this opportunity to revive the sisters and to bring out what they have so that they will not become stagnant in their growth. Thank the Lord. After making this change, we were blessed by the Lord in two aspects. The number of saved sinners increases daily. The sisters are also involved more with the individual work. There are about two hundred in every meeting. We hope that the gospel preaching will soon be taken care of completely by the local sisters so that they do not have to look to the workers for the work. (We feel that a local church which relies only on the workers, without the local saints rising up, is just an empty shell.) Presently, we ask the sisters who have made a breakthrough with God to do the preaching first. Although not everyone can preach the truth of the gospel, everyone should be able to tell about the effect of the gospel on them. Thank the Lord. He has done a deep work in people's hearts. The sisters realize that this is a business of God's house. Some volunteer to give themselves to the Lord. Others are spending their money for the souls of sinners. Some readily agree when they are asked to speak. This wonderful condition really causes us to say, "Hallelujah." The sisters' meeting has been changed to Wednesday afternoon at four-thirty. Because the work of those who pray privately has increased, God has manifested His marvelous grace among us all. Presently, we read the Bible and pray every Wednesday in the meeting. We are reading (not expounding) the Gospel of John. We are paying special attention to the matters concerning the Lord Jesus. Thank the Lord. He has given us much light. We speak to one another about what we have seen and gained. In this way we build up one another. About two hundred people come to that meeting. Every time we meet, more people come. Twenty-one sisters and seven brothers were baptized tonight. The Lord's Day morning message meeting is so crowded that all the seats are filled, and there is no room for standing. There are many who come in and then turn around and walk out. Last Lord's Day we changed the time of the Lord's table meeting to three o'clock in the afternoon. (It was inconvenient for the sisters to come to a meeting at night.) We might have three places with table meetings soon.</p><p>Miao Yun-chun<br />May 6<br />[Address omitted]</p>
