   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. The Testimony of Their Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 12 Paul refers to the testimony of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must have a pure conscience 2 Tim 1:3 , a conscience without offense Acts 24:16 , to bear a testimony to what we are and do.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul s conscience testified that he was sincere, faithful, and honest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In particular, he had the testimony of his conscience that he was single.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He did not use any human way to deal with situations.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He did not exercise his knowledge, ability, strength, or wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He did not use any policy, and he did not play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, he was single, simple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His conscience bore testimony concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This testimony was his boast.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, Paul could say, We live, behave, act, and work only in God, not in any way that is of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our unique way is the God of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The God who raises the dead is our only way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we did not play politics, and we did not exercise our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We were absolutely simple, as simple as those who are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our confidence is in nothing other than the living Person who is the God of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is our boast, and this is the testimony borne by our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>B. Conducting Themselves in the World 1.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Singleness and Sincerity of God</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why did Paul speak to the Corinthians about singleness?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was because the Corinthians were very complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They had many different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was the reason some preferred Apollos, and others preferred Cephas or Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, 1 Corinthians is a book which deals with the complications of the believers at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The source of confusion and division among Christians today is the complications that are within the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If all Christians became simple, there would be no problems among them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The problems in a local church always come from complications.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If there is a problem in your locality, that problem comes from someone who is not simple, but who is complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason, I always try to avoid being involved with a complicated person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever you meet a complicated person, you should not try to argue with him or correct him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Any attempts at argument or correction will cause you to become trapped in complications.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In verse 12 Paul speaks of the singleness and sincerity of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The sincerity of God is a divine virtue, a virtue of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To conduct ourselves in such a virtue means to experience God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, it equals in the grace of God also mentioned in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is wise and almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But in a sense He is also single; He is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was wise; yet He was also simple and single.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I very much enjoy having contact with the Lord Jesus because of His singleness and simplicity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, when you talk to certain brothers, you find that they are extremely complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But our God is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever we talk to Him, we find that He is not full of complications.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When He says yes, He means yes, and when He says no, He means no. Likewise, when He says white or black, He means white or black, not gray.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No matter how God may feel about us at a particular time, He is always single.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He may be unhappy with us or He may be happy, but He Himself is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From experience we have learned that a person who is simple and single is also generous and full of liberality.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who are simple are those who give freely.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, suppose a brother approaches a person so single and tells him that he is short of money to pay his rent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Immediately the one who is simple will be willing to give that brother whatever he needs.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This illustrates the fact that to be simple is to be generous.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But those who are complicated are not generous.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Instead of being willing to give freely, they may consider the matter in a complicated way and then give an amount that falls short of the need.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul was single, simple, and generous.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only a person so single is a generous person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you lack singleness, you will never be generous or bountiful toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our God is bountiful toward us because He is single.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Imagine what would happen to us if God were not single and if He thought about us in a complicated way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Probably He would not care for us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Would you like God to consider your situation and examine you in detail?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Would you like Him to look at you from head to toe and consider what you are inwardly and outwardly?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>None of us would be favored by God if He examined us in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But because of God s singleness and generosity, we have received blessing from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I would ask you to compare Paul to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Paul was like the simple God, but the Corinthians were extremely complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If Paul had not been single and simple, he probably would have forgotten about the Corinthians and would no longer have been willing to minister among them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Paul s conscience testified that toward the Corinthians he and his co-workers conducted themselves in the singleness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, they could be generous toward the Corinthians and be willing to give them anything.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Toward those believers, Paul and his co-workers were generous and full of bounty.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Greek word rendered singleness is rich in meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The words singleness or simplicity are not an adequate translation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This word implies generosity, liberality, bounty, and willingness to give.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If a married brother is simple, he will be very generous toward his wife, no matter what she does or how she treats him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, if a brother is complicated, he will deal with his wife in a strict way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Paul was one who conducted himself in the singleness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He was a true imitator of God and one who lived God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God is simple, and Paul also was simple.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God is generous, and Paul also was generous.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He behaved himself in the singleness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When we have singleness and generosity, we shall also be sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is a common practice to close a letter with the words sincerely yours.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Actually, this usually means politically yours, or, at best, politely yours.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A person may write a long letter full of complications, and then at the end say sincerely yours.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>That is not sincerity.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Only when you treat others in a single way and with generosity can you truly say sincerely yours.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Because Paul conducted himself in the singleness of God and because he was generous, he was truly sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I certainly would not claim to be an absolute and faithful imitator of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But I can testify that throughout the years, we have been trained, taught, and helped by the Lord s mercy and grace to behave ourselves in simplicity, singleness, sincerity, and generosity.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I can testify to you before the Lord that I do not play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Furthermore I can say before Him that I am a simple person.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>My yes is yes, and my no is no.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Not in Fleshly Wisdom</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>but in the Grace of God</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In verse 12 Paul refers to fleshly wisdom and the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Fleshly wisdom is human wisdom in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This equals ourselves, just as the grace of God equals God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The grace of God is God for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The grace in verse 12 is the gift in verse 11, which the apostles received for the experience of resurrection in their sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Being simple and single is an aspect of the expression of the life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Only when we live in resurrection and by the God of resurrection, not by ourselves, are we simple.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>It is when we live in resurrection that we are imitators of God.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Although others may play politics with us, we shall not be political with them.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The most we shall do is try to remove ourselves from the snare of complications.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>I want to follow Paul to conduct myself in the singleness and sincerity of God.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This is an aspect of the manifestation of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Only by living a life in the singleness and sincerity of God can we be constituted ministers of Christ and of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Those who are constituted in this way are needed in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The elders and all the serving ones must be people of this kind.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If you consider the history of the Lord s recovery, you will see that those who play politics and who do not live in the singleness of God cause damage and loss to the Lord s recovery and to themselves as well.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Only those who truly live in the singleness of God have been a profit to the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Regarding this, we have learned some important lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>To live in resurrection is to live in the singleness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>In 1:12-14 we see, as a continuation of 1 Corinthians, how to live in resurrection.</S>
