   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Hymn #631 in Hymns says:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If I'd know Christ's risen power,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I must ever love the Cross;</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Life from death alone arises;</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There's no gain except by loss.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If no death, no life,</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If no death, no life;</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Life from death alone arises;</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If no death, no life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If I'd have Christ formed within me,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I must breathe my final breath,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Live within the Cross's shadow,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Put my soul-life e'er to death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If God thru th' Eternal Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nail me ever with the Lord;</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only then as death is working</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Will His life thru me be poured.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are persons under the shadow of the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Christian life is both a living life and a dying life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We live, but we live in the mold of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Lord Jesus lived on the earth, He was being crucified every day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every day He lived a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We also can live such a life because we have the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we have seen, this power is the person of Christ, and Christ today is the Spirit of Jesus Christ who is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we remain in our spirit, we experience this power in the shadow of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every day our spouse and children are the "shadows of death" to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our children may be very enjoyable to us at first.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, one day they may become shadows, and the more they grow, the darker the shadows may become.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, our children will put us into the mold of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should simply remain there and say, "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not only are our marriage life and family life the mold of the cross, but even the church life becomes the mold of the cross to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Certain saints may wonder why there are hardships in the "glorious church life," and eventually the church life may not seem so glorious to them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every brother and sister may seem to be a "dark shadow."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This may cause some to consider moving to a new locality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, they may discover that the church in the locality to which they move is even darker.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, if they leave the church, their situation will become darker still.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have no place to which we may escape.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every locality is a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have been destined to pass through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only when we are in the New Jerusalem in the new heavens and new earth will we be out of the shadow of death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the New Jerusalem there will be no night and no shadow Rev 21:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, today there are shadows of the cross everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Praise the Lord that within us there is the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul said, "I can do all things in Him who empowers me" Phil 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The One who empowers us is the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By Him we can live a life that expresses and magnifies Christ Phil 1:20 .</S>
