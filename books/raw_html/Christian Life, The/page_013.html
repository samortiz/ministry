<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Christ's All-transcending Ascension</H2><P>The processed and consummated Triune God is also compounded with Christ's all-transcending ascension (Eph. 1:20-21). There are many things which are negative to us as Christians. All the fallen angels in the air are negative to us. But Christ's ascension conquered and subdued all of these negative things. In His ascension, He transcended from the earth through the air to the third heaven far above all. Thus, we can see that the elements of the processed and consummated Triune God include His all-resolving and all-terminating death, His all-producing resurrection, and His all-transcending ascension. Christ as the center of the Triune God was compounded with His death, resurrection, and ascension.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Typified by the Compounded Holy Ointment<br>in Exodus 30:22-31</H2><P>This compounded person is typified by the compounded holy ointment in Exodus 30:22-31. The compounded ointment was not merely oil. It was an ointment. Olive oil as the basic unit was compounded with four spices&#151;myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. Messages one hundred fifty-seven through one hundred sixty-six in the Life-study of Exodus cover the truth concerning the compounded ointment. I would encourage you to read or study those messages. All the elements plus all the numbers related to the compounded ointment signify Christ's divinity, humanity, human life, death, and resurrection. Some Bible teachers recognized that the compounded ointment was a type of the Holy Spirit. But no Bible teacher in the past gave us an analysis of the compounded ointment in all of its aspects. Through our own study we saw that olive oil typifies the unique God, myrrh typifies the precious death of Christ, cinnamon typifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ's death, calamus typifies the precious resurrection of Christ, and cassia typifies the repelling power of Christ's resurrection. Our God today is the compounded God.</P><P>I began to speak on this beginning in 1954. In a training in Hong Kong in that year, I told people that today in the Spirit there is the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ. I received some help from chapter five of Andrew Murray's masterpiece entitled The Spirit of Christ, in which he stressed that the Spirit today includes both divinity and humanity. Since I came to the United States, this vision of the Spirit as typified by the compounded ointment has become clearer and clearer. I believe that this revelation today is in the highlight, at "noontime."</P>
