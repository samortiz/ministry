<h1 class="title">PRINCIPLES REGARDING<br />
GOD&rsquo;S ADMINISTRATION AMONG HIS PEOPLE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 20:7; Exo. 3:16; 7:1; Eph. 2:20; 3:5; 1 Sam. 8:4-9, 19-20; Matt. 10:2; Mark 6:7; Luke 10:1; Acts 13:2</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You for Your mercy and Your sovereignty. We ask You to visit us. Your presence is all that we need. Lord, we consecrate ourselves to You. We pray that You would speak to us, touch our heart, and unveil to us everything on Your heart. Lord, we need the covering of Your prevailing blood. We hide ourselves in You. In these days of warfare we are not fighting for anything of ourselves but for Your kingdom. Therefore, we ask You to cover our shortcomings and weakness. We look unto You for Your living word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLES, PROPHETS, AND ELDERS BEING<br />
THE MAIN CONSTITUENTS OF GOD&rsquo;S ADMINISTRATION</h2>
<p>We will first consider God&rsquo;s administration. Our God is a God of purpose. He desires to accomplish something. In order for God&rsquo;s purpose to be carried out, there is the need of His administration, His government. In spite of the apparent differences between the Old Testament and the New Testament, the divine concept concerning God&rsquo;s administration is the same throughout the Bible. Christians generally say that God&rsquo;s administration in the Old Testament was first the priests, then the kings, and finally the prophets. However, just as in the New Testament, God&rsquo;s administration in the Old Testament involved apostles, prophets, and elders. On the human side these three groups are the main constituents of God&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<p>The word <em>apostle</em> is an anglicized Greek word referring to one who is sent with a commission and implies that the sending one has authority. Thus, apostles in the Bible are those sent by God, who is the One with authority. Although the word <em>apostle</em> does not appear in the Old Testament, there was such a person. Moses was sent by God to deal with Pharaoh. Exodus 7:1a says, &ldquo;Jehovah said to Moses, See, I have made you God to Pharaoh.&rdquo; This shows that Moses was sent as an authority to Pharaoh.</p>
<p>In Genesis 20:7 God spoke to Abimelech concerning Abraham&rsquo;s wife, saying, &ldquo;Return the man&rsquo;s wife, for he is a prophet; and he will pray for you, and you will live.&rdquo; This is the first time that the word <em>prophet</em> is used in the Bible. Thus, according to the Bible, the first prophet was Abraham. Most people think of a prophet as one who predicts, or foretells, future events. However, this is not the main meaning of the word <em>prophet</em> in the Bible. In Exodus 3 and 4 God called Moses and sent him to deal with Pharaoh and to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt. However, Moses somewhat shrank back, saying that he was not a good speaker, which compelled God to use Aaron to speak for Moses (4:10, 16). In Exodus 7:1b Jehovah said to Moses, &ldquo;Aaron your brother will be your prophet.&rdquo; Aaron was Moses&rsquo; spokesman. Thus, the main meaning of the word <em>prophet</em> in the Bible is not one who predicts but a spokesman. A prophet is God&rsquo;s spokesman, one who speaks for God. However, Aaron was a prophet not for God but for Moses.</p>
<p>With Moses and Aaron we can see the difference between an apostle and a prophet. According to Hebrews 3:1-2, Moses was a type of Christ as the Apostle sent by God. Therefore, Moses was the first apostle; he was one sent by God. As the apostle&rsquo;s spokesman, Aaron was a prophet. Actually, Moses and Aaron should be considered as one. Aaron is not separate from Moses; he is actually a part of Moses. We know this because Moses and Aaron were always together when they went to see Pharaoh and when they spoke to the children of Israel. The oneness of the apostles and prophets continues in the New Testament. Ephesians 2:20 says that the church is &ldquo;built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets.&rdquo; Ephesians 3:5 says that God&rsquo;s New Testament economy &ldquo;has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit.&rdquo; Thus, in both the Old Testament and the New Testament, the divine concept is that the apostle and the prophet are one. Nevertheless, the apostle and prophet represent two different functions. The apostles stand mainly for God&rsquo;s authority, or administration, and the prophets stand mainly for God&rsquo;s speaking. Apostles also speak, but the term <em>apostle</em> primarily refers to the administrative aspect, and <em>prophet</em> refers to the speaking aspect.</p>
<p>The term <em>elder</em> literally means an &ldquo;older person.&rdquo; In most families the father is the oldest person; therefore, the father is the elder of a family. According to the Bible, the community of God&rsquo;s people is formed of many families, and among these many families there are older ones called elders who take the lead. In Exodus 3:16 God said to Moses, &ldquo;Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me.&rdquo; Thus, the concept of having elders among God&rsquo;s people is not unique to the New Testament. Actually, the New Testament follows the Old Testament in this regard. The elders existed even before Moses was called and sent as the first apostle. From Exodus onward, we see that God deals with His people through the elders. In preparation for the passover, God went first through Moses to the elders of the children of Israel (12:21). Thus, the elders are crucial because they are the leading ones among God&rsquo;s people, and they represent God&rsquo;s people. Those who are directly involved in God&rsquo;s administration are of only three categories&mdash;apostles, prophets, and elders.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEMS WITH HUMAN KINGSHIP</h2>
<p>We need to change our concept concerning human kingship. First Samuel 8:4-9 says,</p>
<p class="indent1">All the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah. And they said to him, You are now old, and your sons do not follow in your ways. Appoint now for us a king to judge us like all the nations. But the matter displeased Samuel when they said, Give us a king to judge us. Then Samuel prayed to Jehovah. And Jehovah said to Samuel, Listen to the voice of the people according to all that they have said to you; for it is not you whom they have rejected, but they have rejected Me from being King over them. Like all the deeds that they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt to this very day by forsaking Me and serving other gods, so they do also to you. Now therefore listen to their voice, but you shall solemnly warn them and declare to them the practice of the king who will reign over them.</p>
<p>Verses 19 and 20 say, &ldquo;But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel, and they said, No; but there will be a king over us, that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.&rdquo; The thought to have a king to &ldquo;judge us and go out before us and fight our battles&rdquo; has existed among God&rsquo;s people for many centuries.</p>
<p>God does not want to have a human king among His people, because once a king comes in, the headship of God is usurped. God wants to have only the apostles, prophets, and elders as His sent ones, His spokesmen, and the leading ones among His people, for these do not usurp His headship. However, according to their fallen nature, God&rsquo;s people desired to have a king like the nations. Even today we like to have a king because it is convenient. If there is a king, we do not need to do anything since the king does everything for us. In one sense, no one likes to have a king, because we do not like to be ruled by anyone. However, in another sense, we all like to have a king to do things for us. A leading brother from another country recently asked me whether he should stay in the United States for a training or return to his locality to take care of an upcoming conference there. By asking me this, he was making me his king. He wanted me to make the decision so that he would not be bothered and could rest. I refuse to be such a king. I prayed for the brother and told him, &ldquo;You must go to the Lord and pray until you are clear about what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is people&rsquo;s laziness, or indolence, that causes them to be willing to have a king. The elders of the children of Israel did not want to be bothered with their responsibilities of judging and fighting. They saw that the nations had kings who did everything for them. In past turmoils many saints in the local churches were deceived mainly because they were lazy. Many did not exercise their spirit, which is the gift of God, but preferred to rest and rely on someone else. This kind of idleness gives an ambitious person the opportunity to become a king who promises to do everything and make all the decisions. We may accept such a one because we prefer to rest and leave the responsibility to someone else. This is the principle of having a human king.</p>
<p>When elders ask me to come to their locality or send someone to help them, I often decline their request. Such elders are like mothers who ask others to come to their home to help them cook. Each mother must cook for her own family. If she does not prepare the food well, her family can still eat it, and she will learn from her mistakes so that her cooking will improve. We must drop our concept of needing someone to come and help us. If the leading ones in a local church always ask for help from others, that local church will not be strong. The churches do not need a king; the elders are good enough. God has no intention to have a human king among His people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS BEING THE BASIC FACTOR<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S ADMINISTRATION AMONG HIS PEOPLE</h2>
<p>The basic category of persons in God&rsquo;s administration is the elders. We can see this concept in the Bible. The elders of the children of Israel already existed before Moses was raised up as the first apostle. We should not rely entirely on the apostles and prophets. The apostles are sent by God to accomplish something, and the prophets speak for God. However, those who administrate directly among God&rsquo;s people are the elders. Thus, the elders are the basic factor of God&rsquo;s administration among His people.</p>
<p>The elders of Israel became lazy and idle, preferring the convenience of the kingship according to the custom of the nations (vv. 19-20). Christian denominations today follow this principle. For the sake of convenience, the members of a denomination donate money to hire a pastor as a king to do everything for them. This offends God&rsquo;s headship. The elders in the local churches may be capable and strong, but they must be careful not to become kings. The eldership does not offend God&rsquo;s headship, but if anyone becomes a king, this offends God&rsquo;s headship. The thought of a human king is altogether offensive to God. In 1 Samuel 8 the elders&rsquo; request for a king greatly displeased God, who told Samuel, &ldquo;It is not you whom they have rejected, but they have rejected Me from being King over them&rdquo; (v. 7). This indicates that although the apostles, prophets, and elders are part of God&rsquo;s administration, the kingship should be kept for God Himself. The apostles, prophets, and elders do not interfere with, offend, or usurp the kingship of God. However, when God&rsquo;s people bring in a king, this is a direct offense against God&rsquo;s kingship. The apostles, prophets, and elders must be careful to keep the kingship for God.</p>
<p>The principle of keeping the kingship and headship uniquely for God is consistent throughout the Bible. This is the reason the Lord told His disciples, &ldquo;Do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers&rdquo; (Matt. 23:8). Christ alone is our Teacher, Master, Leader, and King. Peter exhorts the elders, &ldquo;Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God;...nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock&rdquo; (1 Pet. 5:2-3). The elders should shepherd and oversee the flock, but they should not be lords. To be a lord interferes with God&rsquo;s kingship. We must see that in God&rsquo;s economy for His administration, He desires to keep the kingship uniquely for Himself.</p>
<p>If we prefer to be idle and have someone else do everything for us for the sake of convenience, this will open the door for a king to come in, just as Saul came in as a king among the children of Israel. The elders especially should not be idle or take the way of convenience. They need to be diligent and willing to bear the burdens. In order to receive God&rsquo;s blessing, we must not open the door for a king to come in, nor should we desire to be a king. The Bible clearly reveals that God does not want to have a human king in His administration, because He does not want anyone to replace Him by usurping His headship and kingship. The headship and kingship must be left to God alone. God sends His apostles and establishes His prophets and the elders among His people, but He has no desire for there to be a king.</p><h2 class="head1">THERE NEEDING TO BE A PLURALITY<br />
OF APOSTLES, PROPHETS, AND ELDERS</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, there should always be a plurality of apostles, prophets, and elders. After calling His disciples, the Lord appointed twelve apostles (Matt. 10:2). Whenever the Lord sent out His disciples, He sent them two by two (Mark 6:7; Luke 10:1). The Lord never sent out an apostle alone. In Acts 13:2 Paul and Barnabas were sent out together as apostles. There is always a plurality in the apostleship. The same is true of the prophets and elders. There should always be several elders in a local church. The plurality in the apostleship, the prophethood, and the eldership is crucial because it helps prevent anyone from becoming a king among the churches.</p>
<p>There was no permanent leadership among the early apostles. Peter took the lead in Acts 2:14, but in 15:13 James rose up to take the lead. This record shows that Peter was not the permanent, unique, official, or organizational leader. Instead, he was only a momentary leader; later, James became another momentary leader. If there is one apostle, prophet, or elder above the others, that one is a king, which is an insult to Christ&rsquo;s headship and the kingship.</p>
<p>The Lord has shown us that God does not want to have a human king in His administration. There was a king in the Old Testament, but that was against God&rsquo;s desire. Thus, there is no king among God&rsquo;s people in the New Testament age. It was the degradation among the children of Israel in the Old Testament that caused a king to come in. The desire of the children of Israel for a king was according to the custom of the nations, which are abominable in the eyes of God. We must be impressed that we should not have a king. We welcome the apostles, prophets, and elders, but we have only one king, who is our God, Savior, and Lord.</p>
<p>We must see this principle and stand against anyone becoming a king among the local churches. The basic factor in God&rsquo;s administration today is the elders. The apostles and prophets do many things, but the basic constitution of God&rsquo;s administration is the elders. It is the elders who directly administrate. Because God desires to keep the headship and kingship absolutely and uniquely for Himself, He needs a group of elders in each locality who participate in His administration without offending His headship.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the first apostle was Moses. Following Moses, many were raised up to speak for God. These were prophets, God&rsquo;s spokesmen. Eventually, the Lord Jesus came as the Apostle and the Prophet (Heb. 3:1; Deut. 18:15, 18). Christ is the Apostle who is sent with God&rsquo;s authority and the Prophet who speaks for God. Christ initially appointed and sent out twelve of His own apostles. After Pentecost He sent many more, including Paul. Among these apostles some were also prophets. These early apostles appointed elders in the local churches they established (Acts 14:23). Since that time God&rsquo;s administration among His people has been primarily with the elders.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER BALANCE IN THE ELDERS&rsquo;<br />
RECEIVING HELP FROM OTHERS YET BEARING<br />
THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN LOCALITIES</h2>
<p>There should be no king among God&rsquo;s people in the churches today. The elders in every local church should be diligent in directly seeking the Lord for everything. For every need they should pray, fellowship, and wait on the Lord to receive direction, guidance, and leading directly from Him.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the elders should never think that because they are capable, they do not need help from the other churches or anyone outside their locality. Such pride is wrong. On the other hand, neither should they be open to everyone without discernment and ask for help from the other churches and servants of the Lord every time a need arises, in order to avoid bearing any burdens. This is also wrong. We need to be humble and open to others, yet we also must be diligent and not always rely on others&rsquo; help. Therefore, whenever a need arises, we should first pray in order to seek the Lord directly. After we pray, the Lord may send someone to give us some extraordinary help or open the fellowship so that we receive help from other churches, but ordinarily we must take care of our own local affairs.</p>
<p>No matter how weak certain persons may be, when they are married and have a family, they find a way to take care of their family. Similarly, all the elders must learn to take care of their own localities. They should not always look to others for help but must be diligent and faithful and must open directly to the Lord in prayer. Nothing is better than our direct contact with the Lord. If the elders pray, seek the Lord, and wait on Him, the help will often come directly from the Lord.</p>
<p>We need to change our attitude, because our idleness, laziness, and habit of relying on others open the door for a king to come in, not only among a group of churches but also locally. The elders in a locality should not allow one elder to become a king. Every elder must exercise discernment and pray to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading while respecting the Lord&rsquo;s leading in the other elders. The elders must be diligent, active, and faithful to the Lord, not expecting someone else to do everything for them for the sake of convenience. To dominate is wrong, and to be lazy is also wrong. If all the elders are exercised in taking the lead, there will be no opening for anyone to become a king. To have a king is contrary to God&rsquo;s administration. Among His people today, God desires to have a plurality of elders. This will allow God&rsquo;s economy to be carried out yet avoid offending God&rsquo;s headship.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE APPOINTMENT, PLACEMENT,<br />
AND CAPACITY OF THE ELDERS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 11:29-30; 14:23; 15:2, 4, 6, 23; 21:18; Titus 1:5</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE EARLIEST MENTIONING OF ELDERS<br />
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>We need to see a few points concerning the elders. The children of Israel had elders, but the Old Testament does not tell us how these elders were appointed. In the same way, in the New Testament we can see that there were elders in the first local church, the church in Jerusalem, but there is no record of when or how they became elders. Nevertheless, it is clear that the elders were important.</p>
<p>The first mention of the elders in the churches is in Acts 11:29-30, which says, &ldquo;The disciples, according to how one was prospered, determined, each one of them, to send things for dispensing to the brothers dwelling in Judea, which also they did, sending it to the elders through the hand of Barnabas and Saul.&rdquo; These verses reveal that donations from the Gentile churches were sent to the elders in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In chapter 15 we can see the importance of the elders. Verse 2 says, &ldquo;When no little dissension and discussion with them came about through Paul and Barnabas, the brothers directed Paul and Barnabas and certain others among them to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning this question.&rdquo; This shows that when there was a disagreement concerning the truth, not only the apostles but also the elders were involved. This clearly shows that the elders are important in God&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<p>Verse 4 says, &ldquo;When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared the things that God had done with them.&rdquo; Verse 6 says, &ldquo;The apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter.&rdquo; Finally, verse 23 says, &ldquo;Writing to them and sending by their hand the following: The apostles and the elder brothers, to the brothers throughout Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are of the Gentiles, rejoice.&rdquo; In all these verses the elders are mentioned in a specific way.</p>
<p>Acts 21:18 says, &ldquo;On the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.&rdquo; In Paul&rsquo;s last visit to Jerusalem, he met with James and all the elders. This also shows the importance of the elders.</p>
<p>According to the revelation of the entire Bible, the basic factor in God&rsquo;s administration should not be a king, the apostles, or the prophets but the elders. The direct administration in both the Old Testament and the New Testament is with the elders. When the administration was apparently with the kings in the Old Testament, that was an abnormal situation. The genuine administration of God depends basically and directly on the elders.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS BEING PRODUCED<br />
BY GROWTH AND MATURITY IN LIFE</h2>
<p>We need to consider how the elders are appointed, or the way in which the elders should be produced. The New Testament apparently reveals that the apostles appoint the elders. However, the producing of the elders actually does not depend mainly on the appointment by the apostles. Sometimes what the Bible does not say is as meaningful as what the Bible does say. The Bible does not say how the elders among the children of Israel were produced. Nor does the Bible say how the elders in the church in Jerusalem were produced. This indicates that the producing of the elders does not depend entirely on their appointment.</p>
<p>The producing of the elders depends mainly on the matter of life. In a family there is no need to appoint the father. He is produced not by appointment but by life. It is a spontaneous matter of life that among the persons in a family, one is the father. The term <em>elder,</em> which simply means an older person or a person of advanced age, implies one who is produced by the growth and maturity of life. We need to be impressed that the elders are produced not mainly by appointment but by what they are in life according to their growth and maturity.</p>
<p>Although the father in a family does not need to be appointed, the elders do need to be appointed because the situation in the church is not as simple as that of a family. In a family everyone knows who the father is, and there is no argument about it. In principle, the elders are produced by their maturity in life, but even in a small church it may not be immediately clear which ones have the most maturity. Therefore, in order to prevent confusion, a few need to be appointed as elders. To appoint elders is simply to point out or indicate to the saints who the elders are in order to avoid confusion or complication. Nevertheless, we need to be clear that the elders are produced not by appointment but by growth in life.</p>
<p>According to Acts 14, during the same journey on which Paul preached the gospel, he also raised up local churches and appointed elders in each church. Verse 23 says, &ldquo;When they had appointed elders for them in every church and had prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord into whom they had believed.&rdquo; These churches in which Paul appointed elders had been established within less than one year. Thus, Paul&rsquo;s practice in his early ministry and during his first trip was to first preach the gospel, second raise up churches, and third appoint elders. Twenty years later his practice in appointing elders seems to have changed. In Titus 1:5 he said, &ldquo;For this cause I left you in Crete, that you might set in order the things which I have begun that remain and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you.&rdquo; Paul did not directly appoint the elders in Crete as he did on his first journey.</p>
<p>Regardless of Paul&rsquo;s apostleship, which he received of the Lord, I believe that as a human being he needed improvement. The Lord does not need improvement, but Paul did. In one matter this is clear. In 1 Corinthians 7, which was written in Paul&rsquo;s early ministry, Paul&rsquo;s opinion was that it was better for widows to remain single (v. 8). However, in his later ministry he said that the younger widows should remarry (1 Tim. 5:14). Through much experience Paul learned something and, as a result, changed his opinion, but this change became part of the divinely inspired record of the Bible. Therefore, we should not be condemned if some minor aspects of our teaching change as a result of years of experience.</p>
<p>Paul may have also changed in the matter of appointing the elders. On his first journey he appointed the elders as soon as a church was established, but later he may have discovered that this practice was unreliable. Therefore, in his later ministry he did not immediately appoint the elders but instead left the task to his younger co-worker because he saw the need for some consideration concerning the qualifications of the elders. Paul did not mention the specific qualifications of the elders until his later ministry (3:2-7; Titus 1:6-9). This may indicate that he found that some elders were appointed at the wrong time. In other words, in Paul&rsquo;s early ministry the appointment of the elders was quick, but in his later ministry the appointment of elders was slow and deliberate. He became very careful about this matter.</p>
<p>We should not decide whether a brother is an elder at an early stage of his growth in life, when he is immature. We must be slow in this matter and wait until the time is right. Otherwise, it is unsafe and may cause trouble. The New Testament reveals that the elders in a local church should not be appointed in a quick way. There is the need of time for thorough consideration so that the qualifications may be manifested. Then the time will be right to make a decision. Farmers wait to reap grain until it is ripe. It would be foolish to reap before the harvest ripens. Similarly, whenever a new local church is raised up as the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, it is proper and safe to delay appointing the elders until there is a full manifestation of the situation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS BEING RAISED UP LOCALLY</h2>
<p>The migrations in the past few years have allowed a subtle practice to creep in, which we may call the transfer of elders. An elder is like a father in a family, and fathers are not transferred. There is no transfer of elders in the Old Testament. The elders in a tribe of the children of Israel were raised up from within that tribe. If the elders in one tribe were weak, other elders were not transferred in from another tribe. The elders in Judah belonged to the tribe of Judah; they could not transfer to the tribe of Dan to be elders of that tribe.</p>
<p>Elders are not transferable. In a migration we do not transfer anyone. In the past when large groups of saints migrated to establish new local churches, each group was already like a tribe of the children of Israel with elders who went with them. These elders were not transferred to take the lead among a new group of saints. However, because some misunderstood what happened in these migrations, the practice of transferring elders subtly crept in. This is absolutely against the biblical principle and is useful only for those who want to build up their own kingdom by manipulating the situation in order to gain control over certain local churches. Transferring elders is dangerous because it opens the door to hierarchy. The elders should be raised up locally from among the saints meeting in a church. Keeping this principle in life will prevent false ones from maneuvering according to their ambition to build up a hierarchy or personal kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN ORDER TO CARE FOR THE CHURCHES,<br />
THE ELDERS NEEDING TO SEEK THE LORD BY PRAYING AND GETTING INTO THE WORD</h2>
<p>The elders in some local churches may feel that they are weak and need to be helped by the addition of an elder from another locality. However, we need to keep the principle that the parents of a family are not rearranged or replaced, no matter how weak they may be. The elders who feel that they are weak and need help should pray much and get into the Word. All the leading ones can make it if they are diligent and desperate to deal with the Lord. Those who complain that they are weak are only admitting that they are slothful in seeking the Lord by praying and getting into the Word. Any young wife can eventually learn to cook as long as she tries. Even if the food she prepares does not come out perfectly at first, it will be good enough to feed her family.</p>
<p>The elders need to desperately seek the Lord in their care for the churches. I know this from experience. When a need arises, we should not immediately ask for help from others; instead, we should first go to the Lord over and over again. If we still are not clear regarding a certain matter after we have sought the Lord many times, we can ask others for help. We should not say that we are weak. It is true that we are weak in ourselves, but because we have the Lord, we only need to apply Him. If we are diligent and seek the Lord desperately, we will make it.</p>
<p>Before Brother Watchman Nee gave a message on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, he would spend all of Saturday preparing&mdash;praying, fasting, seeking the Lord, getting into the Word, and considering the message. Any elder who prepares in this way can give a powerful message. What a mother cooks is not that important, as long as her children are fed and nourished.</p>
<p>Requesting the transfer of elders is brought about by laziness, idleness, and seeking convenience. The parents in a family may be well educated and intelligent, and the parents in another family may be uneducated and ignorant. Nevertheless, these parents should stay with their own families. It is normal for some families to be strong and others to be weak. Those in a weak local church need to try their best to learn something on their own. Transfers open the door for laziness, hierarchy, and improper kingship. If so-called spiritual giants are raised up among us, this indicates that many of us are lazy. If all the saints are diligent and desperate to seek the Lord, no &ldquo;giants&rdquo; will be raised up among us. If &ldquo;giants&rdquo; do come in, there will be no market for them to &ldquo;sell their cargo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are two attitudes that the elders in the local churches must avoid. On the one hand, it is wrong to be proud, thinking that because we are capable, we do not need others&rsquo; help. On the other hand, it is also wrong to be improperly humble, saying that we know nothing and need others&rsquo; help in everything. This attitude opens the door to false ones who damage the church. In the past the elders in some local churches welcomed anyone who was willing to come and help them. Because they did not exercise the proper discernment, terrible things happened. Those who have learned the necessary spiritual lessons of the Lord will not quickly agree to go to help another local church when invited. When I am invited to go somewhere, I do not immediately reply but ask for time to pray and seek the Lord for His leading in the matter. Quickness in accepting invitations is a sign of an unsound person.</p>
<p>We need to exercise discernment in asking others to come help us. We must avoid both the attitude of pride and the opposite attitude of excessive humility. Because we have the Lord, we are not as needy as we may think. Local churches have been damaged in the past because the elders did not exercise discernment in opening to others for help. We need to be balanced&mdash;neither proud nor excessively humble, open to the fellowship of the Body of Christ but also realizing that we are all members of the Body, each having a function and being attached to Christ the Head.</p>
<p>The elders must be desperate in seeking the Lord; they need to pray, fellowship, and wait on the Lord, spending much time in His presence. The elders&rsquo; capacity to help the saints in their locality does not depend on eloquence, gift, or natural ability. A certain American surgeon who taught at a renowned university in northern China was not saved when he came to China. After he had been in China for several years, one of his children passed away. This caused him to be open, and he was saved. Immediately after being saved, he became zealous in preaching the gospel, yet he was altogether not eloquent. Not only when giving sermons but even in personal conversations he could not speak easily. Nevertheless, many were saved through him because he prayed much and lived a life of loving and following the Lord and loving sinners. Others who are very eloquent but do not love or seek the Lord do not bring anyone to Him. This proves that our capacity to help others does not depend on eloquence, gift, or natural ability. In the past false ones have been able to come in and damage the local churches mainly because of their eloquence and outward ability. Hence, the elders must learn the lesson to not trust in such outward things or to rely entirely on help from outsiders. Instead, the elders should humbly trust in their own contact with the Lord in prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>We have seen three points concerning the elders. First, the elders should not be appointed quickly. It has been made clear in our history that the eldership in a newly established church cannot and should not be determined right away. We must wait until the situation is manifested. We should not be concerned about who will bear the responsibilities&mdash;some will spontaneously rise up to meet the needs. We must avoid premature appointment of the elders. Second, there should be no transferring of elders, because this violates the principle of life. Third, the elders in every locality can make it if they are diligent in desperately contacting the Lord in prayer.</p>
<p>A certain local church recently faced a big problem related to a brother&rsquo;s illness. However, they did not ask for others to come and help them. They only asked others to pray for them, and they themselves prayed much. The answer to their problem came through this prayer. If the elders take every need to the Lord in desperate prayer, they will receive His answers. If a local church has a need, the best way for the elders to take care of it is not to ask brothers from other localities to come to help them but to bring the matter to the Lord and pray desperately. The Lord will grant them the supply to meet the need, perhaps by sending someone to help them. The elders must be diligent and desperate in bringing everything to the Lord in prayer.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">HONORING THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST<br />
IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE APOSTLES, ELDERS, AND CHURCHES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 15:1-35</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we look unto You to show us more truth with the shining of Your light. Lord, bring us out of our darkness and into Your light. In Your light we see light. Thank You that we are in Your sanctuary, the place of Your speaking and shining. Lord, cover us with Your prevailing blood. Under this covering we claim Your full anointing. Lord, we have no trust in ourselves but trust instead in Your mercy, presence, and speaking.</p>
<p>We need to see something further concerning God&rsquo;s administration. Acts 15 contains a unique record in the New Testament of a conference of apostles and elders. According to this record, there was no human head, authority, or &ldquo;king.&rdquo; Verses 1 through 35 say,</p>
<p class="indent1">Certain men came down from Judea [to Antioch] and began to teach the brothers, Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved. And when no little dissension and discussion with them came about through Paul and Barnabas, the brothers directed Paul and Barnabas and certain others among them to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning this question. They therefore, having been sent forward by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, telling in detail about the turning of the Gentiles; and they brought great joy to all the brothers. And when they arrived in Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared the things that God had done with them. But certain men from the sect of the Pharisees who had believed rose up from among them, saying, It is necessary to circumcise them and to charge them to keep the law of Moses. And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter. And when much discussion had taken place, Peter rose up and said to them, Men, brothers, you know that from the early days God chose from among you that through my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. And God, the Knower of hearts, bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit even as also to us; and He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith. Therefore why are you now testing God by placing a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus we are saved in the same way also as they are. And all the multitude became silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul relating all the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. And when they finished speaking, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, listen to me. Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles to take out from them a people for His name. And with this the words of the prophets agree, even as it is written, &ldquo;After these things I will return, and I will rebuild the tabernacle of David which has fallen; and I will rebuild its ruins and erect it again, so that the remainder of men may seek out the Lord, even all the Gentiles upon whom My name has been called, says the Lord, who is making these things known from of old.&rdquo; Therefore I judge that we do not harass those from the Gentiles who are turning to God, but that we write to them to abstain from the contaminations of idols and fornication and what is strangled and blood. For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who proclaim him in the synagogues, he being read every Sabbath. It then seemed good to the apostles and the elders with the whole church to choose men from among them to send to Antioch together with Paul and Barnabas: Judas, who is called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers, writing to them and sending by their hand the following: The apostles and the elder brothers, to the brothers throughout Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are of the Gentiles, rejoice. Since we have heard that certain ones who went out from among us have troubled you with their words, unsettling your souls, to whom we gave no instruction, it seemed good to us, having become of one accord, to choose men to send to you together with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will report the same things by word of mouth. For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: to abstain from things that have been sacrificed to idols and blood and things strangled and fornication, from which if you carefully keep yourselves, you will do well. May you be strong. So when they had been sent away, they went down to Antioch; and when they had gathered the multitude together, they handed them the letter. And when they read it, they rejoiced at the encouragement. And Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, exhorted the brothers through much speaking and confirmed them. And when they had spent some time there, they were sent away with peace from the brothers to those who had sent them. But it seemed good to Silas to remain there. And Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and announcing the word of the Lord as the gospel with many others also.</p><h2 class="head1">THERE BEING NO HEAD CHURCH</h2>
<p>Acts 15 reveals a few basic principles in God&rsquo;s administration. First, the record in this chapter shows us that in the early days among the churches there was no head church. Many Christians believe that Jerusalem was the early headquarters of the church, controlling and giving orders to the other churches. However, in Acts 15 we can see that this was not so because the decision was not made by the church in Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NO LOCAL CHURCH MAKING DECISIONS AFFECTING THE OTHER CHURCHES WITHOUT FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>The second principle revealed in Acts 15 is that no church should make a decision by itself. The problem arose in the church at Antioch when some came and taught that the Gentile believers had to be circumcised according to the Old Testament law. This was absolutely against the truth of the gospel. Because Paul, who was the apostle to the Gentiles, and Barnabas could not tolerate this false teaching, they brought about much &ldquo;dissension and discussion&rdquo; (v. 2). However, neither they nor the church in Antioch made a decision concerning this matter, because they did not assume that they had the authority to do so. Paul did not presume that he was a king to make the final decision or give orders to others.</p>
<p>Paul, Peter, and James were among those who gathered in Jerusalem. These ones are considered to be great names in church history. However, according to Acts 15, they conducted themselves merely as brothers. Peter and James addressed the others as &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; (vv. 7, 13). This indicates that they did not presume that they had a higher position than others. We need to read Acts 15 several times in order to get into the spirit of this chapter and see what kind of atmosphere there was at that time. The atmosphere indicates that there was no human authority or head.</p>
<p>As a principle in God&rsquo;s administration, no single local church should presume to make a decision regarding the truth or in other matters affecting the other churches without fellowship. Accordingly, the church at Antioch sent Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem. Although Paul and Barnabas were apostles, they did not decide to go on their own. Instead, they were directed to go by the brothers (v. 2). This word is repeated in verse 3, which says, &ldquo;Having been sent forward by the church.&rdquo; Paul and Barnabas being sent forward by the church indicates that the church was higher than they were. At most, they were representatives of the church. Not only were Paul and Barnabas sent, but &ldquo;certain others&rdquo; were sent also (v. 2). This indicates that Paul and Barnabas were not &ldquo;kings.&rdquo; The record in Acts 15 shows that no human being presumed to be a head or authority above others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLES AND THE ELDERS REPRESENTING<br />
THE CHURCH AND THE CHURCHES</h2>
<p>The third principle revealed in Acts 15 is that not only the apostles but also the elders represented the churches. This chapter describes a conference of apostles and elders. No one attended the conference as a prophet because the prophets do not represent the churches. The apostles and the elders were included because in God&rsquo;s administration the apostles represent the universal church, and the elders represent their respective local churches.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONFERENCE IN ACTS 15 INCLUDING<br />
MUCH DISCUSSION, TESTIMONIES,<br />
AND CONFIRMATION FROM THE WORD</h2>
<p>The fourth principle revealed in Acts 15 concerns the head of a conference of apostles and elders. It is difficult to say who was presiding over this conference. It seems that James gave the concluding, deciding word, but no one gave an opening word. Verse 7 shows that this conference opened with &ldquo;much discussion.&rdquo; We do not know who began the discussion, but it must have lasted a long time. After the discussion Peter rose up and spoke regarding his experience. No one can argue with history. Peter told the brothers what he had seen and personally experienced. There was no disagreement that God had visited and saved many Gentiles. In verse 9 Peter said that God made no distinction between the Jews and the Gentiles and that because God had cleansed the Gentiles&rsquo; hearts by faith, there was no need for them to be circumcised. After Peter&rsquo;s testimony the others were silent because they were convinced (v. 12a).</p>
<p>Verse 12b says, &ldquo;They listened to Barnabas and Paul relating all the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.&rdquo; When Paul and Barnabas are mentioned in chapter 15, sometimes Paul is listed first, but other times Barnabas is listed first. In verse 12 Barnabas is first. There is some significance here. It appears that there is a shift in Acts 13. In the first part of chapter 13 and earlier, Barnabas&rsquo;s name is always recorded first (11:30; 12:25; 13:2, 7). Then in the middle of chapter 13 Paul begins to be mentioned first (13:42-43, 46, 50; 15:2, 22). However, this does not mean that after Acts 13 Paul always took the lead (14:14). Acts 15 twice mentions Barnabas first in important circumstances (vv. 12, 25). In inspiring the writing of the Holy Scriptures, the Spirit indicated that there is no fixed leadership. One brother takes the lead today, but another brother may take the lead tomorrow. We must see that Paul was not always the leading one.</p>
<p>Barnabas and Paul also testified according to their personal history and experience, telling the others how God had done signs and wonders among the Gentiles through them, and then held their peace. After the testimonies of Peter, Barnabas, and Paul, the whole company was silenced. It is possible to argue concerning doctrines, opinions, and ideas, but no one can argue with historical facts. Therefore, there was no more discussion. However, they did not make a decision by voting. Instead, James said, &ldquo;Men, brothers, listen to me. Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles to take out from them a people for His name. And with this the words of the prophets agree&rdquo; (vv. 13-15). Then he quoted some prophecies from the Old Testament to show that what Peter, Barnabas, and Paul had testified agreed with the word of the prophets. After much discussion and a few testimonies, James, a brother who knew the Scriptures, quoted from God&rsquo;s Word to confirm the testimonies.</p>
<p>The account in Acts 15 is quite valuable because it allows us to see that there was discussion among the early apostles and elders. It is wrong to think that we need to avoid discussion in order to be spiritual. Only when a king is present can there be no discussion. Every meeting of the elders should include much discussion. This is scriptural. We should discuss, but no one should insist on anything. We need to be fully open. No one should merely be a yes-man, agreeing with whatever is said regardless of his true feeling, because we all have been born again, love the Lord, and have Christ living within us. We also have a spirit and can exercise discernment. Much discussion took place in the presence of Peter, James, and Paul. These three were not kings, because their presence did not silence the others. The kingship was fully preserved for God. The only King is God, and we are all His subjects. We should never say that no one else should speak when a certain brother is present. This is a wrong concept and an insult to the headship of Christ.</p>
<p>The conference in Acts 15 progressed from discussion to testimonies and then to confirmation from God&rsquo;s Word. This is the right way in God&rsquo;s administration to reach a decision regarding problems among the churches. There should be no human authority. After James quoted the Word of God, he must have received authorization from the Lord, because he boldly said, &ldquo;Therefore I judge that we do not harass those from the Gentiles who are turning to God&rdquo; (v. 19). James received and transmitted the King&rsquo;s decree.</p>
<p>This also shows us that we should not make decisions according to our experience alone. There must be confirmation from the holy Word. Any experience that cannot be confirmed by the Word should not be a deciding factor. The final factor of any decision must be the holy Word. Peter did not have the boldness to make a decision based solely on his experience, nor did Barnabas or Paul. Only after hearing the testimonies and finding confirmation in the Word of God did James utter a judgment. The authority was not with James but with the word he quoted from the Holy Scriptures. Because James found confirmation in the Word, he did not make a humble suggestion but spoke with authority. We can see the wisdom of James in his closing word. The judgment he spoke was according to the holy Word and corresponded with the testimonies of the experienced ones. This decision covered all the necessary aspects and met all the needs. We need to learn all these things.</p>
<p>Verse 22 says, &ldquo;It then seemed good to the apostles and the elders with the whole church.&rdquo; This wonderful record shows that although the conference was a gathering of apostles and elders, the decision was made with the whole church. The apostles and the elders considered that what they decided should be acceptable to the whole church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HOLY SPIRIT PRESIDING OVER THE CONFERENCE</h2>
<p>Verse 28 says, &ldquo;It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things.&rdquo; This shows that it was the Holy Spirit who was presiding over the conference. The decision was made by this presiding One, the Holy Spirit as the presence of the King. However, just as the apostles and elders made the decision with the church, so also the Holy Spirit made the decision with the apostles and elders. This is the right way. We must have the assurance that every decision in the church is made by the Holy Spirit with us.</p>
<p>We need to learn from this example. The fellowship of the apostles and elders should be open to all the saints and all the churches. Nothing should be hidden. Only false ones try to conceal what they are doing and are afraid to have fellowship. Every elder should feel free to open any matter in fellowship. The church must be crystal clear, transparent. The elders must learn to keep everything open, allowing the brothers to discuss everything. We should not hide or conceal anything. This principle applies not only to the elders but also to the local churches. No church should conceal anything from the other churches. A church should never do something secretly for fear that the other churches would not agree with it. The elders in a local church should present the major problems they are facing to the elders of the other churches to seek their feeling. Discussion is necessary because it helps us to find the truth and receive the light.</p>
<p>Nothing should be hidden or concealed among the churches because no church has the authority by itself to make decisions affecting the other churches. The church in Antioch did not claim to have the authority to make the decision because Paul was there. To do so would have made Paul the king, but there was no human king. We must learn this. We cannot say that a particular local church can make a decision affecting the other churches without fellowship. Of course, the local elders can make decisions concerning the local administration, but even locally no elder can make a decision by himself or rule over the other elders. Everything that a local church does must be made open to all the elders. The elders should discuss everything. We must keep this principle. No elder should think that he can give orders to the other elders because he is more capable than they are. To do so would make him a king and thereby insult the headship of Christ. An elder should simply present a matter in an open way to all the other elders. There should be much discussion, testimonies regarding the historical facts, and confirmation from the holy Word. This way allows the indwelling Spirit to speak to us. As a result, whatever the eventual decision may be, we will have the full assurance that it seems good to the Holy Spirit and to us (v. 28).</p>
<h2 class="head1">HONORING THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>There is no earthly king among us because our king is Christ our Head. If we keep this principle, we will have the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. When the church is normal, the blessing comes. We all must honor the headship of Christ so that He will bestow His blessing on us.</p>
<p>The wonderful, unique record in Acts 15 shows us the proper headship and leadership. All the apostles and elders, including Peter, James, and Paul, honored the headship of Christ. None of these &ldquo;great&rdquo; men dared to assume or presume anything. In all that they said and did, each one conducted himself not as a leader or head but as a brother. Similarly, no local church considered itself to be higher than others. After the church in Antioch sent Paul, Barnabas, and others to Jerusalem to resolve the problem, the church in Jerusalem wrote a warm letter to Antioch. Acts 15:23 says, &ldquo;Writing to them and sending by their hand the following: The apostles and the elder brothers, to the brothers throughout Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are of the Gentiles, rejoice.&rdquo; This letter shows no signs that the church in Jerusalem considered itself to be higher than the other churches. All the churches were equal in the one Body.</p>
<p>The record in Acts 15 is beautiful because it shows that among the saints and among the churches, there was only one Head. There was no human headship, leadership, or presumption. We all must learn not to assume or presume anything. We must conduct ourselves as brothers, allowing the Holy Spirit to speak to us. In this way we honor the headship of Christ and can have the full assurance that the blessing will be transmitted from the Head to the Body.</p>
<p>This is not only a matter of doctrine but also of truth and light. We must learn the truth and be enlightened so that we may see the real situation. All the churches, co-workers, elders, and saints should keep these principles, not daring to assume or presume to be anything but honoring the headship of Christ, the unique King, who is present as the Holy Spirit. We must be open to Him.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit made the decision in Acts 15 in the principle of incarnation&mdash;in and with humanity. The principle of incarnation can be seen throughout the chapter. The decision was apparently made by the apostles and elders, but it was actually made by the Holy Spirit with them. This is the principle of incarnation. We need to learn to discuss, testify concerning the historical facts, and find the confirmation in the Word. Then the Holy Spirit will guide us to the proper decision. This is the proper way to maintain God&rsquo;s administration while honoring and respecting the unique headship of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">FURTHER FELLOWSHIP<br />
CONCERNING PROPER DISCUSSION</h2>
<p>We must learn not to hide anything or do anything independently but to open everything for discussion. However, we also must learn to discuss without losing our temper. This is not easy. In the early years of my service in the church, I learned much concerning this point. For the first few years that I served, I did not say much in the way of discussion because I did not have the assurance that I could control my temper. I knew that I should participate in the discussions, but I also realized that I was not qualified, because my temper was not dealt with. I repented to the Lord for not being purified from my temper so that I could be used by Him. I also confessed to the brothers the reason for my silence. Eventually, I learned to discuss without losing my temper.</p>
<p>We should not insist when we are in a discussion with the brothers. To insist is a sign that we are ruled by our temper. Acts 15 records that there was much discussion, but we also know that there was no insisting, because verse 25 says that they became of one accord. To avoid insisting is not easy. As long as we are natural, have a temper, and are in our self, we will insist on our opinion. To discuss in a proper way is quite difficult; it requires many lessons of the cross. If we do not learn these lessons, our discussions will become battles. Nevertheless, we need to have much discussion. We should not excuse our silence by saying that we want to keep the oneness when actually we dare not speak because we are weak in the spirit and not yet free from our temper.</p>
<p>The apostles and elders in Acts 15 had all learned much through many spiritual experiences. Therefore, they were qualified to participate in the discussion, and they did so without losing their temper. Because they discussed without insisting, they were able to accept the final decision even if the decision went against their initial opinion. It is not easy to not be offended when what we say in a discussion is set aside. Nevertheless, we must learn to discuss without losing our temper, insisting, or being offended. In the affairs of government, people often play politics in order to avoid offending others or to save face. However, in Acts 15 there was no offending, no saving of face, and no playing of politics. The brothers were open and genuine.</p>
<p>It is quite difficult to put the normal and proper principles in Acts 15 into practice. In order to perform an operation, a surgeon must be qualified, and he and his instruments must be sterilized, purified; otherwise, he will introduce germs into his patient and make the patient sicker. Similarly, in order to participate in the fellowship of the co-workers and elders, we must be qualified and purified. When we try to put the principles in Acts 15 into practice, we will find that we are not qualified or prepared if we have not learned the lessons of the cross and have not been purified or thoroughly dealt with. Our participation in a discussion will become a problem. If we are offended in a discussion, this indicates that we are in the flesh. If we are not in the flesh, we will not care to save our face or be concerned about whether others respect us. To be overly concerned about politeness is actually to play politics for the sake of the flesh, but the flesh has no place in the meetings of the co-workers and elders. The example of Acts 15 can be practiced only by those who have learned the lessons of the cross. Because the early apostles and elders had adequately learned the lessons of the cross, they were qualified to have such a discussion. They participated in the discussion because they felt that they had something to say, but they did so without insisting or losing their temper. As a result, their discussion ended not in offense but in one accord (v. 25). Therefore, especially among the co-workers and elders there is the need to learn many lessons of the cross.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE ELDERS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 3:1-7</h1>
<p>First Timothy 3:1-7 says,</p>
<p class="indent1">Faithful is the word: If anyone aspires to the overseership, he desires a good work. The overseer then must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, of a sober mind, orderly, hospitable, apt to teach; not an excessive drinker; not a striker, but gentle; not contentious; not fond of money; one who manages well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity (but if one does not know how to manage his own house, how will he care for the church of God?); not a new convert, lest being blinded with pride he fall into the judgment suffered by the devil. And he also must have a good testimony from those outside, that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</p>
<p class="indent1">The qualifications of the elders are not mentioned in the Bible until the time of Paul&rsquo;s later ministry. First Timothy was written about A.D. 65. We need to consider why Paul did not write concerning the qualifications of the elders before this time. Acts 14:23 records that in Paul&rsquo;s first journey he appointed elders in local churches not long after the churches were raised up through his ministry. This record is brief and does not say anything about the qualifications of the elders. It was not until much later that he gave a thorough description of the qualifications of the elders. Peter also wrote concerning the elders later in his ministry (1 Pet. 5:1-4). The writings of Paul and Peter concerning the eldership were certainly based on their experiences and observations over many years. They learned from the situations they saw and passed through. Because of all that they had seen, they realized what the qualifications of the elders should be. Such specific qualifications could be identified only after adequate experience and observation.</p>
</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ELDERSHIP DEPENDING NOT MAINLY<br />
ON ABILITY OR GIFT BUT ON LIFE</h2>
<p>We must note that in the writings of both Paul and Peter very little is said concerning the abilities of the elders. First Timothy 3:2 says that an elder must be &ldquo;apt to teach,&rdquo; yet the word <em>apt</em> does not indicate ability but habit. Parents may not have much ability in teaching, but they should nevertheless be apt to teach their children at home. The elders similarly must be apt to care for the saints&rsquo; learning. According to Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Timothy 3:1-7, eldership is not a matter of gift or ability but a matter of life. This does not mean that the elders can be without ability. However, throughout church history and even in our recent past, the problems in the eldership have been not mainly matters of ability or gift but matters of life.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes of the start of a basketball game, it is possible to assess the players&rsquo; abilities. Similarly, it is possible to know a person&rsquo;s spiritual abilities or gifts in a short time. To know a brother&rsquo;s eloquence, we only have to listen to him speak for a few minutes. However, to know a person in life takes time. In Paul&rsquo;s later ministry he did not appoint elders immediately after establishing a church but left this matter to his co-workers (Titus 1:5). Perhaps this was because he found that it was unsafe to appoint a brother to be an elder before the necessary time had passed to know him in life.</p>
<p>It takes more than a few months to truly know a person because it takes time for a person&rsquo;s real condition in life to be exposed. Someone may pretend to be patient, humble, and not ambitious for a few months, but it is difficult to pretend for more than a year. Within a year a person&rsquo;s condition in life will be exposed through his manner and conduct. It is not safe or proper to decide quickly whether a brother is an elder. We must allow a longer time to see the brother&rsquo;s real situation in life. According to our experience, to know someone in life requires at least a year of regular contact.</p>
<p>To know a person, we need not only time but also different circumstances and situations. If within a year there has not been a situation that tempts a brother&rsquo;s ambition, it may remain hidden until such a situation arises. Time alone does not expose people adequately. Time plus environments expose a person. For this reason, we should wait at least a year before we decide whether a brother is an elder. It is better if we can wait even longer.</p>
<p>Companies, schools, hospitals, and other organizations care much for the abilities of their workers, but Paul does not mention anything concerning gifts or ability among the many qualifications of the elders he lists. The problems in the eldership are not related to ability, skill, or gift but are matters of life. What we can do does not mean much; instead, we should consider what we are. Only what we are in life counts for the eldership. To be an elder is not a matter of ability or gift but a matter of life, a matter of what we are.</p><h2 class="head1">AN ELDER BEING AN OVERSEER</h2>
<p>Paul does not use the word <em>elder</em> in 1 Timothy 3:1-7. Instead, he uses the word <em>overseer,</em> which in Greek is <em>episkopos.</em> This word is sometimes translated &ldquo;bishop.&rdquo; However, the word <em>bishop</em> has been misused to describe a hierarchical position. An elder is an overseer (Acts 20:17, 28). Humanly speaking, to be such an overseer requires some ability, but Paul instead emphasizes character, disposition, conduct, and being. In order to be an overseer in the church, a brother must be the right kind of person, not in what he can do but in what he is. This means that a brother must be right in life before he can be a proper overseer in the church.</p>
<p>According to human history and our own experiences, we know that in most situations what we can or cannot do does not mean as much as what we are or are not. The condition of people&rsquo;s family life is not determined by their ability as much as by their character, disposition, conduct, and being. We should not be concerned about how much we can or cannot do. We should not be proud of our ability, nor should we be disappointed in our inability. We need only to be the right person in disposition, character, conduct, and being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOLY ASPIRATION TO THE OVERSEERSHIP</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 3:1 Paul writes, &ldquo;Faithful is the word: If anyone aspires to the overseership, he desires a good work.&rdquo; To aspire does not mean to be ambitious. A man can aspire to be a good father, but this does not mean that he is ambitious. The church needs many brothers to aspire to the overseership. Not every brother with this aspiration will become an elder, but the church will have a wonderful future.</p>
<p>The elders need to speak to the brothers in their localities to stir up their aspiration to be elders. If an elder is afraid of others&rsquo; aspiration, this may indicate that he is trying to hold on to his personal kingdom. If we do not want our own kingdom, we will stir up the aspiration in others to be elders. We will like to see many in the younger generation aspiring to be elders. Such aspiration is very good, but we condemn ambition. To have the ambition to be a great leader is devilish (cf. Isa. 14:12-15).</p>
<p>Paul begins 1 Timothy 3:1 by writing, &ldquo;Faithful is the word.&rdquo; This probably indicates that the second part of the verse was a well-known saying among the churches at that time, and Paul was confirming the saying. Ambition and competition should be condemned, but we need to stir up in the saints a holy aspiration for the Lord&rsquo;s interests and the spreading of the church. Because we desire that the churches would spread, and every church needs elders, many young brothers should pray, &ldquo;Lord, if it is Your will, I would like to be one of the elders to take care of Your testimony in a locality.&rdquo; This is not ambition. If circumstances never allow a brother to be an elder, he should not be dissatisfied. There should be no ambition or competition but a proper, holy aspiration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE ELDERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;Without Reproach&rdquo;</h2>
<p>After confirming that the overseership is a good work in verse 1, Paul goes on to give certain requirements of the overseers, which are qualifications of the elders. Verse 2 says, &ldquo;The overseer then must be without reproach.&rdquo; To be without reproach does not mean to be perfect or blameless in the eyes of God; rather, it means to be irreproachable in the eyes of man. None of us are perfect or blameless in the eyes of God, but the elders must be without reproach before man. This qualification implies that we must be very careful and considerate in speaking, acting, contacting people, and handling matters so that others will not have cause to reproach us. If we do these things carelessly, we may become reproachable in others&rsquo; eyes. What we say and do may be right but still cause others to think poorly of us. Therefore, this qualification implies not blamelessness but carefulness in all that we say and do. This first requirement seems to cover all the following requirements. If a brother is without reproach, he should also meet all the other qualifications as well.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;The Husband of One Wife&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The second qualification is &ldquo;the husband of one wife&rdquo; (v. 2). The matter of marriage indicates much about a person. To be the husband of one wife indicates that a brother has self-control. Anyone who has more than one wife cannot or does not bridle his lust. Such a person cannot be an overseer. Lust is very much related to temper. If someone can control his temper, he is more likely to be able to bridle his lust. An overseer must be one who can control himself. If a brother cannot control his temper and his lust, he cannot be an overseer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;Temperate, of a Sober Mind&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The third qualification of an overseer is &ldquo;temperate&rdquo; (v. 2). The word <em>temperate</em> denotes &ldquo;moderate, not going to extremes, balanced, and self-controlled.&rdquo; In other words, an overseer must be just right&mdash;not too quick or too slow, not too high or too low, not laughing excessively or weeping excessively. An overseer has to balance himself. When he hates, he also has to love. If someone often goes to extremes, he cannot be irreproachable. Thus, being without reproach, which is the first qualification, includes being temperate.</p>
<p>The following qualification is &ldquo;of a sober mind&rdquo; (v. 2). <em>Temperate</em> and <em>sober</em> are very close in meaning. However, to be sober is mainly a matter of the mind, and to be temperate is a matter of the emotion and will. In order to be temperate, we cannot allow our likes and dislikes to direct our behavior. An elder must be without strong preferences. Our emotion affects our will. A person who likes to talk will decide to talk. If a person does not like to talk, he decides not to talk. Our likes and dislikes affect our decisions. Thus, an elder must be temperate in his emotion and will.</p>
<p>An elder must be of a sober mind. Most people&rsquo;s minds are not sober. They are often confused, complicated, and sometimes peculiar or strange. To be of a sober mind means to think clearly and have a pure and clear discernment. In reading the Bible some believers do not see the proper light but instead pick up peculiar thoughts. For instance, to practice leg lengthening is to not be soberminded. In 1968 a dear brother with whom I stayed for a short time told me, &ldquo;Recently, there was news that creatures have come from other planets, and someone in this area has spoken with them.&rdquo; To heed such rumors is to not be soberminded. Sometimes we are all like this. Rumors spread easily among the saints when they do not have a sober mind to discern what they hear. We especially should not listen to those who speak negatively about the church.</p>
<p>Few Christians today are able to receive light from the Bible because their minds are not sober and are quite complicated. In order to receive light from the Word of God, a mind must be pure, clean, and straight, without any peculiar thinking. In order to be an overseer in a local church, a brother needs such a mind so that he can accurately understand the situation of the church and of individual saints. The overseers&rsquo; thinking must be practical, based in reality, pure, clean, and straight, because they are responsible for keeping strange, polluted, and damaging things out of the church. The church will be protected if the overseers have a sober mind to discern and see through such things. Moreover, if a brother is soberminded, he will also be temperate. In order to be without reproach in all that he says and does, an overseer must be temperate and soberminded.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE ELDERS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 3:1-7</h1>
<h2 class="head1">FURTHER QUALIFICATIONS OF THE ELDERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;Orderly&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The fifth qualification of an elder in 1 Timothy 3:1-7 is &ldquo;orderly&rdquo; (v. 2). To be orderly, or decorous, is to have behavior that always fits the situation. It is to be neither too fast nor too slow, neither too bold nor too timid. A decorous person is one who always does what is fitting. One who is decorous talks when talk is necessary and is silent when silence is required. He can also laugh when laughter is appropriate.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;Hospitable&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The sixth qualification is to be hospitable (v. 2). The elders need to realize that serving the saints as overseers and shepherds requires much time because human life is full of turmoil. In times of fellowship the saints may tell the elders the entire history of their married life or family life. Out of politeness, the saints may say, &ldquo;I am sorry to occupy so much of your time. Do you still have some time?&rdquo; In order to avoid offending the saints, the elder must reply, &ldquo;It is okay&mdash;I have plenty of time.&rdquo; An elder may think that listening to a brother&rsquo;s story is not very important, but to the brother it may be a lifeline because he thinks that there is no one besides the Lord Himself to whom he can tell his story. Many saints feel this way. We have to realize that human life is like a turbulent sea&mdash;there is much turmoil and little rest.</p>
<p>The elders also must realize that most Christians are weak&mdash;weak in their soul and even weaker in their spirit. Therefore, the elders need to help them to find rest by listening to their stories. If we can give them an hour or two so that they can release all that is on their heart, that will be a rest to them. We may not be able to solve their problems, but we can give them rest because they trust and respect us as elders. The saints find rest by telling the elders things that they cannot tell others. This is sovereignly ordained by God. As elders, we should not reject the saints who come to us for fellowship. It does not matter whether we can solve their problems. Actually, we cannot solve anyone&rsquo;s problem, but we can provide rest for the saints by listening to their stories. I have seen this happen many times. We must be willing to give the saints enough time to relate everything. Moreover, just as an on-call physician must be available to provide medical care at any time, an elder must always be available to help the saints. This is part of what it means to be hospitable. Whatever the saints need, we have to give them. This indicates that to be an elder is a very difficult job.</p>
<p>The need to be hospitable is a severe test to the elders. It tests whether we love the members of the church and are compassionate, patient, and willing to be a sacrifice. We must sacrifice our time, our rest, and our material possessions. According to my experience and observation, no other qualification of the elders tests us as much. The sisters who want their husbands to become elders need to know that to be the wife of an elder is difficult because an overseer must be hospitable. A brother who needs to go somewhere may ask an elder for directions to the place. After the elder gives him directions, the brother may confess that he does not have a car or the money to hire a taxi. In order to be hospitable, the elder should then use his car to drive the brother where he needs to go. Even after explaining the location of the place and different ways to get there, if the elder will not take the brother himself, the brother may feel that the elder does not care for him. This kind of feeling among the saints may eventually lead to problems. It is difficult to imagine all the situations a brother will face as an elder. The elders must be willing to help the saints in all kinds of situations.</p>
<p>Being hospitable, which is an endless job, is a matter not of ability but of willingness. If the elder does not know how to find the place where a brother needs to go, he should still drive the brother to look for the place. If he does, the brother will be greatly touched and edified by the elder&rsquo;s love. An elder may not be able to touch a brother&rsquo;s heart by giving several messages, but by giving his time and effort, the elder will touch the brother&rsquo;s heart with his love. To be hospitable is to be willing to give and be troubled, bothered, and exhausted in order to take care of others. Regardless of our knowledge or ability, we must be willing. This is the highest test.</p><h2 class="head2">&ldquo;Apt to Teach&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The next qualification of the elders is to be &ldquo;apt to teach&rdquo; (v. 2). The word <em>apt</em> means &ldquo;tending, inclined, likely.&rdquo; An overseer should be able to teach, but the point here is that he must be willing to teach. This kind of teaching is not like that of schoolteachers but like parents&rsquo; teaching in the home. Schoolteachers teach students in schools because it is their job, but parents&rsquo; teaching of their children at home should be a habit in their living. If we have children, we should not only love our children but also have a habit to teach and instruct them. We should not merely command our children to do their homework but should instead offer our help. This is what it means to be apt to teach. The elders must have the habit and the willingness to teach the saints. An elder&rsquo;s gift or ability to teach is of secondary importance; primarily, he must be concerned for the saints&rsquo; learning and build up a willingness and a habit to teach the saints.</p>
<p>Being apt to teach is another test of our genuine concern for the church and the saints. It is also a test of how much patience we have. Even if an elder has great ability, he must also be patient in order to properly teach the saints. It is not adequate to give messages; we must be willing to sit with a brother for several hours to help him see some crucial aspect of the truth. Although this will exhaust us and test us, it should not be something that we merely tolerate but something that we are inclined to do. Many saints in the church require individual help in learning the truth. With the phrase <em>apt to teach</em> the apostle Paul indicates that an overseer must have the concern, the willingness, and the habit to teach.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;Not an Excessive Drinker&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The first qualification in verse 3 is &ldquo;not an excessive drinker.&rdquo; Like &ldquo;temperate&rdquo; and &ldquo;of a sober mind,&rdquo; this is a matter of self-control. Some may argue that according to the wording here, the elders may drink but not excessively. However, it is quite difficult for people to control themselves once they begin drinking. Therefore, in order to control ourselves, it is best not to drink at all. In this matter we must control ourselves to the uttermost.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;Not a Striker, but Gentle&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The next item in verse 3 is &ldquo;not a striker, but gentle.&rdquo; This is related to the preceding qualification because many who drink excessively are strikers. When people are drinking, they cannot control their temper. The basic thought here is that we need to be calm and cool. Because drinking agitates and excites our temper, we should not drink. If we are calm, we will not quarrel or be a striker. To be gentle, or mild, is to be agreeable and flexible in every situation. According to Paul&rsquo;s word, to be an overseer is very difficult.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;Not Contentious&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Verse 3 then says, &ldquo;Not contentious.&rdquo; To be contentious is to be quarrelsome. Not only should we not be a striker, but we should not even be quarrelsome. All these items indicate that an overseer must be very self-controlled, mild, and moderate. An overseer should never lose his temper. The elders cannot contend or fight with other saints but must be lenient and flexible with everyone in every situation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;Not Fond of Money&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Lastly, verse 3 says, &ldquo;Not fond of money.&rdquo; To be greedy is a matter of lust. Every lust needs to be controlled, bridled. To not be fond of money is to bridle our lust for money. Everyone has this lust, but an overseer must learn how to control it. The lust in our flesh is expressed mainly in sex, temper, and greed, or covetousness. These three areas are dealt with in the apostle&rsquo;s charge: to be the husband of one wife is to control sexual lust; to be temperate, not a striker, and not contentious but gentle is to control our temper; and to not be fond of money is to bridle our lust for money. Most of the qualifications of the elders in these verses are related to controlling these three kinds of lust. An elder must be one who exercises strict control in these three things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE QUALIFICATIONS IN 1 TIMOTHY 3:1-7<br />
ACTUALLY BEING A REVELATION<br />
OF WHAT THE RESURRECTION LIFE<br />
OF THE INDWELLING CHRIST CAN DO IN US</h2>
<p>The self-control that is required of an overseer is altogether a matter of life. As elders we must live a life that has been dealt with by the cross of Christ so that the resurrection power will enable us to exercise such self-control. We should not say that no one can meet these requirements. If no one could make it, the apostle Paul would not have written it, nor would it be included in the Bible. These qualifications are not a kind of law or commandment; instead, they show us what the Lord can do within us. This is like the constitution of the kingdom in Matthew 5&mdash;7, which not only indicates what the kingdom requires but also proves and testifies how much the resurrection life can do within us. We believe God&rsquo;s living Word. Whatever the Lord says will come to pass. Hence, we need to trust in His Word, receive it, and pray. We should not be disappointed by our apparent shortcomings. Instead, we should be encouraged that because the Word includes these qualifications, the resurrection life will produce them in us.</p>
<p>We should not isolate 1 Timothy 3:1-7 from the rest of the Epistle, which reveals the eternal life, God&rsquo;s economy, which is His dispensing, and the manifestation of God in the flesh (6:12, 19; 1:4; 3:16). Thus, 1 Timothy 3:1-7 is actually a revelation of how much the resurrection life of the indwelling Christ can do in us. By ourselves we cannot meet these requirements, but the indwelling Christ can certainly meet them. However, we must be willing to cooperate with Him. Our flesh, old man, and natural life have been crucified on the cross, and it is now Christ who lives in us (Gal. 2:20). We need to cooperate with Him by having a desire and a willingness and by praying much. If we wait on the Lord, He will work out all these things from within us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE ELDERS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 3:1-7</h1>
<h2 class="head1">FURTHER QUALIFICATIONS OF THE ELDERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;One Who Manages Well His Own House&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 3:1-7 the apostle Paul writes concerning the requirements of the overseers, which are the qualifications of the elders. Verses 2 and 3 concern mostly virtues and proper conduct, or the manifestation and expression of what the elders are in life. In verses 4 through 7 Paul addresses the elders&rsquo; human relationships. Every human being has human relationships. We have a family, and we live in a community. An overseer in the church must take care to have proper relationships with others.</p>
<p>The first kind of relationships in human life is family relationships. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;One who manages well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity.&rdquo; Managing one&rsquo;s house is a matter of taking the lead, but Paul&rsquo;s concept here is not mainly related to authority. As a husband and father, an overseer should take the lead in his family not merely by ruling but by establishing a good example and pattern. A family is not like a government or an organization, which are led by authority. A father&rsquo;s leadership in his family should not mainly be based on his ruling with authority but should instead be based on the pattern of his daily living. Similarly, to be an elder does not mean to rule the church with authority. This concept is absolutely wrong. A father&rsquo;s management of his family is very different from a supervisor&rsquo;s management of a business. A supervisor may hire and fire employees, but a father cannot hire or fire his children. The basic need in a family is the father&rsquo;s example. As a father, an elder must live properly before his family. This is the proper way to manage one&rsquo;s house. In our home we should not try to exercise our authority as a king, law officer, administrator, or school principal. Paul&rsquo;s concept in this section concerns the overseers&rsquo; daily living. It does not work to merely discipline our children. God&rsquo;s ordained principle is that a father must live a life that is a pattern, an example, to his children.</p>
<p>As overseers, we must take the lead in our family by presenting a pattern in our living. This is our duty. However, if our children are in subjection with all gravity, we should not think that it is because of our doing; instead, we have to worship the Lord for His mercy. Although the disposition of our children is not under our control, this does not mean we can neglect our duties to live as an example and to spend as much time and energy as we can on our children. Nevertheless, we must realize that the way our children turn out ultimately depends on the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. We know that this is true, because if two children are siblings and are raised by the same parents with the same care, they may still turn out very different. One may have a good character and become a seeking believer, while the other may have a poor character and not even be saved. Therefore, we must do our duty to live a proper life as an example to our children, but we should not be discouraged or proud because of how our children turn out.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s word concerning an overseer&rsquo;s children in verse 4 does not involve salvation or spirituality. We should be a good example to our children, but whether or not they will eventually be saved depends on God&rsquo;s predestination. Jacob and Esau were twins, but Romans 9:10-13 shows that their destiny depended on God&rsquo;s selection. We cannot cause our children or anyone else to be spiritual, but we can establish an example by living a sober, temperate, and orderly life and by seeking the Lord. If two flesh brothers listen to the same gospel message, one may be saved, but the other may not. We have seen cases like this. Therefore, we must be zealous in preaching the gospel and convincing people to receive the Lord, but we must also realize that a person&rsquo;s salvation ultimately depends not on our effort but on God&rsquo;s predestination. We should not think that because it depends on God&rsquo;s predestination, we do not need to preach the gospel. We must do our duty. Similarly, we should not assume that our children will behave well if we are a good example, nor should we neglect our duty. The best and most proper way to be a parent is to live as an example to our children and pray for the Lord&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<p>If our living establishes a proper standard, we are not liable if our children behave badly. However, if we do not live as a pattern, our children&rsquo;s bad behavior is our responsibility. If they are good, the credit does not go to us, but if they are bad, we receive the &ldquo;debit.&rdquo; This is the divine accounting. We should not say that God is not fair. Romans 9:20 says, &ldquo;O man, who are you who answer back to God? Shall the thing molded say to him who molded it, Why did you make me thus?&rdquo; We cannot argue with God. If our children behave well and are eventually saved and live before the Lord, we must worship the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I am nothing. Even my best behavior is like dust; it means nothing. I can only thank You for Your mercy.&rdquo; We should not ascribe anything to our goodness. We have to acknowledge God&rsquo;s predestination, His mercy, and His grace. If our children begin to live sinfully, we must humble ourselves, praying, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me. I accept the blame because I may have neglected to adequately care for them in some aspect.&rdquo; This must be our attitude.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s concept in 1 Timothy 3:1-7 concerns the overseers&rsquo; living. Whether our children behave well is secondary; the primary matter is whether we have a proper living. We must take the lead and manage our family well by having a living that presents a positive pattern to them. This depends on what we are; it is a matter of life.</p>
<p>Verse 5 says, &ldquo;If one does not know how to manage his own house, how will he care for the church of God?&rdquo; This indicates that the way for an elder to care for the church is also to be an example. This principle corresponds with Peter&rsquo;s teaching. In 1 Peter 5:3 he wrote to the elders, &ldquo;Nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock.&rdquo; If we cannot be a good example to our children, we cannot be a good example in the church. Paul&rsquo;s basic concept is that the elders should lead not by ruling with authority but by being a living example so that the other members of the church can follow. In order to care for the church, we must drop our natural concepts. To care for the church is not mainly a matter of administration. The word <em>administration</em> does not even appear in the Bible. The New Testament reveals that the eldership is not a matter of ruling with authority but of being an example. According to the New Testament, to be an elder is not a matter of position or authority but altogether a matter of life. We must establish an example by our living. In order to be a good example, we must love the Lord and His Word, deal with sins, hate the self, and learn the lessons of the cross. Caring for the church is not mainly a matter of business affairs but a matter of life. If we lack life, our service in the business affairs of the church is meaningless. Everything we do related to the church must be based on life.</p>
<p>If the elders live a life with a high standard, this will be an example to the other saints. When childish or fleshly brothers rebuke the elders, the elders should not defend themselves but continue to express love to those brothers. This will establish an example for the whole church of denying the self and of not being offended by weaker members but loving such ones. The whole church will learn of this. On the other hand, if an elder goes to see movies, other members will begin to do likewise. Those who do not go will not respect the brother&rsquo;s eldership. Thus, an elder&rsquo;s care for the church is very similar to a father&rsquo;s care for his family. A father cannot have a good family simply by ruling with authority based on his position. Instead, he must live a life that is a standard to his children and that convicts their conscience. In the same principle, the overseers care for the church not by ruling with authority according to position but by living a life as a standard, an example, which the saints will spontaneously follow, just as a flock of sheep always follows the first few sheep. We must reject the concept that the elders &ldquo;run&rdquo; the church. Even the Lord Jesus took the way of setting up an example for us to follow (John 13:15; Matt. 11:29; 1 Cor. 11:1; 1 Pet. 2:21). Hence, in order to care for the church as overseers, we must be like fathers who care for their family not by ruling with authority but by living as examples. Paul writes that a brother must be able to do this with his family before he can do it with the church.</p><h2 class="head2">&ldquo;Not a New Convert&rdquo;</h2>
<p>First Timothy 3:6 says, &ldquo;Not a new convert, lest being blinded with pride he fall into the judgment suffered by the devil.&rdquo; This is also related to human relationships, for we cannot be proud if we are alone. When a person is appointed to a special position in a group, the larger the group is, the easier it is for the person to become proud. A new convert should not be an overseer. Although we may not be a new convert, we must see the principle that we must be careful not to become proud when we first become an elder.</p>
<p>In the New Testament there is no indication that there is the need of an apprenticeship for someone to become an elder. However, in the Old Testament there was a five-year apprenticeship for the priesthood. The Levites began learning to be a priest when they were twenty-five years of age (Num. 8:24). Then when they were thirty, they were qualified to serve in the tabernacle (4:3). Based on this principle, when a brother is first appointed as an elder, he should consider himself to be only an apprentice who is learning. In an established church that has a sufficient number of elders, it is good to have two or three apprentices helping the elders and learning from them how to care for the church. Eventually, these apprentices can become proper elders. In a new local church the leading ones should consider themselves only as learning apprentices. This will preserve them.</p>
<p>Pride makes us blind. If an elder becomes proud, he will suffer the same condemnation as the devil. Lucifer was placed in a high position, but he became proud of his position and earned God&rsquo;s condemnation and judgment. When the apostle Paul was writing this portion in 1 Timothy, he probably had in mind Isaiah 14:12-15, which describes Satan&rsquo;s pride and ambition and God&rsquo;s judgment of him (cf. Ezek. 28:14-19; Jude 9). Paul&rsquo;s word is a warning to new elders to be careful not to be proud. If an elder is proud, he will follow Satan as a rebel against God&rsquo;s government and authority and will suffer the same judgment. Those who are taking the lead in the churches must be in fear and trembling, praying that the Lord will preserve them from any kind of pride. We must not consider that we are in a higher position or have a higher rank than others. Especially the younger brothers must learn to be humble in the church, in the meetings, and in contacting others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;A Good Testimony from Those Outside&rdquo;</h2>
<p>First Timothy 3:7 says, &ldquo;He also must have a good testimony from those outside, that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.&rdquo; Those outside are our neighbors, relatives, and acquaintances who are not in the church. We must have a good testimony from such ones concerning our daily living and walk. This is altogether not a matter of ability but a matter of life; it concerns who we are in our conduct, character, and living among others, even those outside.</p>
<p>If we do not have a good testimony from those outside, we will fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. The apostle Paul indicates that Satan uses the pride of youth and the reproach from the outsiders to damage us. If we do not have a good testimony before the outsiders, Satan will use this reproach as a snare to entangle us. Paul&rsquo;s concept is that we must establish a good example for our family and be careful in our walk before the outsiders. We must not give them any opportunity to say something negative about us so that we will not be ensnared, disappointed, or discouraged, which may damage, spoil, or destroy us for the eldership.</p>
<p>In verses 6 and 7 Paul does not use the word <em>Satan,</em> which means &ldquo;the adversary.&rdquo; Instead, he twice uses the word <em>devil,</em> which means &ldquo;slanderer.&rdquo; Not much slandering will come to a brother who is not an elder, but once he becomes an elder in the church, the devil will try to trap and damage him through slander. The devil being mentioned twice in these few verses indicates strongly that he hates for anyone to be an elder, and he hates that there are proper elders in the church. He tries to damage every elder. In other words, once we become an elder, we become a target of Satan. Satan will try to damage us through our pride or the reproach of others. The reproach of others can greatly disappoint and damage us. If we lose our temper in front of a relative, that one will be utilized by Satan to tell others of our failure. Such a poor testimony will discourage, disappoint, and eventually damage us for the eldership. We must not be proud so that we may not fall into the judgment suffered by the devil, and we must also be careful not to earn the reproach of the outsiders, which is the snare of the devil. In 1 Timothy 3:1-7 Paul&rsquo;s burden concerns not our ability but our life, living, and being. His word clearly indicates that Satan does not damage us in our work or our ability but in our life, living, and conduct.</p>
<p>For past mistakes we need to follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading to make restitution. In order to clear up the situation, we must confess to those whom we offended and even to those who were merely present when we offended someone else. Especially the overseers should do this. If I lose my temper with my wife in the presence of others, I must first confess to my wife, and then go to the others, and in the presence of my wife ask them to forgive me, testifying to them that the Lord has touched my conscience. This will remove a bad impression. For the future we must look to the Lord, realizing that it is by His mercy that we are an elder. We must be careful because Satan will continually seek opportunity to damage us as those who care for God&rsquo;s house, the church. The elders must pray, &ldquo;Lord, deliver me from any temptation, and keep me from the evil one and evil things.&rdquo; Especially the new elders have to pray very much for their eldership. Paul&rsquo;s word reveals that there is a battle regarding the eldership because the devil seeks to ruin every elder.</p><h2 class="head1">FURTHER FELLOWSHIP REGARDING THE ELDERSHIP</h2>
<p><em>Question: Can an elder retire?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The Bible does not say that an elder can retire. Just as a husband and father cannot retire, neither can an elder retire, for these are all matters of life. Furthermore, our real usefulness begins at eighty. Moses&rsquo; began to be used by the Lord at eighty (Exo. 7:7). However, because there are always several elders in a church, the older ones do not need to overly exert themselves, for the younger elders can bear the practical burdens. The older ones do not have much physical strength or energy, but their experiences are valuable and greatly needed. Brother Watchman Nee once told me that it is a great loss when the old saints pass away. He said that the recovery needs many saints to live beyond eighty years of age, because we need their testimonies concerning their experiences in life. We need to take care of our physical health so that we can live longer for the sake of the church.</p>
<p>It is dangerous for an elder to leave the eldership. We should either enter the eldership for life or not enter at all. We must look to the Lord to make us willing to continue serving in this function at any cost. The thought of retirement is somewhat natural. The older we are, the more positive we should be about our service. This does not mean that we should do more, but it is a great help in any situation if we will speak of our experiences. There are several overseers in each church, and the older and younger ones have different portions. Nothing can replace the lessons learned from experiences. These are the riches of the church.</p>
<p><em>Question: What is the best way to carry out an apprenticeship for the eldership?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We must be careful not to do this quickly. We need to do all such things in the church continually but gradually. When brothers are first brought into the meetings of the elders as apprentices, they should only observe to learn. Occasionally, the elders may ask them to do something. Learning in an apprenticeship does not come mainly from teaching and instruction but from observation.</p>
<p><em>Question: How do we cultivate the proper aspiration for the overseership?</em></p>
<p>Answer: First Timothy 3:1 indicates that it is good to aspire to the overseership. This means that for the future of a local church several brothers in the church should have the aspiration that one day they could bear the responsibility of the eldership. This aspiration is different from ambition. Although we need to cultivate the proper aspiration for the eldership, we must condemn ambition. The older elders should bear the responsibility to pray, &ldquo;Lord, raise up more proper, useful brothers to bear the burden of the church.&rdquo; Some brothers may be promising and good for the eldership yet lack the aspiration. Therefore, we need to pray for them. The proper aspiration comes mainly from others&rsquo; prayer.</p>
<p><em>Question: In considering a brother for the eldership, should we take into account his reputation before he was saved?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Whether we did something wrong before we were saved or after, we should make a thorough restitution with all those involved in our life. If a man steals before he is saved, once he becomes a believer, he must make restitution to those from whom he stole. If he does not make restitution and eventually becomes a leading one in the church, others will reproach him.</p>
<p>We need to distinguish slander from reproach. Reproach means that we are criticized because of some sin, error, mistake, or wrongdoing. Slander is when we are falsely accused or ill spoken of simply because we have become a believer or come into the church. If we are criticized for wrongdoings that we have not dealt with, this is reproach, but if we are slandered for following the Lord, this is a good testimony. Those who slander us know deep in their conscience that we are taking the right way. Even if others revile us when we make restitution to them for past offenses, their conscience will bear testimony to them that we are right.</p>
<p><em>Question: How can an elder who is a father care for his family and also be always available to help the saints?</em></p>
<p>To be an overseer is difficult. The most helpful thing for children is for their parents to spend time with them. To sit with them, observe what they are doing, and instruct them is the best encouragement to them and prevents them from being idle. Sometimes we need to have free talks with them about wide-ranging subjects. If we do, they will be happy. All children like to learn. The need with our children is endless. The more time we spend with them, the better. We should allow them to join in our daily activities, and we should join them in their activities. However, an elder also needs to be available to help the saints. In order to care for both these needs, we must learn to fellowship with the Lord and follow His leading. What I have shared concerning the eldership are principles. We need the Lord&rsquo;s leading for specific situations.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>We need to be impressed that the eldership is altogether a matter of life. It depends not on what we do but on what we are and how we live. We can retire from doing something, but we cannot retire from what we are. The care for the churches is not a matter of business but a matter of life. Therefore, those who aspire to the eldership need to learn mainly not how to do things but the way to live a life of a high standard. The requirements in 1 Timothy 3:1-7 are altogether related to what we are and to the way we live.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">ASPECTS OF THE ELDERSHIP<br />
REVEALED IN TITUS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Titus 1:1-11</h1>
<p>Titus 1:1-11, which is quite similar to 1 Timothy 3:1-7, says,</p>
<p class="indent1">Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God&rsquo;s chosen ones and the full knowledge of the truth, which is according to godliness, in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the times of the ages, but in its own times He manifested it as His word in the proclamation with which I was entrusted according to the command of our Savior God; to Titus, genuine child according to the common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior. For this cause I left you in Crete, that you might set in order the things which I have begun that remain and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you: if anyone is unreprovable, the husband of one wife, having believing children not accused of dissoluteness or unruly. For the overseer must be unreprovable as a steward of God, not self-willed, not quick tempered, not an excessive drinker, not a striker, not greedy for base gain; but hospitable, a lover of good, of a sober mind, righteous, holy, self-controlled; holding to the faithful word, which is according to the teaching of the apostles, that he may be able both to exhort by the healthy teaching and to convict those who oppose. For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, whose mouths must be stopped, who overthrow whole households, teaching things for the sake of base gain, which they ought not to do.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FAITH OF GOD&rsquo;S CHOSEN ONES,<br />
THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH,<br />
AND THE HOPE OF ETERNAL LIFE</h2>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to Titus concerns the maintaining of order in the churches. For this, the faith of God&rsquo;s chosen ones, the truth according to godliness, and eternal life are indispensable. Hence, in the very opening word these three things are set forth. According to 1 Timothy 3:15-16, godliness is God manifested in the flesh, the divine life expressed in humanity. This is the truth of godliness. The hope of eternal life, which is the divine life, is altogether a matter of the expression of this life and is not only for the coming age and eternity future but also for this age. We have much to hope for in the eternal life, the life of God, because it is able to do many things that we are unable to do in ourselves. Without the eternal life, we are wretched, hopeless people, but because we have the divine life, we are full of hope. God promised the eternal life before the world began. When the New Testament time came, this promise became the manifested word. God manifested the word of His promise by Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension as the Spirit. These accomplishments of God&rsquo;s manifested word were revealed through the apostles and prophets.</p>
<p>Historically, many Christians have treasured Genesis 3:15, which says that the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent. This verse is a prophecy concerning Christ&rsquo;s coming as the seed of the woman through incarnation to destroy Satan on the cross and rescue us from his usurpation. Hence, it is a wonderful promise of our objective salvation. However, the hope of God&rsquo;s promise is not only Christ as the seed of the woman but also Christ as the seed of life, the eternal life, that is sown into the believers (Mark 4:26-28). We have hope because the seed of the woman destroyed the serpent on the cross and, even more, because the seed of life has entered into us to be our daily salvation. We live in a hopeful situation because we have the hope of eternal life.</p>
<p>Confucius taught that the highest learning of ethics is to cultivate, or develop, one&rsquo;s inner &ldquo;bright virtue,&rdquo; which is actually the conscience. Humanly speaking, this is very good, but as Christians, we hope not in the bright virtue but in the eternal life. We do not need to develop our bright virtue, because we have Christ as the seed of the divine life in us. This is much better and higher. The divine seed with the divine life is our hope. We cannot meet the requirements of the elders described in 1 Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:6-9 simply by cultivating our conscience. We can meet these requirements only because we have God Himself as the eternal life within us. Since the eternal life is within us, we can fulfill the highest requirements. For example, by this life we can be patient and temperate. In ourselves we are hopeless, but in this life we are full of hope. The truth of godliness, the hope of eternal life, and the manifestation of God&rsquo;s word all denote God becoming our life. Since God is now our life, there is nothing that we cannot do. We should not be discouraged by the high standard of the requirements in 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1. Instead, we should be hopeful in the realization that these requirements prove the capacity of the divine life in us.</p><h2 class="head1">&ldquo;A STEWARD OF GOD&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The requirements of the elders in Titus 1 are nearly the same as those in 1 Timothy 3. However, in Titus 1:7 Paul adds that an overseer &ldquo;must be unreprovable as a steward of God.&rdquo; A steward is not only a servant but also one who dispenses. Therefore, an elder should be one who dispenses, or ministers, God to others. To serve God is not merely to do something for God but to minister God to others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;RIGHTEOUS, HOLY&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In Titus 1:8 Paul writes that an overseer must be &ldquo;righteous, holy.&rdquo; These words are not used in 1 Timothy 3, but they show that Paul&rsquo;s concept is that the requirements of an overseer are based not on his ability but on his manner of life. An elder must be one who is righteous and holy. To be righteous is mainly toward man, and to be holy is mainly toward God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;HOLDING TO THE FAITHFUL WORD&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Verse 9 begins, &ldquo;Holding to the faithful word.&rdquo; The faithful word is the full revelation of the New Testament. The elders must hold to the New Testament revelation. This implies that the elders have to study and learn, for we cannot hold to what we have not first received.</p>
<p>First Timothy 3:2 says that the overseers must be &ldquo;apt to teach.&rdquo; This kind of teaching is mainly on the positive side&mdash;to strengthen the members of the church. However, the elders&rsquo; holding to the faithful word is both to &ldquo;exhort by the healthy teaching&rdquo; and to deal with the opposers (Titus 1:9). This indicates that the overseers need to have two kinds of teaching&mdash;one kind to edify the saints and the other to fight the battle so that the mouths of the vain talkers and deceivers may be stopped (vv. 10-11). The elders must learn how to teach in order to stop the vain talkers and deceivers.</p>
<p>By &ldquo;vain talkers and deceivers,&rdquo; Paul means mainly the Judaizers, &ldquo;those of the circumcision&rdquo; (v. 10). The Judaizers were those who perverted and distorted the truth of the gospel in order to mislead the believers into going back to the law of Moses. Today different kinds of vain talkers and deceivers try to mislead believers. The elders must speak to stop the mouths of such ones. Like a mother&rsquo;s cooking of food for her children, the elders&rsquo; teaching to convict the opposers is a matter not mainly of gift or ability but of duty. If a mother does not know how to cook, she must learn. Similarly, an elder cannot excuse himself from teaching because he is not a gift to the Body as a teacher. To be an elder is not easy. When deceivers are spreading lies, the elders in a local church should not need to call someone from another locality to come and help them. It is the burden of every elder to learn to teach.</p>
<p>All the elders have to study the Bible and the ministry books in order to be fully educated in the crucial aspects of the truth. The teaching of the apostles is fully contained in the Bible, but because the Bible is deep, we need the ministry books to help us in our study. We first need to spend time in the Bible directly, and then we need to spend time to study the ministry books. These books include all the positive Christian teachings throughout the centuries and sift out the wrong things. If we read them, we will receive a thorough education. When we are educated in the teaching of the apostles, we will be able to safeguard and protect the local church. To be an elder is not a matter merely of administration. More importantly, every elder must learn the truth thoroughly and be able to teach it to others.</p>
<p>If we know and experience the truth, our speaking will have impact, not because of eloquence but because of reality. We will be able to refute the lies of those who oppose just as the overseers stopped the mouths of the Judaizers in ancient times. When we have the knowledge and experience of the truth, our speaking is our testimony. This is the urgent need today because, as elders, we must not only safeguard ourselves against the deceivers but also expose and stop the deceiving mouths by speaking the truth with impact.</p>
<p>Verse 9 mentions the healthy teaching. When we have been nourished and healed by the healthy teaching, we can pass it on by exhorting others. Every elder must be able to do this. The elders need to dedicate themselves to study the Bible and the ministry books. If we are elders merely in name, we are like practicing doctors who have not studied medicine. The need for potential elders to apprehend the faithful word may have been the reason that Paul hesitated in the appointment of the elders in Crete (v. 5).</p>
<p>If we have adequate knowledge and experience of the spiritual truths, we will know what to speak not only in the meeting but also on any occasion, just as a carpenter knows which tool to use for different tasks. If we lack skill in speaking, it may be because we are not thoroughly educated in the spiritual truths or have not adequately experienced them. The elders should not rely on traveling co-workers. We all have to learn for ourselves. The practice of many in Christianity today is to donate their money to hire someone to do things for them. Brother Watchman Nee summarized the attitude of most Christians in this way: &ldquo;For illness, call the doctor; for lawsuits, call the lawyer; for spiritual affairs, call the pastor. What about us? We can devote ourselves to secular work without distraction&rdquo; (<em>The Orthodoxy of the Church,</em> p. 18). On the contrary, we all, especially the overseers, need to be trained in spiritual matters.</p>
<p>Apparently, to be an elder is difficult, but actually, it is an enjoyment. The more we study the Bible and the ministry books, the more enjoyment we receive. It is also a great enjoyment to help the others in the church, especially to minister Christ to the young ones and the weak ones. In God&rsquo;s economy to be an elder is a great blessing. Thus, we should treasure the eldership.</p>
<p>The elders are crucial for the successful carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy. If the elders fail, God will be defeated temporarily. The testimony of God today rests on the shoulders of the elders; they bear the Ark of the Testimony. Paul was the top apostle, but many of the churches under his ministry were in a poor condition because the elders were inadequate. The direct burden of God&rsquo;s testimony is not upon the apostles or prophets but upon the elders.</p>
<p>If the elders function as they should, the local churches will not become an improper hierarchical organization under someone&rsquo;s control. Every local church should be administrated locally, and no local church is higher than the other local churches. This is according to God&rsquo;s administration in His economy, which is unlike any government or administration in human history. When every member of the Body of Christ functions properly, the headship and kingship are kept for the unique Lord. The church is not an organization but a universal organism. We all must learn these things and hold fast to them in order to stop the mouths of the vain talkers and deceivers.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TEACHING OF THE ELDERS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 5:17</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS LABORING IN WORD AND TEACHING</h2>
<p>First Timothy 5:17 says, &ldquo;Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching.&rdquo; Here Paul indicates that it is good for the elders to teach. Peter says that the elders are shepherds (1 Pet. 5:2). According to Ephesians 4:11, shepherds and teachers are one category of gifted persons. In order to shepherd people, we must know how to teach and instruct them. Teaching is the main way to practically shepherd the saints.</p>
<p>The teaching mentioned in 1 Timothy 5 and Titus 1 is not the teaching of the gifted teachers but the teaching of elders in the local churches. The elders&rsquo; teaching is like the teaching of mothers and fathers in their homes. The elders are the leading ones; they take the lead in everything&mdash;the meetings, the business affairs of the church, seeking the Lord, studying the Word, prayer, preaching the gospel, and helping the saints. According to 1 Timothy 5:17, the elders should take the lead, especially to &ldquo;labor in word and teaching.&rdquo; Titus 1:9 similarly says that the elders must hold to the faithful word so that they &ldquo;may be able both to exhort by the healthy teaching and to convict those who oppose.&rdquo; Therefore, the main responsibility of the elders is teaching.</p>
<p>The eldership is weakened by two main things: a shortage of life and a lack of teaching. If the elders are rich in life and in teaching, the situation in the churches will be wonderful. We need to see our shortages and seek after life and the truth in order to be qualified and edified as elders. In order to function properly in the eldership, a brother must not only have adequate growth in life but also spend much time learning the basic truths.</p>
<p>We need to encourage the young saints, especially the young brothers, to study the Word diligently so that they will be prepared to take care of the churches in the future. As the Lord&rsquo;s recovery spreads, the need for elders increases. We cannot pray, fellowship, and labor for the spread of the churches without considering this need. The young ones should spend much time studying the Word in order to be built up in the full knowledge of the truth. We must also encourage them to seek the Lord for their growth in life. If the young saints grow in a balanced way in life and truth, they will be well prepared to take care of the churches.</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 5:17 Paul says that the elders should labor &ldquo;in word and teaching.&rdquo; <em>Word</em> here denotes the general speaking of doctrines, and <em>teaching</em> denotes special instruction concerning particular things. Thus, the elders should be able to teach the saints concerning the practical family life, daily life, and church life. The main function of the elders is teaching. The way for the elders to carry out anything or solve any problem is teaching. Therefore, if the elders are unable to teach, the eldership will be weak. If there are four elders in a locality, at least three of them must be able to teach. If none of the elders in a locality can teach, even if they all have much life, the eldership will be weak. As elders, we need to pay our full attention to the matter of teaching. To take care of other things, such as the business affairs in the church, is necessary but not as important as laboring in word and teaching. The elders should be occupied by ministering the word and in teaching the saints concerning the practical matters of the daily Christian life and church life.</p>
<p>The elders are the local shepherds, and to be a shepherd is to be a teacher. Therefore, the elders should continually teach the saints. In order to do this, they must dedicate much time to studying the truth. The elders should know all the basic truths, such as the difference between the soul and the spirit, the ground of the church, the genuine oneness, and the definition of the church. An elder may be invited to visit the home of some saints to speak to them concerning some point of the truth or a practical matter. The saints&rsquo; relatives or neighbors may also come to listen to the speaking. This kind of home teaching is often more effective than giving messages in large meetings. The elders should be able to answer all the saints&rsquo; questions concerning the truth. The elders&rsquo; teaching should saturate the saints with the word of the truth.</p>
<p>Describing the qualifications of an overseer, Titus 1:9-11 says, &ldquo;Holding to the faithful word, which is according to the teaching of the apostles, that he may be able both to exhort by the healthy teaching and to convict those who oppose. For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, whose mouths must be stopped.&rdquo; In the early days of the church the elders had to know how to deal first with the Judaizers and then with Gnostics and others influenced by Greek philosophy. We must know the truth in order to stop the mouths of the deceivers. We may not confront opposers directly, but when the family of a new brother or sister hears a false report concerning the local churches, the elders must be able to teach in order to expose such lies. This requires some skill. For instance, it may be best to begin by asking the new brother or sister, &ldquo;According to your experience and observation in the church, what would you say to your family?&rdquo; Eventually, the opposers&rsquo; activities will only help us. The devil&rsquo;s goal is to destroy what the Lord loves, but the Bible shows that whatever the devil does eventually helps the Lord. We do not need to worry about the opposers, but we must learn the truth and how to teach. The strength of the eldership depends on life and teaching.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE DEACONS</h2>
<p>Like the qualifications of the elders, the qualifications of the deacons given by Paul are mainly matters of life and truth. First Timothy 3:8-13 says,</p>
<p class="indent1">Deacons must similarly be grave, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for base gain; holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. And these also must first be proved; then let them minister if they are unreprovable. Women similarly must be grave, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things. Deacons must be husbands of one wife, managing their children and their own houses well. For those who have ministered well obtain for themselves a good standing and much boldness in faith, which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>In certain situations in the church life it is wise to say nothing, but whenever we speak, we must speak with one tongue. If we speak differently to two people concerning the same thing, we are being double-tongued, like a serpent. The devil always lies, which is a matter of being double-tongued (John 8:44). The elders and deacons should exercise to control their speaking. They should not speak lies, idle words, or any unnecessary word.</p>
<p><em>The faith</em> in 1 Timothy 3:9 is the objective faith, referring not to our believing action but to the things in which we believe. The mystery of the faith is the entire revelation of the New Testament, which includes Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension as the life-giving Spirit. All these are items of Christ, who is the mystery of God (Col. 2:2). After Christ passed through these processes, the church was produced, and the church is spreading this mystery. The mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church (Eph. 3:4). The mystery of the faith comprises these two great mysteries.</p>
<p>First Timothy 3:10 says, &ldquo;These also must first be proved; then let them minister.&rdquo; This may indicate that there should be an apprenticeship in the deacons&rsquo; service. Before an elder or deacon is appointed, there is the need of a period of proving and testing. Like the elders, the deacons must study the Bible and the ministry books in order to learn the mystery of the faith. They must hold this mystery, the contents of the New Testament, in a pure conscience, which implies a regenerated spirit, because the conscience is the first part of the spirit. If the elders and the deacons meet the high requirements mentioned in these Epistles, the church will certainly be strong.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">PETER&rsquo;S EXHORTATION TO THE ELDERS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 5:1-7</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, show us Your way in the eldership. We ask You to cleanse us with Your precious blood. Because we are often polluted by our old man, our fallen nature, and our flesh, we need Your cleansing and Your forgiveness. Lord, open Your heart and open our mind so that we may have a way to get into Your Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;THE ELDERS AMONG YOU I EXHORT,<br />
WHO AM A FELLOW ELDER AND WITNESS<br />
OF THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST, WHO AM ALSO<br />
A PARTAKER OF THE GLORY TO BE REVEALED&rdquo;</h2>
<p>First Peter 5:1 says, &ldquo;The elders among you I exhort, who am a fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory to be revealed.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s main thought concerning the elders is about the same as that of Paul. We should pay special attention to the main points in Peter&rsquo;s charge.</p>
<p>First, he exhorts the elders as a fellow elder, a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker of the glory to be revealed. Although Peter is directly referring to only his own status, all the elders should be witnesses of Christ, especially of His sufferings, and partakers of the glory to be revealed. This indicates that we should live a life that is absolutely one with Christ, a life that is Christ Himself. Such a life is a life of sufferings in this age and a life of glory in the future. The Greek word translated &ldquo;witness&rdquo; also means &ldquo;martyr.&rdquo; If we are martyrs, those who share in the sufferings of Christ, we will be partakers of the glory in the coming age.</p>
<p>The qualifications of the elders are not matters of ability but altogether matters of their life, living, and person. Being a witness who shares in the sufferings of Christ and being a partaker of the glory to be revealed are matters not of what we can do but of what we are. It is possible to be a very capable person yet not be a witness of Christ or a partaker of glory. Therefore, we should care more for what we are than for what we can do. An elder should be a martyr, sharing in the life of Christ. We should live a suffering life because Christ, who is still the suffering One today, is life to us. Such a living prepares and qualifies us to be partakers of the coming glory. It is a basic thought in the New Testament that suffering comes first and glory follows (Rom. 8:17; 1 Pet. 1:11). If we suffer with Christ, we will surely reign with Him. However, the main thought here is that the eldership depends not on what we can do but on what we are and the kind of life we live.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;SHEPHERD THE FLOCK OF GOD AMONG YOU&rdquo;</h2>
<p>First Peter 5:2a says, &ldquo;Shepherd the flock of God among you.&rdquo; He also calls the Lord Jesus the Chief Shepherd (v. 4). In order to understand the concept of shepherding and martyrdom in 1 Peter 5, we must remember the words of the Lord that Peter heard in John 10 and 21. Peter heard the Lord say, &ldquo;I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep&rdquo; (10:11). The Greek word translated &ldquo;life&rdquo; in this verse is <em>psuche,</em> which refers to the soul-life. The Lord laid down not His divine <em>zoe</em> life but His human life. As the good Shepherd, He sacrificed His <em>psuche</em> life for His flock. After the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, He found Peter and asked him, &ldquo;Do you love Me?&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;Yes, Lord, You know that I love You.&rdquo; The Lord responded, &ldquo;Shepherd My sheep&rdquo; (21:16). After the Lord charged Peter to be a shepherd, He prophesied that Peter would be martyred (vv. 18-19). Eventually, Peter was martyred because of his shepherding of the Lord&rsquo;s flock. Because the Lord laid down His life for His sheep, He was the first martyr&mdash;He lived a life of suffering for His flock. Peter was also a martyr. The elders today must live as martyrs, sacrificing their lives for the church, the flock of God.</p>
<p>To be an elder requires us not only to be humble, temperate, and sober but also to be ready to suffer as a martyr for the church. As the good Shepherd, the Lord laid down His life for His sheep. Today He is the Chief Shepherd, and as His fellow shepherds, we must follow His pattern to sacrifice and live His suffering life as martyrs for the flock of God. The eldership requires not only that we give hospitality but also that we give our soul-life in martyrdom. We must give our life and our being for the church. If we have such a spirit of martyrdom, we will be a proper elder even if we cannot speak or pray eloquently. We must be willing and even aspire to give our life for the church. We should love the saints under our care to the extent that we would give our soul-life for them. If we do this, we will be partakers of the glory to be revealed. In order to be proper shepherds caring for God&rsquo;s flock, we must be witnesses of the sufferings of Christ and partakers of the glory to be revealed.</p>
<p>In Acts 20:28-29 Paul said to the elders in Ephesus, &ldquo;Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers to shepherd the church of God, which He obtained through His own blood. I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.&rdquo; In Matthew 10:16 the Lord said, &ldquo;I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves.&rdquo; Because there are wolves, the elders must be martyrs in order to shepherd the flock. The wolves in the Lord&rsquo;s time and the apostles&rsquo; time were mainly the Judaizers, who were the Jewish religionists. In the same principle there are religionists today who seek as wolves to damage and destroy the flock of God. When we consider 1 Peter 5 together with John 10 and 21 and Acts 20, we can see that to be an elder requires a spirit of martyrdom. Although we may not suffer physical martyrdom, we must be willing to sacrifice our life for the church.</p><h2 class="head1">&ldquo;OVERSEEING NOT UNDER COMPULSION<br />
BUT WILLINGLY, ACCORDING TO GOD;<br />
NOT BY SEEKING GAIN<br />
THROUGH BASE MEANS BUT EAGERLY&rdquo;</h2>
<p>First Peter 5:2b says, &ldquo;Overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God; not by seeking gain through base means but eagerly.&rdquo; Here Peter uses the word <em>overseeing</em> in his word to the elders. Paul similarly uses the word <em>overseer</em> to refer to the elders (1 Tim. 3:1-2; Titus 1:7). To oversee the church is not to rule it but to safeguard, preserve, and protect it as a shepherd oversees a flock. <em>Not under compulsion but willingly</em> means not by constraint, pressure, or force. This is like a mother&rsquo;s care for her child.</p>
<p>According to 1 Timothy 5:17, in the ancient times some elders were supported financially by the churches. Thus, there was a temptation for material gain. Therefore, Peter writes, &ldquo;Not by seeking gain through base means&rdquo; (1 Pet. 5:2). Paul uses similar terms in 1 Timothy 6:5, which says, &ldquo;Perpetual wranglings of men corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth, supposing godliness to be a means of gain.&rdquo; Paul knew of some who pretended to be godly in order to get money from others. This is shameful. Brother Watchman Nee purposely avoided having special contact with wealthy saints, because he was not seeking base gain. We must overcome the temptation to seek gain through base means. We must earnestly love the saints and be willing to give our life for them without any thought of material gain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;NOR AS LORDING IT OVER YOUR ALLOTMENTS BUT<br />
BY BECOMING PATTERNS OF THE FLOCK&rdquo;</h2>
<p>First Peter 5:3 says, &ldquo;Nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock.&rdquo; We daily lord it over our possessions, such as our house, furniture, and cars, but elders should not lord it over the saints, because the church is not their possession. The church, which includes the elders, is the possession of God. An elder should not be the lord and should not consider the church or the saints his possession. Instead, he should be a pattern. The elders&rsquo; being patterns indicates that they are on the same level as the other saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;WHEN THE CHIEF SHEPHERD IS MANIFESTED,<br />
YOU WILL RECEIVE THE UNFADING CROWN OF GLORY&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Verse 4 says, &ldquo;When the Chief Shepherd is manifested, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.&rdquo; To receive the unfading crown of glory is to be a partaker of the glory to be revealed. The Lord is the Chief Shepherd, and He became a martyr for His flock. In a sense, He is still suffering. Therefore, the elders, who are His fellow shepherds, must also suffer for the flock with the view that some day they will be with Him in glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;IN LIKE MANNER, YOUNGER MEN,<br />
BE SUBJECT TO ELDERS; AND ALL OF YOU<br />
GIRD YOURSELVES WITH HUMILITY<br />
TOWARD ONE ANOTHER, BECAUSE GOD RESISTS<br />
THE PROUD BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Verse 5a says, &ldquo;In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders; and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another.&rdquo; The phrase <em>in like manner</em> implies that the elders are on the same level as the younger brothers. According to our natural thought, the young ones should be humble toward the older ones, but the older ones do not need to be humble toward the young ones. This thought places the elders and the young ones on different levels and creates ranks with the young ones of the lower rank submitting to the elders of the higher rank. However, the phrase <em>all of you</em> in verse 5 places us all on the same level. In the church there is no rank. The word <em>gird</em> describes the way a servant puts on a serving apron. The elders&rsquo; girding themselves with humility indicates that they are serving ones. This thought is precious. The elders must reject any thought that they are higher than others. They should not rule but should serve the saints. Paul has the same basic thought when he writes, &ldquo;Not a new convert, lest being blinded with pride he fall into the judgment suffered by the devil&rdquo; (1 Tim. 3:6). These two apostles had the same concern about pride among the elders.</p>
<p>In the eldership there are two main temptations: base gain and pride. If a leading brother&rsquo;s love for the church causes him to labor to take care of the church full time, the saints may honor him by giving him material support. However, if his intention is to gain the support, he is seeking gain through base means. We must reject this temptation. The other temptation for the elders is to think that because they are elders, they have a special rank and are higher than others. Those who think this way have fallen into the pit of pride. We must be on the alert against these temptations.</p>
<p>In his exhortation Peter does not rank the elders above the other saints but puts all the believers on the same level. This is important. As elders, we must not rank ourselves differently from the other saints. Instead, we must consider ourselves lower than the others because we serve the saints. The serving ones are always lower than those being served (cf. Luke 22:27). Because we elders are the serving ones, we must continually gird ourselves with humility.</p>
<p>First Peter 5:5b says, &ldquo;God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.&rdquo; The church needs genuinely humble elders, for they will bring in grace. I have seen churches where the grace was lacking because of the elders&rsquo; pride. The pride of the elders frustrates God&rsquo;s grace from coming to the church, but the humility of the elders keeps a living flow of grace coming into the church. Therefore, whether the elders are humble or proud makes a great difference.</p><h2 class="head1">&ldquo;BE HUMBLED UNDER THE MIGHTY HAND OF GOD THAT HE MAY EXALT YOU IN DUE TIME&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Verse 6 says, &ldquo;Be humbled under the mighty hand of God that He may exalt you in due time.&rdquo; Verses 5 and 6 both concern humility. We need to humble ourselves because pride frustrates God&rsquo;s grace from coming to us. If we are humbled, God will exalt us in due time, in the next age. Verses 1 and 4 also allude to the coming age. The present age is not the time to be exalted but the time to be humbled.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;CASTING ALL YOUR ANXIETY ON HIM<br />
BECAUSE IT MATTERS TO HIM CONCERNING YOU&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Verse 7 says, &ldquo;Casting all your anxiety on Him because it matters to Him concerning you.&rdquo; Because this verse is often quoted out of context, we need to see that it continues the thought in the foregoing verses. Hence, the anxiety mentioned in this verse is the anxiety that should come from our concern for the churches. As elders, we should not be anxious for our possessions or family, but we must be concerned for the church and the saints. We should not be indifferent to the condition of the church. There should be times when we are so burdened and anxious for the church that we cannot sleep. At such times, we need to learn to cast all our anxiety for the church on the Lord because He cares for the church and the elders. In 2 Corinthians 11:28 Paul writes, &ldquo;There is this: the crowd of cares pressing upon me daily, the anxious concern for all the churches.&rdquo; Paul probably had no anxiety other than his concern for the church. The elders should follow this pattern.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: When the saints come to the elders for advice concerning a practical situation, how should we help them without lording it over them?</em></p>
<p>Answer: For an elder to rule or lord it over others is easy, spontaneous, and natural; for an elder not to rule is quite difficult. I recently noticed that even my young granddaughter likes to rule over others. Everyone&rsquo;s natural man likes to rule as a king. Therefore, when a brother becomes an elder, his natural tendency is to try to rule over the church. This is true even for those who are not ambitious. We have to fight the battle to resist this tendency. Peter uses strong words and expressions concerning the elders not lording it over their allotments and girding themselves with humility. Those who are natural may be offended by these words. It is a shame if elders behave like kings and treat the saints as their servants. As an elder, we must consider ourselves as the servant of the saints.</p>
<p>The elders should serve the church as martyrs who are ready to give their life for the church. We should not be judges. We must love and care for the saints as fathers love their children and as shepherds care for their flocks. We must drop all the natural concepts, practices, and tendencies and see the light that there is no rank in the church. The elders serve the saints. They love and care for the church with an anxious concern for the church&rsquo;s condition and the saints&rsquo; growth in life. However, they also need to cast this anxiety on the Lord, trusting in Him because He cares for the church and the elders.</p>
<p><em>Question: How should we apply this word in our localities?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The leading ones in each locality should fellowship and pray together. The advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery can be greatly frustrated or greatly helped by the elders. The apostles are important, but the Lord&rsquo;s move depends more on the elders because the elders are the ones directly responsible for the churches. The proper eldership is necessary for the Lord to go on. Practically speaking, God&rsquo;s economy depends on the eldership. Even when God spoke to Israel in the Old Testament time, He often spoke directly to the elders (cf. Jer. 29:1). The apostle Paul called for and spoke to the elders of the church in Ephesus because the condition of the church in Ephesus depended largely on the elders (Acts 20:17). Therefore, the elders in the churches today should spend time to fellowship and pray together concerning their view of the eldership. Our concept is the basic factor. If our concept is proper, everything will follow.</p>
<p>The New Testament mentions the elders and deacons but does not give detailed instructions concerning the administration of such ones. An overly strong church administration may eliminate the serving ones&rsquo; seeking the spirit and life. First Timothy 3:1-13 and 1 Peter 5:1-7 concern the life of the serving ones. Therefore, to be an elder or deacon is not mainly a matter of administration but a matter of having a proper life. Although my practice is not to propose anything to the churches, when the church in Anaheim moved into a new building in 1976, I asked the brothers to do away with the service groups, because I saw that a hierarchy was being built up. The service of the church should not depend on the organization of such service groups. When I visited the church in Taipei in the past and saw many different forms in the service office, I asked the elders to destroy those forms. When I went to Taipei in 1975, I saw that many of the elders, deacons, deaconesses, and leaders of the home meetings were not active in their service but merely occupying administrative positions. I showed them that over a period of twenty-five years an organizational administration had gradually accumulated and pushed out the spirit and life. I suggested that many should drop their administrative positions and spend more time to seek the Lord in prayer. Hundreds resigned, and many were happy to be released. Some felt awkward at first because their position had become a crutch. However, when I visited again in 1977, the situation was very good. Nevertheless, I am concerned that an unnecessarily large administration may gradually return.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ELDERS&rsquo; NEED FOR A FRESH VISION<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 3:9; Titus 1:1-2, 9-11</h1>
<p>In previous chapters we have seen the qualifications of the elders. In this chapter we will consider the need for the elders to renew their vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We will not cover all the details of the vision but will focus on our need to have our vision refreshed and made clear.</p>
<p>First Timothy 3:9 says, &ldquo;Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.&rdquo; Titus 1:1-2 says, &ldquo;Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God&rsquo;s chosen ones and the full knowledge of the truth, which is according to godliness, in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the times of the ages.&rdquo; Verses 9 through 11 say, &ldquo;Holding to the faithful word, which is according to the teaching of the apostles, that he may be able both to exhort by the healthy teaching and to convict those who oppose. For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, whose mouths must be stopped, who overthrow whole households, teaching things for the sake of base gain.&rdquo; In order to have a clear view of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must understand the terms <em>the mystery of the faith; the faith of God&rsquo;s chosen ones; the full knowledge of the truth, which is according to godliness; the hope of eternal life;</em> and <em>the faithful word, which is according to the teaching of the apostles.</em> If we review the details of these great items, our vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will be refreshed.</p>
<p>As elders, we need to fellowship with one another and contact the Lord in prayer concerning the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in order to fully realize what the Lord is doing among us. Otherwise, as the years go by we may gradually lose our vision and begin to go on in a routine way. We may begin to think of the local churches as an ordinary Christian work and feel that our duty is only to come to the meetings and take care of the practical matters of the church. If this is our case, we will lose the impact. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery requires our full effort. It should be our cause. Because of the great number of Christians on the earth today, some may think that being a Christian is a common thing. However, to be a Christian is a great thing. It requires much exercise, and to be in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery requires even more exercise. Therefore, we need to pray that we may see the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in a fresh way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONTENT OF THE VISION</h2>
<p>We must first see the eternal purpose of God. Although we may say that we have known this for years, our view needs to be refreshed. Second, we need to know why God is triune and why He created the universe. Then we must see why God came into man and made Himself one with man&mdash;we need to get into the depths of incarnation. We also have to consider why God lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years as a man. This is not a small thing, but it has become common to many Christians. It is a shame to understand the four Gospels merely as a story. We need a vision concerning God&rsquo;s living on the earth as a God-man. We also need a clear view of Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, including their meaning, accomplishment, and application to us. After His ascension the transfigured Christ descended as the life-giving Spirit. These are all items of Christ as the mystery of God.</p>
<p>As a result of Christ&rsquo;s processes, the church was produced. We also must see what the church is. This includes many items. The church is the assembly of God&rsquo;s called-out ones, the Body of Christ, the new man, the kingdom of God, the house of God, the bride of Christ, a warrior, a lampstand, and the testimony of Jesus. We need to get into all the meanings and implications of each of these items. We also need to see the universal and local aspects of the church, the various functions and services in the church, and the oneness, nature, position, life, reality, essence, and unique ground of the church. All these must be fresh and refreshing to us not only for ourselves but also so that we can help others.</p>
<p>We must spend time in these things until they become our burden and cause. Our purpose is not merely to preach the gospel and save the sinners, nor is it only to gather the saints in meetings to worship God, teach, and shepherd the saints. We must have the view of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, which includes Christ&rsquo;s processes and His coming again as the life-giving Spirit to produce the church. Christ is the mystery of God, and as His corporate increase, the church is also a mystery&mdash;the mystery of Christ. The manifestation of God in the flesh, which is the mystery of godliness, has two steps: the first step is the individual incarnation of Christ, and the second step is the corporate manifestation of God in the church. We have to see all these things.</p>
<p>In addition to these aspects of Christ and the church, we also need to see the practical Christian life, including regeneration, clearance of the past, consecration, discerning the spirit from the soul, the anointing, the law of life, the sense of life, the fellowship of life, dispositional sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification. These experiences are for our participation in the processes of Christ and the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<p>It would take many messages to cover all these matters, yet all the elders should have a clear and fresh view of them. Such a view will refresh us and be our cause. The first aspect of our cause includes all the items from God&rsquo;s eternal purpose to the establishment of the local churches; the second aspect includes all the experiences of the Christian life from regeneration to glorification.</p>
<p>The elders must get into all these things and know them thoroughly so that they can hold the mystery of the faith. Each of these points is a mystery, and together they are the mystery of the faith. Even creation is a mystery. Scientists do not know the meaning of the universe. It is a mystery to them, but we know. Similarly, Christ&rsquo;s processes and the experiences of the Christian life are mysteries. These are the basic items of the mystery of our faith. The elders must know these items just as all people must know basic mathematics in order to carry out crucial tasks in their daily lives.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS&rsquo; NEEDING TO BE ABLE TO TEACH<br />
THE CONTENT OF THE VISION</h2>
<p>The elders must also be apt to teach (1 Tim. 3:2). When we begin to shepherd a brother, we may quickly discern that his need is basic knowledge of some item of the truth. If this is the case, we need to meet regularly with him for several weeks to teach him concerning the truth. This way is not too slow, nor is it a small thing. As the years go by there will be a glorious result of such labor. Any time we spend teaching the saints concerning the mystery of the faith is not a waste.</p>
<p>The elders need to know the items of the mystery of the faith to the extent that they can teach them to others. Then they will be apt to teach. Not every elder needs to give messages in large meetings, but every elder must be able to teach the basic items of the truth to individual saints. All the items mentioned in this chapter are basic factors of our Christian life. We should not be content with our situation simply because we see more than other Christians. We need to come back to God&rsquo;s full revelation and renew our vision in order to see all these things.</p>
<p>The real function of the elders is to teach, and teaching is the way to shepherd. When we visit the saints to shepherd them, we must be prepared to teach them. Our teaching should not be doctrinal theology or simple Bible stories but the items of the mystery of the faith that we have covered. Sometimes the best way to teach a brother concerning a certain point is not in a meeting but by repeated personal contact over several weeks. In this way the point will not only be taught to him but also wrought into him.</p>
<p>We should not think that this kind of labor is slow, for it is the way to shepherd the saints in life. The Lord&rsquo;s way is the way of growth by life. Paul writes, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:6). This is a matter of life. Paul also says, &ldquo;You are God&rsquo;s cultivated land&rdquo; (v. 9). The local churches are fields for God to grow Christ. The way of life is not fast, but eventually we will see that it is not slow. When we have tried to be fast in the past, we have only been delayed, distracted, and defeated. If we are faithful to the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we will gain the increase. If we deviate from this way, there will be no increase in the long run. The lessons of the past should be sufficient to teach us that we must take the way of life.</p>
<p>The elders need to pray for a vision of the Lord&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, eternal plan, and accomplishments in time, such as creation, incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. They also need to pray for an understanding of why He came again as the life-giving Spirit and how and why the church was produced. Finally, they need to ask the Lord for a realization of why we are regenerated, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified. We need to pray about these things, learn them, and repeat them in the presence of the Lord until they are wrought into us. This is the way for every elder to be strengthened and enabled to teach. The teaching of the elders is a matter not of skill or technique but of having a clear view of what God wants, a clear vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO BE GOVERNED BY THE VISION</h2>
<p>We have not seen this vision if we consider the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to be an ordinary Christian work. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is absolutely different; it is something from deep in the heart of God and revealed in His Word. Our understanding and exposition of the Bible are different from traditional theology because we care for God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, whereas traditional theology cares for religious teachings. God has shown us His heart&rsquo;s desire. We all must see this vision. When we see it, it will make us absolutely different. If we see the vision of God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, we will never leave the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. If we do not see the vision, we will stay in the local churches as long as we feel that the meetings and the saints are good, but we may leave as soon as any suffering comes. Some have left the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery because of unfulfilled ambition to be an elder. Our vision should cause us to realize that whether or not we are an elder, this is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>A clear vision will safeguard us. Proverbs 29:18 says, &ldquo;Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint.&rdquo; Paul says, &ldquo;I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision&rdquo; (Acts 26:19). We must be a people with a vision. This vision should continually govern us and be our cause. Our vision, which is the mystery of the faith, comprises Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ. We should never think that we know this mystery sufficiently. We need to continually review God&rsquo;s full revelation in order to see this vision afresh. In every locality the elders should meet regularly to pray and fellowship about the vision and study the Bible and the ministry books to refresh their seeing of the vision.</p>
<p>The truths that we have seen in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, especially regarding the church, will be rejected and opposed by organized Christianity. In this sense, it is a suffering to be in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. If we were not for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, it would be easy to please others. Because we cannot compromise concerning the mystery of the faith in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we face opposition. The elders need to know all the contents of the mystery of the faith, how to teach in order to care for the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and how to teach in order to convict the opposers. Therefore, we need a thorough review of the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. For this we need to study the Bible concerning the mystery of the faith, and we need to receive help from the ministry books.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">NEEDING TO KNOW THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY<br />
IN LIFE AND TRUTH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will continue to consider the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We need to know the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in life and truth. These two items are inexhaustible topics in the Bible. Life is the Triune God, for the Father is in the Son, and the Son became the Spirit to be our life. The truth is the content of the Bible. Therefore, in order to have an adequate vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we have to know the recovery in the Triune God and through the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO KNOW THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY IN LIFE</h2>
<p>Many Christian workers have not seen life; they carry out their particular works without a realization of life. When they preach the gospel, they do not emphasize life. When they teach the Bible, they teach only doctrines and do not seek to minister life to others through their teaching. In the past in China there was a large publishing group in which several denominations participated to release Christian literature in Chinese. Of the many books they published, I did not read or hear of one that ministered life to the readers. Instead, they conveyed only Bible stories, doctrines, and Christian culture. Few Christians in the denominations know or minister life. When I was young, my family met with the Southern Baptists, who are fundamental and have sound teachings, but I never heard anything of life there. All that I heard was like husks and chaff, but there was no grain, no life. They have the term <em>life,</em> and they quote verses that mention life, such as John 10:10 and 14:6. However, they define life in these verses merely as everlasting blessing. In all my years among them I never heard that Christ can be life to us in our daily living or that Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>Although in the local churches we have seen something concerning life, there have been periods in our history when we deviated from life. We forgot what we were doing for a time and missed the mark. Sometimes even the so-called release of the spirit has not been on the line of life&mdash;it was not the genuine release of the spirit. The real content of some apparently high meetings was not life but entertainment. It is possible for us to be misled concerning life, because life is deep, abstract, and mysterious. As a result, some are distracted from life by tongue-speaking, shouting, or other outward activities. We may also be misled from the line of life by eloquence or scriptural knowledge. These activities and natural abilities may be compared to physical images of Jesus, which some claim lead their viewers to remember the real Lord but which are actually deceiving idols. Attractive activities and abilities are idols in the eyes of God when we mistake them for life.</p>
<p>Life is mysterious and difficult to define and share with others, but our eyes must be opened to see that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is a recovery back to life. The degradation of Christianity is a deviation from life. Even a deviation to doctrines concerning life is still a deviation from life. There are few messages on life in Christian denominations today. Because some base their speaking on the Word of God, the Spirit is able to work on some of the listeners, but few speakers have the intention to minister life. This shows that Christianity has deviated from the central lane of life. It is easy to be attracted by a powerful evangelist, an eloquent teacher, or one who performs miracles. However, natural charisma, knowledge, eloquence, and miracles are not life and do not minister life.</p>
<p>The Bible establishes the principle that the degradation of Christianity, which began from the last part of the first century, is a deviation from life. The last ministry in the Bible is John&rsquo;s mending ministry, which uniquely brings the believers back to life. Yet many who read the Gospel of John, the Epistles of John, and Revelation do not realize that the purpose of these writings is to bring us back to life. The deviation of Christianity from life has continued from the New Testament time down to the present.</p>
<p>Brother Watchman Nee was a pattern of one who never deviated from life in spite of many seemingly positive attractions. There were several contemporary Christian workers in China who had apparently good works and great followings. I witnessed that Brother Nee was not moved even a bit to seek such outward success but was absolutely in life and for life. I also saw that some Christian workers came the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery but did not stay long because they were not for life but were for a successful work, movement, or career. Even many believers who remained in the local churches did not know life. They stayed because they felt that the local churches were the best place to hear good doctrines from the Bible. Thirty years ago in mainland China, I heard many say this. They came to the meetings and were genuine and moral Christians who cared for proper doctrines, but they lacked life.</p>
<p>We need to ask ourselves what we are doing in the local churches. Are we doing an ordinary Christian work? Is our goal merely to have the best doctrines? We need to see that the purpose of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to bring us back to God Himself as our life. I have no interest in anything but life. I have studied the Bible daily for more than fifty years, but I have no interest in mere scriptural knowledge, because it is like chaff. Life is God Himself&mdash;the God who created the universe, was incarnated, lived on the earth in humanity for thirty-three and a half years, died on the cross, passed through death and Hades, entered into resurrection, ascended to the heavens as a man, and became the life-giving Spirit to enter into us as our life. Therefore, life implies a great deal. God ordained that His chosen, called, saved, and regenerated people should live this life&mdash;the processed God, who is real, practical, available, and even one with us.</p>
<p>I am not proud that the Lord has revealed these things to us. Instead, my heart aches for the pitiful situation of millions of Christians today who do not know life. Many even reject, despise, criticize, and try to damage the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. If our vision is clear, we will not be bothered by such ones but will pity them because they do not know life. We should similarly pity those who have gone out from among us. However, we mainly need to consider our own situation and whether we truly know life. In the past many in the local churches have deviated from life. Even if we truly care only for life, we must be careful not to give others even the impression that we care more for anything else, such as increasing the number of believers in our meetings or the number of local churches. Life grows on its own; the growth of life is not our doing. I believe that the Lord sovereignly allowed the recent turmoil in the churches in order to give us a negative background that will help us to see what life is. From now on we must have a definite vision concerning life.</p>
<p>We need to pray that the Lord would cause us to see life. Although we may have heard many messages concerning life, it is possible that we may have never seen life. As genuine believers, we have life, but if we have seen life in a practical way, we will be able to discern life and not be misled if some try to lead the church in a wrong direction. No man&rsquo;s speaking alone can give us a vision or cause us to see life. Our seeing of life depends entirely on the Lord, but we need to have a seeking heart. We must not be content with the situation in Christianity or with our own situation. Our standard must be God Himself, who is our life. If we know God in all the items from creation to our glorification, we know what life is.</p>
<p>If we know life, we will be able to discern that some so-called holiness and power are not life. Brother Nee told me that when he was young, he would often go to hear famous preachers who visited the big cities in China to hold revival meetings. Afterward, he would go to see Miss M. E. Barber, an older sister who gave him much spiritual help, and would tell her how good the speaking was. Miss Barber went with him on several occasions to hear these preachers. Brother Nee often appreciated the power, eloquence, and knowledge of the speakers. However, Miss Barber pointed out to him that these things are not life but natural human ability. Brother Nee was eventually helped to see that things such as eloquence, ability, and charisma are not life. Miss Barber could discern life because she knew life. We need a vision in order to similarly know life.</p>
<p>The elders should not try to learn methods for establishing, organizing, and pastoring a local church. These kinds of subjects are taught in seminary courses. We do not need any such techniques. Instead, we need to see a vision concerning what life is. To know the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in life is to know God as our life in experience. We should be able to tell others how we definitely experienced the Lord as our life.</p>
<p>Life is not miracles. The Lord did not trust those who believed because of miracles. John 2:23-24 says, &ldquo;When He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed into His name when they saw the signs which He did. But Jesus Himself did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew all men.&rdquo; John is a book of life. Whoever cares for miracles does not know life. John 2 ends with this word about the Lord&rsquo;s not entrusting Himself to those who believed because of miraculous signs, and chapter 3 begins with the word <em>but,</em> indicating that what follows is different. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;But there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.&rdquo; Nicodemus came to the Lord not to see miracles but to seek something deeper. Therefore, in chapter 3 the Lord opened Himself to this seeking one regarding regeneration, which is altogether a matter of life (vv. 3, 5). The Gospel of John is the unique Gospel of life. Miracles are what God can do with His power, but life is God Himself coming into us so that we may live, experience, enjoy, and be one with Him.</p>
<p>Seeing such a vision concerning life will make us different. This is what we need. In past turmoils many saints in the local churches were deceived because their vision concerning life was inadequate. If a man does not know what real gold looks like, he can be cheated by someone selling a lesser substitute. If we have a proper and definite vision, a clear view, concerning life, no one will be able to deceive us. For this reason, we all need to pray definite prayers asking the Lord to show us a clear vision of life. Along with such prayer, we also need to study particular verses and books in the Bible. Reading certain ministry books concerning life can also help us. However, studying alone is not adequate to see life&mdash;we must have the prayer.</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO KNOW THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY IN TRUTH</h2>
<p>The truth is the content of the Bible. In between doctrine and light is the truth. According to the human mentality, the Bible appears to be a book of many doctrines concerning matters such as God, man&rsquo;s fall, and salvation. Anyone who is literate can read the Bible and learn such doctrines. The truth is the reality conveyed in the doctrines. It is possible to know the doctrines but not have the truth, the reality. When I was a youth, I heard the pastor of my family&rsquo;s denomination preach that Jesus is the Savior who died for all men. I heard this doctrine, but I did not receive the truth. Before I was saved, I could even teach the doctrines concerning Christ and salvation. My mother had been baptized in our denomination, but she was not saved. Nevertheless, she taught her children many Bible stories, and she told us that Jesus was the Savior who died on the cross. That was only a story and a doctrine to us. We did not realize the truth.</p>
<p>When we realize the truth, we have the reality. Christ becomes living to us, and His death becomes real to us as an event that took place specifically for the forgiveness of our sins. We receive the reality that is conveyed in the doctrines. Such reality can be revealed to us and realized by us only through the Spirit. For this reason, if two speakers give more or less the same message, one may preach only doctrine, but the other ministers the reality, because the power of the Holy Spirit is in his preaching. The power of the Holy Spirit makes preached doctrines real to the listeners&mdash;it gives them the reality, the fact. Truth is the reality conveyed in the doctrines and realized through the Spirit. The Bible has many doctrines, but few readers of the Bible receive the truth. Anyone can read the term <em>the church</em> in the Bible, but few have seen or touched the reality of the church. When the Spirit operates, the church becomes no longer only a doctrine but a truth, a reality, to us.</p>
<p>If we have truth, we have light, for truth is the shining of light, just as grace is the expression of love. In the Gospel of John we see grace and reality, which is truth. John 1:17 says, &ldquo;Grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Grace and reality in the Gospel of John become love and light in 1 John. First John 4:8 says, &ldquo;God is love.&rdquo; First John 1:5 says, &ldquo;God is light.&rdquo; Love is the source of grace, and grace is the expression of love. In the same principle, light is the source of truth, and truth is the shining of light. If we know only doctrine and lack the truth, we do not have light. Once doctrine becomes truth to us, light shines within us, and we have light. To know the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in truth implies both doctrine and light, for the doctrines in the Bible convey truth, and truth is the shining of God as the divine light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DOCTRINE BECOMING TRUTH,<br />
TRUTH BECOMING LIGHT,<br />
AND LIGHT BECOMING LIFE</h2>
<p>Truth is the shining of light, and the divine light is life (John 1:4). This brings us back to life. We may know that life is the Triune God, but we still need the truth, the shining of the Triune God in many aspects, in order to have the riches of life. The shining of the divine light in its many aspects is the riches of life.</p>
<p>We first must have the doctrines in order to have the truth. Thus, Christian workers and the fundamental denominations that lack life are still helpful if they preach correct doctrines, for eventually those doctrines may become the truth. Without the doctrine, the truth cannot come. Many missionaries who went to China taught only doctrines, but without their work many Chinese would have never heard that Jesus is the Savior who died on the cross for sinners. Eventually, some of the Chinese who heard this doctrine realized and received the truth that Jesus was their Savior. Through the doctrines we see the truths. Doctrine becoming truth in us is the shining of light, and the light is life.</p>
<p>Concerning the proper ground of the church, we first must know the doctrine. Then, perhaps through our prayer and hunger for the truth, the Lord will enlighten us, giving us the shining of light. Through the Lord&rsquo;s enlightening, the doctrine of the ground of the church becomes truth, a shining within us. This shining joins us to the light, and the light becomes life. Thus, even the ground of the church is an aspect of the riches of life. To see the light, the truth, of the ground of the church makes us different in life. One who truly sees the ground of the church is different from one who remains in the church yet does not know or see anything concerning the truth of the ground of the church.</p>
<p>We need to know the Lord&rsquo;s recovery both in life and in truth, which means in the Triune God and in the Bible. For this reason, we need to study the Bible daily, because from the Bible we first receive the doctrines. Through God&rsquo;s enlightening, the doctrines become truth and the shining of the divine light in us. Then we are joined to the light, and the light becomes life to us. This is what we need.</p>
<p>All the riches of life are in the truth. Every truth is an aspect of the riches of life. In our experience it is first a doctrine; then it becomes a truth, which joins us to the light, and that particular aspect of the light becomes life to us in one of life&rsquo;s rich aspects. This is difficult to explain and analyze, but our experience confirms it. When we read the Bible, we first get doctrine, then the truth, then light, and finally life. This is the procedure. We cannot have life first. We first learn the doctrine by reading, then we see the truth, then the light shines, then light becomes life, and we receive the riches of life. Often during one time in the Word, we experience all four&mdash;doctrine, truth, light, and life. However, it takes a long time to realize some truths. After knowing a doctrine for several years, in one particular time of prayer with the Lord it may become real to us as truth and the shining of light, bringing us the riches of life.</p>
<p>We must know the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in life and truth. Those who are truly in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery know God in a living way and know the Bible in the way of light. We have to pray for this to be our experience. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not an activity, movement, or ordinary Christian work but a matter of life and truth in light. We are truly in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery if we know God and the Bible, have life and truth, and are full of light. Christians who are not genuinely seeking the Lord will not understand what we are doing and teaching in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. They may be offended and criticize us. We cannot avoid this, but there are always a few like Nicodemus, who are sincere, hungry, and seeking after the Lord&rsquo;s heart. The Lord reveals Himself to such ones, and they become part of His recovery.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>

IN LIFE AND TRUTH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW TESTAMENT REVELATION CONCERNING LIFE</h2>
<p>For centuries the human mind has been in captivity to religious and natural concepts. For this reason, many read the Bible for years but do not see what it reveals. We are short because we are veiled by our natural concepts. Of the four Gospels, only John emphasizes life. We must set aside our natural concepts in order to see life revealed in John. John does not begin his Gospel with Jesus&rsquo; human birth. Instead, he opens from eternity: &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (1:1). John 1:3 says, &ldquo;All things came into being through Him.&rdquo; Then verse 4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; When Matthew speaks of life, it concerns the blessing of eternal life in the coming age (7:14; 19:16-17), but the life spoken of in John is present in Christ.</p>
<p>John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality.&rdquo; Verse 17 says, &ldquo;Grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The items mentioned in these verses are all related to life. This life is a person, Christ Himself (11:25; 14:6). Grace and reality are our experience of the life that is Christ. We have to spend much time to know who and what Christ is. Christ being life may sound simple, but John&rsquo;s twenty-one chapters reveal many aspects of this wonderful person.</p>
<p>Regrettably, when most Christians read John, they see only stories and miracles, and they miss life. John 3 concerns regeneration, which is to receive the divine life by being born of God, but this is a mystery to most Christians. John 1:12-13 says, &ldquo;As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&rdquo; These verses clearly reveal that whoever receives the Lord and believes into His name becomes a child of God by being born of Him. This is not a small thing. We should be deeply impressed that we were born of God when we were saved through believing.</p>
<p>Some in Christianity deny that we receive God&rsquo;s life and nature through regeneration. However, every living thing has the life and nature of the being of which it was born. Whatever is born of a lion is a lion with the lion life and nature. To say that such an animal is anything other than a lion is illogical. This shows that many Christians are clouded by natural concepts. They dare not say that we are children of God who possess the divine life and nature. However, 2 Peter 1:4 says, &ldquo;He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature.&rdquo; Since we were born of God, we surely have God&rsquo;s nature. Of course, we do not possess the Godhead as deities to be worshipped, but because we are born of God, and God is our Father, we are the same as He is in life and nature. Nevertheless, many Christians deny this truth. Therefore, they do not understand regeneration in John 3.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John is not a record of stories and miracles but a description, a detailed portrait, of various aspects of Christ as life to us. In 10:10 the Lord said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly.&rdquo; In 11:25 He said, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life.&rdquo; The Lord being the resurrection and the life indicates that He is a life that can withstand, overcome, and never be conquered or terminated by death. In 14:6 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the way and the reality and the life.&rdquo; If we only see the stories and are attracted by miracles when we read John, this means that our concept is natural, and we lack the heavenly revelation. With revelation we will see that the miracles were done to signify something deeper about life. Miracles are not the goal. The apostle Paul did many miracles, but he did not heal himself or his co-workers Timothy and Trophimus (Acts 19:11-12; 1 Tim. 5:23; 2 Tim. 4:20). Paul had a thorn in his flesh, which was a physical sickness (2 Cor. 12:7). After he asked the Lord three times that it would depart, the Lord said, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you&rdquo; (vv. 8-9). Grace is Christ Himself as life experienced by us.</p>
<p>Most Christians who read the Bible pay attention to miracles but not to grace. They do not see that grace is Christ as life in our experience. Even many so-called great teachers of the past centuries did not see life. Martin Luther was used by the Lord to recover the truth of justification by faith, but Luther did not see life. I found only doctrine and no life in Luther&rsquo;s writings. Kaspar Schwenckfeld, a contemporary of Luther, saw something of life, but Luther called him a fool possessed by the devil. William Law, an eighteenth-century teacher, was initially concerned only with doctrinal knowledge of the Bible, but one day he had a turn and saw life. It is good to read his book <em>The Power of the Spirit.</em> Yet Schwenckfeld and Law did not see as much as we see today. In the same principle, an ordinary electrician today knows more about electricity than the great inventor Thomas Edison. Therefore, we do not boast, but we thank and worship the Lord that He has shown us more than what the great teachers of the past have seen.</p>
<p>Because Luther did not see what Schwenckfeld saw, Luther considered him to be heretical. This indicates that seeing means a great deal. Those who do not see consider those who do see to be heretical. When I was young, I read Luther&rsquo;s expositions on Romans and Galatians. Compared to what we see today, his exposition is elementary. He saw the doctrine of justification by faith, but the main point of Galatians is life. Justification by faith is only a beginning; the result is life. In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; Justification issues in life so that we can have this experience. Luther did not see this. Although Romans has sixteen chapters, Luther covered mainly the first four chapters in his exposition. <em>Life-study of Romans</em> points out that Romans has four stations&mdash;justification, sanctification, the Body, and the churches (p. 393). Luther saw only the first station. We may compare the first station to elementary school and the next three stations to high school, college, and graduate school, respectively. Nevertheless, theologians today still hold Luther in high regard and may be offended by this comparison. Few in Christianity have seen the later stations in Romans. Few practice the genuine church life, because they have no idea about these things.</p>
<p>Many in the local churches are still quite natural in their concepts concerning the spiritual things and their understanding of the Bible. They remain under a thick veil of their natural concepts. Some are still distracted by miracles, thinking that miracles and divine healing are life. These things are not life, for their effects are temporary, but life is eternal. The resurrection of Lazarus was not life but a miracle, because he eventually died again. Life is <em>zoe,</em> the eternal, divine life, which never dies. John 2:23-24 says, &ldquo;When He [Jesus] was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed into His name when they saw the signs which He did. But Jesus Himself did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew all men.&rdquo; The Lord did not entrust Himself to those who believed because of miracles. We have to see that miracles are not life. The Lord did miracles, and He still does miracles in certain situations today. However, His main intention is to impart life to man. In some situations the Lord will not do a miracle. For instance, He did not remove Paul&rsquo;s physical infirmity so that Paul would experience more grace, more life.</p>
<p>We need to see that life is a person&mdash;the Triune God, who in Christ has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension and has come into us as the life-giving Spirit to be our life and to mingle with us. Because we have received Him, we have been regenerated, are being transformed, and will be conformed to His image and glorified. The Christian life is not an exchanged life but a grafted, mingled, regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified life. This is beyond our human thought. It is easy to understand an exchanged life&mdash;because our life is bad, and Jesus&rsquo; life is wonderful, we trade our life for a better one. However, according to the Bible, we are grafted into Christ and mingled with Him (Rom. 11:17; 1 Cor. 6:17). The Lord does not nullify our humanity but fills, transforms, and uplifts it. Regeneration, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification are the work of life within us, and this life is the processed Triune God who became the life-giving Spirit to dwell in our spirit and be one with us. This is why Paul is able to say, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). This experience is a matter of life.</p>
<p>In Christianity I was taught to hope to be raptured, to be suddenly taken up by the Lord into glory. However, according to the Bible, glorification is part of a lifelong process (Rom. 8:30). Christ is the processed Triune God who is dwelling within us as our life and mingling Himself with us to sanctify, transform, conform, and eventually glorify us. This is beyond our natural, human concept; we need the heavenly vision to see this.</p>
<p>We need to see that life is a wonderful person who is both God and man, who passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, and who is now the indwelling Spirit. John 7:39 says, &ldquo;The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; At that time the Spirit was not yet. But since the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, the Spirit has been, and He is now within us and is everything to us. This is what we mean by life. We need a vision of this profound reality.</p>
<p>Revelation depicts the churches as golden lampstands (1:12, 20; 2:1). The church can be golden, having God&rsquo;s nature, because His life is being worked into the believers through their regeneration, transformation, conformation, and glorification. Apart from this process, there is no way for the church to be a golden lampstand, a shining testimony of God&rsquo;s nature. The churches are seen as golden lampstands in Revelation because in God&rsquo;s eyes, in His eternal view, the church is altogether divine. The church is divine because Christ, the divine person, has been wrought into it. The lampstand was patterned to depict the Triune God (Exo. 25:31-40). The golden substance signifies God the Father in His divine nature, the form of the lampstand signifies God the Son as the embodiment and expression of the Father, and the seven lamps signify God the Spirit as the seven Spirits of God for His expression. This implies that the church is the Triune God&rsquo;s reproduction not in the Godhead as a deity to be worshiped but in life, nature, and expression. Life is not only our experiences, such as the law of life, the sense of life, the fellowship of life, and the anointing, but primarily the Triune God dispensing Himself into us and making us one in Him to be the golden lampstands. We need to see a vision of the churches as the lampstands&mdash;the embodiment and expression of the Triune God. When we see this vision, we will know what life is.</p>
<p>The New Testament revelation concerning life is that the Triune God becomes one with His chosen and redeemed people and that they become His embodiment. This is what the Bible means by life. The Lord Himself told us that He is life (John 11:25; 14:6), and Paul in Colossians 3:4 says, &ldquo;When Christ our life is manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in glory.&rdquo; Christ is our life, and glory is His expression. When we are manifested with Him in glory, we will be exactly the same as He is in life, nature, and expression.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VISION OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY IN LIFE</h2>
<p>If we see the revelation in the Bible concerning life, we will know what the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is. It is not any kind of work, movement, activity, teaching, or practice but a living of the life that is the Triune God. Once we see this, nothing will distract us, because nothing else is as valuable, precious, or high. The churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are the lampstands in Revelation, which are the testimony of Jesus and the embodiment of the Triune God. We have to know the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in life. This vision will keep us; it has kept me. It was this vision that kept Brother Nee while he was imprisoned for twenty years. Perhaps no other Christian in history has been in prison for the Lord&rsquo;s sake for so long without changing his belief. I believe that what kept him without any change was this vision. I can testify concerning him because I was with him.</p>
<p>If we have the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in life, no matter what happens, we will be kept in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery without any change. No one will be able to persuade us to change, because we have the best. If a man possesses costly gold and realizes what he has, no one will be able to convince him to exchange it for something less valuable. Nothing is better or higher than what the Lord has revealed to us in His recovery. If we see this, we will never be convinced to change. I have seen the vision clearly for forty-five years, since 1933. In myself I am weak, but I cannot deny what I have seen. This is what burdens me to share with others. We need to see the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in life&mdash;the Triune God in Christ realized as the indwelling Spirit to be our life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTION AND ANSWER</h2>
<p><em>Question: Is it possible to have life outside the proper church life?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There are two aspects of the Christian life: the individual aspect and the corporate aspect. Regeneration is an individual matter; the church life is a corporate matter. The individual aspect is for the corporate aspect. Outside the church life, people can be regenerated to receive the divine life, but without the church life, people will not have the abundance of life. In church history many people have been regenerated and to some extent transformed without experiencing the proper church life, but they did not have the abundance of life. We experience life individually, but because our individual experience is for the corporate aspect, we must be in the practical church life in order to have the abundance of life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>

<h2 class="head1">THE NEW TESTAMENT REVELATION<br />
CONCERNING TRUTH</h2>
<p>First and 2 Timothy, Titus, and 2 and 3 John, which were written during the degradation of the church, do not stress life as 1 John does but instead emphasize the truth. The following verses from these Epistles all mention the truth. First Timothy 2:4 says, &ldquo;[God] desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth.&rdquo; First Timothy 3:15 says, &ldquo;I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.&rdquo; First Timothy 4:3 says, &ldquo;Who forbid marriage and command abstaining from foods, which God has created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who believe and have full knowledge of the truth.&rdquo; Titus 1:1 says, &ldquo;Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God&rsquo;s chosen ones and the full knowledge of the truth, which is according to godliness.&rdquo; Second John 1-2 says, &ldquo;The elder to the chosen lady and to her children, whom I love in truthfulness, and not only I but also all those who know the truth, for the sake of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever.&rdquo; Verse 4 says, &ldquo;I rejoiced greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.&rdquo; Third John 1 says, &ldquo;The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truthfulness.&rdquo; Verses 3 through 4 say, &ldquo;I rejoiced greatly at the brothers&rsquo; coming and testifying to your steadfastness in the truth, even as you walk in truth. I have no greater joy than these things, that I hear that my children are walking in the truth.&rdquo; Verse 8 says, &ldquo;We therefore ought to support such ones that we may become fellow workers in the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In previous chapters we have seen what it is to know the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in life. We also need to know the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in truth. Like life, the truth is not altogether clear to the saints. According to the natural concept, the word <em>truth</em> is taken to mean &ldquo;doctrines&rdquo; or &ldquo;principles,&rdquo; such as the popular proverb, &ldquo;Honesty is the best policy.&rdquo; However, in the Bible <em>truth</em> means something else. The Greek word for <em>truth</em> in the New Testament is sometimes translated as &ldquo;reality&rdquo; or &ldquo;truthfulness.&rdquo; It is used in John 1:17, which says, &ldquo;Grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The same word appears in John 4:24, which says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&rdquo; Paul writes in 1 Timothy 3:15 that the church is &ldquo;the pillar and base of the truth.&rdquo; These cases show that we cannot understand truth according to the natural concept.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament usage, <em>truth</em> means that which is real. In John 14:6 Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the way and the reality and the life.&rdquo; Christ is not the doctrine or the principle but the reality. Every positive thing in the universe is a type of Christ. The sun, the air, the water, and food are types and shadows of Christ, who is the real sun, air, water, and food. Likewise, all human virtues, such as love, holiness, kindness, patience, and humility, are shadows, the reality of which is Christ. He is the real love, holiness, kindness, patience, and humility. The Old Testament offerings are also shadows; Christ is the reality of every offering&mdash;the sin offering, the trespass offering, the peace offering, the meal offering, the drink offering, the burnt offering, the wave offering, and the heave offering. Even the words we speak are a shadow. Christ must be our word&mdash;our expression, speech, eloquence, and utterance. In the entire universe, only Christ is real; He is the reality. Thus, in the New Testament the word <em>truth</em> denotes Christ as the reality. Accordingly, in John 8 <em>the truth</em> and <em>the Son</em> are used synonymously: John 8:32 says, &ldquo;You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.&rdquo; Verse 36 says, &ldquo;If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed.&rdquo; Christ, the Son, is the truth. When we read the New Testament, we should not understand the word <em>truth</em> according to the natural concept; instead, we must realize that it indicates Christ as the reality.</p>
<p>In previous chapters we have seen that the truth is in between doctrine and light. We have also seen that the truth is the content of the Bible. When people read the Bible, they first receive doctrines. When the Holy Spirit enlightens the words of the Bible, the doctrines become reality, truth. Without the enlightening of the Spirit, we have only empty doctrines. The truth is conveyed in doctrines, yet the truth in the doctrines can be realized only by the enlightening of the Spirit. When the doctrines become the truth, it brings light, for the truth is the shining of the light. When we see the truth, light shines within us. The purpose of our having truth is so that life would be imparted to us. When the Spirit enlightens us, the doctrines we know become truth, which brings light, and light brings life.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say whether light or life comes first. John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; This verse implies that life comes before light. The same order is also implied in the phrase <em>the light of life</em> in 8:12. However, in creation light came first. God created light on the first day, and life did not appear until the third day. The reason it is hard to say whether light or life comes first is that the two are one. When one is present, the other is also present. Nevertheless, we must see that life is the goal. God&rsquo;s intention is that we would have life. The way to have life is by means of light. It is because God is light that we are able to receive Him as life. In order for Him to be our life, He must first be light to us. In order for us to know and possess Him as life, we must see light. God&rsquo;s goal is to impart Himself to us as life, but this requires His being light as the procedure.</p><h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S WORD IN THE BIBLE<br />
AND PROPER PRAYER</h2>
<p>We need to see why the truth is the necessary step to our receiving God as light. In other words, we need to see why, in addition to God, we need the Bible. Without God, the Bible is not light or life to us. The Bible itself is not the reality. The Bible is God&rsquo;s speaking, His utterance, and God Himself is the content, the reality, of the Bible. However, without the Bible man could not know God. Without God&rsquo;s word recorded in the Bible, we could not know God as light or life.</p>
<p>We need to see the importance of God&rsquo;s word in the Bible. A basic principle in the New Testament is that the word is necessary for believing. Romans 10:17 says, &ldquo;Faith comes out of hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.&rdquo; In other words, believing comes from hearing the word. Moreover, without God&rsquo;s word in the Bible, there would be nothing to believe in. Thus, John 5:24 says, &ldquo;He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life.&rdquo; In order to understand and believe into God and receive Him as life, we need His word in the Bible. Like electrical wires, which transmit electricity, the Bible transmits God as life.</p>
<p>In order to know the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in truth, we need to know the Bible not only in the way of doctrine but also in the way of truth. When we know the Bible in truth, we have the shining of light, which causes us to have life. Therefore, how much life we have depends on how much truth we know. An ignorant believer, even if he loves the Lord to the uttermost, cannot have the abundance of life, because he is lacking in truth.</p>
<p>We must spend time in the Word, which will first be doctrine to us. Then the doctrine must become truth to us by the enlightening of the Spirit. There is no need to pray to get doctrine; whoever reads the Bible can get doctrine. However, in order for doctrine to become truth to us, we need to pray much and in the proper way. For this, we need to deal with the Lord and be dealt with by Him, and we need to have a clear conscience and a purified mind, will, and emotion. Then we need to open our entire being from our spirit and pray. The more we pray in this way, the more the Spirit will enlighten us to cause doctrines to become truth. Unbelievers and believers alike can read the Bible and learn doctrines. However, in order for doctrines to become truth to us, we need to pray, be dealt with, open to the Lord, and be willing to give up our desires, choices, and preferences, which can be veils to us. There will be no shadows, veils, or coverings to frustrate the Spirit&rsquo;s enlightening, which causes the doctrines we know to become truth to us. The truth is the shining of light, which brings life to us. This is why we need to know the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in truth.</p>
<p>Paul stresses the matter of truth in his later Epistles, when the church was in degradation. When the church is abnormal and in a time of degradation, there is an urgent need of the truth. This need is met when the doctrines in the Bible become truth to us, for then we are in the light and freed from the darkness of degradation. Because of the situation of Christianity today, there is the urgent need of truth as the shining of light, which will bring in life.</p>
<p>As elders in the local churches, we need to know the truth of the Bible. We must not be content with doctrines, which in themselves are empty and vain. Instead, we must daily pray, open, and spend time to touch the Lord. We must be willing to allow Him to touch us and deal with us, especially with our conscience so that we can hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience (1 Tim. 3:9). Then the doctrines of the Bible will become truth to us. We may come to the meetings, listen to messages, and read the Bible, but if we are indifferent and do not spend time opening in prayer, the doctrines will not become truth to us. As a result, we may accumulate much doctrinal knowledge but lack the truth. Doctrines become truth to us only when we mean business with the Lord by touching Him, being willing to be touched and dealt with by Him, and having a purged conscience and an open spirit with a sincere heart that seeks after God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire. If we are this kind of person, the doctrines in the Bible will become truth to us one by one, which will bring us light and life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO HAVE THE ABUNDANCE OF LIFE<br />
AND TO FLOW OUT RIVERS OF LIVING WATER<br />
BEING TO HAVE AND SPEAK THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>Life and truth have one goal&mdash;the abundance of life. &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly&rdquo; (John 10:10). In order to have the abundance of life, we first must read the Bible to learn the doctrines in the Bible. Someone who does not read the Bible cannot be rich in life. Believers who read the Bible only when they feel inspired are spiritually starving; such ones cannot have the abundance of life. However, to read the Bible does not automatically cause us to have the abundance of life. We still need the doctrines to become truth to us. For this reason, the New Testament encourages us not mainly to know doctrines but to fully know and walk in the truth. The apostle John loved the saints in truthfulness (2 John 1; 3 John 1). Because the Christian life is a matter of truth, Christian love must also be a matter of truth. If we do not possess the truth and walk in the truth, we cannot love others in truthfulness. It is possible to love others in darkness, but when we know the truth and walk in the truth, we love in the truth and in light.</p>
<p>The main point we need to see is the way to turn doctrines to life, or put in other words, the way to have the abundance of life. John 7:38 says, &ldquo;He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; The rivers of living water are different aspects of life, including love, patience, humility, and all the riches of Christ, but we need to see how to practice this, how to cause these aspects of life to flow out of us. These rivers of life flow out through the truth. Actually, every river is a truth. If we do not speak, nothing can flow out. In order to speak, we must know the doctrines and possess the truth. We cannot speak concerning Christ as love or patience if we have no knowledge of the truth concerning the riches of Christ. In order for the riches of Christ to flow out of us as rivers of living water, we must have and speak the truth.</p>
<p>The way to have the abundance of life and to flow out the riches of life is the way of the truth. We first need to know the doctrines. Then as we are open to the Lord and pray much, the Spirit will come to enlighten the doctrines, and they will become truth, which brings light and life. The more truth we have, the more riches of Christ as life we enjoy. Eventually, we will have the abundance of life. The abundance of life is altogether in the truth. When we release the truth by speaking, that is the flowing out of the riches of life. In order to minister life to others, we must speak, and in order to speak, we must read the Bible and study the truth to learn the doctrines. Without the doctrines we cannot have the truth, and without the truth there is no light or life.</p>
<p>The truth is altogether a matter of speaking. Our God is a speaking God. Hebrews 1:1-2 says, &ldquo;God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s speaking is first conveyed to us in the form of doctrines, which become the truth to us through the Spirit&rsquo;s enlightening. The truth is the shining of light, which brings us life. This means that in order to have the abundance of life, we must know the truth.</p>
<p>In order for an elder to be apt to teach, as 1 Timothy 3:2 requires, he must know the truth. An elder does not need to be a gifted teacher but should be apt to teach the saints, as parents should be apt to teach their children at home. Yet even for this kind of home teaching, one must have a certain amount of knowledge. In the local churches the principle is the same&mdash;every elder must have adequate knowledge of the truth. The elders also must have an abundance of light and life. Then they will be apt to teach. Not every elder needs to give messages, but every elder must learn to speak in order to teach in small groups and larger meetings.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is absolutely a recovery of life&mdash;a recovery to bring us back to the Triune God in order to possess, experience, and enjoy Him as life. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not a matter of miracles, healing, or any kind of activity, movement, or practice, because these things are not the Triune God as life. In order to know the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we need to spend time in the Word so that we will know the doctrines, but the doctrines alone are not adequate. We must deal with the Lord, be dealt with by Him, and open ourselves in prayer. In this way there will be no veils, shadows, or frustrations to the Spirit&rsquo;s enlightening the doctrines we know so that they become truths to us. Because the truths are the riches of the Triune God as life to us, we will have the abundance of life and be part of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. If the elders practice this, they will be able to teach not by theological training but by experiencing the Triune God through the word in the Bible. This is what it means to know the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in life and truth. If the Lord gains the proper eldership among the local churches, He will have a way to go on. If we are faithful to Him, this will be worked out. This is absolutely different from a so-called revival; it is altogether a matter in life and truth.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">NEEDING TO KNOW THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY<br />
IN LIFE AND TRUTH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4, 14, 17; 8:32, 36; 14:6; Gal. 2:14; Eph. 1:13; 4:24</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, bring us into Your light. We long to see light in Your light. Lord, thank You that although we were born in darkness, we have been regenerated into light. We are no longer sons of darkness but are children of light. We need more light. Speak something to us that will bring us into light. Lord, we trust in You.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIC FACTORS IN JOHN</h2>
<p>In previous chapters we have seen that we need to know the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in life and truth. In this chapter we will continue to consider the matter of the truth. In order to know what the truth is, we must come to the Gospel of John. The word <em>truth</em> is rarely mentioned in Matthew, Mark, or Luke. Its revelation begins in John, the Gospel of life. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Because the Word is the first item mentioned in the Gospel of John, it must be very significant. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; In the Word, which is God, is life. Life is in the Word. Verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality.&rdquo; The Greek word for &ldquo;reality&rdquo; in this verse is translated as &ldquo;truth&rdquo; elsewhere (e.g., 8:32). John 1:17 says, &ldquo;The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The matters that we need to see in these verses are the Word, life, grace, and reality, or truth.</p>
<p>In chapter 8 the truth is mentioned again. Verse 32 says, &ldquo;You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.&rdquo; Verse 36 says, &ldquo;If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed.&rdquo; These two verses use <em>the truth</em> and <em>the Son</em> interchangeably, revealing that the truth is actually a person, Christ the Son. Chapter 14 also reveals this in verse 6, which says, &ldquo;Jesus said to him, I am the way and the reality and the life.&rdquo; Both the truth and the life are a person, Christ Himself. Verse 17 mentions the Spirit of reality, which is the &ldquo;another Comforter&rdquo; mentioned in verse 16. The first Comforter is the Son, and the second Comforter is the Spirit of reality, which is also mentioned in 15:26 and 16:13. In 17:17 the Lord prayed to the Father, &ldquo;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.&rdquo; The word of the Father is the truth, and this truth sanctifies the church.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John also covers the matter of light. John 1:4 says, &ldquo;The life was the light of men.&rdquo; In 8:12 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.&rdquo; The term <em>the light of life</em> indicates that life becomes light.</p>
<p>The Word, life, grace, reality, the Spirit of reality, and light&mdash;along with the Son and the Father&mdash;are the basic factors in the Gospel of John. In other words, John is composed with the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;the Word, life, light, grace, and reality, or truth. These terms may be familiar terms to us, but we need to see that all these factors are a person, God Himself. The Father, the Son, the Spirit, the Word, life, and light are God. Grace is God for our enjoyment, and truth is God revealed and realized.</p>
<p>On God&rsquo;s side, truth is God revealed; and on our side, it is God realized. When God reveals Himself, that is truth; and when we realize and touch God, that is also truth, or reality. When God is hidden, we do not have truth. The revelation of God is truth, but it needs our realization. Our realization goes along with God&rsquo;s revelation. We cannot have realization without revelation. The revelation of God brings forth the realization of God in us. This is truth.</p>
<p>As we have seen in previous chapters, when we have the truth, we have light, for truth is the shining of light. The shining of light is actually light itself. Furthermore, light brings in life; light becomes life. Life is our enjoyment of God, which is grace. Grace is God Himself&mdash;the Father embodied in the Son and the Son realized as the Spirit enjoyed by us&mdash;and God is the Word. Therefore, the basic factors in John are like a circle&mdash;the beginning is joined to the end. The beginning is the Word; the end is the truth, reality; and the Word and the truth are one. The basic factors in John are one; they are all aspects of the Triune God. We must see this in order to understand what the truth is.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TRUTH BEING<br />
GOD HIMSELF AS THE REALITY</h2>
<p>We have seen that truth is the real content of doctrines, but we must also see that truth is nothing less than God Himself. In Galatians 2:14 Paul says that Peter and the other Jewish believers who refused to eat with Gentile believers &ldquo;were not walking in a straightforward way in relation to the truth of the gospel.&rdquo; We sometimes speak of certain truths, such as the truth of the church, the truth of the kingdom, or the truth of baptism. According to this usage, <em>the truth</em> means a doctrine or teaching. However, the truth of the gospel is the reality of the gospel&mdash;God revealed and realized. Christians who emphasize doctrinal teaching may argue that the truth of the gospel in Galatians 2 is that, according to the New Testament gospel, the Gentile believers can eat with the Jewish believers. This argument is apparently right, but it is shortsighted&mdash;it not the truth but a doctrine. The truth of the gospel is God revealed and realized because it is not a matter of whether the Gentiles can eat with the Jews but a matter of whether the Gentiles can enjoy God. In the Old Testament economy the Gentiles were alienated from enjoying God, but in the New Testament economy the Gentiles are allowed to enjoy God with the Jews. This is the truth of the gospel. We must come to God Himself as the truth.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:13 says, &ldquo;In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation.&rdquo; In this verse <em>the word of the truth</em> and <em>the gospel of your salvation</em> are synonyms. Therefore, the truth is not a doctrine but salvation, which is the Lord Himself. When we touch the content of any doctrine, if we do not touch God Himself, we still do not have the truth. Most Christians think that we have the truth when we understand the contents of the doctrine. However, that is not truth but still doctrine. When we touch God, we have truth.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:24 says, &ldquo;Put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.&rdquo; It is crucial to see what the reality is here. Some versions translate &ldquo;righteous and holiness of the reality&rdquo; as &ldquo;righteousness and true holiness&rdquo; (e.g., KJV). However, in Greek the definite article is emphatic, indicating a noun. The reality is not a small thing, for the new man was created in righteousness and holiness of the reality. In this verse the words <em>according to God</em> reveal that the reality is God Himself. According to the factors in John, the reality, the truth, is God as the Word, as the Father embodied in the Son and the Son realized as the Spirit to be life, light, and grace for our enjoyment. It was in the righteousness and holiness of such a reality that the new man was created.</p>
<p>Some Christians argue a great deal about matters such as whether to use wine or grape juice at the Lord&rsquo;s table. They call their teachings the truth, and they say that others who teach differently do not have the truth. Actually, the teachings that they insist on are not the truth but doctrines, for the truth is God Himself. Other Christians stress matters such as the form of baptism, head covering, and the timing of the rapture. Such doctrinal teachings are not truth, because they are not God. Nevertheless, the revelation in the Bible concerning baptism, head covering, and the rapture does convey God as the truth. Brother Watchman Nee never introduced a teaching without God as the content. Whatever he taught was the truth, for it was full of God.</p>
<p>In our study of the Bible and Christian literature, we should not merely collect doctrines without God. Teachings emphasizing outward forms are vain doctrines. Truth is God revealed and realized in His many aspects, such as the basic factors we have seen in the Gospel of John. A teaching that does not convey God is not truth but a mere doctrine. Whether a teacher ministers truth to us or merely doctrine depends on whether his teaching ministers God to us. If God is ministered in his teaching, what he speaks is not merely doctrine but truth. Although he may be an eloquent and knowledgeable scholar, if his speaking does not minister God, it is not truth but mere doctrine.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;holiness&rdquo; people, such as the Amish, teach that Christians should wear only certain colors and styles of clothing. They have some scriptural basis, because 1 Timothy 2:9 says that women should &ldquo;adorn themselves in proper clothing with modesty and sobriety.&rdquo; However, their teachings about clothing are not the truth, because they do not convey God. Therefore, such teachings are not much different from the teachings of Confucius. We should not teach in this way. Even in teaching the sisters to wear modest apparel, we must minister God in Christ as life, light, and grace for their enjoyment. When we enjoy the living Christ, He will tell us what to wear.</p>
<p>If we are not clear about what the truth is, we may be divided by disagreements over doctrines. The real truth, Christ Himself, will prevent such division. We should not argue about matters such as the proper way to immerse people when we baptize them. As long as we baptize them in the power of the Spirit to transfer them into Christ, the way they enter the water does not matter. The truth stops different opinions. Without the truth, the more we discuss such matters, the more we are loaded with vain and divisive doctrines. The Brethren were divided mainly by disagreements over so-called truths related to matters such as the timing of the rapture. When we touch the matter of rapture, we should care only to minister Christ as life, light, and grace. When we minister Christ into the saints, He will be the nourishment that causes them to grow. This will produce the maturity that is necessary to be raptured.</p>
<p>We do not care for doctrinal arguments about matters such as the timing of the rapture, because they do not convey the reality of God. However, we do care for the proper doctrines, which convey the truth. All teachings, including those printed in our books, are doctrines, but not all doctrines are the same. Doctrines that convey Christ as reality are like grain, but doctrines that do not minister Christ and only lead to division are like chaff. Second Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching.&rdquo; The proper teaching of the Scriptures ministers Christ as the reality. If we know what the truth is, we will not be deceived by empty doctrines. The doctrines in the Bible convey the truth, which is God Himself in many aspects.</p><h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: What is the relationship between our receiving of the truth and our experience of it?</em></p>
<p>Answer: When we see the truth, we receive it, and it becomes our experience. Our receiving of the truth ushers us into the experience of it. If we reject a particular teaching from the Bible, we are rejecting God in that aspect and cannot experience Him as such. However, we must be careful not to interpret the Bible according to our old, natural concepts, for this will cause us to miss important aspects of the truth. When we genuinely receive the truth, we experience and practice it. Therefore, any real truth always issues in our experience of God, even the matter of the ground of the church. When we see the truth of the church ground and receive it, we apply it and experience an abundance of life.</p>
<p>In previous chapters we saw that life is God and that the truth is the content of the Bible. God is life to us through His steps of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, descension, and indwelling. The content of the Bible is the truth because the Bible reveals God to us. However, when we read the Bible, it is merely doctrine to us until the Spirit enlightens us. For this reason, we must daily touch the Lord and allow Him to deal with us so that we will have a sincere heart, an open spirit, and a pure conscience. Then when we read the Bible, the Spirit will enlighten us, and the doctrines in the Bible will become truth to us, which is God Himself, who is light, life, and grace. Thus, our receiving of the truth is our experience of God as truth. Everything that we speak and teach must convey such truth; otherwise, it is mere doctrine.</p>
<p><em>Question: Is it all right to speak things that we have not yet fully experienced?</em></p>
<p>Answer: A great teacher once said, &ldquo;A good minister always speaks beyond what he has experienced.&rdquo; We should not speak in pretense, but we often must speak concerning things that we have not fully experienced. In a sense, our ministry must always be ahead of our experience. The apostle Paul ministered beyond what he had experienced when he wrote concerning glorification (Rom. 8:17, 30). John also ministered beyond his experience when he wrote concerning the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21&mdash;22).</p>
<p>Ministering beyond our experience differs from teaching doctrines without life. The things that the apostles Paul and John taught beyond their experience were full of life. We may not have fully experienced what we minister, but whatever we minister should be the truth, which conveys God. The Bible is different from any other book, for it is full of God as the truth. When we read a piece of Christian literature, we should judge its value by whether it helps us to touch God.</p>
<p><em>Question: How is truth related to the growth in life?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The increase in truth results in the growth in life. As a believer receives more truth, life becomes more abundant in his experience. This is why we need to know the Bible, receive the truth, and care only for teaching that conveys God as life.</p>
<p><em>Question: What is grace?</em></p>
<p>Answer: According to John 1:17, when the Lord came, He brought grace, which is God Himself as our enjoyment. Many Christians define grace simply as unmerited favor. This is not wrong, but it is a shallow understanding. According to this definition, some consider grace to be material blessings, such as wealth and success in business and family life. God may allow us to have such things, but Paul counted all things other than Christ as refuse (Phil. 3:8). If grace were merely material blessings, when a believer is imprisoned for his faith, as Brother Watchmen Nee was, he would lose grace. This is absolutely false. Such ones surely receive more grace in their suffering.</p>
<p><em>Question: Ephesians 4:20-21 says, &ldquo;You did not so learn Christ, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus.&rdquo; What does it mean to learn Christ as the reality is in Jesus?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The phrase <em>the reality is in Jesus</em> refers to the actual condition of the life of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels, because His life was the expression of God. Everything the Lord did in His human life was God expressed and was therefore truth, reality. Thus, we learn Christ according to the living of Jesus in the four Gospels.</p>
<p>The Bible is the revelation of God as reality, but when we first read it, it is not such a revelation but only doctrine to us. When the Spirit enlightens us, the doctrine becomes reality. The word that Peter spoke in Matthew 16:16, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,&rdquo; was a revelation to him. But when we first read it, it is not a revelation to us but a doctrine. Millions have read Peter&rsquo;s word and received it merely as a doctrine. However, when the Spirit enlightens this word in the believers, it becomes revelation and truth. This is why the Spirit is called the Spirit of reality. It is the enlightening of the Spirit that brings revelation, reality, light, and life.</p>
<p><em>Question: Ephesians 4:25 says, &ldquo;Having put off the lie, speak truth each one with his neighbor, for we are members one of another.&rdquo; What does it mean to put off the lie and speak truth?</em></p>
<p>Answer: According to the natural concept, this may be taken to mean only that we should be sincere, honest. However, according to the context, to put off the lie means to put off everything false, which is to put off everything that is not Christ; and to speak the truth means to speak Christ, who is the reality. Ephesians 4:15, says &ldquo;Holding to truth.&rdquo; According to the Lord&rsquo;s word in John 14:6, in Ephesians <em>truth</em> indicates Christ along with all that He is, such as God, light, life, and grace.</p>
<p>We must see that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is altogether a matter of life and truth. Life and truth characterize the recovery. Life is God Himself in all His processes to reach man, and truth is God Himself as the reality. Accordingly, the purpose of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to bring us back to God so that we may experience and participate in Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">NEEDING TO KNOW THE SELF AND<br />
THE OLD, NATURAL BEING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:24-26; Luke 19:23-25; John 12:24-25; Rom. 6:6; 8:13; Gal. 2:20; 5:24; 2 Cor. 4:10, 16</h1>
<p>In previous chapters we saw that in order to know the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we need to know God as life and the content of the Bible as the truth. We also need to know our self and our old, natural being. Several verses in the New Testament mention different aspects of our natural being. The self and the old, natural being include the soul-life, the old man, the practices of the body, the flesh, the old &ldquo;I,&rdquo; and the outer man. According to the Word, all these things have been or need to be denied, crucified, and put to death.</p>
<p>Matthew 16:24-26 says, &ldquo;Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it. For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life?&rdquo; In these verses we see the self and the soul-life.</p>
<p>Luke 9:23-25, a parallel portion, says, &ldquo;He said to them all, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake, this one shall save it. For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself?&rdquo; The word <em>himself</em> in verse 25 replaces the word <em>soul-life</em> in Matthew 16:26. This shows that the soul-life is the self.</p>
<p>John 12:24-25 says, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life.&rdquo; Here we see the soul-life again.</p>
<p>Romans 6:6 says, &ldquo;Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves.&rdquo; This verse reveals that our old man has been crucified. Romans 8:13 says, &ldquo;If you live according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.&rdquo; The practices of the body must be put to death.</p>
<p>Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; In this verse we see the old &ldquo;I,&rdquo; who is crucified with Christ. Galatians 5:24 says, &ldquo;They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts.&rdquo; Here we see the flesh with its passions and its lusts.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 4:10 says, &ldquo;Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.&rdquo; Verse 16 says, &ldquo;We do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.&rdquo; Here we see that the outer man is decaying, or being consumed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THERE BEING NO PLACE IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY FOR THE SELF OR THE OLD, NATURAL BEING</h2>
<p>There is no place in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for the self. The New Testament leaves no place for any part of our old being. The speaking of the Lord Jesus and the writings of the apostle Paul show that in God&rsquo;s economy nothing of our old being should remain. We need to realize that God&rsquo;s economy is altogether a matter of the new creation. Our old being must be put aside.</p>
<p>Most Christians do not see that our old being must be put aside. Many Christian teachers do not even know the meaning of the self. As a result, many denominations promote, build up, and use the old being. This situation should cause us to mourn. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is different from denominational Christianity, because in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there is no place for the old man except the tomb. In order to know the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must know that our old being has to be terminated. Although there is no place for our old being in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, in the sense of the new creation there is a place for us in the church. There is a place for us as regenerated persons who are being sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified, but we need to see that there is no place for our natural man.</p>
<p>The Lord said to Nicodemus, &ldquo;Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&rdquo; (John 3:3), and &ldquo;Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God&rdquo; (v. 5). The kingdom of God in this age is the church. Therefore, these verses indicate that the natural man cannot enter into the church, because we must be regenerated to enter into the church. Some Christian teachers do not consider the church to be the kingdom of God in this age. They say that the kingdom will exist only in the coming age. However, Romans 14:17 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This verse does not use the future tense verb <em>will be</em> but the present tense verb <em>is,</em> showing that the kingdom of God is present today. Furthermore, the context in Romans 14 concerns the practical church life in the present age, and Romans 12 deals with the Body life. This proves that the kingdom of God in this age is the church. Since regeneration is the way to enter the kingdom of God, which is the church today, there is no place for the natural man in the church.</p>
<p>Romans reveals that in order to enter into the practical Body life, which is the real practice of the church life, we need to be transformed. Romans 12:2 says, &ldquo;Be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect.&rdquo; The will of God is the Body of Christ, and the living of the Body is in the church life (vv. 3-16). Therefore, we need to be transformed for our living of the practical church life. Regeneration is our entry into the church, and transformation is for our remaining and going on in the church life. In the church life all the old, natural things must be put aside. Regeneration and transformation nullify our old being; they do not give it any ground. When the old being has been dealt with, we can practice the proper church life, which is in the new creation. We need to see this in a practical way.</p>
<p>In order to see the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in life and truth, we must know that there is no place for our self or natural man. Many Christians, including theologians who study the Bible, do not see the truth revealed in God&rsquo;s Word, because their natural being remains untouched and veils them. Our own experience confirms this. When we are natural, we do not see the truth. In our natural being the natural concepts cover our inner eyes. When we realize that our natural being must be put aside, and we deny our self, we see much light in the Scriptures.</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO TAKE UP THE CROSS<br />
AND DENY THE SELF</h2>
<p>The self denotes the soul-life in its opinions, likes, dislikes, and choices. Opinions are a matter of our mind; likes and dislikes, or preferences, are a matter of our emotion; and choices are a matter of our will. When the Lord told His disciples that He would be crucified, Peter rebuked Him, saying, &ldquo;God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!&rdquo; (Matt. 16:22). Peter&rsquo;s self was expressed in his opinion. We need to see that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has no place for our opinions, preferences, or choices. If we mean business with the Lord and have received some vision, we must condemn the self.</p>
<p>Immediately after Peter expressed his opinion to the Lord, the Lord said, &ldquo;If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me&rdquo; (v. 24). Contrary to the understanding of most Christians, taking up the cross does not primarily mean suffering; instead, it means killing. Crucifixion was a historical method of carrying out a death sentence. To crucify a person is not mainly to cause him to suffer but to terminate him. If we know what the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is, and we see that in the recovery there is no place for the self&mdash;our natural being in our opinions, preferences, and choices&mdash;we will take up the cross.</p>
<p>To take up the cross means to remain on the cross. We were crucified with Christ, and we need to remain on the cross. Apparently, the Lord was crucified after the three and a half years of His ministry. Actually, He was crucified from the very beginning of His ministry, when His baptism, which signifies death and burial, took place. Throughout the three and a half years of the Lord&rsquo;s ministry, He bore the cross, living a crucified life. He continually denied the self during His human life on earth for the accomplishment of the Father&rsquo;s will. The Lord bore the cross from His baptism to His crucifixion.</p>
<p>In order to follow the Lord, we must follow His pattern by taking up the cross and denying the self. We need to remain under the killing of the cross by denying our opinions, preferences, and choices. In John 21:18-19 the Lord told Peter, &ldquo;When you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go...Follow Me.&rdquo; Here the Lord indicated that Peter&rsquo;s preferences would be terminated, and He prophesied that Peter would be martyred. History tells us that this indeed occurred.</p>
<p>We need to see that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we must crucify, reject, and deny the self with its opinions, preferences, and choices. This is a crucial matter. It does not work merely to advise or exhort the saints not to have opinions or to be opinionated. We need a basic dealing with our opinion, which requires a vision that causes us to see that our old man and our old &ldquo;I&rdquo; have been crucified already (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20). Based upon that accomplished termination, we deny our self.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there is no place for the self with its natural opinions, preferences, and choices. If these things come in, they will annul the nature of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Christianity has lost the genuine church life through centuries of promoting the self with its opinions, preferences, and choices. In order to remain in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we need the light and the vision to see what the self is and that in the recovery it has no place.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO LOSE THE SOUL-LIFE</h2>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;Whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it&rdquo; (Matt. 16:25). To lose our soul-life is to not live in our old, natural being. In our old being we may be quick or slow, proud or humble, selfish or generous. No matter what kind of person we are in our old being, we should not live that person. This is difficult because we naturally live our old person. If we have the vision, we will see that we still mostly live our old person, our old being. Because we are regenerated and are being transformed, our natural man will be terminated not by our own doing but by our living another person, Christ.</p>
<p>The natural concept concerning the Christian life is often a matter of ethics and morality. According to our natural concept, we may think that if a man has a bad temper, when he is saved, he should improve his behavior and no longer lose his temper. However, according to this concept, if a man is naturally timid, he does not need to change his behavior, because he already has a pleasant natural man. We need to see that transformation is altogether not a matter of ethics or morality. Whether or not we are naturally ethical or moral, we need to be transformed. Whether we are naturally slow or quick, bold or timid, pleasant or short-tempered, we need to be transformed and live Christ. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is a matter of taking up the cross, denying the self, losing the soul-life, and living Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTION AND ANSWER</h2>
<p><em>Question: How can we tell real transformation from natural ability in those who are serving in the church?</em></p>
<p>Answer: With genuine transformation there will be the mark of the cross. When a capable and ethical man is saved and comes into the church life, the leading brothers should recognize that his ability is natural if they see no mark of the cross. If a man who is naturally capable but not ethical is saved and comes into the church, he may become ethical but remain natural. If this is the case, there will still be no mark of the cross. In recent turmoils many forgot about the mark of the cross and were deceived by natural ability. If we know the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we will know that our old being should be on the cross. Our ability to discern the mark of the cross and natural ability in others also depends on how much of the cross we have experienced ourselves.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">NEEDING TO KNOW THE SELF AND<br />
THE OLD, NATURAL BEING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 4:16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER ATTITUDE CONCERNING<br />
NATURALNESS IN OURSELVES AND OTHERS</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 4:16 says, &ldquo;Though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.&rdquo; The outer man is the old being, the natural man, and includes any natural ability, strength, eloquence, and talent. The inner man is the spiritual being, the new creation. We must realize that nothing of our old, natural being should remain in the church life.</p>
<p>If we hear a message given by a brother whom we have not known for a long time, our ability to discern whether his speaking is natural or spiritual depends on our experience. If the cross has dealt with our own natural ability, we will be able to discern whether others&rsquo; functioning is natural or spiritual. However, if we realize that a brother is serving or speaking by his natural ability, we should not do anything. We are all still in the process of transformation. None of us can say that we are fully transformed; we are all still somewhat natural. We need to see that in the church life there is no place for anything natural, yet because we are in the process of being transformed, we are still unconsciously and unwillingly somewhat natural.</p>
<p>The churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, as parts of the living Body of Christ, will spontaneously reject anything that is natural. If a local church does not discern what is natural from what is spiritual, we should not be bothered, because such a church is simply immature. We must let children be children. If we give them time, they will grow. We do not need to instruct a childish church to reject a certain brother&rsquo;s speaking because it is natural and to receive another&rsquo;s speaking because it is spiritual. If we do this, we are probably acting naturally ourselves. It is better to give an immature church time to grow. By growth the church will come to discern what is spiritual and what is natural. Nothing natural can remain in the churches. Sooner or later, the natural things will be rejected or terminated. Regrettably, if a church is so immature that it cannot discern what is natural from what is spiritual, that church will suffer for a time. We cannot help this, but like healthy physical bodies, the churches will heal and grow.</p>
<p>We should not justify anything natural. We must condemn and reject anything natural in ourselves, but it is better not to condemn others&rsquo; naturalness. Others may be very natural, but it is not our job to condemn them. If we do, our condemning is natural. We must see that there is no place for the self, the soul-life, the old man, the practices of the body, or the old &ldquo;I&rdquo; in the church life. Similarly, there is no place in the church life for our natural man with any of its strength, ability, or talent. If we truly see the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we will realize that there is no place for whatever we are, have, or can do in our old being. The elders need to see this so that it will become a ruling, controlling, directing vision to them. In the church life our old being must be terminated. The church life is altogether of the new creation. If the elders see this vision and live this vision, the churches will be strong and vital.</p>
<p>We should be burdened to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I need to see more of the vision of Your recovery in life and truth. I also need to know my old, natural being. My natural man with its strength, ability, and talent must be terminated. Lord, mingle Yourself with my new being that I may live together with You.&rdquo; Such a vision will control and direct the church life, governing us in shepherding, fellowshipping, and contacting the saints. Then we will be a people under the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVING IN RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>In a conference of apostles and elders in Acts 15 there was &ldquo;much discussion&rdquo; (v. 7). To debate, dispute, or argue in the old man is easy. However, to discuss without the flesh and in the new creation is quite difficult. Sometimes we may not participate in discussions with other serving ones because we cannot do so without being in the flesh. However, if this is our case, we are not being spiritual by not discussing, for we are still in the old creation; we are only hiding it. If we truly know the flesh and cooperate with the indwelling Christ to crucify our flesh, we will be able to discuss not in a natural way but in the new creation. Remaining silent during a time of fellowship may be an indication of spirituality, but it is a weak indication. Remaining silent is better than fighting, but a stronger indication of spirituality is to discuss in the spirit, not in the flesh or in the old being. Similarly, if we have some natural ability, to not use it is relatively easy. However, to use our ability not in a natural way but in resurrection is not easy; it is a stronger indication of spirituality.</p>
<p>Some may wonder how to use their ability in resurrection. Our old man and our new man are difficult to separate. Our new man comes out of our old man. Resurrection is something living coming out of something dead. In a sense, there must first be something old that can die before resurrection can come. What this means experientially is that our new person still bears the appearance of our old person, but our new person is in resurrection. Regeneration and transformation do not change or remove our characteristics. If we are a slow person, regeneration and transformation will not make us quick. However, before regeneration our slowness or quickness is natural, and after regeneration and transformation our slowness or quickness is spiritual. The characteristics remain, but the nature changes.</p>
<p>There being no place in the church for our natural man does not mean that when a brother who has some ability to speak comes into the church life, he should no longer speak. In the church life we may use our abilities but in a spiritual way, not in a natural way. Similarly, the serving ones may have discussions but not in a natural way. There should be no insisting, stumbling, or offending. Simply to be honest and sincere is not adequate. We need a vision to see that in the church life, the natural man must be terminated. We should not do anything by our natural man or in a natural way. It will take time, but when we see this vision, the old, natural things will spontaneously be terminated. We should not pretend that we are not natural or fleshly but spiritual and in resurrection. Pretense is natural and fleshly. If we have truly seen the vision that in the church life the natural being must be terminated, we will lose any inclination for pretense. The vision kills our pretense.</p>
<p>When we see the vision that there is no place in the church life for our natural life, we will not seek our own interest. In other words, we will not be selfish. Selfishness is natural. If two brothers serving together make a mistake, they will be tested by how they confess. If they are natural, they will try to place more of the blame and guilt on one another. This is selfish. If we have seen that there is no place in the church life for our natural being, we will not try to place blame on others in such situations. We will not try to save our self, because our vision condemns the self. We are often subtly and perhaps unconsciously selfish, caring for our face, glory, interests, and profit. When we see that there is no place in the church life for the natural being, we will lose interest in selfish gain and honor. This becomes a great salvation.</p>
<p>A brother who has seen the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery may begin to argue in order to vindicate himself, but he will quickly lose his boldness and become silent because he has lost his interest in preserving the self. If a brother does not try to place blame on others, this may indicate that he has seen the vision. Without the vision, the more we argue, the more boldness we will have. We need to pray that we would see this vision of the church life. The church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is unique, absolutely different from any human society or religious organization; the church life is altogether a matter of Christ as life and the Bible as the truth and has no place for our natural man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: What is the difference between the crucifying of the old man and asceticism?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Hinduism, Buddhism, and Catholicism teach asceticism, which is self-inflicted suffering, but in the Bible crucifixion implies not mainly suffering but killing, terminating. Life coming out of death is a basic principle in the universe. In other words, if there is no death, there can be no life. In our physical body cells are continually dying and being replaced with new cells. Metabolism is a process in which some substances are broken down, and others are built up. In other words, it is a killing and a generating. This is crucial for our health. Therefore, it is foolish and blind to hate the cross. What the Bible teaches is not asceticism but death and resurrection. It is wrong to seek suffering. If we are suffering in the church life, this means that we have not been terminated. A dead person does not suffer. If we feel that someone is a suffering to us, this indicates that our natural man is still living and needs to be terminated on the cross. The most restful person is one lying in a tomb. If we remain on the cross, we will not suffer. If we do not know the Spirit, we may try to crucify ourselves, which is asceticism. The death in Romans 6 can be realized and experienced only by the Spirit in Romans 8. The killing power of Christ&rsquo;s death is in the Spirit.</p>
<p><em>Question: What is the relationship between the breaking of the outer man and the release of the spirit?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Brother Watchman Nee taught that the release of the spirit is an issue of the breaking of the outer man. A genuine breaking of the outer man will cause our spirit to be released. If we sit silently in the meetings, it may be because our outer man is still strong and whole. The breaking of the natural man is a lifelong matter. We may encourage the saints to pray and speak in the meetings, but we also have to help them to know how to experience the cross for the breaking of the outer man. Without the death of the cross, we cannot have resurrection. If we experience the cross, we will experience resurrection. The real breaking of the natural man will cause the spirit to be released. Whatever we are in the natural man must be crucified. If we genuinely experience this putting to death, the spirit will be released in resurrection.</p>
<p><em>Question: Will denying the self or losing our soul-life cause us to behave differently?</em></p>
<p>Answer: When people change their behavior, that is performance. We simply need to go to the cross. We cannot separate denying the self, taking up the cross, losing the soul-life, crucifying the flesh, putting to death the practices of the body, and realizing that the old man has been crucified and that the outer man is being consumed. These matters are closely related. The basic thing is that we must see that there is no place in the church life for the natural man, the self, the soul-life, the old &ldquo;I,&rdquo; the outer man, or the old man. We need such a vision. We do not need to perform, for the vision will terminate us and cause us to lose any taste or interest for the old, natural things. We may still have the same characteristics outwardly, but inwardly our vision will be terminating all the old natural things, and we will not be a cause of problems in the church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PROPER VIEW AND PRESENT NEED<br />
OF THE MINISTRY AND THE CHURCHES</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPHERE AND SERVICE<br />
OF THE MINISTRY AND THE CHURCHES</h2>
<p>The terms <em>ministry</em> and <em>work</em> in the New Testament denote a kind of service. The Greek word translated &ldquo;ministry&rdquo; literally means &ldquo;service.&rdquo; In the New Testament the Lord raised up apostles from among His believers and then commissioned them with the ministry. The apostles went out with the ministry to raise up local churches. Thus, there was first the ministry with the apostles and co-workers, and then there were the churches.</p>
<p>According to Acts and the Epistles, the ministry is regional. When the New Testament was written, there were two regions of the ministry, or the work: Judea, the Jewish region, where Peter, James, and John labored; and the Gentile world, the Gentile region, where the apostle Paul and his co-workers labored (Acts 21:18-19; Rom. 15:16; Gal. 2:8-9). The churches are local. Each church belongs to one locality. The apostles raise up and establish the churches. They appoint elders to bear the burden of the local churches. Like the churches they care for, the elders are local, bearing the local burden. The apostles are regional, bearing the burden of the ministry to strengthen all the churches in a region. Some apostles may also be elders in a church in the center of their region to strengthen the testimony in that church. For example, Peter was an apostle and also an elder in Jerusalem. The church in the center of a region is not higher than the other churches and does not control them but is the center of the work in that region, as Jerusalem and Antioch were in the New Testament.</p>
<p>We need to pray that the Lord would strengthen, increase, and spread the ministry to cover every region. There needs to be brothers carrying out the ministry in every region to strengthen the churches there. We also need to pray that every local church would have adequate elders to take care of the local building. If the ministry and the churches are in a normal situation, the Lord will be able to have a proper testimony. In other words, the need for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony on the earth falls into two categories. First, the Lord needs more brothers who are useful to carry on the ministry by raising up, establishing, and strengthening the churches in every region. Second, the Lord needs more elders to take care of the local churches, which includes shepherding and teaching for the building up of the church in each locality. If we meet the need for the brothers to carry out the ministry in different regions and the need for the brothers to bear the burden of the local building, the Lord will have a way to go on.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER RELATIONSHIP<br />
AMONG THE CHURCHES</h2>
<p>Once we see the sphere and service of the ministry and the churches, we can address the relationship among the churches. All the churches are on the same level; there is no head church. In the past few years there have been three kinds of mistakes in the relationships among the churches. The first mistake concerned the stress that all the churches follow particular &ldquo;flows.&rdquo; The word <em>flow</em> has been incorrectly used to denote various outward practices. The right meaning of the word <em>flow</em> is God&rsquo;s testimony on the earth. We entitled our periodical <em>The Stream</em> and the first article in the first issue &ldquo;The Divine Stream&rdquo; to signify the unique flow of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony on the earth. All the churches are part of this one testimony, the testimony of Jesus, which is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in life and truth. This flow is never confusing or demanding.</p>
<p>The second mistake in recent years relates to the interference of local churches with other churches. No local church should interfere with other local churches, just as families should not interfere with other families. Ministering brothers may visit other churches to strengthen them, but they should not interfere. All the saints should blend among the churches, but they should not compare, judge, or express opinions about the churches. In the recent turmoil among the churches much damage was done through such interference.</p>
<p>The third and perhaps greatest mistake in recent years was the organizational transfer of saints and elders between localities. There was a subtle, hidden, evil intention behind these transfers, and they greatly damaged the local churches. Just as different families do not transfer members, neither should the churches transfer members. Even if the parents in a family are poor, they cannot be fired or transferred away, nor can new parents be hired. Transfers cause a local church to become a man-made organization without the nature of a family. Such human maneuvering and manipulating is wrong. These transfers cause the churches to lose the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. In recent years the churches that did not participate in such transfers received much more blessing than those that did. We must stand against transfers among the churches. Just as different families may have different conditions, local churches may be strong or weak, but their members should not be transferred to try to change their condition.</p>
<p>We must beware of these three mistakes: so-called flows, interference among churches, and transfers between churches. These mistakes may cause us to deviate from the truth. We must respect God&rsquo;s economy and His ordination of the ground of locality for the churches regardless of the churches&rsquo; conditions. The desire to make every local church the same is a human concept and requires human maneuvering. Some people are born tall, and others are born short. If we try to make them all the same, we may damage or kill them. We must leave the churches as they are and not try to organize them hierarchically in order to make them the same. Even if a local church is weak, others should not interfere with it. This is not a matter of pride but of contentedness in family life. A poor family is still a genuine family, and the family members can enjoy their life together. We should be content in our local church because we are a genuine church. In the past year a certain church has had much increase not by transfers or by trying to conform to so-called flows but by enjoying the church life as a genuine local church. This honors the Lord&rsquo;s headship, His economy, and His ordination.</p>
<p>Even if we have the truth, we must not be careless, lest these things creep in. We should see and learn much from our past mistakes. We must respect other churches. If we visit a smaller, weaker, or poorer church, we should not interfere or even compare. Comparing is a kind of interference. We must leave all the churches as they are and respect them. We also need to avoid transfers. Under the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign leading, some saints may migrate, but organizational transfers to try to control the condition of the churches are wrong.</p>
<p>When we have dealt with these mistakes and are in a normal condition, the local churches need to learn to receive the other churches. No church should be proud or closed to the other churches. We need not only to receive other churches but also to be open to them. We should be willing to learn from other churches, just as families learn from other families to try to improve their own condition. We should have as much fellowship as possible with other churches but without any interfering. We must realize that in such fellowship all the churches are on the same level; it is not a vertical fellowship among churches on different levels but a horizontal fellowship. If we take care of these few points, the relationship among the churches will become normal.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT NEED<br />
AND BURDEN IN THE MINISTRY</h2>
<p>We all must bear the burden to pray that the Lord would raise up more brothers to participate in the ministry so that every region would be adequately cared for. The brothers who are now bearing the ministry need to pray to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading concerning which region to care for. The brothers who bear the ministry should care for several churches. They must allow the elders to bear the burden of the local building so that they can spend more time to minister to all the churches in a region. This is not a small thing. We need to pray that the situation of the ministry in every region would become normal, but we should not do anything in ourselves to try to change the situation. No human hand can make the situation normal. We need to pray much for ourselves and others. This is our practical and urgent need.</p>
<p>I have a burden to help the churches in Southern California while I am living in Anaheim, but my primary burden is to release the Life-studies. I also have a burden to visit the churches in the United States and Canada. Many churches in other countries have invited me to visit them, but despite my heart for them, because of the practical situation, I do not feel that it is the Lord&rsquo;s leading for me to travel abroad presently. I feel that I must leave the ministry in other countries to others, who can care for them with the help of the Life-study messages. This has already been taking place and working well. Because I still feel that the United States is strategic for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery on the whole earth today, I am burdened to strengthen the churches here. However, my main burden is to release the word&mdash;to finish the Life-studies of the New Testament books along with the Recovery Version of the New Testament. I also have a burden and ask the saints to pray that the Lord would give me the time to finish the Life-studies of the Pentateuch. If I can finish these two sets of Life-studies, my present burden will be discharged, and they will be a rich supply to all the churches on the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: In our local church two saints who were poisoned and who left during the recent turmoil have indicated that they would like to return to the meetings and have fellowship with the church. However, there is some indication that they still do not want to receive the ministry. How should we leading brothers approach this?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The leading brothers first need to make it clear to the saints that there are no conditions or terms for coming into the church life. All those who are saved are members of the church, and as long as they are not living in sin, they can meet with the church. Receiving the ministry is not a condition for someone to be in the church life. This subtle concept may damage the saints&rsquo; appetite for the ministry.</p>
<p><em>Question: If a local church needs an elder to serve full time but cannot afford to support him, should they ask other churches to help them financially?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We must see clearly that the elders are local. If there is a need and a burden for an elder to serve the church full time, the elder and the church should pray much to see whether this is the Lord&rsquo;s leading. The financial support for a full-time serving one depends on the Lord&rsquo;s leading and our faith. To make an arrangement with other churches in order to guarantee financial assistance is somewhat organizational. If the Lord leads us to do something, He will send the supply to take care of the needs. Therefore, we need to learn to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading and exercise our faith.</p>
<p><em>Question: The first local church on a certain Spanish-speaking island was established four years ago. Some came and told us that because the &ldquo;flow&rdquo; of the churches was in English, we had to do everything in English. As a result, many seeking ones who spoke only Spanish came but left after a short time. After those who insisted on English left, the Lord gave us the burden to begin using Spanish, and the church has been growing greatly. Can you say something concerning uniformity among the churches?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We must learn the basic lesson to never try to force outward uniformity among the churches. We may practice pray-reading and benefit from it, but if we visit a church that does not practice pray-reading, we should not talk about it. It is more profitable to simply meet with them in their way and have sweet fellowship. Fellowship requires the participation of two sides. On our side, we should not insist on pray-reading, and on their side, if they know that we practice pray-reading, they should open to us in a learning spirit. Neither side should feel unhappy. Both should receive and be open to one another, and neither should insist or be offended or stumbled. This is a basic principle of fellowship.</p>
<p>In the same principle, if we live in a locality in which some saints do not agree with pray-reading, we should not insist on pray-reading in the meetings. Instead, we pray-read only in our private life and family life. In order to keep the fellowship, we should not insist in such a situation. We can and should fellowship with others who have different outward practices. When we visit another locality, we need to take their way in order to have fellowship with them. We need to learn to receive others and be open to others. However, if we visit another locality and learn from them, we should not insist on anything new when we return to our locality. This is interference, and it may damage the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>We must learn to keep a sweet fellowship by not touching the differences among the churches. As long as a group is a genuine local church, that is good enough. Of course, we cannot tolerate idolatry or immorality, but we do not need to condemn things that are not sinful in the eyes of the Lord. We need to respect each local church and give each church full liberty so that we can have fellowship. We help others not by correction but by ministering life to them. To correct others is not life. Even if we visit a church that is worldly, we should only minister life to them. Life will help them to forsake their worldliness. To expect all the churches to be uniform is altogether wrong. This will cause many problems, and it does not correspond with the principles in the Bible. We should visit other local churches, not to interfere or correct but only to fellowship and minister life. This will help the churches to go on in a peaceful situation.</p>
<p>Among the churches there should not be an improper coordination that brings in hierarchical organization and human headship. Coordination often implies organization and activity. For the churches to have fellowship is normal, but to coordinate in the way of organizing nearby churches is an improper activity. Fellowship among the churches and fellowship among the saints are the healthy flow of life, like the flow of the blood in our body. Proper fellowship among believers is always profitable. Accordingly, it is normal for the elders in nearby churches to come together to fellowship. However, for such elders to coordinate may be a snare that causes the churches to fall into organization, which we must avoid. All the churches are autonomous and on the same level. If the Lord so leads, we may come together to fellowship, but we must avoid hierarchical organization and human headship not only among the churches but also within each local church.</p>
<p><em>Question: There are a number of nearby churches in a particular area. One locality is larger than the others, and the others join the larger locality for certain meetings to receive the ministry. These churches also coordinate regarding the children&rsquo;s work. Are these instances of improper organization?</em></p>
<p>Answer: If our intention is simply to come together to receive the ministry, that is perfectly all right. The gathering of the churches for this purpose gives more impact to the ministry. However, we should make it clear to all the saints that such a meeting is not for organization but only for the ministry of the word. Concerning the children&rsquo;s work, it also depends on our attitude and intention. We should not be legal about the autonomy of the local churches, but we should try to avoid organization and human headship. In areas where several localities are close to one another, the churches need to come together sometimes, but we must practice this in a proper way. The normal relationship among the churches is one of fellowship in which all the churches are autonomous and respect one another.</p>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You for Your mercy and grace. We thank You that we are in Your recovery because of Your mercy and grace. Lord, we have learned that we cannot trust in anything but Your mercy and grace. Your mercy and grace are all that we need. Lord, thank You that You have mercy on whomever You desire to have mercy. We ask You for further mercy. It is Your mercy that has kept us and Your mercy that will bring us on and cause us to grow in life.</p></body></html>
