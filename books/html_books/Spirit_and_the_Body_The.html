The Body actually comes out of the Spirit. First Corinthians 12:13 says, "For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit" (Gk.). We, as the many members, have all been baptized in one Spirit into one Body, and now we are all drinking of this one Spirit. The Body has come out of the one Spirit, and now the Body is drinking of this one Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CARING FOR THE PROPER UNITY</H2><P>I am burdened that everyone in the Lord's recovery would see the Spirit and the Body. Christianity has missed the mark because it does not care at all for the Body, nor does it care for the Spirit in the proper way. Many have talked about the Spirit, and since World War II there has been much talk about the Body. Actually, the believers do not care for the Body. If we care for the Body, we must care for the proper oneness, the genuine unity. The Body is one. There is one Head and one Body, one Christ and one church. The Body does not refer to a group of believers who come together for a specific purpose. That is a social gathering, not the Body. Whenever we speak of the Body, we must have a deep sense of realizing that the Body is uniquely one. The Body is not only one in a locality, but one in the universe. If we are in a division, not caring for the oneness of the Body, we do not know what the Body is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RELIGION VERSUS THE SPIRIT</H2><P>In this message I would first like to say a word concerning the Spirit. Many among us have come to see that religion is not something positive, but I am concerned that some still have a wrong understanding of what it means to be religious. Many of those who would tell others that they are too religious are not clear themselves regarding what religion is. Religion is something related to God and to the service and worship of God, yet having nothing to do with God the Spirit. Although a certain thing related to God may be very good, it is religion as long as it is not related to the Spirit. Take the example of prayer. If you pray to the Lord without praying in the Spirit, your prayer has nothing to do with the Spirit and hence is something of religion. The same is true with studying the Bible. If your reading and study of the Bible have nothing to do with the Spirit, they are a religion. To be religious is not a matter of doing things in a particular way or of being old as opposed to being young. To be religious is to do something for God apart from the Spirit. The best thing done for God becomes a religion if it has nothing to do with the Spirit. I am burdened that all those in the Lord's recovery may be clear about what religion is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LEADING, WORKING, AND SPEAKING<br>OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Let us consider a number of verses in the book of Acts pertaining to the Spirit. At the beginning of Acts, the one hundred twenty did not form anything, start anything, initiate anything, or intend to do anything. Rather, they prayed again and again for ten days (Acts 1:14). Their prayer was absolutely in the Spirit. Then, to their surprise, the Spirit was poured out upon them, and they became a people wholly in the Spirit. From that time onward, whatever they did, whatever they said, and wherever they went was utterly a matter in the Spirit. On the day of Pentecost, when Peter stood up with the eleven and spoke, he did not speak without the Spirit. Rather, Peter was filled with the Spirit. When Peter spoke to the religious leaders in Acts 4, he was again filled with the Holy Spirit (Acts 4:8).</P><P>Stephen was also a man filled with the Holy Spirit (Acts 6:5). No one was able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke (Acts 6:10). Stephen was a person living, speaking, and ministering in the Spirit.</P><P>Philip preached the gospel in the Spirit. Philip did not determine to do this preaching or make a decision to do so. He was simply living and walking in the Spirit. Thus, when the Spirit told him to go to the Ethiopian in the chariot, Philip ran to him (Acts 8:29-30). After Philip had preached the gospel to the eunuch and had baptized him, he did not intend to go away. The Spirit, however, "caught away Philip" (Acts 8:39). Where Philip, an evangelist, was to go did not depend on his decision; instead, it depended upon the leading of the Spirit. The Spirit led Philip to preach the gospel to the eunuch, and it was the Spirit who caught Philip away after he had preached to him.</P><P>All of us, especially the young people, must be impressed that in the Spirit there is no such thing as a movement. The Spirit must take the lead, the Spirit must do the work, the Spirit must do the speaking, and the Spirit must even do our living. We, the people in the church, must be those absolutely saturated with the Spirit and absolutely one with the Spirit. If so, then whatever we say is the Spirit's speaking, whatever we do is the Spirit's doing, and whatever work we do is the Spirit's working. In the book of Acts we do not see any kind of movement. Instead, we see the leading, working, and speaking of the Spirit.</P><P>In the whole book of Acts there was, strictly speaking, just one conference, and that took place in Acts chapter fifteen. This is very different from today's Christianity where conferences are held one after another to decide what to do and where to send people. In Christianity the sending out of people depends upon decisions made at a conference. This is a movement. In the book of Acts, however, we do not see such conferences. In Acts the apostles did not gather together to discuss and to make decisions. They did not ask questions such as, "Where is the need? Where should we go? How many should we send?" Nothing took place according to manmade decisions; rather, everything was according to the living Spirit. The way Peter behaved and worked was not dependent upon Peter; it was due to the Holy Spirit. What Stephen and Philip did was not the result of a decision made at a conference. No, they were in the Spirit, and the Spirit took the lead in all things. It was the same with the Apostle Paul. In Acts 13 the prophets and teachers at Antioch did not call a conference and discuss matters. No, they prayed and fasted, and as they were praying, the Holy Spirit spoke to them, saying, "Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them" (Acts 13:2). Again, there was neither a discussion nor a decision, but the speaking of the Holy Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT A MOVEMENT,<br>BUT THE LIVING MOVE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</H2><P>By these examples we can see that in the book of Acts there is nothing of a movement. There is just the living move of the living Person of Jesus, and this living Person is the Holy Spirit. When Barnabas and Paul were confronting a sorcerer, a false prophet, we are told that Paul was filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak to him (Acts 13:9-10). Acts 13:2 mentions Barnabas before Paul. However, it was Paul who took the lead to speak. Barnabas and Paul did not hold a conference in which Barnabas said, "Paul, you have studied at the feet of Gamaliel, and you are more learned than I. Now that we are on our mission, let us make the decision that from now on you will be the speaker and I will be the helper." Instead of the record of such a discussion, we are simply told that in a certain situation Paul was spontaneously filled with the Spirit and took the lead to speak. There was no human discussion or decision; rather, there was the move of the living Person, the Holy Spirit. If we had been Barnabas or Paul, we would have discussed who should be the speaker. But the one who was filled with the Spirit did the speaking. If you have the Spirit, you may speak. But if you do not have the Spirit, you should be quiet.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HOLY SPIRIT AND US</H2><P>The only conference in the book of Acts took place in chapter fifteen. The apostles and elders came together to take care of a certain matter. Acts 15:28 says, "For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us." Whenever we have a conference, we must have the assurance that whatever we decide is the decision of the Spirit. We must be able to say, "It seems good to the Holy Spirit and to us." I read the Bible for years without ever paying any attention to this verse. The decision made in chapter fifteen was not made only by the apostles and the elders with the whole church; it was made also by the Holy Spirit, and the apostles and elders followed the Spirit to make a decision. Hence, it was a decision made by the Holy Spirit and the apostles and elders.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HONORING THE LORD</H2><P>We must learn from the experience of the apostles and elders in Acts 15 never to make decisions on our own. Furthermore, we should not make suggestions to others or give instructions to them. None of us is qualified to do this. At the time of the Acts, Peter, Paul, and the other apostles were not qualified by themselves to make decisions or give instructions. Then what about us? We must honor the Lord. We are not the Lord or the Master, and we are not the Lord of the harvest. Only the Lord Jesus is the Lord of the harvest. He is the Master, and we must honor Him by not making decisions in ourselves. Suppose I am your servant, and you are my master. Suppose that without you I make certain decisions and then give instructions to others, making decisions for them as well. This would be a great insult to you. You are the master, but who am I? Nevertheless, we have all transgressed in this respect in the past, for a lot of decisions have been made among us. Some decisions were made by individuals and others by groups. In certain cases some even made decisions for others. But where is the Lord? When we make decisions in this way, it seems that there is no Lord among us. It seems that we do not have the Spirit, but only ourselves to depend on. We make decisions and we give instructions. Instead of doing this, we must pray, fast, and wait on the Lord. We need to honor Him. He is our Master, and we are His slaves. We should say to Him, "Lord, You are my Master. I am neither qualified nor do I have the position and the authority to make decisions or give orders to others. Lord, I am waiting on You. I want to know Your will and Your heart. Lord, I want to know what You want me to do and what You want my fellow-workers to do. Lord, I ask You what You want the churches to do." We all must have this attitude; otherwise, we shall insult the Lord, and eventually He will give us up.</P><P>This is exactly the situation in today's Christianity, and this is the reason Christianity has lost the Lord's presence. Many of those in Christianity have made themselves the Lord of the harvest, the masters of the work. They hire some, lay off some, give orders, and make decisions. They form mission boards, hold conferences, and make decisions about where to send their workers. We must not repeat the tragedy of the history of Christianity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED TO PRAY<br>AND CARE FOR THE LORD'S LEADING</H2><P>Although the Lord has burdened us to go to the campuses, we should not turn this into a movement. Any decisions that you make by yourself for others are an insult to the Spirit. If you have done this, you must repent and, if necessary, ask the others to forgive you because you gave them instructions about what they should do. None of us should ever tell others where they should go. What an insult this is to the Lord! Who are you? Who authorized you to make suggestions to others? You need to help the others to contact the Lord. Young brothers and sisters, you need to pray. Yes, we are burdened and led of the Lord to work on the campuses. But the young people must bring this matter to the Lord, pray, and offer themselves to the Lord once again, saying, "Lord, I want to go on with You. Lord, where do You want me to go?" Everyone must pray until he is clear about the Lord's leading. Do not expect others to instruct you where you should go. That is organization, religion. Every one of us, from the leaders to the least among us, must be brought into the presence of the Lord to contact Him. Yes, the Lord is moving to the campuses, but perhaps in His sovereignty He will not allow you to go. He may lead hundreds of others to go, but He may tell you to stay where you are. This will be a proof that what is taking place among us is not a movement, but absolutely a matter of the Lord's leading.</P><P>We all must go into the presence of the Lord and pray for some time. For years, I have been learning this lesson and practicing it. We are not in any kind of movement. Everything must be brought into the presence of the Lord. I cannot go to the Lord for you; you must go to the Lord yourself. We all must learn this lesson that no one can go to the Lord for someone else. That is the clergy-laity hierarchy. If I can go to the Lord, then you can go to the Lord also. Even the newest one among us, the one most recently saved, must still go to the Lord himself. Eventually we all shall be able to say, "I am going to this place because I have inquired of the Lord, and He has led me to go there." But you must never go somewhere because a certain brother has encouraged you to do so. Never tell anyone where he should go. Instead, you must have the assurance that the Lord is leading. Otherwise, we shall be in a movement, and there will be no spiritual value in what we do. Do not expect to be clear after one day. You may not even be clear after ten days. A number of times I was not clear concerning the Lord's leading even after a hundred days. Every day I prayed and said, "Lord, have mercy on me." Finally, one day the clearance came, and I knew the Lord's leading. Whenever I have acted upon such a leading of the Lord, I have never regretted it.</P><P>God's New Testament economy is a matter of the Spirit. Acts 16:6 says that Paul and those with him "were forbidden of the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia." When they were trying to go into Bithynia, the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them (Acts 16:7, Gk.). However, Paul and his companions did not hold a conference to discuss the situation. Rather, as Paul was waiting on the Lord, he saw a vision by night. Acts 16:9 says, "And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us." Paul and his companions concluded that the Lord was calling them to preach the gospel to the Macedonians (Acts 16:10). Even after seeing the vision, Paul might have wondered whether or not the Lord was leading them to Macedonia. By this we see that the apostles walked and worked not according to their own decisions, but only according to the Lord's leading. However, the tragedy of today's Christianity is that so many do not have the Lord's presence and do not care for the leading of the Lord. For all practical purposes, they exalt themselves to be the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOING DIRECTLY TO THE LORD</H2><P>The tragic history of Christianity must not be repeated among us. We must not insult the Lord and offend Him by not caring for His leading. We do not agree with any manmade decision. Everyone in the Lord's recovery must go directly to the Lord and pray. If anyone asked me where he should go, I would give him just one word&#151;pray. Pray until you are clear, and then go. Do not ask me or anyone else what you should do. None of us is the Lord. Only Jesus Christ is the Lord. I cannot speak on His behalf and tell you where you should go. You must inquire of Him, "Lord, where should I go?" If you do not get the Lord's leading, do not go to others and ask them to tell you what you should do.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING ASSURED OF THE LORD'S SENDING</H2><P>Do not say, as if it were a mere slogan, "I am following the flow." The real flow is the Lord Himself. How wrong it is to stir up a movement! That is an insult to the Lord. It is an offense to Him. There must never be a movement among us in the Lord's recovery. Do not use the word "flow" as a cloak to disguise a movement. When some of you speak of the flow, you actually mean a movement. To create a movement and then to encourage others to follow it is to make a tremendous mistake. Again I say, concerning any move you make in the Lord's recovery, you must go directly to the Lord Himself and pray. I long to see that after some months of prayer, spontaneously, without a discussion or a conference, a number will be burdened to go to Phoenix and others to certain other places. If the angels ask why you have come there, you will then be able to say, "Angels, don't you know that the Lord has sent me here?" You will have authority. But if you say that a certain brother has sent you there, that will mean nothing. It will have no weight whatever. What any man says about where you should go means nothing. You must have the assurance that the Lord is sending you. And do not say, "I have come here because I followed the flow." Perhaps after a year you will regret that you followed the so-called flow, for you never had any assurance from the Lord. You must be able to say, "I am here because the Lord sent me here. He asked me to come to this place and He wanted me here." We all must be clear concerning the Lord's leading to this extent. None of us should give any instructions to others or make decisions for others.</P><P>Now is the time for us to have a genuine turn before the Lord. You must say, "Lord, we don't want to offend You or insult You. We want to honor You by waiting on You for Your leading." This is the Lord's recovery, not a repetition of the pitiful history of Christianity. Do not take orders from anyone and do not give orders to anyone. Go to the Lord and pray. This is the proper way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BALANCED BY THE BODY</H2><P>Suppose the leading ones, after much prayer, are truly burdened about a certain matter. What they should do then is through fellowship pass on their burden to the saints and ask the saints to pray. Eventually, the saints will receive a personal leading from the Lord, and they may move accordingly. In this way no one will be individualistic or rebellious. This is why we have the Body. We have both the Spirit on the one hand and the Body on the other hand. The Spirit and the Body keep us in balance. You need to check whether or not the leading you have from the Lord corresponds to the feeling of the Body. We need to be balanced.</P><P>When some hear about being balanced by the Body, they may think that this matter of balance will produce the same result as if the leading ones made the decision and told them where to go. It is possible that the outward result may be the same, but the inward nature is absolutely different. Suppose I am a leading one and make decisions for others. After making the decision, I then tell the others to what place they should move. This is an insult to the Lord. If I were to do this, there would be no need for the others to pray. Instead, they would simply act on my word. To do this is to usurp the position of the Lord and to make myself the Lord. This is the greatest insult to the Lord. Instead of doing this, I should say, "Brothers, I feel burdened of the Lord to share with you that some of you may need to move to a certain city. I ask you to please pray thoroughly about this matter." Eventually, some may be burdened by the Lord and led of Him to go to that place. Others, however, may be burdened to go to a different place. After you have received a burden from the Lord, you need to take care of the Body. Thus, we take care of both sides, the side of the Spirit and the side of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PRAYER AND FELLOWSHIP</H2><P>You may wonder where the Body is in a practical way. The Body is in the fellowship, and this fellowship is in unity. It is not a partial fellowship or fellowship relating to a division or an opinion. No, it is the fellowship of the Body. Fellowship follows prayer. After you have had prayer and fellowship, then you will be clear regarding the Lord's leading.</P><P>Some may say, "The result is exactly the same as if there were no prayer or fellowship. It is the same as if someone gave me an order to go somewhere. If that is the case, then why should we pray and have fellowship?" We must pray and fellowship in order to honor the Lord. If we do not pray and have the proper fellowship with others, we insult the Lord and usurp His position. Furthermore, if you move to a place without prayer and fellowship, you will be shaken when the tests, afflictions, and persecutions come. You may say, "Brother So-and-so sent us here. Perhaps he made a mistake. We should not follow a man." However, if you pray and fellowship, you honor the Lord, and you will also have the assurance that it is the Lord who is leading you. Then after you move to a certain place, you will have the assurance that the Lord sent you there, and you will never regret your move no matter what the outward situation may be. You will be so assured that your being there is the Lord's will and leading that you will be ready to die there. You will not only have the assurance; you will also be strengthened and endued with authority. You will be able to say, "Affliction and persecution, stay away. We have been sent here by the Lord of heaven and earth." Because you have been sent by the Lord, not by any man, you will have the authority to pray. I hope you can all see the difference between being sent by the Lord and being sent by man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A PLEASANT SPIRIT AND A SWEET ONENESS</H2><P>In the Body the young ones, the middle-aged ones, and the elderly ones are all one. Any dissenting between the young ones and the older ones is absolutely wrong. It is not of the Body. Yes, the young saints who are burdened for the campuses need to be free to have their own meetings, and the older ones should not interfere with them or make suggestions to them. However, we still need to have fellowship. The older ones need the fellowship of the younger ones, and the younger ones even the more need the fellowship of the older ones. We must always maintain a pleasant atmosphere and a good spirit. In Los Angeles there may be three halls, but there should be one pleasant spirit with a very sweet oneness. The young ones must be faithful to go to the campuses for the Lord's testimony, and the older ones, not interfering with the young ones, should pray for them, stand behind them, support them, and strengthen them. The young ones should also respect the older ones and seek their help, prayers, and wise counsel. If this is the case, what a pleasant situation there will be among us.</P><P>The Body is one. No matter how many halls a certain church may have, there is still one church in that locality. The church in Taipei, for example, has at least seventeen halls. Counting only those who are seniors in college or who have recently graduated, the number of serving young people is over one thousand. These one thousand serving ones are scattered throughout the seventeen halls. Nevertheless, they all are one. Two years ago, by the Lord's mercy, so many of the older ones who were elders, deacons, and deaconesses resigned from their service for the Lord's purpose. Approximately eight hundred of these older ones, many of whom had been in the church since the beginning in 1948, resigned, allowing the young people to take up their places of service. After a year and a half the young people came up. They are absolutely one with the older ones. They respect the older ones, and the older ones love them, pray for them, stand with them, support them, and sustain them. They all are one. What a pleasant atmosphere there is in the church in Taipei! What a testimony this is to the whole earth!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE UNIVERSAL ONENESS OF THE BODY</H2><P>Young people, we are not a movement, and we are not merely for any type of campus work. We are only for the Lord's recovery. If you were to offer me the whole world, I would say, "I don't want it. I only want the Lord's recovery." It is absolutely wrong to offend the recovery by damaging the unity. We are not for a movement or for a work; we are for the Lord's recovery, which is based upon unity. If we lose our unity, we are no longer the recovery. Rather, we become a part of today's Christianity. The thing that most distinguishes us from Christianity is the unique unity. We care for this unity. Never allow the work on the campuses to damage the unity. It is a terribly serious matter to damage the Lord's recovery by breaking the unity.</P><P>The unity about which we are speaking is the universal oneness of the Body. We do not practice unity simply among ourselves, but with all believers. We love all believers in Christ, including those in the Catholic Church and in all the denominations and free groups. Although we love all Christians, we do not care to participate in their divisions. Whether or not they want to be one with us in the unique unity depends on them. But even if they do not desire this, we still love them. We should not do anything that causes division. Rather, we would sacrifice anything and everything for the sake of keeping the unique unity. We would never tolerate anything that would cause a separation or a division. We do not care for numbers&#151;we care for unity. We do not want to have a large number, yet be full of divisions. It is better to have just five hundred who continuously keep the unity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>KEEPING THE REALITY OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>Yes, the young people need to go to the campuses for the Lord's purpose. But this must not be a movement, and it must not in any way cause division among us. We look to the Lord that He would grant us the grace we need for this. We would abandon anything that would cause a division or even give the slightest impression of division. We do not care for any work, for any movement, or even for any increase. We care only for the unique oneness of the Body. Although the number may be small, we are in the reality of this unity. But if we lose the unity, we lose the reality of the Lord's recovery.</P><P>In the churches and with the saints we must care for two elements: the Spirit and the Body. We must ask, "Is this the Spirit?" and, "Is this for the Body, or does this cause division?" We must be certain that what we are doing is in the Spirit and that it takes care of the unity. We do not want to become a movement that cares nothing for the Spirit; neither do we want to be a repetition of the division and confusion of the Christianity that does not care for the unique unity. We look to the Lord for His mercy and grace that we may always care for the Spirit and the Body. The Body is expressed in a practical way in the unique unity. We care for this unity, not merely in our locality, but in the whole earth. We must avoid anything that would cause division among the saints or among the churches. Again I say, we care only for the Lord's recovery, and the Lord's recovery is absolutely a matter in the Spirit and in the unique unity. May the Lord grant us His mercy and grace that we may be kept in His recovery. Otherwise, we shall be a repetition of the pitiful history of Christianity. May the Lord have mercy upon us that we would not become such a repetition. We all need to pray earnestly for the Lord's recovery; we need to pray earnestly that we would be kept in the Spirit and in the unique oneness. To be in the Spirit and in the unique oneness of the Body is to be kept in the Lord's recovery.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>FOUR ASPECTS OF THE SPIRIT</H1><P>In this message we shall consider a number of crucial verses pertaining to the Spirit and to our experience of the Spirit. All these verses are deeper and more profound than we have ever realized.</P><P>In John chapter four the Samaritan woman brought up the matter of the worship of God, saying, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship" (v. 20). In His reply to her, the Lord Jesus said, "God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality" (v. 24). If you are religious, in your worship of God you will bow down and say, "O God." But according to John 4:24, we must worship God in spirit and in reality. In our worship of God there is no visible object. Because God is Spirit, He is invisible. This Spirit is like the breath or the air. In fact, the Greek word for Spirit is the same word as the word for air or breath. When we worshipped God in the past, according to our concept, we worshipped One who was great and mighty or One who was in the heavens. We need to drop our religious concepts and worship in spirit. Actually, chapter four of John does not deal with the worship of God, but with the drinking of the living water. The Lord Jesus met the Samaritan woman for the purpose of giving her a drink. This is the subject of this portion of the Word. However, because of the religious question raised by the immoral, yet religious, Samaritan woman, the Lord Jesus spoke the word about worshipping in spirit. The Samaritan woman discovered that God was different from her concept of Him; for God is Spirit, and He is also a drink to satisfy our thirst.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WORSHIPPING GOD BY DRINKING<br>AND BREATHING OF HIM</H2><P>According to John chapter four, the very God whom we worship is good for drinking. The proper worship of God is not to bow down before Him; it is to drink Him as the living water and to breathe Him as the living air. God is a living drink, the unique drink in the universe that can quench our thirst. If you would kneel down before this drink and say, "O God, I worship You and bow down before You," He would say, "Foolish child, I don't want you to bow down to Me, worshipping Me in your religious way. I am here for you to drink. You need to drink of Me. The more you drink of Me, the more you worship Me." Have you ever realized that the true worship of God is the drinking of God? The more you drink of God, the more you worship Him.</P><P>We need to put together verses 14 and 24 of John chapter four. Verse 14, which speaks of drinking the living water, is the interpretation of verse 24. To drink of the living water is to worship God the Spirit. However, thousands of Christians worship God without drinking Him. Although they have worshipped Him again and again, they have never drunk of Him. When we say that God is Spirit, we do not mean that He is merely the object of our worship. No, when the Lord Jesus said that God is Spirit, He was indicating that we must drink of Him. In other words, we must receive Him into us, not only drinking Him as the water, but also breathing Him in as the living air. God is our breath, and we must breathe Him in. Thus, drinking Him and breathing Him is true worship. Have you worshipped God today by drinking and breathing? In John 20:22 the very Spirit, who is God, is likened to the air, the breath, the pneuma, and in chapter four the Spirit is likened to living water. The air is the living water, and the living water is the air. Today we worship our God by breathing Him in and by drinking of Him. This is the proper way to worship God.</P><P>How much we need God as our air and as our water! Nothing is more necessary for our physical life than water and air. Although we may live for many days without eating, we can go only a few days without drinking and only several minutes without breathing. Air and water are most necessary for our living. As the Spirit, our God is both the air and the water. We need to breathe Him in as the air, and we need to drink of Him as the water. We need to have a deep breathing and a deep drinking. This breathing and drinking is our worship. God is Spirit, and we must worship Him by breathing and drinking. This is not a mere doctrine, for doctrine cannot quench our thirst or refresh us. But this Spirit refreshes us, quenches our thirst, and satisfies us. Hallelujah, God is Spirit for our enjoyment!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>POSITIONED TO DRINK</H2><P>First Corinthians 12:13 says, "For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit" (Gk.). Because we all have been baptized into one Body, we all have been made, or positioned, to drink of one Spirit. Not many Christians fully realize that we have been positioned to drink of the Spirit. We all have been positioned in the living, eternal fountain to drink of the one Spirit. Thus, we are the drinking people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BACK TO DRINKING</H2><P>Although you may be familiar with all these verses, my burden is that you daily and hourly experience drinking of the Lord. The Lord's recovery is to bring you back to the drinking of God. Every day and all day we must drink of God. God, who is Spirit, is our drink. We should not worship Him in a religious way, but drink of Him in a living way. The genuine worship we render to God is our drinking of Him. The more we drink of Him, the more worship He receives from us. Whenever we come together, we should say, "Let us drink!" God is Spirit for us to drink.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BAPTIZED INTO THE NAME<br>OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>Matthew 28:19 says, "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit." This verse does not refer to a ritual; rather, it speaks of baptizing the believers into a name, which is the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. A name always denotes a person. For example, if I call a certain brother by name, the person himself responds. Thus, to be baptized into the name means to be baptized into the person, for the name is the person. According to this verse, the Person into whom we are baptized is the Person of the Triune God. The name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is the name of the Triune God. It is not merely the Father or the Son or the Spirit, but the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</P><P>There is no human language adequate to describe the Triune God in full. The Father denotes the source, the Son denotes the course, and the Spirit denotes the flow. The flow is with the course, and the course is with the source. These three, the source, the course, and the flow, are one reality. The source is in the course, and the course is the flow, the Spirit. The Father is in the Son, and the Son is the Spirit. Thus, we have the source, the course, and the flow of the reality. To baptize the believers into the name of the Triune God means to baptize them into the Person of the divine source, the divine course, and the divine flow. In other words, to baptize believers into the name of the Triune God is to place them into the flow of the Triune God.</P><P>Before someone believes in the Lord, he has nothing to do with the Triune God; he has nothing to do with the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. But after a person believes in the Lord, we must exercise our faith to place him into the very reality of the Triune God. Today the reality of the Triune God is the flow of the Spirit with the course of the Son and the source of the Father. We baptize the believers into such a reality. This reality is a Person, and this Person is triune: the Father as the source, the Son as the course, and the Spirit as the flow. Proper baptism is to place the believers into the flow of the Triune God. When anyone is baptized into such a Person, he is both satisfied and excited. Now he is in the flow, and he is even carried away by the flow.</P><P>When we were saved and baptized, most of us did not hear such a rich gospel or have such a proper baptism. I expect that from now on the churches in the Lord's recovery will preach a rich gospel and practice the proper baptism of placing people into the Person, the reality, of the Triune God, baptizing them into the Father as the source, the Son as the course, and the Spirit as the flow. In this way we put all the new converts into the flow of the Triune God. Are you in this flow? If you are, you should be able to say a strong, "Amen!" Because I am in this flow, I am sometimes beside myself with joy. I am in the flow of the Spirit with the course of the Son and the source of the Father. When I am in the Spirit, I have the Son; and when I have the Son, I have the Father. How wonderful! When we believe in the Son, we have the Father; and when we call, "O Lord Jesus," the Spirit comes, just as when we call a certain brother by name, the brother himself comes. Jesus is the name, and the Spirit is the Person. Therefore, when we call on the name of Jesus, the Spirit comes. Therefore, we have all three of the Triune God: the Father, the source; the Son, the course; and the Spirit, the flow. We are people in the flow of the Triune God. We should not understand this merely in a doctrinal way, but in the way of experience.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all" (Gk.). The grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Spirit are with us. Love is the source, grace is the course, and the fellowship is the flow. The fellowship is a matter of transmission, of conveying something into us. With the Father, the source, we have love. When the love comes forth, we have the course, the grace of Christ the Son. When this grace is conveyed to us, it becomes the fellowship of the Spirit. The fellowship of the Spirit transmits into us for our enjoyment all that Christ is along with the Father. This transmission is the flow, the fellowship. It is the transmission into our being of the very God the Spirit so that we may enjoy Him. Here in this transmission we enjoy the grace of Christ and we taste the love of God. Here we are in the fellowship, the communication, the flow, of the Triune God. Day and night something is being transmitted into our being for our enjoyment. In this way we enjoy the love of God and the grace of Christ in the fellowship of the Spirit. Today this Spirit is constantly flowing into us, through us, and out of us. This is the fellowship of the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TRIUNE GOD ISSUING IN THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Thus far, we have covered two aspects of the Spirit: that God is Spirit and that the Triune God issues in the Spirit. The Triune God with the Father as the source and with the Son as the course issues in the Spirit as the flow. The Father and the Son come to us in the flow of the Spirit. Therefore, the Triune God issues in the Spirit for our enjoyment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REDEEMER BECOMING A LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</H2><P>Now we come to a crucial point: the fact that Christ, the Redeemer, became a life-giving Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45 says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit" (Gk.). The last Adam was Jesus Christ in the flesh. As a man in the flesh, He was the Lamb of God who took away our sins. Furthermore, when He was crucified on the cross, He dealt with our natural life, our natural man, and our self. By dealing with our sins and our self, Christ made it possible for us to receive the divine life. God's intention was to impart His life into us. As the Lamb of God, the last Adam accomplished these two things on the cross, taking away our sins and dealing with our self and natural life. Both are included in the glad tidings. We need to see that our sins have been taken away and that our self has been dealt with. Thus, we are able to receive the divine life. After dying on the cross to take away our sins and to deal with our natural life, the last Adam, our Redeemer, became in His resurrection a life-giving Spirit to impart Himself as life into us.</P><P>When we believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him as our Redeemer, it was the life-giving Spirit who came into us. Many believers do not realize that they received the Lord Jesus not only as the Redeemer and the Savior, but also as the life-giving Spirit. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we knew that we were sinful. Therefore, we prayed, repented, confessed, and received Him as our Redeemer. However, we were not told that He would come into us to be our life. At least I was not told this when I believed in Him. However, I later found out that after believing in Him, there was something inside me that made me happy and joyful. Sometimes I even felt like leaping. Have you not had this experience? This is the experience of Christ as the life-giving Spirit. Although we received Him as our Redeemer, He came into us not only as our Redeemer, but also as the life-giving Spirit. Today He is in us mainly as the life-giving Spirit.</P><P>If you ask believers where their Redeemer, the Lord Jesus, is, many lift up their eyes, point to heaven, and say, "He is in heaven." Rarely do you find a Christian who, when asked where the Lord Jesus is, will say with rejoicing, "Christ is in me!" If you ask me where my Jesus is, I will say, "Jesus my Redeemer is, on the one hand, in the heavens as my Lord and, on the other hand, in me as the life-giving Spirit." For this reason sometimes I am rejoicing, bubbling, and even beside myself with joy. Rejoice, Jesus Christ is the life-giving Spirit within us! Before coming into the churches, you probably never heard that the Redeemer became a life-giving Spirit. But there is a verse in the Bible telling us that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit. It seems that those in Christianity do not have the second part of 1 Corinthians 15:45. After completing the work of redemption, Christ became the life-giving Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD BEING THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Verse 6 of 2 Corinthians 3 says, "The letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life," and verse 17 says, "Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." If we put these verses together, we see that the Lord is the Spirit who gives life. Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is no bondage, no deadness, no entanglement of letters and regulations. Because the life-giving Spirit is within me, I am free from the law, from knowledge, from bondage, from regulations, and from all dead letters. Hallelujah, I have the living One within me!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TRANSFORMED BY THE LORD SPIRIT</H2><P>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, "But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit" (Gk.). If we, like mirrors, behold and reflect the Lord without having any veils on our faces, we shall be transformed into His image from one degree of glory to another. This is from the Lord Spirit. This indicates that the life-giving Spirit is now doing a transforming work within us. Our God is the Spirit for us to breathe in and to drink of, and our Triune God issues in the Spirit as the flow, the fellowship, the transmission. Also our Redeemer is the life-giving Spirit within us, imparting Himself into us as life. When we open to Him, gaze on Him, behold Him, and reflect Him, we are under the process of transformation. This means that all that He is, now is being transfused into our being. By being transfused with all that He is, we shall have a complete transformation. We shall be transformed into His image from one stage of glory to another. Eventually, we shall all be the same as He is. This does not take place by means of teaching or doctrine, but by means of Him as the Lord Spirit. This Lord Spirit is in us right now.</P><P>To this point we have seen three aspects of the Spirit: that our God today is Spirit, that the Triune God issues in the Spirit as the flow, and that Jesus Christ, the Redeemer, has become the life-giving Spirit within us to transform us by imparting Himself into us as the transforming element. Do not think that you are so familiar with all these verses about the Spirit. You need to consider your experience. I do not care whether or not you know these verses. I am burdened to fellowship with you to bring you into the real experience of these verses. God is Spirit, the Triune God issues in the Spirit, and the Redeemer today is the life- giving Spirit, transmitting Himself into our being that we may be transformed into His image to be exactly the same as He. This is the Spirit we must experience today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EXPERIENCING THE WORD AS THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Now we must proceed to see another aspect of the Spirit. Not only is God the Spirit, not only is the issue of the Triune God the Spirit, and not only has the Redeemer become the life-giving Spirit, but the words the Lord Jesus speaks are also Spirit. John 6:63 says, "The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life." Years ago I could not understand how the word could be the Spirit. Eventually I learned that the word of God is Spirit because it is God's breath. Second Timothy 3:16 says, "All scripture is God-breathed" (Gk.).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FUNCTION OF NOURISHING</H2><P>According to the New Testament, the word of God, which is God's breath, has various functions. The first of these functions is nourishing, a function covered in John chapter six. This chapter reveals that the Lord Jesus is the bread of life (John 6:35, 58). The bread of life is the Lord Himself conveyed to us in His word. The word is the breath of God that nourishes us with Christ as our food. Thus, the word has a nourishing function. It is able to nourish us and to satisfy us with all that the Lord Jesus is. He is food, and this food is conveyed by the word, which is the Spirit. Whenever we come to the Bible, we should not simply take in the letters by exercising our mind to understand what is written. We must also exercise our spirit to touch God's breath, the Spirit of the Lord. If we do this, we shall be nourished.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE KILLING FUNCTION OF THE WORD</H2><P>Ephesians 6:17 says, "And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God" (Gk). According to this verse, the word, which is the Spirit of God, has a killing function. It kills the enemy, the flesh, the self, the darkness, and all other negative things, such as hatred and envy. The word of God as the breath of God has the ability to kill. It has the capability to slay every negative thing. Many of us can testify that the more we pray-read the Word, the more the negative things within us are killed. Although you may not have the intention to kill your hatred, the living word that enters into you kills your hatred as you pray-read the Word. It also kills your pride. Again and again, the living word as the breath of God kills Satan. Hence, the word not only nourishes, but also kills.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FUNCTION OF FURNISHING THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>Second Timothy 3:16 and 17 indicate that the word of God also has the function of furnishing the believers. Many Christians are like unfurnished apartments with no bed to lie down upon and no sofa to rest on. Are you like this? We need to be furnished, and nothing can furnish us except the living word. The more you pray-read the Word, which is the breath of God, the living Spirit, the more you are furnished. Although teachings may instruct you, they cannot furnish you. You may read the verse that says, "Husbands, love your wives." But if you simply take this verse as black and white letters, it will be a teaching to you; it will not furnish you. However, if you pray-read this verse and touch the Spirit in it, the Spirit will supply you with love. Then you will have something with which to love your wife. The word of God is not merely letters; it is God's breath. As the living Spirit of God, it not only instructs us, corrects us, and reproves us, but it also furnishes us, equips us, with the riches of Christ. This is the way we are equipped.</P><P>Therefore, the word of God has three main functions: the nourishing function, the killing function, and the furnishing function. Day by day we need to pray-read the Word, contacting the breath of God in order that we may be nourished, experience the killing power, and be furnished with all that we need for our Christian life. All that we need for our daily Christian living is conveyed into our being through the living word. We should not merely read and study the Scriptures with our mind; we must also exercise our spirit to contact the living word. If we do this, we shall receive the nourishment, experience the killing power, and be equipped with the divine elements. In this way we become a proper dwelling place for the Lord.</P><P>In this message we have seen four aspects of the Spirit. We have seen that God is Spirit, that the Triune God issues in the Spirit, that the Redeemer has become a life-giving Spirit, and that the word of the Lord, His breath, is the Spirit that nourishes, kills, and furnishes. In substance, God is Spirit; in His economy, the Triune God issues in the Spirit; in His consummation, the Redeemer has become the life-giving Spirit; and in His life supply, His word is the Spirit as the nourishing, killing, and furnishing instrument. We need the full experience of these four aspects of the Spirit. It is by this Spirit that we are transformed to be the same as Christ. It is by this Spirit in the Word that we are supplied with the nourishment, the killing power, and the equipping with all the divine elements. In this way we are fully equipped to be the Lord's habitation.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</H1><P>John 7:39 says, "But this He said concerning the Spirit, Whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified." At the time the Lord Jesus was speaking these words, "the Spirit was not yet"; this means that the Spirit was not there yet because Jesus was not yet glorified. When I was young, I was greatly troubled by this word. I simply could not understand how the Spirit could not have been there when Jesus was speaking. Many years later I read Andrew Murray's book, The Spirit of Christ. Chapter five of this book is entitled "The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus." That chapter shocked me. Through that chapter my eyes were opened to see why the Spirit was not yet there when the Lord Jesus was speaking. Before the Lord's crucifixion and resurrection, the Spirit of God consisted only of divinity. However, after the Lord's resurrection, many items were compounded into the Spirit of God. Hence, after the resurrection of Christ, the Spirit of God was composed not only of divinity, but of many other crucial items as well. At the time of John chapter seven the Spirit of God was there, possessing merely divinity, but the all-inclusive Spirit, including all the other items, was not there yet.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF GOD BECOMING<br>THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</H2><P>The Spirit of God was there from the very beginning (Gen. 1:1-2), but the Spirit as the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9), the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19), was not yet at the time the Lord spoke the word recorded in John 7, because He was not yet glorified. Jesus was glorified when He was resurrected (Luke 24:26). After His resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ, who was breathed into the disciples by Christ in the evening of the day He was resurrected (John 20:22). The Spirit is now another Comforter, who is the Spirit of reality promised by Christ before His death (John 14:16-17). When the Spirit was the Spirit of God, He had only the divine element. When He became the Spirit of Jesus Christ through Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, He had both the divine and human element, with all the essence and reality of the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ. Hence, He is now the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ as the living water for us to receive (John 7:38-39).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE COMPOUND OINTMENT</H2><P>Although I was enlightened through the reading of Andrew Murray's book, I was not able to give others a thorough definition of the all-inclusive Spirit until Exodus 30 was opened to me. In this chapter we have the matter of the compound ointment (Exo. 30:22-33). In typology we have a type of the Spirit of God in the Old Testament, and this type is the olive oil. If you read the Old Testament carefully, you will see that several times olive oil is used to indicate the Spirit of God (Psa. 45:7; Isa. 61:1). According to Exodus 30, four spices are compounded into a hin of olive oil. Thus, in Exodus 30 we do not see simply the olive oil, but a compound. A hin of olive oil is the basic element of this compound, and four spices are added to it: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. When these spices are added to the oil, the oil becomes an ointment, a compound of five elements, the oil plus the four spices.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD COMPOUNDED WITH MAN</H2><P>In typology numbers are significant. Here in Exodus 30 we have one plus four. In typology the number one signifies the unique God. God, signified by the complete unit of a hin of olive oil, is unique and complete. The number four signifies the creatures. In both Ezekiel 1 and in Revelation 4 we read of the four living creatures. Hence, in the Bible the number four always signifies the creatures. Therefore, in this compound ointment we have God signified by the number one and God's creatures signified by the number four. This indicates that the compound ointment is a matter of God plus His creature, man. This reveals that the ointment is compounded with both God and man. God, the basic element, is signified by the olive oil, and man is represented by the four spices.</P><P>Some of the critics condemn the matter of the mingling of God with man. These critics lack knowledge. God and man are not only mingled, but even compounded. In Exodus 30 we have the olive oil compounded with the four spices. When tea is put into water, that is mingling. But when four spices are added to oil to produce an ointment, that is compounding. Compounding involves more than mingling. Compounding implies mingling, but mingling is not as thorough as compounding. Hallelujah, God has been compounded with humanity!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SPICES</H2><P>Let us now consider the spices in more detail. Exodus 30:23 says, "Take thou also unto thee finest spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of fragrant cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of fragrant calamus two hundred and fifty shekels" (Heb.). The quantity of the first spice, myrrh, is five hundred shekels. However, the quantity of the second and third spices, cinnamon and calamus, is only two hundred and fifty shekels. Put together, the cinnamon and the calamus make one complete unit of five hundred shekels. Like myrrh, cassia, the fourth spice, is in the quantity of five hundred shekels. These three complete units of five hundred shekels signify the Triune God, and the hin of olive oil signifies the unique God. Hence, in this compound we see the three in one and the one in three.</P><P>The second of the three complete units of five hundred shekels was split. This points to the fact that the Son, the second of the Godhead, was split on the cross. The splitting of the second unit of five hundred shekels thus implies the death of Christ. The number four of the four spices indicates Christ's humanity. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God, and the Word became flesh (John 1:1, 14). This indicates that the Triune God is involved with humanity. When the Word became flesh, the Triune God became involved with humanity. The Triune God was involved with the man Jesus. At a certain time, Christ, the second of the Trinity, was crucified, split, put to death.</P><P>Myrrh signifies the sweetness of the death of Christ, and cinnamon signifies the sweetness of the effectiveness of His death. The death of Christ is both sweet and effective. In this compound ointment we have not only divinity and humanity, but also the sweet death of Christ and the effectiveness of the death of Christ. This means that when we get this ointment, within it there is the effectiveness of Christ's death. Calamus is a type of reed that rises high, even shoots high, into the air out of muddy ground. It surely indicates the power of Christ's resurrection, for Christ resurrected from the mud of death into the heavenly air. He was the real calamus. Cassia signifies the flavor of the power of the Lord's resurrection. According to some lexicons, in ancient times cassia was used not only as a spice, but also as a repellent to repel insects and snakes. Satan, the snake, is afraid of the resurrection of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE COMPOUND OINTMENT AS A PICTURE<br>OF THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</H2><P>In this compound ointment we have the Triune God signified by the numbers one and three and humanity signified by the number four. We also have the death of Christ, the effectiveness of Christ's death, the resurrection of Christ, and the flavor of the power of Christ's resurrection. This compound ointment is a picture of today's compound Spirit. Before the Lord's crucifixion and resurrection, the Spirit of God was not a compound. He had merely divinity, nothing else. But after the Lord's resurrection, this Spirit of God has been compounded with humanity, with the death of Christ, with the resurrection of Christ, with the effectiveness of Christ's death, and with the effectiveness of His resurrection. This all has been compounded into one ointment which today is the Spirit of Christ. Before Christ's resurrection, the Spirit of God was in existence, but not the Spirit of Christ. The Spirit of Christ came into existence immediately after the Lord's resurrection. After Jesus had been crucified and resurrected, the compound Spirit came into being. In other words, on the day of Christ's resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of Christ. In the Spirit of Christ there are many items: divinity, humanity, the effectiveness of Christ's death, and the power of Christ's resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CHRIST'S DEATH<br>BEING IN THE SPIRIT</H2><P>One day in 1954, as I was speaking to the church in Hong Kong, I shared a word about reckoning ourselves dead. I told the people that in the past I had done a great deal of reckoning, but that the more I reckoned myself dead, the more alive I was. If we would not reckon ourselves dead, the self would probably be dormant. But as soon as we try to reckon ourselves to be dead, the dormant self is awakened. Thus, our reckoning did not help us, although it did help to arouse our dormant self. I told those in that meeting that it is not a matter of reckoning, because the genuine effectiveness of the death of Christ today is in the Spirit. The death of Christ can be realized only when we are in the Spirit. If we are not in the Spirit, reckoning will not work, no matter how earnestly we do it. The effectiveness of the death of Christ is not in our reckoning; it is in the all-inclusive Spirit.</P><P>Many Christians have been helped by Brother Nee's book, The Normal Christian Life. In this book Brother Nee has a chapter on reckoning. However, the messages in this book were given in Brother Nee's early ministry. At that time, he told people to reckon themselves dead. Later, however, in one of his messages he said strongly that the death in Christ in Romans 6 can be experienced only in the Spirit in Romans 8. If we do not have Romans 8, we cannot experience Romans 6. He pointed out that the fact of having been crucified with Christ in Romans 6 can be experienced only by the Spirit in Romans 8. I can confirm this by my experience.</P><P>The effectiveness of Christ's death is in the Spirit. This Spirit is like an all-inclusive dose of medicine. Some medicines are all-inclusive, containing some elements that nourish us and other elements that kill germs. The all-inclusive Spirit is an all-inclusive dose. If we take in this all-inclusive Spirit, it will heal us, no matter what our illness is. Within this Spirit is the nourishing element and the killing element. The killing power of the death of Christ today is in the all-inclusive Spirit.</P><P>Although, according to my experience, I began to speak this in 1954, I did not have the light on this matter from the Bible. One day as I was considering Exodus 30 the light came. I saw that myrrh, which signifies the death of Christ, was compounded into the Spirit. The Spirit of Christ today is no longer merely the oil; it is the ointment. We do not have simply oil, but a compound ointment. In the simple olive oil there was just one item&#151;divinity&#151;but in the compound ointment there are many items including divinity, humanity, death, and resurrection. All the things of Christ, all that He passed through, and all that He has obtained and attained have been compounded together here into this all-inclusive Spirit. The Bible says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit" (1 Cor. 15:45, Gk.). This means that all of the Triune God plus humanity, the death of Christ, and the resurrection of Christ have been compounded into this life-giving Spirit. Thus, the life-giving Spirit is a compound Spirit. In this life-giving Spirit we have divinity, humanity, the effectiveness of the death of Christ, and the power of the resurrection of Christ.</P><P>By your experience you can testify that when the life-giving Spirit moves in you, on the one hand, you are nourished, but, on the other hand, something within you is killed. Does not the life-giving Spirit kill something within you? Certainly it does. Perhaps a certain husband is exchanging words with his wife. This exchange of words must be killed. The only thing that can kill it is the effectiveness of Christ's death in the life-giving Spirit. In the life-giving Spirit there is the killing power. Sisters, have you not experienced such a killing of your temper many times? If you asked me this question, I would say that my self is killed nearly all day long. My stubborn self needs to be killed again and again.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT AS A REPELLENT</H2><P>The all-inclusive Spirit is also a repellent. All of us are familiar with the way the odor of insect repellent drives away mosquitoes. Day by day we must put on the life-giving Spirit as a repellent to Satan. When you call on the name of the Lord Jesus, you not only drink of Him; you also put on the life-giving Spirit as a repellent. If the first thing in the morning you do not put on this repellent, the snake will attack you, and you may lose your temper during the day. But if you call on the Lord's name a few times, you will not only drink of the living water, but also apply the repellent. Whenever you do this, the snake will be frightened.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF JESUS</H2><P>Now we can understand why we are told in John 7 that the Spirit was not yet. Of course, the Spirit of God was there, but the Spirit of Christ as the compound Spirit was not yet. Acts 16:6 speaks of the Holy Spirit, and Acts 16:7 speaks of the Spirit of Jesus (Gk.). Today the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Jesus. In the Spirit of God there is no humanity, but in the Spirit of Jesus there is both divinity and humanity. As Paul was traveling and preaching, he needed not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of Jesus. In our preaching today we also need the Spirit of Jesus, into which His humanity has been compounded.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST</H2><P>Romans 8:9 reveals that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, just as Acts 16 reveals that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Jesus. In Acts 16 we have the Spirit of Jesus, indicating that the apostles were suffering in the humanity of Jesus. But in Romans 8 we have the Spirit of Christ, indicating that today we may live in Christ's resurrection. Romans 8 is a chapter on the resurrection life, which is in the Spirit of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</H2><P>Philippians 1:19 speaks of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This is neither the Spirit only with humanity nor the Spirit only with resurrection, for in the Spirit of Jesus Christ we have both humanity and resurrection. Therefore, the supply of such a Spirit is a bountiful supply. This is not merely the Spirit of God with divine power, but the Spirit of Jesus Christ, including both Christ's suffering humanity and powerful resurrection. When Paul wrote the Epistle to the Philippians, he was in prison and was suffering. Although he was suffering there by the Spirit of Jesus, he suffered with the power of Christ's resurrection and with the expectation of enjoying the first resurrection. This reveals that he was suffering not only by the Spirit of Jesus, but also by the Spirit of Christ. Therefore, he was suffering by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, by the humanity of Jesus and by the resurrection of Christ. This is the all-inclusive Spirit with His bountiful supply.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PROCESSED SPIRIT</H2><P>Whenever I speak about the compound Spirit, I sense that I am short of utterance. I simply do not have the language adequate to express fully what I have seen regarding this matter. The Spirit is no longer merely the Spirit of God. Today the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ. In this all-inclusive Spirit we enjoy God, the uplifted humanity of Jesus, the sweetness of the death of Christ, the effectiveness of the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the power of the resurrection of Christ. All these elements are included in this one compound ointment. Remember that the Spirit of Christ is no longer simply the olive oil; it is the compound ointment. This is the processed Spirit. Certainly compounding is a process. Whenever something is compounded, it passes through a process. Hallelujah, today we do not have a Spirit simply composed of divinity alone, but the all-inclusive Spirit compounded with divinity, the humanity of Jesus, the death of Christ, and His resurrection. By our experience we can testify that God, the humanity of Jesus, the effective death of Christ, and the powerful resurrection of Christ are all in the all-inclusive Spirit. This is the Spirit of God compounded with Christ's humanity, death, and resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NUMBER OF RESPONSIBILITY</H2><P>The ointment is composed of five basic elements: olive oil, myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. The quantity of the spices compounded with the olive oil is one hundred times five. In the Bible the number five, composed of four plus one, is the number of responsibility. Both the ten commandments and the ten virgins are divided into two groups of five (Exo. 34:28-29; Matt. 25:1-2). Look at your hand: You have four fingers and one thumb for the bearing of responsibility. If you had four fingers but no thumb, it would be very difficult to pick up things. Are you the number four or the number five? If God has been added to you, you are number five. I know that I am number five, because God has been added to me. The significance of the number five is that the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is for the bearing of responsibility. The more you enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit of Christ, the more ability you will have to bear responsibility.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANOINTED BY THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</H2><P>The main point we must see in this message is that the very Spirit of God is no longer just the Spirit of God, but the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ. He is no longer just the olive oil, but the compound ointment of five elements. Four spices have been compounded into the olive oil to produce the ointment. According to Exodus 30, the tabernacle and all its utensils were anointed with this ointment. Even the priests were anointed with it. This indicates that the entire church and all the serving ones in the church must be anointed by the compound Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EXPERIENCING THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</H2><P>John 20:22 says, "He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit." This is the Spirit expected in John 7:39 and promised in John 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; 16:7-8, 13. In John 7 the Spirit the disciples were to receive was not yet because Jesus had not yet been glorified. But on the day of His resurrection the Lord came to the disciples by night, breathed into them, and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit." In John 7 the Spirit was not yet, but in John 20 the Spirit was present because Jesus had been glorified. He was glorified in His resurrection; hence, the compound Spirit had come into existence. The Lord's breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter. This fulfillment differs from Acts 2:1-4, which was the fulfillment of the Father's promise in Luke 24:49. There the Spirit as a rushing mighty wind came as power upon the disciples for their work (Acts 1:8). Here, the Spirit as the breath was breathed as life into the disciples for their life. By breathing the Spirit into the disciples, the Lord imparted Himself as life and everything into them. Thus, all that He had spoken in chapters fourteen through sixteen could be fulfilled.</P><P>Just as falling into the ground to die and growing out of the ground transforms a grain of wheat into another form, new and living, so the death and resurrection of the Lord transfigured Him from the flesh into the Spirit. As the last Adam in the flesh, He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) through the process of death and resurrection. As He is the embodiment of the Father, so the Spirit is the realization, the reality, of Him. It is as the Spirit that He was breathed into the disciples. It is as the Spirit that He is received into His believers and flows out of them as rivers of living water (John 7:38-39). It is as the Spirit that through His death and resurrection He came back to the disciples, entered into them as their Comforter, and began to abide in them (John 14:16-17). It is as the Spirit that He can live in the disciples and they can live by Him and with Him (John 14:19). It is as the Spirit that He can abide in the disciples and they can abide in Him (John 14:20; 15:4-5). It is as the Spirit that He can come with the Father to His lover and make an abode with him (John 14:23). It is as the Spirit that He can make all that He is and all He has to be fully realized by the disciples (John 16:13-16). It is as the Spirit that He came to meet with His brothers as the church to declare the Father's name to them and to praise Him in their midst (Heb. 2:11-12). It is as the Spirit that He can send His disciples with His commission, with Himself as life and everything to them, in the same way the Father sent Him (John 20:21). Hence, they are qualified to represent Him with His authority in the fellowship of His Body (John 20:23). It is as the Spirit that Christ does everything today. As the all-inclusive Spirit, He is doing everything with us and to us. God's economy is entirely involved with this all-inclusive Spirit, who is the compound ointment whose anointing we must experience today.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>EXPERIENCING THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</H1><P>If we have an all-inclusive bird's-eye view of the Bible, we shall see that after Christ's ascension, our God, who is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, is today the all- inclusive Spirit. Within this Spirit there is divinity, humanity, the effectiveness of Christ's death, the power of His resurrection, and the ascension. In other words, in this all-inclusive Spirit there is all that God is, all that man in a proper sense is, and all that the Lord Jesus has passed through, gained, and obtained. All this is in the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. Our Savior today is not only the Redeemer, but also the life-giving Spirit. We thank the Lord that by means of the clear view of all the books in the Bible, we see such a wonderful Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PICTURE OF THE COMPOUND OINTMENT</H2><P>This Spirit is mysterious and glorious, but very difficult to describe in words. This is the reason the Bible affords us the picture of the compound ointment in Exodus chapter thirty. In this chapter the olive oil represents the Spirit of God, and the four spices represent humanity, God's creature. The myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia all have a special significance. In the Bible myrrh signifies the sweetness of Christ's precious death, and cinnamon signifies the sweetness of the effectiveness of that death. Calamus signifies the rising power, the resurrection of Christ. Cassia was used in ancient times to repel snakes. If we put all these items together, we must admit that they no doubt portray the details of the compound all-inclusive Spirit.</P><P>In this Spirit we have God and the proper humanity. In this Spirit we have the effectiveness of the death of Christ and the power of the resurrection of Christ. Whatever Christ is and whatever He has done, obtained, and attained are all included in this Spirit. The Lord has shown us the significance of the myrrh, the cinnamon, the calamus, and the cassia; the reason the two middle items are each half of a full quantity; and the fact that these four spices together make three complete units of five hundred shekels each. The hin of olive oil was compounded with the four spices into one ointment. This signifies the mingling of the unique God with His creature, man, to form one compound unit. The tabernacle with all its furniture and vessels and all the priests were anointed with this compound ointment, not merely with olive oil. Today we are not under the anointing of the Spirit that includes only divinity; we are under the anointing of the compound Spirit.</P><P>When the Apostle John used the term, the "anointing," in 1 John 2:27 for the Spirit's move, no doubt he thought of Exodus chapter thirty, the source of the word anointing. The word "anointing" was not used firstly by John; rather, it had been used already in Exodus thirty. The anointing that abides in us is the compound Spirit as the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE INITIAL EXPERIENCE<br>OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>In order to have this all-inclusive life-giving Spirit and to experience the Spirit, we must first be reborn or regenerated by Him. Regeneration is the initial experience of our Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SON INSEPARABLE FROM THE FATHER</H2><P>Do not try to separate the Father from the Son, or the Son from the Father. The New Testament reveals that while the Son is here, the Father is with Him. Furthermore, the coming of the Spirit is also the coming of the Son, and the Son always comes with the Father. John 6:46 says, "Not that anyone has seen the Father, except Him Who is from God, He has seen the Father." The Greek preposition translated "from" is para. Here the sense of this preposition is "from with." The Lord is not only from God, but also with God. While He is from God, He is still with God (John 8:16, 29; 16:32). In these verses the Lord seemed to be saying, "I come from with My Father. When I come from My Father, I come with Him." This means that when the Son comes, the Father is with Him. When the Son was sent by the Father, the Son was sent not only by the Father, but also with the Father. When the Father sent the Son, the Father came with the Son. Therefore, when we receive the Son, we receive the Father.</P><P>This may offend our religious mentality. The religious mind always tries to figure this out. But the more it tries, the more difficulty it has, because the Father is with the Son, and the Son is now the life-giving Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45 says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit." If you argue that the Spirit here is not the Holy Spirit, then I would say that you believe that there are two Spirits that give life. Christ today is the life-giving Spirit. If this life-giving Spirit is not the Holy Spirit, then you believe in two life-giving Spirits. Do you believe that in the universe there are two life-giving Spirits? Certainly it is heresy to teach this. Our God is triune. As the Triune God, He has passed through the complete process and today is the all-inclusive Spirit. I do not care for the explanation of this&#151;I care only for the fact. The Bible reveals that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit. If we would experience Him, we must be born of Him. As soon as a sinner confesses his sin to God and believes in the Son of God, he is born again of the Triune God. However, everyone who has been born again needs to experience this Spirit more and more.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EXPERIENCING THE SPIRIT IN TWO ASPECTS</H2><P>We need to experience the Spirit in two main aspects. In the first aspect we experience the Spirit from within, as the One within us. In the second aspect we experience the Spirit from without, as the One upon us. We need to experience Him from within and from without. This is pictured for us in the meal offering. The meal offering is made of fine flour mingled with oil (Lev. 2:5-6). When the fine flour is mingled with the oil, the oil must get into the flour. This is the oil within the fine flour. Leviticus 2:6 then says, "Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereupon." This is the oil upon the flour. First the oil is mingled with the fine flour to form a lump, and then the oil is poured upon the lump. Thus, the oil is both within the meal offering and upon it. The meal offering is permeated, saturated, and soaked with oil. This is a picture of what we should be. We all should be mingled with the Spirit, saturated with the Spirit, permeated with the Spirit, soaked with the Spirit, and also covered with the Spirit. Both within and without we should have the Spirit. Inside and outside we should be full of the Spirit. Thus, we are permeated, saturated, and soaked with the Spirit. This is the proper Christian life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT AS WATER AND BREATH</H2><P>In the New Testament there are two lines of the experience of the all-inclusive Spirit: the line of John and the line of Luke. In John's Gospel and in his first Epistle we have the experience of the Spirit within. John uses two main symbols to signify this aspect of the Spirit. First, John used the symbol of water, saying that the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is like living water for people to drink. The Spirit is also likened to water in John's last book, the book of Revelation. In Revelation 22:17 the people are called to drink of the living water. No doubt, this living water is the life-giving Spirit. This is clearly indicated in John 7:37-39.</P><P>The second symbol of the Spirit in John's writings is the breath. According to John 20:22, the Lord Jesus came to His disciples on the evening of His resurrection, breathed into them, and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit." According to the writings of the Apostle John, the Spirit is the water for drinking and the breath for breathing. John used these two symbols to represent what the life-giving Spirit is today. This Spirit is the water to quench our thirst and the breath for us to breathe in. As we breathe in this Spirit, we have our life in this breath. This is the inward aspect of the life-giving Spirit. All of us in the Lord's recovery have learned to drink and breathe of this Spirit. We need to drink of Him and breathe Him in by calling on His name. A stanza of a hymn written by Miss M. E. Barber has the following lines:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Blessed Jesus! Mighty Savior!<br>In Thy Name is all I need;<br>Just to breathe the Name of Jesus,<br>Is to drink of Life indeed.</P><P>The way to breathe the name of Jesus is to call, "O Lord Jesus." No doubt this sister often called on the name of Jesus. Otherwise, how could she say in her hymn that to breathe the name of Jesus is to drink of life indeed? The way to breathe His name is to call, "O Lord Jesus." "Just to breathe the name of Jesus is to drink of life indeed." This short stanza also indicates that our breathing is our drinking. To breathe is to drink. When we call on the name of Jesus, we both breathe and drink. This is the experience of the life-giving Spirit in the Gospel of John, a book of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT AS CLOTHING AND WIND</H2><P>Besides John's line, the line of the inward aspect of the Spirit, we have the line of Luke, the line of the outward aspect. We need to experience the life-giving Spirit both from within and from without. Like John, Luke also uses two symbols for the Spirit. Luke 24:49 says, "And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be clothed with power from on high" (Gk.). In this verse Luke uses the symbol of clothing. The Lord says that the disciples should wait in Jerusalem until they are clothed, enveloped, with power from on high. This obviously indicates the outward experience of the Spirit. A drink is something inward, and clothing is something outward. But both are for living. Today we drink liquids and we put on clothing. Have you ever realized that this all-inclusive Spirit is both our drink inwardly and our clothing outwardly? We need Him as our drink within, and we need Him as our clothing without.</P><P>In Acts, Luke uses another symbol, the symbol of the mighty wind. Wind is similar to breath. It is mainly the wind that brings us fresh air to be our breath. Although the wind and the breath are similar, breath is for living and wind is for power. For the inward experience of the Spirit, we have the water to drink and the breath to breathe, and for the outward experience we have the clothing to put on and the mighty wind to blow upon us. The inward aspect is for life and for living, and the outward aspect is for power and function.</P><P>When you are alone in your room, you may drink all the water you want, but you do not need to be clothed in a particular way. However, when you appear before others, you must wear proper clothing. Authority comes with a proper uniform. Everyone respects a policeman. But no one respects a policeman who has no uniform. However, you automatically drive carefully whenever you see a policeman in uniform because of the authority represented by that uniform. The outward experience of the Spirit is our uniform. On the day of Pentecost Peter put on this uniform, and the whole universe was afraid of him. Hell, the demons, Satan, and all the rebellious ones were afraid of Peter because they saw that he was clothed with power from on high and that he possessed the highest authority.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BELIEVING AND CALLING</H2><P>Everything has been accomplished for us, and we can have both the inward and outward experience of the Spirit. Do not worry; there is no need for you to do anything. Simply believe in the glad tidings. The highest gospel is that everything pertaining to the inward experience and the outward experience of the Spirit has been accomplished. Simply believe whatever the Bible says and call upon the name of the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A GREAT SECRET</H2><P>In Acts chapter two there is a great secret, a secret which has been overlooked by most Christians. Acts 2:17 says, "And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh." Verse 21 says, "And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved." In Acts chapter two, to be saved is to receive the Spirit. To be saved is not simply to be forgiven of our sins or to be rescued out of hell, but also to have the Holy Spirit. What must take place for us to have the Holy Spirit and be saved? Two things: first, God must pour out His Spirit; second, we need to call on the name of the Lord. The Spirit has already been poured out. Now you need to call on the name of the Lord Jesus. When you call on the name of the Lord, the outpoured Spirit will get into you and will be upon you. This is the reason Romans 10:13 says, "Whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR NEED TO CALL<br>ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</H2><P>Today we need to learn to call upon the name of the Lord. I am heavily burdened to impress you with the need of calling. Throughout the centuries, Satan has shut the mouths of so many Christians. If you call on the name of the Lord Jesus all day long, you will be saturated, permeated, and soaked with the Spirit, and the power poured out from on high will be your portion. There is no need for me to convince you of this. Check your past experience. Often when you found yourself in trouble, you called on the name of the Lord. We all have some amount of experience. Usually we did not call on the Lord. We simply did not like calling on His name. Therefore, the Lord sent us some difficulty to help us or even to force us to call on Him. When the troubles came, we spontaneously called out, "O Lord Jesus." Perhaps we did not call in a very pleasant way. Nevertheless, we called and we received breath, strengthening, and refreshment. I want to impress you that the secret of experiencing the inward aspect and the outward aspect of this wonderful Spirit is simply to call again and again. After you call, you will pray. Then you will call more and pray more. Eventually, it will be difficult to tell whether you are experiencing the inward aspect or the outward aspect. Then you will be filled with refreshment, and outwardly you will be released. You will have the power, the boldness, the assurance, and the faith to speak strongly. You will not have any doubts whatever. The way to experience this wonderful Spirit is by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. Be simple and call on the name of the Lord.</P><P>We all need to be de-drugged and simplified. When I am at home, I experience the Lord in a simple way, like a simple child. The simplest way for me to experience my Lord is to say, "O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus." Many times I call on the name of the Lord while I am cleaning. When the work tires me, I am strengthened by calling, "O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus." There are times when I have nothing to speak. However, after calling on the name of the Lord for a few minutes, I have a great deal to say. Try it. If you call on the name of the Lord for five minutes, you will be set on fire. Oh, we must be the calling people!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CALLING PEOPLE</H2><P>At least one book in the New Testament&#151;1 Corinthians&#151;was written to the calling people. This book was written to all those who call on the name of the Lord Jesus (1 Cor. 1:2). When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, he received authority to persecute and even kill the believers. In Acts 9 his intention was to bind all those who called on the name of the Lord. This indicates that the Christians in ancient times were the calling ones. There was no need to tell others that they were Christians; neither was there a need for others to discern who the Christians were. It was easy to tell because they were the calling people. They called on the name of Jesus. We must be today's calling people, all day long calling on the name of the Lord. When you call on His name, you are in the Spirit. When you call on His name, you will be filled with the Spirit, saturated with the Spirit, permeated with the Spirit, and soaked with the Spirit. When you call on the name of Jesus, the Spirit will be poured out upon you. Within and without we shall be full of the Spirit.</P><P>Some meetings may be started simply by calling on the name of the Lord for several minutes. The Lord hates deadness more than anything. Nothing is as defiling as death. Although I do not encourage you to be beside yourself, I would like to impress you and even to charge you to call on the name of the Lord. Those who do can testify that it certainly makes a difference. I expect that the time will come when we shall all be accustomed to calling on the name of the Lord Jesus all the time. Before you read the Bible, try calling on the name of the Lord Jesus for a few minutes. What a difference it will make in your reading of the Scriptures! Although it will not change the Bible, it will change you. You will be living, and your spirit will be stirred up. Mere knowledge is useless, but calling, "O Lord Jesus" is useful. Do you know the way to receive the Spirit? There is no need to wrinkle your brow or fast for three days. The Lord never predestined you to do that. Rather, He destined you to call on the Lord. In His economy He has already accomplished everything for the inward and outward experiences of the Spirit, for the indwelling of the Spirit, and for the outpouring of the Spirit. Now He is here as the all-inclusive Spirit. This Spirit includes the Savior, the Redeemer, and the Life-giver. He is waiting not for you to fast or to pray, but to call on His name. He is waiting for you to breathe the name of Jesus and to drink of life indeed. I encourage you to try it. All the local churches must be calling churches, and every saint in the Lord's recovery must be one who calls on the name of the Lord. We have been called to call on Him.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ANOINTING, THE SEALING,<br>THE EARNEST, AND THE FIRSTFRUIT</H1><P>In this message we shall consider some symbols of the Spirit. Second Corinthians 1:21 and 22 say, "Now he who firmly attaches us with you unto the anointed one and hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the foretaste of the Spirit in our hearts" (Gk.). In these verses we see the Spirit as the anointing, as the seal, and as the earnest or the foretaste. Romans 8:23 speaks of the firstfruit of the Spirit. If we would know the riches of the all-inclusive Spirit, we must know how to interpret these symbols. We need to allegorize the figures used in the New Testament to portray this rich Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ANOINTING</H2><P>Second Corinthians 1:21 says, "Now he who firmly attaches us with you unto the anointed one, and hath anointed us, is God." The "us" refers to the Apostles, and the "you" denotes the believers. God has attached the Apostles and the believers unto the anointed One, who is Christ. All the ointment has been poured upon this unique anointed One, and from Him the ointment runs down to all His members. If we were not attached to this anointed One, we would not have any ointment. But the ointment has been poured upon the anointed One, and since we are attached to this anointed One, the ointment runs down to reach us.</P><P>It is difficult to explain anything related to life. Life is mysterious and difficult to understand, but easy to experience. We all have a wonderful physical life. Without this physical life, I could not stand here and speak to you in such a living way. But who understands our physical life? Not even the medical doctors understand it. Although we do not understand it, we experience it every day. Even ignorant babies experience it from the moment they are born.</P><P>Christ has been anointed by God (Heb. 1:9). Hence, He is the anointed One. Since we believe in Him and partake of Him, we participate in His anointing, sharing the same ointment. Thus, we are firmly attached to Him, the anointed One, enjoying His anointing. When you call, "O Lord Jesus," do you not sense the anointing within you? This indicates that you are firmly attached to the anointed One. There is something within you anointing you all the time, flowing and even running throughout your inner being. This is the moving of the ointment that is upon the Head running down to reach you as one of His members. It runs down to water you, to saturate you. Thus, you can no longer be a dry member; rather, you are one always under the anointing.</P><P>This anointing adds to us the very essence of God, the divine element. This is similar to the process of painting a table. As you paint the table, the element of the paint is added to the table. Likewise, as the ointment runs through us, it brings the divine element into us. In the Lord's recovery we have the assurance that day by day something is running through us, doing an inward "painting" work. The more this ointment moves, the more it paints us with the divine element. Hallelujah, the divine element is being added to us in the Lord's recovery! This is not a matter of teaching. Something is running over us and through us, and the divine element is being accumulated within us. The more we enjoy the flowing of the inner life and the more we enjoy the Lord together in the meetings, the more we have God within us. Although we may still feel that we are weak, we nevertheless have God within, for the anointing is constantly adding the divine element into our being.</P><P>This is a strong sign that the Lord's recovery is different from religion. You may stay in religion for years without receiving anything of the divine element into you. However, simply by being in the Lord's recovery for several months, you will be able to testify that God has been painted into you. It is not simply a matter of acquiring the knowledge of God, but it is a matter of having the element of God added into your being by the anointing. Oh, the all-inclusive Spirit, the compound ointment, is anointing us all day long! We have a divine paint, the compound ointment, the all-inclusive Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit, who is painting us day and night. We all have had some amount of the divine element added into our being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SEALING</H2><P>After the anointing comes the sealing. The sealing is rather easy to understand. Any kind of painting is also a sealing. Sometimes we mark things by painting them. To mark something with a seal is to declare that we own that particular thing. Although there may be thousands of copies of a certain book, by putting my mark, my seal, upon a particular book, I declare that it belongs to me. In like manner, the anointing within us as the sealing declares to the universe that we belong to God. God possesses us, and He has put Himself upon us as a seal. This seal is actually God Himself. Oh, I would like to proclaim to everyone, to the angels, to the demons, and to the universe, "Don't touch me! I have a mark upon me, and this mark is God, the all-inclusive Spirit." Do you not have such a mark upon you, showing that you belong to God? Yes, you do, for you have been sealed with God. Hence, the ointment is within you, and the mark is upon you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEARING THE IMAGE OF GOD</H2><P>If you put your seal upon a piece of paper, the paper will bear the image of the seal. The anointing within us becomes the seal, and the seal bears the very image of God. In this way, we bear the image of God. This means that we express God by being anointed and by being sealed. Because God has sealed us, marked us with Himself, the image of God is upon us. We do not bear the image of God by trying to imitate God. Many Christians have been taught to imitate Christ. They were told, "Now that you are a child of God, you must glorify Him by improving your behavior." This improvement of behavior is not Christ; it is religion. There is no need to try to improve your behavior. God has sealed you with Himself as the all-inclusive paint. Has not God painted you? Has He not put Himself upon you? Has He not put Himself into you? You have been sealed with God both within and without. We all have been sealed, painted, anointed with God, inwardly and outwardly. Hence, we bear the image of this seal.</P><P>Take the example of a young person who has recently been saved. In a sense, after someone is saved, he does not need anyone to teach him, for spontaneously, religiously, and naturally he will have the concept of improving himself. A young sister may say, "Formerly, I did not treat my mother very well. Now that I am saved, I should be a nice daughter. I must be gentle and mild toward my mother. I shall make up my mind never to be unkind to her again. O Lord Jesus, You know that I am so weak and sinful. Lord, help me to be gentle and kind to my mother from now on." However, after praying in this way, she will behave either like a scorpion or like a turtle, not like a mild, gentle dove.</P><P>I tried to change my behavior for years, but I was never successful. One day I realized that I had been anointed and sealed. When I saw this, I was happy, beside myself, and full of praise to the Lord. It seemed that I forgot where I was. Spontaneously I began to be kind to my mother; yet, I had no realization that I was being kind to her. This was the bearing of the seal. One day I heard my mother telling a friend, "You know my son, Witness, is a quick person. I don't know what has happened to him. For the last several weeks, he has been so kind to me." After hearing this, I said, "Mother, I am not really so kind. I didn't have any change." According to my feeling, I had no change, but actually I was altogether a different person, a person bearing the image of God. This was not the result of trying to improve my behavior; it was the result of His anointing.</P><P>Do not try to be good or to improve your behavior. If you are bothered with your temper, do not try to adjust it, for the more you try to adjust yourself, the worse your behavior will be. Forget about your temper and your behavior, and praise the Lord for His anointing. Praise Him that you are attached, anointed, and sealed. If a married sister did this, she would spontaneously become an excellent wife. However, if she tries to be a good wife, she will become worse as a wife. Some may ask, "What kind of teaching is this? We have been teaching people to improve their behavior. Now you are telling them not to try to change themselves." Yes, I do say that you should not try to improve. Instead, simply enjoy the anointing and the sealing. If a married couple did this, they would have the best married life. But if they forget to praise the Lord for His anointing, the wife may be like a turtle, and the husband may be like a cat trying to catch the turtle. We need to praise the Lord for the anointing that brings in the divine element and for the sealing that gives us the image of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EARNEST</H2><P>The anointing and the sealing are the earnest, the foretaste, the guarantee. The Greek word for earnest has an interesting background. When an ancient Greek purchased a parcel of land, the seller gave the buyer a box of soil from that land. That box of soil was called the earnest or guarantee. It assured the buyer that he was not purchasing poor land. By receiving a sample of the soil, he could be assured that the land was rich and fertile. The sample, the foretaste, was the guarantee that all the land was exactly like the soil in the box. It was the guarantee of receiving a good parcel of land. God is our inheritance, our parcel of good land. We have not yet possessed the whole of this land. What we are enjoying today is simply the box of soil, the foretaste. This foretaste is the earnest, the guarantee, assuring us that the day is coming when we shall receive our inheritance.</P><P>The whole of our inheritance will be the same as the foretaste, just as the whole piece of land was the same as the soil in the box. Hence, the foretaste is the guarantee that the full taste is coming; it is the guarantee of the whole inheritance, which is God Himself. An illustration of the foretaste of the Spirit is seen in cooking. Before sisters serve a meal, they often enjoy a foretaste of that meal in the kitchen. The day will come when we shall inherit God in a full way. What we are enjoying of Him today is the same in element, in taste, and in substance as what we shall enjoy in the future as the full taste. The difference is only in quantity, not in quality. We are enjoying the foretaste, and we are looking forward to the full taste. Although the anointing we enjoy today is rich and wonderful, it is simply the foretaste; the full taste is yet to come.</P><P>The anointing brings us the divine element, the sealing gives us the divine image, and the foretaste gives us the divine taste. Now we have the divine element, the divine image, and the divine taste. How wonderful! Day by day the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit brings us the divine element. At the same time it gives us the divine image and the divine taste. Now we are tasting our God, who is our inheritance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FIRSTFRUIT</H2><P>This foretaste is the firstfruit mentioned in Romans 8:23. We all have this firstfruit of the Spirit. Suppose you have a peach tree in your yard. Although the tree may be full of fruit, only a few of the peaches will ripen first. These are the firstfruit. Today the Spirit of God within us is the firstfruit. The harvest will take place when we are raptured. At that time, we shall enjoy God as our full crop, our full harvest. But today we are enjoying Him as the firstfruit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ELEMENT, THE IMAGE, THE TASTE,<br>AND THE ENJOYMENT</H2><P>In this message we have seen four things: the element, the image, the taste, and the enjoyment. The anointing brings in the element of God, the sealing produces the image of God, the foretaste affords us the taste of God, and the firstfruit is our enjoyment of God. By the all- inclusive Spirit, we receive the element of God, we have the image of God, we taste God Himself, and we also have God as our enjoyment of the firstfruit. All this is the anointing within us. Thus, we come back to the anointing. The element, the image, the taste, and the enjoyment of God are all in the anointing.</P><P>The anointing refers to the moving of the ointment in us. The ointment is something acting, moving, flowing, and even running in us. The divine element in us does not stand still. The image does not stand still either; rather it is running within us. Furthermore, the taste is something that moves, works, and impresses us. Even the enjoyment of God is something living, working, and moving within us. For example, you may desire to sleep late in the morning, but the anointing will tell you to rise up early to attend morning watch. A brother may feel that his wife is not treating him well and may intend to argue with her about it. However, the anointing helps him to keep from losing his temper. Have you not had this kind of experience? Something is moving in you, but it is difficult to say what kind of movement this is. This is the anointing.</P><P>The Lord's recovery stirs up the anointing within us. If you want to have a loose way of life, do not come into the recovery; for the recovery will stir up the anointing within you. This anointing is constantly moving, working, and living within us. Therefore, an experienced brother, the Apostle John, told us to abide in the Lord according to the anointing (1 John 2:27). This anointing teaches us everything: what we should do and what we should not do, where we should go and where we should not go. Because the inward anointing teaches us all things, we do not need the outward teachings. Simply abide in the Lord according to this anointing.</P><P>This is what it means to live by the all-inclusive Spirit. How wonderful to live like this! We have the anointing, the sealing, the foretaste, the firstfruit, and finally the all-inclusive moving within us. This is not religion; it is God's economy. God's economy means that God dispenses Himself into our being so that we may live by Him and be one with Him. This is accomplished by the inward work of the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SPIRIT OF HOLINESS,<br>THE SPIRIT OF LIFE,<br>AND THE SPIRIT OF SONSHIP</H1><P>In this message we shall consider three crucial aspects of the Spirit: the Spirit of holiness (Rom. 1:4), the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), and the Spirit of sonship (Rom. 8:14-16; Gal. 4:5-6). All these aspects of the Spirit are covered in the book of Romans. In order to understand these three aspects of the Spirit we need to become familiar with the book of Romans.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MAIN THOUGHT OF ROMANS</H2><P>What does the book of Romans actually talk about? Some say that Romans is a book on justification by faith. Such an understanding is superficial. Romans is not merely concerned with justification by faith. The main concept of the book of Romans is that of producing many sons for God.</P><P>In Romans, the only begotten Son of God has been made the firstborn Son of God. Was not Christ the Son of God before He was resurrected? Yes, He was. Then why does Acts 13:33 indicate that He was begotten to be the Son of God in His resurrection? Although Christ was the Son of God before His incarnation, within Him there was no humanity, but only divinity. When He became incarnated, He brought His divine nature, divinity, into the human nature, humanity. After Christ's incarnation and before His resurrection, there was on earth a man with both the divine nature and the human nature. His divine nature was the nature of the Son of God; however, His human nature was not the nature of the Son of God, but the nature of the Son of Man. Therefore, He needed resurrection in order that His humanity might be born into the sonship. Prior to His resurrection, Christ was the Son of God according to His divine nature, but He was not the Son of God according to His humanity. This humanity needed to be born of God. For this reason, Romans 1:4 tells us that He "was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead." In resurrection, Christ as the seed of David was designated as a man to be the Son of God by the Spirit of holiness. In this way the only begotten Son of God was made the firstborn Son of God. The only begotten Son of God had only divinity, not humanity. But in resurrection He was made the firstborn Son of God, possessing both divinity and humanity. Romans 8:29 says, "Because whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the firstborn among many brothers." We are the many brothers of the firstborn Son, not of the only begotten Son. If Christ were still the only begotten Son, He could not have any brothers. In order for Him to have many brothers, He had to become the firstborn Son.</P><P>Few Christians understand that Christ, the only begotten Son of God, has become the firstborn Son of God. Furthermore, many do not realize that as the only begotten Son, He did not have human nature, but as the firstborn Son, He possesses both the divine nature and the human nature. By believing in Him, we are born again and become His brothers. When we are born again, we receive the divine nature. Thus, He has both the divine nature and the human nature, and we have both the human nature and the divine nature. Therefore, He becomes the firstborn Son, and we become the many sons to be His many brothers.</P><P>The book of Romans reveals that the only begotten Son of God has become the firstborn Son of God in order to produce many sons for God. In chapter eight we see that the firstborn Son of God has many brothers. According to chapter twelve, eventually these many brothers become the members of Christ's Body. Today the many sons of God are the many members of the Body of Christ. To Christ, the many sons are the members; to God, the many members are the many sons. Hence, Romans is not merely concerned with justification by faith. Eventually, Romans is a book on the many sons becoming the many members of Christ in order that Christ may have a Body. Justification is not the goal; rather, it is part of the process to reach the goal. God's intention is not simply to justify you. It is that you become one of His sons by being justified, thereby becoming a member of the Body of Christ. This is the main thought of the book of Romans.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED TO KNOW THE SPIRIT OF SONSHIP</H2><P>We can only be a son of God by having the Spirit of sonship. This Spirit of sonship is the Spirit of holiness and the Spirit of life. If you do not know what the Spirit of holiness is and what the Spirit of life is, then you cannot know what the Spirit of sonship is. Although you may be a son of God, you may not know the meaning of this sonship. Can you explain what sonship is? Christians may talk about the Body in Romans 12 without seeing that the members of the Body are the sons of God. No one can be a member of Christ if he is not a son of God, and no one can be a proper member in the Body of Christ without knowing what sonship is. Furthermore, to be a proper member of Christ's Body, we must know the meaning of the Spirit of holiness and the Spirit of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF HOLINESS</H2><P>Let us now consider the Spirit of holiness. Holiness denotes God's unique nature. In Greek, the word holiness means to be separated, different, from all common things. In other words, to be holy is to be unique, to be different, set apart from everything else. Therefore, to be holy means to be just like God Himself and to be different from anyone and anything else and any matter. God's divine nature is unique, different from all other things. In the entire universe there is only one nature absolutely different from all other things, and this is the nature of God. It is not an insignificant matter to be holy, for to be holy is virtually to be divine. It is to be separate, different, from anything other than God. Holiness denotes such a condition. It is the state of being separated from all other things. Only God Himself is in such a condition.</P><P>When Christ came as man, He put on human nature, but this human nature was not holy, for it was exactly the same as our nature. The only difference was that in our nature there was sin, but in His nature there was no sin. To be sinless is not the same as being holy. A table is not sinful, but it certainly is not holy. Sinlessness, or purity, is not holiness. Holiness refers to a condition, a state of being, in which someone or something is different from everything other than God. When Christ took upon Himself the flesh, He put on something that was common. His flesh was neither sinful nor holy. It was later positionally consecrated, separated, to God (Luke 2:22-23), but dispositionally His humanity remained common. Thus, the humanity Christ had put on needed to be made holy. This was accomplished through His resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST'S TRANSFIGURATION</H2><P>Christ's resurrection was a type of transfiguration. You are no doubt familiar with Christ's transfiguration on the mountain (Matt. 17:1-2). At the time of that transfiguration, He was made holy. Prior to that event, He was in the common flesh. His humanity was common, the same as that of Peter, James, John, and every other man. As we have pointed out, the unique thing about Christ's humanity was that there was no sin in it. But as far as the nature of the flesh and blood is concerned, it was exactly the same as our humanity. When Christ was transfigured on the mountain, He was sanctified, made holy. He was made different from Peter, James, and John. His transfiguration actually was His resurrection. Later, when He was resurrected, He was fully transfigured. In His transfiguration Christ was designated, marked out, to be the Son of God. When Jesus was transfigured, His face shone as the sun, and He became separate from all other people. The same thing took place in His resurrection: His physical body became separate, different, from all things other than God. This was according to the Spirit of holiness. Jesus' transfiguration was something inward, not something outward. It was according to the Spirit of holiness within Him. At the time of His transfiguration, the Spirit of holiness permeated and saturated His whole being to make Him separate, different, from anything other than God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PERMEATED WITH HOLINESS</H2><P>At the moment we believed in the Lord Jesus, a certain element came into us. We may call this the life of God with His nature, or the Spirit of life. This element that entered the depths of our being is holy. It came into us as the seed of holiness, the seed of something separate from all things other than God. This is the Spirit of holiness. Holiness is not a type of outward behavior or conduct. Holiness is the state, or condition, of the element that was sown into our being when we believed in the Lord Jesus. This condition of holiness is brought about by the dwelling of God's Spirit in us. The presence of God the Spirit in us produces the condition of being absolutely separate from everything other than God. As believers, we all have this holiness within us, but it needs to permeate our whole being. We need to be saturated with this state of holiness. According to Romans 1:4, this permeation is called designation. The inward holiness permeates us, and this permeation is our designation. This is what marks us out as sons of God.</P><P>In a foregoing message we saw that the indwelling Spirit is the water and the breath. Today such a Spirit is moving and working in us to saturate and permeate us inwardly with the condition of holiness. However, most Christians neglect this work of the indwelling Spirit. It is only when you cease your activity and spend time in the presence of God to fellowship with Him that you begin to realize that there is an inward working, an inward moving, endeavoring to saturate and permeate your being in order to make you separate from all things other than God. The reason few Christians realize this is that they are fully occupied with their works, activities, desires, and hopes. Thus, so many Christians have been carried away from this inward condition of holiness. Nevertheless, we have the Spirit of holiness within. We all have such an inward state and condition within us, and we need to give attention to it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</H2><P>Now we come to the Spirit of life. Because no one can define life, it is difficult to say what the Spirit of life is. In Romans 8:2 we have the term "the law of the Spirit of life." Without knowing what the Spirit of life is, it is difficult to have a proper understanding of what it means to be members of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD LIVING IN US</H2><P>We have seen that holiness is a state, a condition, within us that is different from all things other than God. The Spirit we have received is called the Spirit of holiness, that is, the Spirit of such a condition. Now what is the Spirit of life? The Bible clearly says that life is Christ (John 14:6). We may also say that life is God. But what does this mean? The only thing I can say is that life is God living in us. When God lives in us, that is life. Holiness is a condition, and life is a living. Thus, life is not merely a state or a condition, but a living. Life is God living in us. We all must learn to say, "Life is God living in me. Oh, God lives in me!" This is life. If God does not live in you, then He cannot be life to you. Only when He lives in you is He life to you.</P><P>We have learned to understand Romans 6 in the light of Romans 8, where we have the Spirit of life. In Romans 8 we have the matter of God living in us. In this chapter we do not have doctrines, teachings, regulations, or ways to do things. Here we have the living One. Today the all-inclusive Spirit is not only the Spirit of holiness, the Spirit of a state that is different from all things other than God; this Spirit is now living in us. When you say, "O Lord Jesus," you sense that something is living within you. This indicates that the life-giving Spirit is not only the Spirit of a condition within us, but the Spirit that is a life living within us, the Spirit of the One who lives, moves, and works within us. This is life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF SONSHIP</H2><P>It is even more difficult to say what the Spirit of sonship is. Sonship refers both to the life of the son and to the position of the son. Thus, sonship is not only a matter of life, but also a matter of position. A boy who is the son of a certain man has the sonship of that man because he has obtained that man's life and has the position of that man's son. Therefore, he has the sonship. We all have been born sons of God. This means that we have the life of a son of God and also the position of a son of God. Both the life and the position are related to the Spirit and are included in the Spirit. If you have the Spirit, you have the life of a son of God and the position of a son of God. However, if you do not have the Spirit, you have neither the life nor the position.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A MATTER OF EXPERIENCE</H2><P>This is not merely a matter of doctrine, but a matter of experience. You may claim to be a son of God, and indeed you are. But whenever you are not one with the Spirit, the life and position of a son of God are no longer evident. For example, are you a son of God when you quarrel with your wife? It is difficult to say. On the one hand, because you have been regenerated, you are certainly a son of God. However, as you are quarreling with your wife, as far as your experience is concerned, you are like an unsaved person, because at that time you are not one with the Spirit. When I am one with the Spirit, I have the life of a son of God and the position of a son of God. But when I am not one with the Spirit, the picture is altogether different. By this we see that if we would experience the sonship, the life, and the holiness, we must be one with the Spirit.</P><P>Because the Spirit is in our spirit, the only way to be one with the Spirit is to exercise our spirit and to focus our whole being on our spirit. Here in our spirit we touch the Spirit. We touch the Spirit of holiness, the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of sonship. When we do this, we are immediately living by the Spirit in our spirit. By doing this, we are designated, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and even glorified to be the sons of God.</P><P>Because some of you still hold on to the natural concepts, you may be troubled when you hear these things. I realize that such a message differs from some of the teachings you heard in the past, especially the ethical teachings regarding the improvement of your behavior. For example, if you are a husband, you have probably been admonished to love your wife. But I doubt that even one husband has succeeded in doing this fully. The matter of husbands loving their wives is a religious, ethical teaching; it is not the basic revelation of the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SONS OF GOD ACCORDING TO GOD'S ECONOMY</H2><P>According to God's economy, Christ passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. By His all-inclusive death, He accomplished redemption and solved all our problems. Now, in resurrection, He is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, ready for us to receive and enjoy (1 Cor. 15:45). The way to receive and enjoy Him is to believe in His name, to call on His name, and to open ourselves to Him so that He may have the full liberty to possess us. First Corinthians 6:17 says, "He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit." He is the Spirit of holiness, the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of sonship. As long as we are one with Him in our spirit, our whole being will be permeated with the Spirit of holiness, and we shall become separate, absolutely different, from everything other than God. We shall also be permeated with God's living in us. God will be our life, not in a doctrinal way, but in a practical way. There will be no need for a brother to try to love his wife. Instead, love for his wife will spontaneously issue forth. All the divine attributes and human virtues will come out of him. Eventually, the Spirit of holiness, the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of sonship will become one with us. The Spirit will be one with us because he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit. When the Spirit becomes one with us, we shall have holiness, life, and sonship. We shall be sons of God in reality and no longer behave like an unsaved person. We shall be the sons of God because this Spirit of holiness, life, and sonship will have saturated us thoroughly with what God is. This is holiness, this is victory, and this is glory.</P><P>The more this process takes place in you, the more you will be a proper member of the Body of Christ. For years you might have talked about being a member of the Body. But consider your behavior in the past. Were you a member of the Body in reality? Many of you were divisive and caused trouble. Because you were not one with the Spirit, for years you were not actually a member of the Body. You were not one with the Spirit of holiness, the Spirit of life, or the Spirit of sonship. Instead, you merely held on to certain doctrines or biblical concepts. This is not what you need today. You need the Spirit of holiness, the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of sonship. At this very moment, the Spirit is in your spirit. Forget your concepts, your understanding, and your knowledge, turn to your spirit, open to the Spirit who is in your spirit, and be one with Him. The Spirit witnesses with our spirit (Rom. 8:16). Hence, you need to turn to your spirit to be one with this Spirit, who is the Spirit of holiness, life, and sonship. When you do this, this wonderful Spirit will work in you. As a result, rivers will flow out of you (John 7:38-39). There is no need to struggle, strive, endeavor, or mistreat yourself. Drop your concepts, turn from your knowledge, turn to your spirit, and open your entire being to the Spirit of holiness, the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of sonship. The more you do this, the more you will be saturated and permeated with the Spirit. You will be one spirit with Him, and He, the Spirit, will be one with you. Then you will actually be a son of God and a member of the Body of Christ.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE EXPERIENCE OF THE SPIRIT<br>FROM SANCTIFICATION TO GLORIFICATION</H1><P>The wonderful, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit is the sanctifying Spirit. In this message we shall firstly cover the sanctifying aspect of the all-inclusive Spirit. Then we shall proceed to see that the sanctifying takes place by the imparting of life. The all-inclusive Spirit who indwells us today is the sanctifying One, and His work of sanctifying takes place by His life-imparting. This imparting of life transforms us. Hence, there is also the transforming aspect of the Spirit. By reading the book of Romans we can see that transformation implies conformation. Transformation issues in conformation. Conformation means to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29). Through conformation, we become in a practical way the many sons of God to fulfill God's eternal purpose. Therefore, we have sanctifying, life-imparting, transforming, and conforming. Romans 8:29 and 30 indicate that conformation issues in glorification. Glorification will be the ultimate consummation of the work of the wonderful Spirit. Thus, in this message we need to cover five matters: sanctifying, life-imparting, transforming, conforming, and glorifying.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SANCTIFYING WORK OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>We begin with the sanctifying work of the Spirit. As we saw in the foregoing message, the all-inclusive Spirit is in us with a condition, a state, of holiness. The Spirit Himself is the essence, the very substance, of holiness. When this all-inclusive Spirit enters into our spirit and remains there as the essence of holiness, there is in our spirit a condition of holiness. Consider again the illustration of making tea. When a tea bag is placed in a cup of hot water, there is immediately in the water a condition of tea. The more the water is stirred up, the more the tea spreads into the water and permeates it. Eventually, the water will be saturated, permeated, with the essence of tea. To coin a word, we may call this the process of "teafication." Teafication is an illustration of sanctification. The Spirit of holiness is like the tea that is put into our spirit, which is like the hot water. Thus, within our spirit there is a condition of the divine tea. As this divine tea moves within us, His holy essence spreads into our inward being and saturates every part, proceeding from the center of our being to the circumference. Eventually, our entire being will be permeated with this holy essence. This is sanctification.</P><P>Christians have been writing books on sanctification for centuries. We have read a number of these writings, but none of them ever fully satisfied us, because they did not correspond to our experience. As we progressed in the experience of sanctification, we began to realize that it resembles what we have called teafication. By considering the way a tea bag teafies hot water, we can understand the process of sanctification. In sanctification we are permeated with the holy divine essence. Check with your experience. Has the Spirit not been spreading the divine element within your inner being? This is the sanctifying work of the Spirit of holiness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE IMPARTING OF LIFE</H2><P>As the Spirit sanctifies us from within, He imparts God's life into us. To impart God's life into our being means to give us life. When we were saved and regenerated, we received God's life into us. However, this does not mean that we received God's life in a total sense. Although we have received God's life into us, we still need more impartation of God's life into us each day. This does not take place once for all; rather, it is a gradual process that goes on during our entire life. No matter how experienced we may be in the spiritual life, this process of life imparting must still go on within us. As the Spirit carries out His sanctifying work, He imparts more of God's life into us. I can testify that I have more of God's life today than I did a year ago, and much more than twenty-five years ago. In April, 1925, I received God's life. Although I was very excited when I first received the divine life, I actually had only a little of it. But day by day throughout the years, more of God's life has been imparted into me. Every month and every year I have gained more of this life.</P><P>This imparting of life always accompanies the sanctifying work of the Spirit. Without His work of sanctification, He could not impart God's life into us. Life imparting is always included within God's sanctifying work. The extent to which the impartation of life will proceed depends on the degree He is able to sanctify us. The impartation of life is always the issue of sanctification. Thus, life imparting and sanctifying work together. As the Spirit sanctifies us, He gives us life. This also is like teafication. When the tea bag teafies the water, the tea essence goes wherever the teafication takes place. Within the teafication is the essence of the tea. It is the same with the sanctifying and life-imparting work of the Spirit. In the sanctification of the Spirit of holiness there is the very impartation of God's life. We do not arrive at this understanding through mental figuration. It is absolutely according to our experience. If you have not been regenerated and if you have not had this experience, you will simply be unable to understand what I am talking about. But according to our experience, we know that in this sanctification is the life impartation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TRANSFORMATION, A METABOLIC CHANGE</H2><P>When life is imparted into us, the result is transformation. It is similar to a chemical reaction caused by one element being added to another. The divine life brought into us through sanctification is a divine chemical element. When this element is imparted into our being, there is a reaction, and that reaction is transformation. Transformation means to change our nature, essence, appearance, tastes, and our whole being. Transformation is not outward change, correction, or adjustment; it is altogether an inward, metabolic change of our being. In the process of metabolism, a new essence is added to replace an old, to carry away the old, and to produce a new situation. This metabolism is the very transformation revealed in the New Testament (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18). Transformation is a divine metabolism wherein a new element is added to the old to discharge the old and to create a new situation. If our eyes are opened to see this, we shall drop all the teachings derived from the past regarding correcting ourselves and improving our behavior. Such outward changes are not metabolic changes. They are not the result of something new being added into our being to discharge the old and to create a new situation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO OUTWARD CORRECTION</H2><P>Take the illustration of makeup. Some women with a pale complexion put makeup on their faces to beautify themselves. This is not transformation. Rather, this is like the work of a mortician in beautifying a corpse. Many of us were in the "mortuaries" of religion for years, where hired "morticians" attempted to beautify our faces every Sunday. I used to be in that kind of situation, and I myself did the work of such a "mortician." The Lord's economy is absolutely different from this. We do not care whether or not your complexion is pale; it may even be greenish or grey. No matter what your color is, we would like to feed you with something nourishing. When the rich nourishment of the food gets into you, it will discharge the old things and create a new condition within you. Because my wife serves me nutritious meals, there is no paleness or greenness in my complexion. She never puts makeup on my face to give me such a healthy complexion. The food I eat does not directly cause my face to shine; it indirectly causes it to shine through the process of metabolism. The new, rich, nourishing element gets into my fibers, discharges the old element, and gives me a new constitution. This is just what spiritual transformation does.</P><P>The saints in the Lord's recovery do not have outward correction, but they have a certain amount of inward transformation. How encouraged and happy I am to see the transformation, the metabolic change, taking place in the brothers and sisters! Although I may be tired from the work of the ministry, I am eager to work to supply you more nourishment when I think about how you are being transformed. Many can testify that in my ministry I never correct others. Instead of correcting them, I supply them with rich nourishment. This nourishing element is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. When Christ as the nourishing element is ministered into our being, this element causes a metabolic change that transforms us. Even if you have been undergoing this process of transformation for just a few years, you would find it difficult to return to your old life even if you wanted to. After you have experienced transformation, it is impossible to be the same. Although you may try to go back to the sinful, worldly things you used to do, you will not be able to eradicate or undo the work of transformation. Not even the most effective detergent can wash it away. You may wash away makeup, but you cannot wash away the transformation that has taken place deep within you. In fact, the more you try to eliminate it, the more manifest it becomes. It will remain for eternity. This process of transformation will continue and increase until the day of redemption, when we are fully transformed into Christ's image.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FROM GLORY TO GLORY</H2><P>In 2 Corinthians 3:18 we see the matter of transformation: "But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting, as a mirror, the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit" (Gk.). The image into which we are being transformed is the image of the Lord. Transformation into the image of the Lord is from glory to glory, that is, from one stage of glory to another, from one degree of glory to another degree of glory. Whenever I come to this matter of transformation, my inner being leaps, and I am very happy. I am happy to know that you all are undergoing the process of transformation from one stage of glory to another. A year from now many of us will be in a higher stage of glory than we are today. This is the result of the transforming work of the Lord Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TRANSFORMATION ISSUING IN CONFORMATION</H2><P>According to the book of Romans, transformation issues in conformation. The life imparting of the Spirit not only imparts a new essence or element into us to replace the old and to create a new situation to transform us; eventually, it conforms us to the very image of the firstborn Son of God. Firstly we are transformed, and then we are conformed to the image of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FOUR CHARACTERISTICS OF EVERY TYPE OF LIFE</H2><P>By observing living things such as flowers and trees, I have learned that every form of life has a number of characteristics. (I do not speak from the standpoint of biology, but from the perspective of my learning through experience.) Every life has four main characteristics: the life essence, the life power, the life law, and the life shape. Take a carnation for an example. A carnation certainly has a life essence; it also has life power, the power to grow. Carnations, however, do not grow in a lawless way or without regulation. Rather, a carnation grows according to its own regulation, that is, according to the law of the carnation life. Hence, a carnation has a life law. Finally, a carnation has its own shape. The stem, the leaves, and the flowers all have a particular form. There is no need to teach a carnation what should be the shape of its leaves or the pattern of its blossom. How foolish it would be for anyone to do this! If you would try to teach a carnation how to grow and if that carnation could speak, it would say, "Don't waste your time trying to teach me. I have a law within me, and I don't need your regulations. As I grow, the life law within regulates me. This law knows what kind of leaves I should have and what pattern and color my blossom should be. Because every plant has its life essence, life power, life law, and life shape, it is shaped according to its kind. If it is a plant that produces fruit, it will produce fruit according to its kind. A peach tree, for example, brings forth peaches. A peach tree will never make the mistake of bringing forth bananas. Every life has its own law and its own shape.</P><P>To be shaped in a particular fashion is to be conformed. Oh, the divine life within us is shaping us into the form of the firstborn Son of God! By the impartation of life and by the process of transformation, we are being conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God so that He might be the firstborn among many brothers. When you enter into eternity and see the situation there, you may turn to me and say, "Brother Lee, you were right. You gave us a message saying that the life within would shape us, conform us, to the image of the firstborn Son of God. This is exactly what has taken place." Today we are under the process of sanctification, life impartation, transformation, and conformation. This is the activity of the indwelling, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. This is absolutely different from the teachings of religion. Teachings can never accomplish such a thing. Hallelujah, I am happy that within all of us there is this work of the all-inclusive Spirit! This Spirit is sanctifying us, imparting God's life into us, transforming us, and conforming us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GLORIFICATION</H2><P>Eventually, we shall all be glorified (Rom. 8:30). Glorification is like the blossoming of a carnation flower. As a carnation grows, the life within shapes it into the form of a carnation. One day, spontaneously, it blossoms. That is the glorification of the carnation. Glorification is the ultimate consummation of transformation and conformation. Presently we are undergoing the process of transformation and conformation. This will continue until we reach the consummation&#151;glorification. In that glorification, the transfiguration of our body, we shall be exactly the same as the firstborn Son in spirit, soul, and body. At that time we shall know for certain that we are the many sons, and Christ may say, "I am the firstborn, and you are the many sons." We shall actually be the same as He (1 John 3:2). This is the work of the all- inclusive Spirit within us. This is sanctification, life impartation, transformation, conformation, and glorification. We are in this process today.</P><P>When you hear this, you may wonder what you should do. Forget your doing and just rest. As this process goes on, you will be sanctified, you will enjoy the impartation of life, you will undergo the work of transformation, you will be conformed to the image of the firstborn, and ultimately you will be brought into glorification. This is the church life. Instead of trying to do something, simply enjoy the Lord, call on His name, and praise Him. Although we should not try to improve ourselves, we do need to exercise our spirit to experience the wonderful all-inclusive Spirit. The more we do this, the more we shall experience sanctification, the impartation of life, transformation, conformation, and eventually glorification.</P><P>CHAPTER EIGHT</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SPIRIT IN REVELATION</H1><P>In this message we shall consider the Spirit in the book of Revelation. In Revelation we see that the Spirit of God is now the seven Spirits. The term the seven Spirits is found four times in Revelation. Revelation 1:4 speaks of the seven Spirits who are before God's throne; 3:1, of the seven Spirits of God; 4:5, of seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God; and 5:6, of the seven eyes of the Lamb, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. The seven Spirits of God are called the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne and also the seven eyes of the Lamb. They are the seven Spirits of God; yet these seven Spirits are the seven lamps of fire burning before God's administrative throne and also the seven eyes of the redeeming Lamb. Before you came into the church life, you probably never heard a word about the seven Spirits of God being the seven lamps and the seven eyes. Nevertheless, this is found in the book of Revelation.</P><P>Hardly anything in the book of Revelation is new. Revelation is not a book of new things; rather, it is the conclusion of the things revealed in the foregoing books of the Bible. The book of Revelation is the consummation of all previous revelation. It contains few new things, and the new things it does contain are related to the foregoing revelation. This is true with respect to the seven lamps and the seven eyes. Both are references to the Old Testament. The term the seven Spirits, however, is a new term; it cannot be found in the Old Testament. But the seven lamps and the seven eyes are found in the Old Testament. In Exodus chapter twenty-five, the first mention of the lampstand, we read of the seven lamps. Hence, the term the seven lamps found in Revelation is a reference to the Old Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S TESTIMONY AND GOD'S ADMINISTRATION</H2><P>The thought of seven lamps burning and shining before God is not new; it had already been presented in the Old Testament (Exo. 25:31-37). The lampstand in the tabernacle had seven lamps burning before God. The lampstand signified not only God's testimony, but also God's administration. God's administration cannot be separated from His testimony because God's testimony is for God's administration. Most Christian teachers, however, have seen only that the lampstand is a testimony. They have not seen that the lampstand also refers to God's administration. God's administration is carried out through the shining of the lampstand.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A PICTURE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>We need to consider this lampstand in more detail. The lampstand with its branches is all-inclusive. It provides a clear picture of the Trinity. In the lampstand we have the Triune God. Firstly, the lampstand is solid gold, made of a talent of gold. Thus, gold is the essence, the substance, of the lampstand. In typology gold signifies God's substance, God's nature. No doubt the gold of the lampstand signifies that the source of the lampstand is the Father in the Godhead with the divine substance. Secondly, the stand itself is the embodiment of the gold. Without the stand, the gold would not have any embodiment or form. But with the stand the gold has a form and an embodiment. The stand as the embodiment of the gold signifies the Son, the second in the Trinity, who is the embodiment of God the Father. The Father is the substance, and the Son is the embodiment. Thirdly, we have the seven lamps which refer to the Spirit. The seven lamps, obviously, are the expression. The gold is the substance, the stand is the embodiment, and the lamps are the expression. Therefore, in the lampstand we have the Father as the substance, the Son as the embodiment, and the Spirit as the expression. This is the Triune God: the substance, the embodiment, and the expression. In substance the lampstand is one, but in expression it is seven. At the bottom the lampstand is one, but at the top it is seven.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LAMPSTAND, THE STONE, THE LAMB, AND GOD</H2><P>The revelation in the Bible is always progressive. The first mention of the seven lamps is in Exodus, but the development of the seven lamps is in Zechariah. In the book of Exodus we cannot see that these seven lamps are the Spirit of God. In order to see this, we must proceed from Exodus to Zechariah. In Zechariah 4:2 and 10 we see clearly that the seven lamps of the lampstand are the seven eyes of God. Zechariah 3:9 shows that the seven eyes of God are the seven eyes of the stone. The seven lamps are the seven eyes of God, and these seven eyes are also on the stone. According to Zechariah, this stone is for God's building. Zerubbabel was in the process of building the temple, and that stone with the seven eyes was for God's building. Eventually we see that the stone with the seven eyes is the lampstand. In the book of Revelation we see that the seven eyes of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb. The seven lamps of the lampstand are the seven eyes of God, the seven eyes on the stone, and the seven eyes of the Lamb. This means that the lampstand equals the stone, the stone equals the Lamb, and the Lamb equals God. In Exodus we have a lampstand with seven lamps. In Zechariah we see that these seven lamps are the seven eyes of God and the seven eyes of the stone. The book of Revelation indicates that these seven eyes are also the seven eyes of the Lamb. The seven lamps are the seven eyes of God, the seven eyes of the stone, and the seven eyes of the Lamb. This proves that the lampstand is God, that God is the stone, and that the stone is the Lamb. The lampstand is the stone, the stone is the Lamb, and the Lamb is God. These four things&#151;the lampstand, the stone, the Lamb, and God&#151;are four in one. The lampstand is for shining, the stone is for building, the Lamb is for redeeming, and God is for administrating. Therefore, we have the shining stand, the building stone, the redeeming Lamb, and the administrating God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SEVEN SPIRITS<br>FOR ADMINISTRATION AND TRANSFUSION</H2><P>The seven lamps of the shining lampstand are the seven eyes of the building stone; the seven eyes of the building stone are the seven eyes of the redeeming Lamb; and the seven eyes of the redeeming Lamb are the seven eyes of the administrating God. These seven lamps and these seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God. They are not only the seven lamps and the seven eyes, but also the seven Spirits. In the previous messages we have covered many of the crucial aspects of the life-giving Spirit. In this message we have the conclusion of the life-giving Spirit. This conclusion is that in the present age the Spirit is the seven Spirits of God who are the seven lamps of fire burning for God's administration and also the seven eyes of the redeeming and building One for transfusion and infusion. The lamps of burning fire are for God's administration, and the eyes are for the redeeming and building One's transfusion.</P><P>I realize that this thought is foreign to today's Christianity. Nevertheless, it is in the Bible. In the past did anyone tell you that the lampstand as God's testimony is for God's administration or that the seven lamps of the lampstand are the seven eyes of the administrating God and the seven eyes of the redeeming Lamb? Did anyone tell you that these seven eyes of the redeeming Lamb are the seven eyes of the building stone? Did anyone tell you that the seven lamps as the seven Spirits are for God's administration and that the seven eyes as the seven Spirits of God are for Christ's transfusion? You probably never heard any of these things. The seven lamps are for God's administration to accomplish God's purpose, and the seven eyes are for Christ's infusing to perfect us. On the one hand, these seven Spirits are seven lamps shining, burning, searching, judging, and carrying out God's administration. On the other hand, these seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the redeeming and building Christ to infuse whatever Christ is into us. Whenever He looks at us, we receive an infusion. This is today's life-giving Spirit. Today the life-giving Spirit is the seven Spirits of God as the seven lamps of fire burning to carry out God's administration. While He is burning us, He is looking at us. He is not only the lamps of fire burning for God's administration, but also the eyes of the redeeming Lamb looking at us, not to judge us and expose our faults, but to grant us His precious infusion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LAKE OF FIRE AND THE CITY OF WATER</H2><P>At the end of the book of Revelation we see two consummations, one negative and the other positive. The negative consummation is the lake of fire, and the positive consummation is the city of water. Whatever the seven burning lamps search out and judge will go to the lake of fire. But whatever has been infused into us by the seven eyes of the redeeming Christ will be built into the New Jerusalem. The lake of fire is a collection of everything that has been judged by the seven lamps of burning fire. Thus, the seven lamps are for searching, judging, and sending the negative things into the lake of fire. On the one hand, the seven Spirits of God are the seven judging and searching lamps; on the other hand, they are seven transfusing eyes, transfusing all that Christ is into us to make us part of the city of water, the positive consummation. Hallelujah, we are not going to the lake of fire, but to the city of water!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CLEANSED AND INFUSED</H2><P>Because your condition is not pure, some of you are still under the seven burning lamps. You are still involved with certain things that need to be searched and judged. Mainly we are not under the flaming lamps, but under the infusing eyes. Are you under the searching lamps or the infusing eyes? I am happy to be under the seven eyes. Suppose you are about to quarrel with your wife. The seven eyes will immediately become the seven lamps. At such a time, you need to repent and say, "O Lord Jesus, forgive me. I am still in the flesh, and I am so pitiful. Lord, thank You for Your blood. I confess my failure and I apply Your blood to my situation." Whenever you do this, the seven lamps turn into the seven eyes looking at you, and immediately you are once again under His transfusing. Christ's essence and certain of His attributes are transfused into your being.</P><P>Some of you may not know how to answer when asked if you are under the seven lamps or the seven eyes. If you are honest, you will say that you are under both, for quite often you have been involved with the things that are destined to go to the lake of fire. You have been related to the wrong consummation. But by the Lord's mercy, whenever you repent and apply the blood, you are immediately connected to the right consummation. Hallelujah, now you are connected to the New Jerusalem under the transfusing of the seven eyes of the Lamb.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SEVEN EYES OF THE BUILDING STONE</H2><P>Recently in the Lord's recovery there has been much talk about the building. The building actually issues out of the seven eyes of the stone. The seven eyes are not only the seven eyes of the administrating God, but also the seven eyes of the redeeming Lamb and even more the seven eyes of the building stone. When we are involved with negative things and are connected to the wrong consummation, the lake of fire, the seven Spirits are the seven burning lamps of God to search us and to judge us. But if we repent and apply the blood of the Lamb, these seven Spirits of God immediately become the seven eyes of the Lamb. When we say, "Lord, thank You for the cleansing of Your redeeming blood," the seven Spirits of God, which are the seven eyes of the redeeming Lamb, become the seven eyes of the stone. When in experience the Spirit of God becomes the seven eyes of the stone, His looking upon us brings about a transfusion, and it immerses us into all that Christ is. This makes us the proper material for God's building. Moreover, it builds us into God's building. I realize that we are still short of this building, but I believe that this building has already begun. In the coming days all the churches will be brought into such a state that the saints will be under the seven eyes not only of God and the Lamb, but also of the stone. We shall be under the infusing of the building Christ.</P><P>As the unique stone, the building Christ will infuse into us all He is. He will immerse us into His very essence to make us stones and to build us into God's building. This building work can be accomplished only by the transfusing and infusing of the seven eyes of the building stone, which is the building Christ. In the coming days, many of us will be under this transfusing, and we shall become the proper material to be built together into God's building. This is the conclusion of the life-giving Spirit unfolded as the seven Spirits of God in the book of Revelation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPEAKING SPIRIT</H2><P>The seven Spirits are also the speaking Spirit. Revelation 2:7 says, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." Today we are hearing the speaking of the Spirit. In Christianity many sermons are given from many platforms, but I wonder how much of this speaking is the speaking of the Spirit. The speaking of the Spirit to the churches is in the churches. How can those not in the churches hear what the Spirit is speaking to the churches?</P><P>The speaking of the Spirit always turns us to the infusing of Christ. The Spirit's speaking is Christ's infusing. If you listen to His speaking, you will immediately be under Christ's transfusing and infusing, and you will be immersed into Christ. Today the seven Spirits are speaking to the churches, and anyone who has an ear and listens to this speaking will be turned to Christ's infusing. Do not analyze this with your mentality. Instead, check with your spirit and with your experience. Whenever you listen to the speaking of the seven Spirits of God to the churches, you are immediately under a precious, sweet, and dear transfusing, an infusing that changes you, transforms you, makes you the proper material, and builds you into God's building. Whatever must go to the lake of fire is burned away by the seven lamps, and now you are under the seven eyes, being infused with all that Christ is to become part of the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SEVEN SPIRITS<br>BECOMING THE ONE RIVER</H2><P>Eventually the seven Spirits become one river (Rev. 22:1-2). In the first chapter of Revelation we have the seven Spirits before the throne of God. In the last chapter the seven Spirits as the seven lamps and the seven eyes become the one river of water of life flowing out from God's administrative throne. This river contains the tree of life to supply the entire city of New Jerusalem. In a sense, even today the seven lamps and the seven eyes become the river of life in the church life. The seven Spirits are either for searching and judging or for transfusing and infusing. But eventually these seven Spirits become the river of life flowing throughout God's building to supply the life that is needed.</P><P>In the book of Revelation we have a clear picture. If we look at this picture, we shall see that today the life-giving Spirit is the seven Spirits of God, who are the seven lamps burning to search and judge the negative things and the seven eyes to infuse us with the positive things and with Christ's essence for God's building. Now we are under the infusing of these seven eyes. Eventually, the seven Spirits become the river of life flowing through the churches to bring us the life supply so that we may be nourished. How wonderful and marvelous this is!</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT<br>AND OUR SPIRIT</H1><P>Although we have seen many things concerning the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, I have the burden in this message to help you realize that this Spirit has been wrought into us and that we have also been put into this Spirit. First, I need to say a further word regarding God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RELIGION<br>AND GOD'S ECONOMY</H2><P>God's economy, or dispensation, is absolutely not a religion. Christianity has been utilized by the subtle one to the extent that it has become a religion. According to the human concept, religion is a good thing. Religion teaches people to worship God, to behave in a way that is pleasing to God, to do things for God, and to glorify God so that they may have a good future, and it encourages them to do all these things. Apparently, this is very good; actually, it is against God's economy in a subtle way. This kind of religion has been a thick veil covering God's chosen people. Today's Christianity is a heavy veil covering many Christians. After reading the past seven messages on the life-giving Spirit, you can see the difference between the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit and religion. What a difference there is! The Spirit is genuine; religion is a counterfeit. The Spirit is the reality; religion is vanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD PROCESSED IN HIS ECONOMY</H2><P>In His economy God has processed Himself in order that He may become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. The word "processed" sounds strange to religious ears. Nevertheless, in His economy God has processed Himself. One day the very God became incarnated. Although He was God, He came into man and became a man, He lived a human life on earth for thirty-three and a half years, and He passed through much suffering. Eventually, He was arrested, judged, and put to death by being crucified on the cross. He was buried and remained in the grave for three days. Then He came out of the grave in His resurrection. Are not all these events part of a process? Yes, they are. The word process is not used in the Bible, but all these events are certainly part of a process. Our God has passed through a long, meaningful, and profitable process, beginning with the incarnation, continuing through human living and crucifixion, and concluding with resurrection and ascension. Today He is the One who has ascended to the heavens, having passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Now, having passed through such a process, what He is, is different from what He was before the incarnation. Before the incarnation, He was merely God. But after having passed through this long process, He is not only God, but God with man. In fact, He is a God-man. With this God-man there is incarnation, human living, the all-inclusive crucifixion, the resurrection, and the ascension.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LIFE AND RESURRECTION</H2><P>At this point we need to see the difference between life and resurrection. Life is something that has never passed through death. Resurrection, on the contrary, is not only life, but life that has passed through death. Death cannot retain such a life; rather, this life overcomes death and even swallows it up. This is resurrection. Thus, to some extent at least, the word resurrection implies a process.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ALL-INCLUSIVENESS OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Today God is the processed God with divinity, humanity, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. This processed God of ours is now the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. We call Him the all-inclusive Spirit because within Him we have God as well as the redeemed, uplifted, and resurrected humanity. Moreover, within Him there is the incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Everything is included in Him. It is possible to make a list of many of the items included in the all-inclusive Spirit: life, light, wisdom, power, holiness, righteousness, humility, kindness, honor, glory. All the divine attributes and all the human virtues are included in this Spirit. Hence, He is all-inclusive.</P><P>This has never been more clear than it is today. Only in the church life, in the Lord's recovery, have you heard anything like this. If you would consult the books in Christian bookstores and libraries, you would be unable to find a sentence telling you that today our God is such an all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BORN OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>In God's economy, this processed God, this all-inclusive Spirit, must be born into us, and we must be born of Him. Our first relationship with this Spirit is that of birth. This is not an insignificant matter. This wonderful Spirit has been born into our being, and our being has been born of Him. John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit." In this verse we see two kinds of spirit, one indicated by the capital letter S and the other by the small letter s. No doubt the Spirit refers to this wonderful Spirit, and the spirit denotes our inward being. What is born of the Spirit is our spirit. Before we were saved, we were flesh. To be saved means not only to have our sins forgiven, to be redeemed, to be justified, and to be reconciled to God. The meaning of salvation is deeper and more profound than this. Ultimately, to be saved means to be born of this wonderful Spirit. Today, we are no longer flesh&#151;we are spirit.</P><P>When some of you hear this, you may say, "Brother Lee, you shouldn't boast for all of us. Even now, I still feel like I am flesh." In a sense, I agree with you. I like to hear you say this, for to realize that you are still flesh is an indication that you are under God's mercy. Only one who is under God's mercy would say that he is flesh. Anyone else would claim to be better than an angel. But in God's mercy you admit that you are poor. Especially you confess that you are ugly in the eyes of your wife or husband. However, although you realize that you are still flesh, do you not also have another sense within? Do you not sense that you are wonderful, glorious, marvelous, and mysterious? Within this flesh there is something divine; there is at least a small amount of gold. Do you not have at least an ounce of gold within you? Outwardly we may still be flesh, but inwardly we have gold. We need to learn to stand with God's grace and forget what we are outwardly. We need to say, "Flesh, go away. I don't care for you or appreciate you. There's gold in me." If you say this, you will immediately be glorious. The more you speak this way, the more the gold within you will increase. This is not a matter of mushrooming growth; it is a matter of faith. We need to say, "Flesh, go! I like gold! Hallelujah for the gold! I like to live with this gold and by this gold." The more you praise the Lord for the gold within you, the more the gold will gradually increase from one ounce to several ounces.</P><P>That which is born of the Spirit is spirit. This is a very important matter. Do you realize that you have been born of the Spirit and that the Spirit has been born into you? This is not a matter of religion, teaching, or any type of practice; it is a matter of birth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RESTRICTED TO THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Regarding the worship of God, worship is absolutely a matter of the spirit. God is Spirit, and we who worship Him must worship Him in spirit (John 4:24). We worship God the Spirit by our spirit. This is crucial. Many Christians understand this, but in their practice they have little realization that they are worshipping God exclusively by their spirit. Your spirit is different from your mind, emotion, or any other part of your inward being. We all need to restrict ourselves to the spirit. Whenever we contact God or fellowship with Him, we must be restricted to our spirit, remembering that we have been born of the Spirit in our spirit. We must worship the Spirit only by means of our reborn spirit, not by any other part of our being.</P><P>Some may ask what the difference is between worshipping God in spirit and worshipping Him by some other means. Although it is difficult to analyze this doctrinally, I can point out the difference in a practical way. Suppose after coming into the meeting you scrutinize the old ones and then the young ones. If you do this, you are surely not in the spirit. Then suppose you say to yourself, "Tonight, Brother Lee will speak. What will he talk about? He has spoken so much about the Spirit. Does he still have something more to say about the Spirit?" All these thoughts are like bugs that fly into your mind and occupy it. If you are occupied in this way, you are definitely not in the spirit. What then does it mean to be in the spirit? It means that you realize that you have been born of the Spirit in your spirit and that you come to the meeting to contact God the Spirit in your spirit. You forget your thinking and restrict yourself to your spirit. You may praise the Lord and say, "Amen! Hallelujah! O Lord Jesus! Oh, the seven Spirits, the seven lamps, and the seven eyes! Amen! Oh, the seven eyes on the stone and the seven eyes of the Lamb! Praise the Lord!" Eventually, when a brother stands up to speak, you may even forget his name. You will simply be enjoying the Lord.</P><P>Some believers are very active in their thinking, feeling, and analyzing, but they do not exercise their spirit. When you come to the meeting, you must forget yourself and exercise your spirit. Whenever I am about to speak, I try my best to forget the heavens, the earth, and even my family. But sometimes the enemy sends thoughts about my wife, children, and grandchildren to distract me. All these thoughts are like bugs. Nevertheless, I care only for my spirit. When I speak, I determine to speak from my spirit. This is the secret of impact in speaking and the secret of the Lord's speaking. We need to restrict ourselves to our spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</H2><P>Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God, and 1 Corinthians 6:17 says that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit. Is this a doctrine or a fact? What about your experience? In experience are you one spirit with the Lord? This must not merely be true doctrinally or positionally, but experientially. Hallelujah, I am one spirit with the Lord! This is a tremendous matter. This is not self-improvement or any type of behavior. This is not a matter of doing better, of loving, and of being holy. Do you dare say that right now you are one spirit with the Lord? I am bold to say this. Whenever I speak for Him, with Him, and in Him, I have the assurance that I am one spirit with Him. I have the assurance that while I am speaking He is working, because I am one spirit with Him and know that He is one spirit with me. This is not religion or ethics, philosophy or logic. It is the divine economy. The believers in Christ can be one spirit with the Lord. Here we have power, life, light, and everything we need. As long as we are one spirit with the Lord, all the pests are exterminated. The best pest control is to say, "O Lord Jesus, I am one spirit with You." When we say this, we have not only power, but also authority. When we are one spirit with the Lord, who can touch us?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GRACE WITH OUR SPIRIT</H2><P>Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you." Galatians 6:18 and Philemon 25 both say, "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit." Right now the Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in our spirit, and grace, the full enjoyment of the riches of the Lord, is also in our spirit. We are inwardly strengthened just by saying these words. If you do not believe it, I ask you to try it. As you are about to lose your temper, say, "Grace be with my spirit." This grace will kill your temper. Grace is the life-giving Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit Himself. Many of us are still very much under the influence of the religion of Christianity. We have heard so many teachings about various things. But I have learned one thing&#151;to be a good eater. Because I have excellent metabolism, I do not gain weight, although I eat very well. My point here is this. Do not tell me to do certain things, for I only need to eat the proper food. Forget those religious teachings about doing this and that. Instead, eat Jesus and enjoy grace. Do not try to deal with your temper. One word is sufficient: "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit." To this, we all must say, "Amen!" If you practice this, you will know wonderful victory. We all need to say&#151;"The grace of the Lord Jesus be with my spirit. Amen."</P><P>Two things are very real. The first is grace, and the second is the spirit. There is something in the universe called grace, and there is something within us called the spirit. The Bible says that grace is with our spirit. In the universe, there is grace; and within us, there is the spirit. Hallelujah, this grace is now in our spirit! If this were not such a wonderful matter, why would the Apostle Paul repeat it again and again, saying that grace is with our spirit, or that grace is with us? This is not vain talk or vain words. I was in Christianity for years, but no one ever told me such a thing. Rather, they taught me to honor my parents, and I did my best to do it. No one told me that there is something in the universe called grace and something within me called my spirit. But after many years I learned through experience that grace is with my spirit. This grace that is with our spirit is simply the all-inclusive Spirit. The all-inclusive Spirit has been born into our spirit, and we have been born of Him. This is grace. Now we are one spirit with Him, and He is within us as grace. The supply, the support, and the enjoyment are all with our spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REAL CHRISTIAN LIFE</H2><P>In every chapter of the book of Ephesians there is a verse concerning the spirit. Our spirit is wonderful because it is indwelt by the Spirit and is one with the Spirit. Hence, it is the mingled spirit, our spirit joined to the Spirit. According to Ephesians 1:17, this spirit is the spirit of wisdom and revelation. If we would know the book of Ephesians, we need such a spirit of wisdom and revelation. Ephesians 2:22 indicates that today God's habitation, the church, is in our spirit, and Ephesians 3:5 says that the revelation of the mystery hidden in God can be revealed to us only in our spirit. Ephesians 4:23 says that we must be renewed in the spirit of our mind. According to this verse, our spirit spreads into our mind and becomes the spirit of our mind. By this spirit we are being renewed. In Ephesians 5:18 we are told to be filled in our spirit. Our physical body may be filled with wine, but we do not desire this kind of filling. Instead, we need to be filled in our spirit with the wonderful, all-inclusive Spirit. Finally, Ephesians 6:18 says that we must pray at every time in spirit. If we put all these verses together, we shall see what the real Christian life is. It is to recognize that our spirit is indwelt by the all-inclusive Spirit. We must restrict ourselves to the spirit and do everything from the spirit. The life-giving Spirit indwells our spirit to be our Christian life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT<br>AND MINDING THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Romans 8:4 reveals that we need to walk according to this wonderful Spirit. Eventually, the New Testament charges us to do just one thing&#151;to walk, behave, speak, do things, and have our being according to the mingled spirit. Romans 8:6 tells us to set our mind upon the spirit. There is no need for me to try to explain this, for the more I explain it, the more confused you will be. You simply need to realize that you have such a spirit within you and that you should do everything according to your spirit. Are you about to lose your temper? Behave according to the spirit. Are you about to exchange words with your wife or husband? Speak according to the spirit. Have your being according to the spirit. Talk according to spirit, fellowship according to spirit, do everything according to spirit. Be simple. Do not think about so many things. Do not think that your wife or husband is good or bad. Instead, set your mind upon the spirit. When you are thinking about your wife or husband, set your mind upon the spirit. When you are tempted to think about a sale coming up tomorrow, set your mind upon the spirit. Instead of considering what style shoes to buy or what color they should be, set your mind upon the spirit. Many of you have heard that you should set your mind upon the spirit, but do you actually practice it? We need to set our mind upon the spirit.</P><P>In our life-study of Genesis we came up with a new proverb: Bind your donkey to the vine. (See Life-study of Genesis, Message One Hundred, p. 1290.) Setting the mind upon the spirit is somewhat like binding the donkey to the vine. When you are thinking about the past or about how your wife is treating you, bind your donkey to the vine and set your mind upon the spirit. Do not care about heaven or earth, or about your wife or husband. Instead, set your mind upon the spirit, and bind your donkey to the vine. Hallelujah, my donkey is tied to the vine! Everything is involved with the vine, which is Christ. Do not argue, reason, or consider. Simply bind your donkey to the vine and set your mind upon the spirit. If you do this, you will be happy and rejoicing and praising. The more you praise, the more you will be in the spirit. The more you praise, the more you will restrict yourself to the spirit and concentrate yourself in the spirit. Hallelujah, it is here in the spirit that we enjoy Him and experience all the riches of Christ! This is wonderful.</P><P>CHAPTER TEN</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SPIRIT AS OUR PERSON</H1><P>In the past messages we have covered many crucial aspects of the wonderful, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. But one deeper aspect remains to be touched, an aspect hidden in the New Testament revelation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE INNER MAN</H2><P>In Ephesians 3:16 Paul prayed that the Father would grant us to be strengthened in our inner man. In this verse Paul unexpectedly uses a strange but particular term: the inner man. This term is very significant. Here Paul does not speak of the spirit or of any other organ; he says that our inner man needs to be strengthened so that Christ may make His home in our hearts. We need to read Ephesians 3:16 and 17 very attentively, noticing the matter of the inner man and then the matter of Christ's making His home in our hearts. Within us we have an inner man, which we did not have before we were regenerated.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SOUL BEING THE PERSONALITY</H2><P>Human beings have their being, or their man, in their soul, not in their body or in their spirit. For this reason, the Bible often refers to man as a soul. For example, Exodus 1:5 says that "all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls," and Acts 2:41, speaking of those baptized on the day of Pentecost, says that "there were added unto them about three thousand souls." According to the Bible, a person is a soul because his being, his man, is in his soul. The Bible reveals that man is a tripartite being, composed of the spirit within, the body without, and the soul between the spirit and the body. The soul is the being, for a person's personality is in his soul. In other words, human life is in the soul. The body is an organ to contact the outward world, and the spirit is an organ to contact the spiritual world. Therefore, a human being, a person, with his personality in his soul, has both a body and a spirit as organs. Neither the body nor the spirit is his personality. This means that the personality of a human being is neither in the body nor in the spirit, but in the soul. Hence, the soul, and neither the body nor the spirit, is the person. Before we were regenerated, our body was our outward organ and our spirit was our inward organ. Being an inward organ, the spirit has no personality in it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT BECOMING THE INNER MAN</H2><P>When we believed in the Lord Jesus and were regenerated, Christ as life entered into our spirit. Prior to this, there was no life in our spirit, for the spirit was merely an organ without life. Our human life was not in our spirit; it was in our soul. A human being is in the soul; that is, the soul is the human being. But when we were regenerated, Christ came into our spirit to be life there. This caused our spirit to no longer be an organ. The coming of Christ into our spirit makes our spirit a new being, which the Apostle Paul called the inner man. Formerly, our spirit was merely an organ, and there was no man, no personality, in it because there was no life in it. But by coming into our spirit, Christ has made it a being with life. Now in our spirit we have another being, the new being, the inner man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TWO BEINGS</H2><P>Because our spirit is now our inner man, every Christian is two beings: the old being in the soul and the new being in the spirit. Our old man is in our soul, and our new man is in our spirit. The Bible says that our old man, the being in our soul, has been crucified (Rom. 6:6). God would never tolerate our having two men. One of the two must go. Hence, the old man was crucified on the cross. When I read Romans 6 fifty years ago, I was troubled by the verse which says that our old man has been crucified. I said to myself, "If this man is dead, how can I live?" At that time I did not see the fact that, although the Lord had crucified my old man on the cross, in regeneration Christ had come into my spirit to make my spirit a new man. Formerly our soul was the man and our spirit was the organ. But now that we have been regenerated the opposite is true. Our spirit has become the man, and now our soul is merely an organ, no longer the being or the personality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LIVING AND WALKING BY THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Often we Christians are not very clear about the little revelation we have received. For example, we often say that we live by the spirit. But if the spirit is still an organ and not a man with life in it, how can we live by this organ? When we say that we live by our spirit, we need to see that this means our spirit now has become a being with life in it. Our spirit has life in it, and this life is Christ. This is why Galatians 2:20 says, "No more I, but Christ lives in me." This verse does not say, "Not my life, but the life of Christ lives in me." This verse does not refer to a life, but to a person. The "I" used to be the person, but now Christ, a new person, lives in me. I used to be the person in my soul, but now Christ is the new person in my spirit.</P><P>Now that Christ is in our spirit, we still have two organs: the body and the soul. Formerly the two organs were the body and the spirit; now the second organ is no longer the spirit, but the soul. Our soul used to be our personality, and our spirit was an organ. But now our spirit is our personality, and our soul has become an organ. This is the reason we can live and walk by our spirit. In our spirit we have not merely an organ; we have the life which is Christ Himself. Christ as the life in our spirit makes our spirit a new being with a new personality. This new being is called the inner man. This inner man needs to be strengthened, empowered. Oh, we all must see this! This is crucial! I was a Christian for more than forty years before I saw this matter. Only during the past ten years have I seen that our human spirit used to be an organ, but that now it is a man. One day the Lord pointed this out to me and said, "Look, now your personality is not in the soul, but in the spirit. The personality in your soul has been crucified, put to death." When we say our soul has been crucified and that we must deny it, we do not mean that the functions of the organ of the soul have been crucified or must be denied. The functions of the soul are still present, for today the soul is an organ. It is the being, the personality, in the soul that has been crucified and dealt with. Therefore, now there is a new being, a new personality, in our spirit. This new personality is Christ Himself. Because the divine life is in our spirit, our spirit has become the new man, the inner man. How wonderful this is! We can live and walk by this new man. If this one matter is made clear to you, you will be changed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SOME EXAMPLES</H2><P>Let us now consider, as examples, some of those who lived and walked in the spirit. Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, was such a one. A number of times the book of Acts says that Stephen was full of the Holy Spirit (Acts 6:3, 5; 7:55). He was one who acted, walked, behaved, and worked in the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit mingled with his spirit. In him the divine Spirit and the human spirit were mingled together as one. It was the same with Philip, who also was full of the Holy Spirit. According to Acts 6 and 7, Stephen and Philip were people who lived, behaved, and walked in such a wonderful Spirit. This was not a doctrine to them; it was their daily walk. They lived no longer in the soul, in the old being with the old personality. They lived in the new being, in the new personality. This new being, this new personality, was constituted by the Holy Spirit indwelling their human spirit. If we saw this, there would be no need for so many kinds of teachings.</P><P>The Apostle Paul and his co-workers were also such people. Paul and Barnabas lived and walked by the spirit. Their soul, their old man with their old being and personality, had been crucified on the cross and buried with Christ. Therefore, they had a new being, the inner man --Christ dwelling in their spirit and making His home in every part of their inner being.</P><P>According to Acts 15:28, the Apostles made a decision with the Spirit, saying, "It seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us." This means that they were one with the Holy Spirit and that their action was the action of the Spirit. Their walk, their daily life, and their work were altogether that of the Holy Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HOLY SPIRIT BEING THE CONSTITUENT</H2><P>This is not simply a matter of power. Many Christians today consider the Holy Spirit either merely as a power or as an instrument. But the Holy Spirit is the constituent of our new being, not simply a power or an instrument. The Spirit is not only a matter of power, but also a matter of constitution, a matter of our make-up. All the Apostles lived according to this new being. Acts 16:6 and 7 reveal that as Paul moved in his ministry, he moved not by his old man, but by the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>STIRRED IN SPIRIT</H2><P>Acts 17:16 says that Paul was stirred in his spirit. If you were not regenerated, you could never be stirred in your spirit. You could only be stirred in your soul, because your spirit would only be an organ. Furthermore, one could never say that he is stirred up in his body, because one's person is not the body. Paul could be stirred up in his spirit because his personality was in his spirit. Thus, this verse is another indication that after regeneration our being, our personality, is in our spirit. However, because many Christians do not have this light or this vision, they are still stirred up in the soul. They may be stirred in the soul by their husbands or wives. How we need to see that our new personality is no longer in our soul! It is in our spirit, which is constituted with Christ as our new man. Whatever we do, we must do it here in this new man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PURPOSING IN SPIRIT</H2><P>Acts 19:21 says that Paul even purposed in his spirit. If his being was not in the spirit, how could he have purposed in his spirit? If his spirit had still simply been an organ, how could he have purposed in this organ? To purpose means to do something with your being, not with an organ. Acts 19:21 proves that, at that time, Paul's spirit had become his personality, his being, his man. Therefore, he purposed in his spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SERVING GOD IN SPIRIT</H2><P>In Romans 1:9 Paul tells us that he served God in his spirit. His spirit was the man, the being, the personality, in which he served God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PRESENT IN SPIRIT</H2><P>First Corinthians 5:3 and 4 reveal that Paul could attend a meeting of the church in Corinth in his spirit, even when he was not physically present. Paul was "absent in body, but present in spirit" (v. 3). Verse 4 says, "In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ." This means that when the believers in Corinth and Paul's spirit were gathered together, his spirit was meeting with them. In this portion of the Word Paul seemed to be saying, "When you met in that meeting and my spirit was with you, I cast that sinful person into the hand of Satan." How strong Paul was!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IN THE SPIRIT OF MEEKNESS</H2><P>First Corinthians 4:21 says, "What will ye? Shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?" This verse also shows that Paul was one absolutely walking, moving, and working in his new being, in his new personality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR SPIRIT BEING REFRESHED</H2><P>First Corinthians 16:18 says, "For they have refreshed my spirit and yours." We need to learn to say, "My spirit was refreshed." Sometimes we say, "My heart has been hurt," or, "My emotion has been touched." Now we must learn to say that our spirit has been hurt or touched or refreshed. That part of your being which is touched proves in what part of your being you are living. If you say that your heart has been hurt, then you are a person in the heart. This indicates that you are still the old person in the old soul. If you say that your emotion has been stirred, it indicates that you are still a soulish person, living in the old being in the soul. Now we must learn to say, "Brothers, my spirit has been hurt." This may not sound very pleasant; but it is accurate. Say, "Brother, you have touched my spirit." This may not seem sweet, but it is precise. If we can say that our spirit has been refreshed by others, it proves that we are living in our new being.</P><P>Some verses in 2 Corinthians also prove that Paul was a man who lived in his new being. Second Corinthians 2:13 says that Paul had no rest in his spirit; 7:13, that Titus's spirit was refreshed; and 12:18, that Paul and Titus walked in the same spirit. Paul was bold to declare that he and his co-workers were those living in their new being, in their new personality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE APOSTLES' LIFE</H2><P>The New Testament is the story of those who lived, walked, and worked in spirit. When I was young, I read books on the life of Paul and the life of Peter. But those books did not tell me that Peter and Paul were living, walking, and moving in their new being. Instead, the books said that Peter and Paul were full of power or full of the Holy Spirit. According to the concept of these books, power suddenly was poured upon Peter, a fisherman, and Paul, a learned man, and they were enabled to speak. But if we see the light on the matter of the spirit as our real person, we shall see the book of Acts in a new way. The Apostles were people living in their new being, in their regenerated spirit indwelt by Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JOHN ON THE ISLAND OF PATMOS</H2><P>The New Testament ends with the case of the aged Apostle John on the island of Patmos. Although John was elderly, he was still living in his spirit. In Revelation 1:10 John says, "I was in spirit on the Lord's day." Because he was in spirit, he saw the local churches. Then in spirit he saw the judgment of God exercised upon the world (Rev. 4:2, ff.), he saw the Great Babylon (Rev. 17:3, ff.), and he saw the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:10). In his spirit, in his new being, his new personality and person, John saw the churches, the world, Babylon, and the New Jerusalem. As one who is growing old, I hope to be one day like John. I long to be able to say that I was in spirit on the Lord's day, that I heard a voice, that I turned to see it, and that I saw all the local churches. How good that would be! I would also like to testify that in spirit I saw the world under God's judgment, the fall of the Great Babylon, and the coming of the New Jerusalem. This is not a dream; it is a realization in spirit. How much we need to be in spirit! We need to live, walk, and work in spirit.</P><P>Our spirit is no longer an organ, and our soul is no longer our person; today our spirit is our person, and our soul is just an organ. We need to say, "Soul, simply be an organ. Don't talk to me, because you are no longer the person. You are my organ. Don't make any proposals to me, for I don't want to live by you anymore. Instead, I will use you as an organ. Soul, don't you know that today my person is the regenerated spirit indwelt by my dear Lord Jesus Christ? If you know it, then you must go to the grave and rest there." I hope that we all shall see this crucial matter.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ELEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>WITNESSES TO CHRIST</H1><P>In Acts 1:8 the Lord Jesus said, "But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth." Apart from all the foregoing messages on the Spirit, we would not be able to understand what it means to be a witness to the Lord. To be a witness to the Lord is to be a person wholly saturated with the life-giving Spirit, a person inwardly filled by the life-giving Spirit and totally immersed into the Spirit. Both within and without, there is the life-giving Spirit. We have seen clearly that in God's dispensation the Lord Jesus Christ today is the life-giving Spirit. When we are filled with Him and immersed into Him, we are one with Him and thereby we are His witnesses. All the saints in the Lord's recovery should be such witnesses. Being a witness does not depend on what you say or do; it depends upon your being a person filled with Christ, immersed into Christ, and fully saturated and permeated with the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. If you are like this, then your being will be a witness to the Lord Jesus. What you are will be the witness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WITNESS AND THE TESTIMONY</H2><P>In Acts 1:8, the word "witness" is different from the word "testimony" used elsewhere. A witness denotes a person, whereas a testimony denotes that which this person bears. First we are the witness, then we bear the testimony. According to the book of Revelation, the saints, the believers, are the testimony of Jesus, and the testimony of Jesus is, collectively, the church. In Revelation the seven lampstands signify the seven churches (Rev. 1:20). These seven lampstands signify that the churches on earth today are the testimony of Jesus. In eternity, the New Jerusalem will be the testimony of Jesus. Collectively and corporately, the churches are the testimony of Jesus, but individually each of us is a witness to Jesus. Every one of us must be a witness to Jesus, a person saturated with Christ, immersed into Christ, and permeated with Christ. Whatever we are, within and without, must be Christ. This is a witness. Then when we come together, we shall be a corporate testimony, for we shall all bear the same thing. This is the testimony of Jesus.</P><P>In today's Christianity there is very little witness or testimony. We see many Christians, but not many witnesses. Instead of the testimony of Jesus, in Christianity there is merely a religion. But every saint in the churches in the Lord's recovery must be a living witness, filled with Christ, saturated with Christ, and immersed into Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit. If we are like this, then we shall immediately become the testimony of Jesus whenever we come together.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AN UPLIFTED DAILY LIFE</H2><P>For the sake of such a testimony of Jesus, we all must have an uplifted daily life. Our daily life among our neighbors, classmates, relatives, and friends must be outstanding. In Matthew chapters five, six, and seven, the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, reveal that the standard of the living of the kingdom people is very high. In our daily walk we must have excellency. This excellence will surprise people, causing them to admire our daily living. It will also be quite convincing. This is the basic factor in our testimony. If we would be real witnesses to Jesus, our daily walk must reach such a standard. This, however, is not a matter of outward behavior; it is a matter of living out Christ. Paul said, "For to me to live is Christ" (Phil. 1:21). It is not simply a matter of doing good or of behaving well. Much more, it is the living out of Christ to express Christ. If we do not have such an uplifted daily walk, we are a failure in the Lord's recovery. We are defeated, and in a sense, the Lord is defeated also. Of course, the Lord cannot actually be defeated, but due to our failure, the enemy may think that the Lord has been defeated. What a shame for those in the Lord's recovery to fall below the standard in their daily walk!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LIVING MEETINGS</H2><P>Along with an uplifted daily life we must have church meetings that are living. We do not want "services" like those in Christianity. Rather, we want living meetings, meetings that are rich, fresh, and high. Having such meetings depends upon all of us. We all, great and small, old and young, need to daily experience Christ. We must exercise our spirit to experience Him. In other words, we must continually exercise ourselves to godliness, to experience Christ in every respect. This is what we call laboring on Christ. Christ is the good land producing a variety of riches, but we need to labor on Him. If we labor on Christ, we shall eventually have a harvest of Christ. Then when we come to the meetings, we shall come with the surplus of Christ and offer this surplus to God. This is the exhibition of Christ. You exhibit a portion of Christ, and I offer another portion of Christ. If we all bring a surplus of Christ, our meetings will be an exhibition of the riches of Christ. Our spirit will be very living, the testimonies will be fresh, and the atmosphere will be uplifted to the heavens. Such a meeting is a shame to the enemy. In this kind of meeting all death is swallowed up, the Lord is expressed, the Father is glorified, and we are nourished. Eventually, through such meetings, the church is built up. Meetings of this kind are not only nourishing to us, but also very convincing to the newcomers. They are inspiring, unveiling, and enlightening. Those who attend such meetings will be thoroughly saturated with Christ, darkness and death will be swallowed up, weakness will vanish, the problems will be solved, all needs will be met, and the newcomers will receive benefit. This kind of meeting is the testimony of Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BEST COMMUNAL LIFE</H2><P>In every locality the church must also take up the burden to care for the young people, especially for the unmarried brothers and sisters. It is necessary to have many brothers' houses and sisters' houses in order to have the best communal life. Even the families should have much contact, communication, and fellowship with each other. We must give a strong testimony to society that the church life is the best communal life. In His creation of man, God put in man the desire for a social life. Human beings simply cannot live without being social. We cannot bear to live without society. Suppose you lived in a large mansion on a mountaintop far removed from society, and you stayed there for a while without a telephone and without seeing anyone. You would soon realize that that mansion was in fact a terrible prison. This proves that everyone needs society. Due to the fall, sin has come in and Satan is now here to occupy human society and make it sinful. Therefore, today's society is corrupt. The nightclubs and parties are filled with corruption. For this reason, the word "social" does not have a positive connotation. Nevertheless, human beings need to socialize, and we, the believers in Christ, need a pure society. The church life is the highest social life. This is why we can say that the church life is wonderful. Here we have not only God, but also other people. We enjoy God, and we enjoy the other people who are the members of Christ. The more fellowship, contact, and communication we have with one another, the better. This will become a testimony to the unbelievers, and our neighbors will say, "These people have the best communal life, the best social life."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ATTRACTION TO THE CHURCH LIFE</H2><P>Three things will attract people to the church: our daily walk, the rich meetings, and the proper communal life. I believe that these three things will bring in the increase. The increase should come in this way, rather than by the means of preaching. (However, this does not mean that we should not preach; we must preach a great deal.) We must have a daily walk that is uplifted; meetings that are high, living, and rich; and a communal life that is pure, yet full of enjoyment. This will attract our relatives, friends, neighbors, and classmates into the church life. I hope that all the churches with all the saints will devote their attention to these three things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PRESENTING THE TRUTHS OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>In addition to these matters, there is the need for us all to be trained to present the truths. We all must learn the things related to the Lord's recovery in such a way that we shall be able to present them to others. In other words, we must learn how to present what we are enjoying in the Lord's recovery. For example, many Christians do not know what the church is. Some think a chapel, cathedral, or bungalow with a high tower is a church. On Sunday mornings many speak of going to church. Others refer to their church as the church on a particular street, indicating thereby that they do not know what the church really is. Therefore, we ourselves must know what the church is and then learn how to present to others the truth in a pleasant, convincing, and attractive manner. Whenever we are asked anything, we must be ready to answer. First Peter 3:15 says that we must be "ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you." Suppose someone asks you who the pastor of the church in Anaheim is, and you answer, "Every one of us is a pastor!" That would not be a proper answer; for it would cause others to think that you are not willing to talk to them. Even a simple question such as this is not easy to answer. In order to answer such a question properly, we must exercise both our spirit and our mind.</P><P>We need to learn how to present things to people in a pleasant way, in a way that is convincing, subduing, and captivating. Whenever people ask us a question, that is an opportunity to catch them. To do this, we must learn how to share with them in a complete way. If someone asks you what it means to turn to the spirit, that is an excellent opportunity to capture him by sharing something with him. We all must learn to do this. At present most of us are not strong in this matter. Hence, we need to speak convincingly when others ask us questions. Take every question as an opportunity to catch a fish. But this requires a great deal of training. About thirty years ago I spent much time in this kind of training in the church in my hometown, and it worked very well.</P><P>Suppose someone asks you a difficult or nonsensical question. Do not reply in an offensive manner. Rather, answer in a way that will calm down the other party. This is the way to catch people. It is possible to talk to people for hours without touching the thing about which they have inquired. Do not be bothered if they ask nonsensical questions, but use the opportunity to inject something positive into them. Do not let them go until they have received a good injection. Some Christians may ask why our meetings are so loud. Do not say, "We are all excited because Jesus is our enjoyment. We all eat Jesus. Eating Jesus is the way!" Some of our young people have answered in just this way. Instead of responding in this manner, answer in a way to soften the one who has asked the question. As you talk with him, give him an injection. Whether he agrees or disagrees, the injection will get into him.</P><P>Our locality is our fishing pond, and every day we are surrounded by fish. For this reason, I am burdened that all the churches train the saints to present what we are enjoying. If, when you are asked a question, you always say, "I don't know," you are not useful. It is not an easy thing to say, "I don't know." Many of us cannot say these words, will not say them, or do not know how to say them. We must learn the right time to say, "I don't know." Then these words will be useful.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOING TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE</H2><P>Now we come to the matter of gaining the young people. Every church must go to the young people. In any field the future is with the young people. If an industry or a school does not gain young people, that industry or school has no future. This generation is the generation of the young people. However, this does not mean that we do not appreciate the older ones.</P><P>There are three reasons why we must go to the young people. The first reason is that the young people are not occupied. It is best to contact young people between the ages of sixteen and twenty. During these years they begin to understand things, but they are not occupied. Therefore, we must seize the opportunity to gain the high school students and the freshmen in college. When many young people turn eighteen, they are eager to leave home. This is the right time to gain them for the Lord's recovery.</P><P>The second reason for going to the young people is the fact that so many young people are gathered in the schools. No other age is gathered together like this. Because the young people are gathered in the schools, it is easy to contact them. In order to catch fish, you must go where the fish are.</P><P>The third reason is that it is easy for the young people, especially those at the end of their teen-age years, to have a change in their mind, that is, it is easy for them to repent. (To repent means to have a change of mind.) If you present something solid, worthwhile, and interesting to young people, they will take it.</P><P>For these three reasons, every local church must work on the campuses. Those who engage in this campus work should be young, the younger the better. It is difficult for someone more than twenty-seven years of age to talk to a person seventeen years of age. It is better that we work with those in our own age group. If I went to work on the campuses, no young people would want to talk to me, because I am an old person. But if I were a young person, it would be very easy for other young people to talk to me. Therefore, we should not send the older ones to work on the campuses.</P><P>However, the older ones, those over twenty-seven, should not think that there is nothing for them to do or that they should retire. An army has more personnel than just the young soldiers. The entire church is a fighting body. But this does not mean that everyone must go to the frontier to fight. Rather, we should send the young ones to the frontier and let the others work in the background. For example, the older ones can spend much time in prayer. But if we asked the young people to stay behind and pray, it would be very difficult for them. It would be like interrupting a basketball game and asking the players to pray. Because their heart and interest are in playing basketball, the players would find this very difficult. Even while they are praying, they would be eager to dribble the ball. Instead of asking the young people to stop and pray, we should pray for them. We need both a playing team and a praying team. The young people should be the playing team, and the older ones should be the praying team. But we are all one Body. If you ask me to stay home to pray, I will be very happy. For me to pray at home is enjoyable.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>INVITING THE YOUNG PEOPLE<br>TO OUR HOMES</H2><P>On the one hand, the freshmen in college are eager to leave home; on the other hand, as they live in the dormitories at school, they are often lonely and homesick. This provides an excellent opportunity to invite them into our homes. The young people in the church can invite others to the homes of the middle-aged ones and of the young couples. All these homes need to be open and ready to receive the young people. When they come in, serve them something to eat and drink. This will touch their heart. In preaching the gospel we do not need any gimmicks. We should simply pray, preach the word, and open our homes. It is difficult for the young people both to go to the campuses and to prepare their homes to receive others. We need the youngest ones to go to the campuses, the oldest ones to pray, and the middle-aged ones to prepare their homes. Day and night the homes need to be ready.</P><P>September is a golden time to catch the freshmen. Every September we should be able to catch a good number. This does not mean that we do not preach the gospel to others. Our daily walk, our meetings, and our communal life are all a type of gospel preaching. Wherever we live, we influence the community. But we must purposely form teams to go to the campuses to reach the young people. If we do this with much prayer, a good number will be brought in. Let September be the time to make contact and October the month to reap. During these months, concentrate your time and labor on reaping a new crop of freshmen. First you reap them, then you build them up. After that, you may use them to gain their classmates or roommates. We need to do the same thing year after year. I believe that each time we do this, more freshmen will be reaped. Do not miss this opportunity. We must pray and seize this golden opportunity. If we gain the freshmen, then through them we shall gain some of their parents. It seems that when young people reach the age of nineteen or twenty, they will not listen to their parents, but their parents will listen to them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DEALING WITH OPPOSERS</H2><P>From the time the Lord's recovery came to this country, there has been opposition against it. The Lord's recovery, of course, is a testimony. But religion does not feel positively about this testimony. Satan, the Devil, is behind this opposition, for he knows that the recovery will defeat him and bring the Lord Jesus back. Hence, through the years, the opposition has followed us wherever we have gone. According to the book of Acts, it was the same with the apostles. Wherever the apostles went, the opposition was there. Some of the opposers even followed the apostles.</P><P>In the midst of this opposition, we must not be passive. We should be not only active, but even aggressive. However, we do not want to fight with others or be angry with anyone. Whenever you meet an opposer, take that as an opportunity to work on him. If that opposer says something negative, do not argue with him. Instead, be patient and pleasant, and take down all the negative points he speaks to you. Then, ask for his name, address, and telephone number and let him know that you would like to study the points and talk with him again.</P><P>When anyone comes to you with a negative, opposing attitude, do not touch the points he raises right away, because at that time the opposer is on fire. If you touch the points of opposition, you will be burned. Instead of touching the points, slow down, cool down, and prepare the way for a second contact. Do not be in a rush to solve all the problems. The more you attempt to solve the problems, the more trouble you will cause. After you have taken down all the points, pray about them and see if you have the answers for them. If not, fellowship with other brothers and sisters. In this way you will find the answer and learn something yourself. Then try to have another time with the opposing one. But do not tell him you have all the answers. Rather, in a gradual way, item by item, solve his problems by injecting something into him. Human beings are human beings. By God's creation, every human being has a conscience and a sense of fairness. If you are genuine, honest, faithful, and nice, the other party will appreciate you. If you present matters solidly, rightly, and fairly, the opposer's sense of fairness will confirm what you say, and something will get into him. But do not expect immediate results. A fisherman must be patient. Hasty fishermen catch nothing; they only frighten the fish.</P><P>Even from the opposition we should be able to gain some increase. Do you not believe that you can bring in one opposer yearly? This means, of course, that we must labor. If we do not labor, we shall not bring in anything, even if we wait until eternity. Some of you may feel that you have no contacts, but you may know some opposers. The opposers are the best contacts. There is no need for you to go to them for they will come to you. All the opposers are like fish who come to a fisherman and say, "Here I am, ready to be hooked." But you may not believe that the opposers can be hooked. Because you may think that they are enemies and attackers, you may not appreciate them. I beg you to change your concept and begin to appreciate every opposer. When an opposer comes to you, you should say inwardly, "Praise the Lord, a good fish has come." But do not try to hook him right away. Rather, in wisdom, bind the opposer secretly. Hold on to a secret line that will not let him go. The problems he raises are the bait. The more questions he asks and the more problems he raises, the more free bait you will have. Take the problems and questions home, cook the bait, and bring it back to the fish the second time. Then the fish will swallow it. But still do not hook him too quickly. If you do so, you will lose him. Actually, you do not need to hook him, for he will be happy to swallow the hook. And when he gets hooked, he will be glad. I hope that a year from now many of us will be able to praise the Lord that we have caught an opposer. If we all do this, the opposers will be terrified and say, "Don't touch those people."</P><P>Do not think that I am too idealistic. This has actually happened in Fullerton, a city near Anaheim. The brothers and sisters there have gained the victory by taking down the questions raised by the opposers, by studying them, and by going back to talk to them. The truth is the truth. We have the case, and the truth is on our side. Thus, we are not afraid to be opposed. If we have real gold, we should not be afraid for that gold to be tested. The more the gold is tested, the more its golden nature is manifest.</P><P>We need to practice all the points covered in this message. If we practice them, we shall gain a good increase.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWELVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A GENERAL VIEW OF THE BODY</H1><P>With this message we begin a series of messages on the Body. Ephesians 4:4 says, "One body, and one Spirit." This indicates that the Body is something of the Spirit and that the Spirit has a great deal to do with the Body. If there is no Spirit, there can be no Body. The Spirit is the reality of the Body. The Body issues out of the Spirit and is constituted of the Spirit. If we know the Spirit, we know the Body. If we know the Body, we must have had the experience of the Spirit. Most Christians do not adequately realize that the Spirit is for the Body and that the Body is for the Spirit. Just as our physical life and our physical body are inseparable, so the Body and the Spirit are inseparable. Without life, our physical body is just a corpse. The Body and the Spirit are one. The Spirit is the life, the reality, and the constituent of the Body.</P><P>Four books in the New Testament are concerned with the Body: Romans, 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, and Colossians. Colossians does not say much about the Body because it is a book on the Head. However, as a book concerning the Head, it also refers to the Body, for we cannot have the Head without the Body. Ephesians is a book on the Body. But Ephesians also covers the Head. Therefore, in Colossians, the book concerned with the Head, we have the Head with the Body; and in Ephesians, the book concerned with the Body, we have the Body with the Head. Each of these four books covers a different aspect of the Body. If we would know the Body, we must know the various aspects of the Body. Although Ephesians was written later than Romans and 1 Corinthians, we must consider it first because it reveals how the Body is produced, how the Body comes into existence, how the Body is formed, and how the Body is constituted.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST PROCESSED<br>THROUGH DEATH AND RESURRECTION</H2><P>Ephesians 1:19 and 20 say, "And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead." We may say both that power has been wrought in Christ and that Christ has been worked upon. In other words, Christ has been processed. This word "processed" sounds strange to religious ears. The religious ones will wonder how the Lord Jesus could have been processed. Nevertheless, we must take care of the fact. Christ, who is God, one day became a man, a despised Nazarene with no physical beauty. One day He was crucified and stayed there on the cross for several hours. After He died, His side was pierced, and blood and water came forth. Then He was buried in the tomb, and after three days He was resurrected. He was nailed to the cross in the flesh, but He was resurrected in the Spirit. He was crucified with a natural body, but He was resurrected with a spiritual body. Was this not a process? If this is not a process, then what is it? The Lord Jesus certainly underwent a long process. In any kind of cooking the food is processed. Everything we take into us as food, even if it is raw, has been processed in some way. How could a watermelon get into us without being sliced and processed?</P><P>Christ, our Redeemer, has become a life-giving Spirit. Our concept is natural, and we have been too much under the influence of Christianity. Do not think that since Christ has become the life-giving Spirit, He is only great, majestic, and transcendent. Do not suppose that He imparts life into you by coming upon you in some electrifying way. As the life-giving Spirit today, Christ is like a small particle of processed food. This food is life-giving. Every day I am strengthened by eating nourishing food. In like manner, Christ gives us life not from the heavens, but from within us. If you say, "O Lord Jesus, I love You," you will receive life. This life comes to you not from the third heaven, but from within you, because Christ, the life-giving Spirit, is in you. According to the religious concept, Christ is a great One. But He is not only great, for the life-giving Christ today is also very small. We need to praise Him for His smallness. How small our Christ is! Anything we eat is smaller than we are. For example, can you eat a large, thick steak whole? No, before you can eat it, you must cut it into small pieces, the smaller, the better.</P><P>In Ephesians 1 we see that Christ has been processed through death and resurrection into ascension. Verse 19 says, "And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power." The word "working" is a weak translation of a Greek word which actually means "energizing." Therefore, this verse, and the first part of verse 20, should read, "According to the energizing of his mighty power, which he [God] wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places." Here we see the process Christ has undergone, from death, through resurrection, to ascension far above all principality, power, might, dominion, and name. Verse 22 says that God "hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church." This is the process through which Christ has passed. Having passed through such a process and having obtained so much and having attained to such a high position, He now has all things under His feet, and He is the Head over all things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TRANSMITTED TO THE CHURCH</H2><P>The last three words of verse 22, "to the church," are crucial. This indicates that whatever Christ has undergone, whatever He has obtained and attained, has all been transmitted to the church. The word "to" here indicates a type of transmission. Again I say that whatever Christ has gained and obtained has been transmitted to the church. Christ is above all, but His being above all has been transmitted to the church. Hence, the church also is above all.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TRANSMISSION BEING THE SOURCE OF THE BODY</H2><P>Verse 23 says that the church is Christ's Body. This means that whatever Christ has passed through, obtained, and attained has been transmitted to the Body. Whatever has happened to the Head has happened to the Body. What the Head has gained now belongs to the Body. This transmission is the source of the Body. The Body comes from the transmission of the Head. This transmission took place on the day of Pentecost. On the day of Pentecost everything belonging to the Head was transmitted to the Body. We need to have a vision of this. Neither our belief nor our unbelief alters the fact that all the Head has obtained and attained has been transmitted to the Body. Such an event has taken place in this universe. On the day of Pentecost the ascended Christ transmitted to the Body all His experiences. Out of this transmission the Body came into existence. All that Christ has accomplished, obtained, and attained is not only for the Body, but also to the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CASE OF PETER</H2><P>Consider the case of Peter. On the day of Pentecost Peter, a Galilean fisherman, became another person. I appreciate the Peter we see in the four Gospels because he was frank and honest, although he was selfishly honest. In the Gospels Peter was very natural and fully in the flesh. However, he made no pretense. He was what he was, and he was exposed. It seemed that he never did anything right. Only on one occasion did he speak a clear word, and that was in Caesarea Philippi when he said that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God. What Peter said on that occasion was wonderful, but it came not from Peter, but from the Father's revelation. On other occasions Peter spoke nonsense and was rebuked for it. According to Matthew 16, immediately after he confessed that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God, Peter told Him to pity Himself and not go to the cross. That forced the Lord to rebuke him and say, "Get behind Me, Satan." Peter also spoke nonsense when he was on the mount of transfiguration. He seemed to say, "Lord, how good it is to be here. I will make three tabernacles here, one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." What nonsense! Furthermore, when the collector of the half shekel asked Peter if his Master paid the tax, Peter immediately answered that He did. He was also rebuked for this. But on the day of Pentecost Peter was another person. Prior to that, he was bold in a fleshly way, but actually very timid in following Christ, for he denied the Lord three times. But on the day of Pentecost Peter was more mighty than all the powerful people on earth. What happened to him, and what made him different? It was the fact that all that Christ had passed through and experienced had been transmitted into Peter. On that day Peter received a heavenly, divine transmission. To repeat, on the day of Pentecost all that Christ had passed through, obtained, and attained was transmitted from the third heaven to the church. Out of this transmission the Body came into existence.</P><P>If we would experience the Body today, we must have a personal experience of the transmission that transpired on the day of Pentecost. There are many genuine Christians who do not have the experience of the Body. Although they are truly saved, they do not have the sense that they are in the Body. The reason for this is that they do not have the vision of the transmission that has taken place from the Head to the Body. They have not seen that whatever Christ is, whatever Christ has accomplished, whatever place Christ occupies, and whatever Christ possesses have been transmitted to the Body. In order to share in this transmission, you need to be part of the Body. My first burden in this message is to point out that the existence of the Body depends on the transmission that took place on the day of Pentecost. Ephesians 1 declares this fact.</P><P>Ephesians 1:23 says that the Body is the fullness of Him who fills all in all. Apart from the Body, the Head has no fullness. Because Christ is universally great, He needs a great body to be His fullness and to express Him. This Body comes out of the transmission of Christ. All that Christ has obtained and attained and all that He is have been transmitted into the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ABOLISHING OF THE ORDINANCES</H2><P>We may say that the book of Ephesians is a biblical lexicon, for it contains many new terms. One of these new terms is "the new man." In Ephesians 2 we see that the Body is the new man. Ephesians 2:15 and 16 put the Body with the new man, telling us that the new man is the Body and that the Body is the new man. In order to create this new man and to produce this Body, Christ abolished on the cross all ordinances, rituals, and different ways of living. Both the Jewish manner of life and the Gentile way of life have been abolished by Christ on the cross in order to create the one new man, the Body of Christ. In order for the Body to come into being, all the ordinances had to be done away with. All the different ways of living&#151;Jewish, British, American, Brazilian, Japanese, Chinese, Filipino&#151;must go. As long as we have the Chinese way of life, we do not have the Body. In New York there is a group of Chinese Christians who emphasize the fact that in their meetings they have a Chinese flavor. This is not the Body; it is a Chinese sect. Likewise, if we insist upon having an American flavor, we are an American sect, not the Body. In the Body there is no Jew or Greek, bond or free, but Christ is all in all.</P><P>According to the Bible, the ordinances are the various ways of living. It is very difficult for Jews to eat pork with Gentiles. All our ordinances must be abolished. This is for the Body. If all the ordinances are done away with, only Christ will remain. This matter of ordinances is not a simple, superficial matter. If some are bothered by the shouting in our meetings, it proves that they have certain ordinances. In their opinion, Christians should be silent in the meetings.</P><P>In 1932 I went with Brother Nee when he was invited to speak at a Southern Baptist seminary in China. That was my first experience attending a Pentecostal meeting. In that meeting some were jumping, some were shouting, and some were even rolling on the floor. I was very bothered; to me, it was like a circus with everybody doing something on his own. Eventually, the pastor rang a bell to stop the meeting, and Brother Nee gave a message on the prodigal son. After the meeting I said to Brother Nee, "I cannot tolerate such a meeting with all that shouting, jumping, and rolling." I thought that Brother Nee would be in full agreement with me. However, he said, "Brother, in the New Testament there are no ordinances telling us how we should meet." Although Brother Nee did not care for that type of meeting, he realized that there should not be any ordinances among Christians. If you are troubled by certain types of meetings, it indicates that you still have some ordinances. Although I might not participate in certain activities in a meeting, I would not be bothered about them. We need to give up our ordinances. On the cross Christ crucified all the ordinances. Therefore, we should not be troubled by them any longer.</P><P>If you still keep the ordinances, the Body disappears. As long as you have any ordinance, there can be no Body. We have seen that the Body issues out of Christ's transmission. In this transmission every ordinance is done away with. This matter of ordinances was a problem to Peter. On the day of Pentecost Peter was bold. But when it came to the matter of eating, he had difficulty, for he still observed the eating ordinances. In Acts 10:9 through 16 Peter saw a vision of a great sheet and heard a voice saying, "Rise, Peter; kill, and eat" (Acts 10:13). This voice seemed to be saying, "Peter, you should not keep your ordinance about eating. If you do, the Gentile believers will be cut off from the Body. You must give up your ordinance and eat what you never ate before."</P><P>We must not make any ordinances. If you know the Body, you will never keep any ordinance or be troubled by any practice. Every practice is permissible as long as there is no sin or idol involved in it. In order to have the proper Body life, we must abandon every ordinance. This, however, is not easy to do. For example, we like our way of meeting. Eventually our way of meeting becomes an ordinance. If we shout and others do not, or if we call on the Lord's name in a certain way and others do not, we may be troubled. According to our opinion, the more shouting and the more calling the better. No doubt we have received benefit from shouting and calling on the name of the Lord, but we must never make this an ordinance. Because we are in the Body, we should not have any ordinances.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JOINT-HEIRS, JOINT-BODY, JOINT-PARTAKERS</H2><P>The Body is also a matter of being joint-partakers (Eph. 3:6, Gk.). According to the Greek, the word "heirs" in Ephesians 3:6 should be rendered "joint-heirs." The same Greek word appears before the words rendered "body" and "partakers." Hence, we are joint-heirs, a joint-body, and joint-partakers. If we would have the Body, we must learn the lesson that the Body is such a joint matter. The more we are joined to others, the better. Never be isolated, for isolation is against the principle of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE UNIQUENESS OF THE BODY AND THE SPIRIT</H2><P>We have seen that Ephesians 4:4 says, "one body, and one Spirit." This verse not only reveals the uniqueness of the Body; it also shows that the one Body is determined by the one Spirit. Because there is one Spirit, there is one Body. There is not another Body because there is not another Spirit. We must keep the oneness, the unique oneness of the Body, because the Body and the Spirit are unique.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BODY BUILT UP BY THE MEMBERS</H2><P>In Ephesians 4:11 and 16 we see that although the Body is produced by the transmission of Christ, it is built up by the gifted persons, by the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. However, the Body is not built directly by the gifted persons; rather, it is built directly by all the members of the Body. Therefore, Ephesians 4:16 says that every part has a measure of function and that the Body is built up by the function of every part in love.</P><P>If we put together all the points we have seen in this message, we shall have a general view of the Body. The Body is produced by the transmission of Christ. In order to have the Body in practical reality, all the ordinances must be abolished. Furthermore, we must recognize that the Body is a joint matter and that it is altogether in the Spirit. If we have the Spirit, we have the Body. Because there is one Spirit, we are limited to having one Body. We are compelled to keep the oneness of the Body. The Body is now being built up through the gifted persons who perfect the members to function so that the Body may be built directly through them.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRACTICALITY OF THE BODY</H1><P>In the previous message we saw in the book of Ephesians four main aspects of the Body: that the Body comes into existence through the transmission of Christ; that the Body has been brought forth through the abolishing of all the ordinances; that the Body is a matter of our being joint-heirs and joint-partakers of the promise in Christ; and that the Body is a matter of the Spirit. The words "one body and one Spirit" indicate that the Body of Christ is wholly a matter of the Spirit. If we have the Spirit, we have the Body. In this message we shall see further, from 1 Corinthians 12, that the Body is a matter of the Spirit. In 1 Corinthians 12 the Body is covered in detail.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING BEING SPIRITUAL</H2><P>Many translators are troubled by 1 Corinthians 12:1. According to the King James Version, this verse says, "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant." In this verse the Apostle Paul uses the adjective form of the word pneuma, which means spirit. Some translations have added the word "gifts" after "spiritual" to make it read, "Concerning spiritual gifts." But this is not altogether accurate. If Paul had meant this, he would have added the word "gifts." Other translations say, "Concerning spiritual matters." This is better than "spiritual gifts," for when you use the word "gifts," you limit the matter to the realm of gifts. However, "spiritual matters" implies a larger realm, a broader scope. It includes not only gifts, but also other spiritual things. I prefer the rendering, "Concerning being spiritual." I believe that this was Paul's meaning in this chapter. Paul's meaning was that we all need to be spiritual, to be in the condition of being spiritual. It is possible to have the Spirit, but not to be spiritual at a particular time. Being spiritual is a practical matter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRACTICALITY OF THE BODY</H2><P>We all are members of the Body. But suppose when we come together as the Body, we come in a way that is careless, loose, and sloppy. If we all were like this, where would the Body be? Practically speaking, there would be no Body. The Body would be there doctrinally, but not practically. However, suppose when we gather together everyone is filled with the Spirit, bubbling, and saying, "O Lord Jesus. Jesus Christ is Lord. Oh, I'm so happy this morning! I have something to share of the Lord." This is an illustration of being spiritual. Whenever we come together as members of the Body, we must be spiritual in a practical way. But suppose no one prays, calls on the Lord, or stands up to give a word of testimony. In such a case we would not be spiritual in a practical way in the meeting.</P><P>As Paul was writing this chapter, he realized that when Christians gather together they need to be spiritual. Whenever we are spiritual, the gifts will be manifested, and many things will happen. If we are practically spiritual in the meetings of the church, both the spiritual gifts and other spiritual matters will be evident. In this way we shall have the Body in a practical way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING SPIRITUAL BY SPEAKING IN THE MEETINGS</H2><P>First Corinthians 12:2 says, "Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led." If you remain silent in the meetings, you are a dumb idol. But all the attendants at a church meeting must be very spiritual. To be spiritual means to be bubbling. This is the opposite of being dumb. As those attending the meetings of the churches, we need to make a joyful noise to the Lord. This noise should not be a performance; it should be spontaneous. In this verse Paul seemed to be saying to the Corinthians, "You were Gentiles, carried away to dumb idols in the idol temple. You were dumb and made no noise because you were worshipping dumb idols. Because the idols could make no noise, you did not make any sound either. But now when you come to the church meeting, you come to the living God, to the speaking God, not to a dumb idol. Therefore, you also must speak." To speak in the meetings is to be spiritual. But if you do not speak in the church meetings, it is an indication that you are not spiritual.</P><P>Suppose three brothers who live together in the brothers' house come to the meeting. In the meeting all three are dumb. When others pray, they do not even say amen, because they do not agree with their way of praying. When they get back home, they may speak about the meeting in a critical way. In the meeting they were dumb, but at home they are very talkative. These brothers definitely are not spiritual. However, in their own estimation they may be the most spiritual brothers in the church. Whether or not we are spiritual is tested by whether or not we speak in the meetings. Speaking in the meetings will make you spiritual.</P><P>Suppose these three brothers come to the meeting and lay aside their opinions. One says, "Lord Jesus, I love You." Simply by saying this much we all become spiritual. It means a great deal to utter something in the meeting. Hence, we all must learn to speak in the meetings. Do not be dumb. If you are dumb, it means that you worship a God who does not speak. Our God is the bubbling God, the speaking God, the One who speaks constantly. Whenever you speak concerning the Lord, you immediately release your spirit and increase your spiritual capacity.</P><P>The best way for the sisters to conquer their temper is to utter thanks and praise to the Lord in the meetings. But if the sisters are always silent in the meetings, they will find it easy to argue with their husbands at home after the meetings. If their husbands speak in the meetings, that will make them angry. But if the sisters speak in the meetings, they will be stirred up in their spirit and their temper will disappear.</P><P>To speak in the meetings is not an insignificant matter. By speaking we make the Body very practical. As a member of the Body, are you silent or bubbling? Are you one who is praising, shouting, and calling on the name of the Lord? If we all are like this, our meetings will be uplifted to the heavens. The most spiritual meeting is the meeting in which everyone speaks. In such a meeting everyone is nourished and edified.</P><P>However, when we are silent, we easily fall into our mind and begin to criticize others. Then it is easy to be in the self. When you are critical and in the self, you first kill yourself, then others, and then the meeting. Unsatisfied with this, you will go home and kill either your wife, husband, or roommate. Because certain brothers and sisters were silent in the meeting, the dumb idol got into them, and after the meeting they killed their wife or husband.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BODY EXISTING IN OUR SPEAKING</H2><P>We need to revolutionize our meetings by speaking. We are the Body. Nevertheless, many times the practical Body has disappeared due to our dumbness. But the Body will return in a practical way whenever we are bubbling. The Body is in our speaking, in our joyful noise. When we come together to make a joyful noise, the Body is present in a practical way. This is the Body in function. If we all function, the Body is present. But if we do not function, the Body is gone. The Body exists in our speaking.</P><P>First Corinthians 12:3 says, "Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say Lord Jesus, but in the Holy Spirit" (Gk.). In this verse we find a secret: if we do not speak, we are not in the Spirit. But if we speak, we are immediately in the Spirit. Whenever we say, "Lord Jesus," we are in the Spirit. If you do not believe this, I ask you to try it. It is easy to get into the Spirit. Simply say, "Lord Jesus," and you are in the Spirit.</P><P>First Corinthians 12 does not speak about the Body in doctrine, but about the Body in a practical way. There can be no Body if there is no practice in the Spirit. If we do not function, the Body is not present, because we are not being spiritual. But if we function, we are spiritual, and the Body is present. If we realize this and practice it, our meetings will be revolutionized. They will be full of joyful noise to the Lord. One may say, "Lord Jesus"; another, "Amen"; and another, "Praise the Lord." Still others will say, "Lord Jesus, I love You." Because some brothers and sisters are in the mind or the self, or are occupied by a dumb idol, they do not say anything in the meetings. We all must learn to be spiritual so that the Body may exist in a practical way. We all need to utter something and to function. The difficulty is that we are not accustomed to doing this because of the background and influence of today's Christianity. Nevertheless, I hope that we shall have a change. We need to be bubbling all the time, especially when we come together for the purpose of practicing the Body. Although we are the Body, the practicality of the Body is in our speaking.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GIFTS MANIFESTED IN OUR SPEAKING</H2><P>First Corinthians 12:4 says, "Now there are differences of gifts, but the same Spirit" (Gk.). How are these gifts manifested? They are not manifested by our silence, but by our speaking. We all must learn to speak something for the Lord. Whenever you speak, the gift will come forth. Many times I have received enlightenment as I was speaking. A number of times I have been compelled to speak by the brothers. According to my feeling, I had nothing to say. I did not even know what book, chapter, or verse to use. But as I began to speak, I received a word from the Lord. As you are speaking, you will sometimes say things of which you formerly had no understanding. Learn to utter something for the Lord. Then the gifts will be manifested.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GIFTS, MINISTRIES, AND OPERATIONS</H2><P>After mentioning the diversities of gifts in verse 4, Paul says in verses 5 and 6, "And there are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. And there are differences of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all" (Gk.). The gifts are by the Spirit, the ministries are of the Lord, and the operations are of God. Therefore, in these verses we have the Spirit, the Lord, and God. In Pentecostalism or in the charismatic movement we hear of the gifts, but not about ministries or operations. It seems that those in the charismatic movement know nothing about these things. The gifts are for the ministries, the ministries are for the operations, the workings, the functions, and the operations are for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose. In the church meetings we need the gifts, the ministries, and the operations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WORD OF WISDOM<br>AND THE WORD OF KNOWLEDGE</H2><P>In verses 8 through 10 the Apostle Paul lists nine gifts. But this does not mean that there are only nine gifts of the Spirit. There are more than these nine; however, Paul uses nine as illustrations. Often those in the Pentecostal movement or the charismatic movement ask if we have the manifestation of the gifts in our meetings. To them, gifts means speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues. When asked whether or not we have the gifts in our meetings, some brothers have answered incorrectly that we do not have them. But in the meetings we have a great deal of the manifestation of the gifts, especially of the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge. After these two gifts, Paul lists faith, healing, miracles, prophecy, the discerning of spirits, tongues, and the interpretation of tongues. By the order of the gifts in these verses, we see that those in the charismatic movement today make the tail the head and the head the tail. The first two gifts are not tongues and the interpretation of tongues; they are the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge. Because we often have the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge in our meetings, we must say that we have the manifestation of the gifts.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GIFT OF FAITH</H2><P>Let me say a word about the gift of faith, the third gift. Day by day we exercise our faith and speak in faith. If I had no faith, I would not be able to speak in the meetings. Sometimes others ask me why I am so bold. My answer is that I am bold because I exercise my faith. Because I have faith, I have the assurance that God will work and move according to the word spoken. Faith is very convincing. It gives us not only power, but also authority. In all our meetings we exercise at least three gifts: the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, and faith. In no other Christian group are these gifts manifested more than in our meetings.</P><P>If we do not speak, we shall not have the practice of the gifts. Of the nine gifts listed in 1 Corinthians 12, at least three&#151;the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, and prophecy&#151;are related to speaking. Again I say that we must all learn to utter something in the meetings. If we do this, the Body will be present. The Body exists in our being spiritual, and being spiritual means to speak something from our spirit. The Body is not practical until we are spiritual from within our spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE COMING FORTH OF THE BODY-CHRIST</H2><P>Verse 12 says, "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is the Christ" (Gk.). In this verse Paul brings in the concept that Christ is the Body. You may be familiar with the fact that in verse 12 we see the Body-Christ, the corporate Christ, not the individual Christ. Yes, we are the corporate Christ. However, if we are dumb when we gather together in the meetings, Christ has no way to come forth. He cannot come forth when we are silent. But when we are spiritual, speaking and functioning in the meetings, Christ comes out. When you speak for Christ, Christ comes forth in your speaking. If we all speak forth Christ, then the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ, will come forth. This is Christ as the Body. In order to have the Body-Christ, we all need to speak.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>POSITIONED TO DRINK OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Now we proceed to verse 13: "For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit" (Gk.). The Body has been formed by the baptism in the one Spirit. In one Spirit we all have been baptized into one Body. So many spiritual terms have been ruined by Christianity. When we speak of the baptism in the Spirit, some immediately associate this with speaking in tongues. But it is not necessary to speak in tongues in order to be in the Spirit. I have not spoken in tongues since 1937. But I can strongly testify that I have the deep sense that at this very moment I am in the Spirit. Are you bold enough to say that you are in the Spirit? We have the assurance that we are in the Spirit because one day, more than nineteen hundred years ago, we were all put, baptized, into the Spirit. Moreover, we have been made to drink of the one Spirit. We have been positioned to drink of the Spirit. As long as we are in the Spirit, we are positioned to drink of the Spirit. For example, everyone who is in the water has been positioned to drink the water. Praise the Lord that we are all in the Spirit and have been positioned to drink of the Spirit!</P><P>The way to drink of the Spirit is found in verse 3: "No man can say Lord Jesus, but in the Holy Spirit" (Gk.). Whenever you say, "Lord Jesus," you are drinking. The more you say this, the more you drink. When we come together, we must call on the name of the Lord so that we may drink of the one Spirit. Then we shall be bubbling, speaking, uttering something for the Lord, and making a joyful noise to the Lord. If we do this, the Body will be among us in a practical way through our practice of being spiritual.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE FUNCTIONING<br>OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE BODY</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DRINKING BY SPEAKING</H2><P>First Corinthians 12:13 says that in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body and that we were all made to drink of one Spirit. If we consider this verse in the light of verses 3 through 12, we shall see that to drink is both to call on the name of the Lord and to speak. When we speak, we drink. The baptism into the one Body, which transpired nearly two thousand years ago, has positioned us all to drink. Practically speaking, to drink is to function, to call on the name of the Lord, and to utter something for the Body. If you do not speak in the meeting, you cannot drink. Apparently, when we speak, we are speaking something out; actually, we are drinking, taking something in. The more I speak, the more I drink. This is the reason I am satisfied after speaking in the meeting. Probably you have often had the sense in the meeting to say something; but because you were cautious, the opportunity was lost, and you went home defeated, feeling like a deflated tire. However, we can also testify that when we speak in the meeting, we return home in triumph. This indicates that if we speak in the meetings, we are drinking as we speak. As we speak out, we drink in. Our speaking is our drinking. Thus, we all need to learn to speak in the meetings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OF THE BODY</H2><P>First Corinthians 12:15 and 16 say, "If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?" We need to understand Paul's intention in writing these words. Many Christians, members of the Body, have the concept that they are not as good or as high as others. For example, we may think that our hands are better than our feet. Suppose one of the members of the Body who is a foot says, "I am just a poor foot, not a beautiful hand. Therefore, I am not of the Body." This is a form of self-despising. I know that in their hearts many saints despise themselves and say, "I am not that good. The Lord didn't give me five talents or two talents. I'm not sure He even gave me one full talent. Because I am so poor, I don't need to function." Those who feel this way may consider that they are not of the Body. When they come to the meetings, they act like outsiders or spectators. They do not join in the Body activity. Hence, Paul's intention in these verses is to tell those who, outwardly speaking, may seem inferior to others not to despise themselves. Such members should not say that they are not of the Body.</P><P>After referring to the foot and the hand, Paul speaks of the ears and the eyes. Comparatively speaking, the eyes are more excellent than the ears. When you look at a person's face, you look firstly at his eyes, not at his ears. Just as the feet are apparently inferior to the hands, so the ears seemingly are inferior to the eyes. In the Body, some are the feet, and others are the ears. Both may consider themselves inferior to other members. Some among us hold this concept and say, "I am not as smart as Brother So-and-so. There is no need for me to say anything in the meeting. Even if I did speak, I could not speak well. Thus, I am excused from functioning."</P><P>In my experience throughout the years, I have come to know the psychology of the saints. Some of the sisters say, "We are the weaker vessels. In the meetings, the brothers should be the ones to bear the responsibility because they are the stronger ones." Others may excuse themselves as being too old, too young, or too shy. For this reason, only a few, such as the hands and the eyes, function in the meetings. The reason so many do not function is that they consider themselves inferior. If they are a foot, they view themselves as inferior to the hand. If they are an ear, they see themselves as inferior to the eyes. Thus, they do not function. It seems that their not functioning is humility; actually it is a form of pride. Some feel that if they cannot say something outstanding, with an utterance better than that of the Apostle Paul, they will not say anything at all.</P><P>We all need to be converted and become like little children who gradually learn to speak without any consciousness of being smart or dumb. One of my little grandchildren talked all day long, although hardly anyone understood what he was saying. It was even difficult to tell what language he was speaking. But day by day his speaking improved. At first, not one word was right. But gradually he began to use the right words. Now he speaks better English than I do. All the saints must learn to speak in the meetings, even if they seem at times to speak nonsense. Of course, I do not encourage anyone to speak nonsense intentionally. We in the church are a family, not a graduate school where everyone is studying for a master's degree or a doctoral degree. Most of us are still in kindergarten or even in nursery school. Some are in elementary school, others in junior high or high school, and a few are on a college level. The church is not an army&#151;it is a family, a body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED FOR ALL TO FUNCTION</H2><P>Do not say that you are not of the Body. To say, "I am not of the Body," means that you feel you do not need to function. For the foot to say, "Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body," means that the foot has no need to function. In this portion of the Word, not to be of the Body means not to function. Many of us, perhaps eight out of ten, are like this. Many think that because they are not talented or gifted, they do not need to function. This means that they consider themselves not of the Body. As many sit in the meetings, they have this concept. They may deny it, but deep within they say, "I am not an elder, so I don't need to do anything in the meeting." Although you may not be as gifted as the elders, you are still a member of the Body. You cannot say that you are nothing. If you are not a hand, at least you are a little finger. Therefore, you must be of the Body, that is, you must function in the meetings.</P><P>When we come to the meetings, we should be like basketball players. However, when certain saints come, they come not as players, but as spectators. Those who behave like spectators feel that they are not of the team, not of the Body. But all of us are on the team. Therefore, when we come to the meetings, we must come as players expecting to play in the game. We need to be adjusted in this matter. Some of the sisters may say, "I am not that smart or gifted. There is no need for me to function." It seems that these sisters are not of the Body. They are of the Body, but considering themselves inferior to others, they do not function. They say, "I am just a poor foot. No one pays attention to me. Those who are the eyes or the hands may go ahead and make a show. I prefer to stay aside." Do not think like this. No matter how inferior you may seem to be when compared to others, you must still be proud of what you are. The foot should say, "I may sometimes give off an unpleasant odor, but if I don't walk, the body has no way to walk. If I don't touch the earth, how can the body touch the earth? I am proud of being a foot." Likewise, the ear needs to say, "I am proud of being an ear. If I don't hear, the body cannot hear." Members like the feet and the ears must learn to be proud and uplift themselves. Although the religious ones may be troubled to hear that some of the members of the Body need to be proud, this is nonetheless quite necessary. However, if the members become too proud, they will then need to be humbled.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BODY TEMPERED TOGETHER</H2><P>In verse 24 Paul says, "God hath tempered the body together." The word "tempered" in this verse is very significant. Sometimes the Lord will allow you to become proud. But if you are too proud, He will humble you. To temper something is firstly to heat it up and then to cool it down, as a blacksmith does when making an iron fitting. In order to make the steel stronger, he first heats the metal and then puts it into cold water. This is tempering. Likewise God has tempered the Body. If you are not able to help people to be proud, you are not a good minister. I encourage you all to be proud. Say, "Praise the Lord that I am a wonderful foot!" But after I have helped you to become proud, I shall put you into cold water. Some religious pastors always tell people to be humble. But so many of you despise yourselves and are in bondage to your self-made humility. I want to dig you out of your graves of humility and help you soar in the air. I would like to teach you to be proud. However, after soaring in the air for a while, you will need to be put into a cage. This is not pleasant, but it is necessary. Do not say that because you are not a hand, but a foot, you are not of the Body and do not need to function. You must be proud of what you are. Do not despise yourself or nourish any self-made humility.</P><P>The Apostle Paul was wise. After speaking of the self-despising members, he says, "And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you" (v. 21). For the eye to say that it does not need the hand is pride. For the foot to say, "Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body," is self-made humility. In its pride, the eye may think that it is excellent and marvelous and that it has no need for the hand. But the eye should never say to the hand, "I have no need of you." Neither should the head say to the feet, "I have no need of you." Because the head is on top, and the feet are on the bottom, the head may be very proud and think that it has no need of the feet. First Paul deals with those who are humble, then with those who are proud. Both are wrong, and both need tempering. Thus, God has tempered the Body, uplifting the low ones and lowering the high ones. He causes the humble to be proud and the proud to be humble. If you are among the humble ones, you should not say that you are not of the Body. And if you are among the proud ones, you should not say that you do not need the other members. As the Body is tempered together, eventually the lower ones will be tempered to be somewhat higher, and the higher ones will be tempered to be somewhat lower. When this takes place, we all shall function, and the Body will come into existence in a practical way.</P><P>In today's Christian meetings the Body is not present in actuality. Many of the lower ones consider themselves not of the Body, and many of the higher ones think that they do not need others. It seems that they themselves can be the entire Body. Therefore, we all must be tempered. Those who do not function must learn to function, and those who function more than they should must learn not to function too much. In one of the meetings in Anaheim, I said that I was tired of hearing certain ones speak so much in the meetings. Because the lower ones often think that they are not of the Body, and the higher ones often consider that they do not need others, in the meetings the higher ones may make a display of themselves. That is not the display of the Body. If only a few members function in the meetings, we do not have the Body in a practical way. However, those who do not function should not blame those who do. Instead of considering themselves not of the Body, they must be encouraged to be stronger and more aggressive than those who do function often. They should not allow the elders to be the only ones to function. If I ask the elders in a particular church why they function so much, they may say, "Brother Lee, we are suffering as we wait for others to function. So many of the other members do not bear their burden. They come to the meeting to enjoy a time of rest." Thus, both those who function a great deal and those who do not function at all are wrong. This is the reason we may not have the Body expressed in our meetings. Instead, we have a display of a few who function often. Many of the saints are not spiritual in the meetings. They sit there without functioning, perhaps criticizing others. Therefore, we do not have the Body in a practical way. From now on, the least among us must function and be bubbling all the time.</P><P>We should be neither proud nor humble. Rather, we all need to be tempered. God has tempered the Body. There are neither cold ones nor hot ones, but all have been tempered. The Body is one, but the members are on different levels, just as the members of our physical body are on different levels beneath the head. But the members on every level are needed. When all the members function, we have the Body in actuality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WHOLE BODY FUNCTIONING</H2><P>If everyone in the meetings were a Paul, a Peter, or a John, that would be terrible. If everyone were a spiritual giant, I doubt that we could have a meeting. God does not gather so many giants together. There are just two shoulders in the body. Suppose, however, that the fingers, the thumbs, and the ears are all shoulders. What kind of body would that be? Do not dream that everyone in the local church will be a strong shoulder. To use another illustration, the local churches should be flocks of lambs. In these flocks we do not need large donkeys or even big cows. Instead, we all should be little lambs. In the various localities we need to have flocks. Then if we all as the "lambs," the members of the Body, function, we shall have the Body. The Body exists in the functioning of all the members. Whenever I speak, my whole body functions. If my mouth were detached from my body, it would not be able to function. We all need to learn that we are members of the Body. Do not say that you are not of the Body. You need to say, "Praise the Lord that I am of the Body! I am proud of the fact that I am part of the Body."</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>EXERCISING TO PRACTICE THE BODY LIFE</H1><P>Today in any Christian group there may be two categories of people: the self-despising ones and the proud ones. Those who despise themselves think that they are nothing. As a result, they do not count themselves as part of the Body, and they do not function. The proud ones, to the contrary, consider themselves superior to others and seem to say, "I don't need anyone else. I can do everything myself." This combination of humility and pride is the source of the clergy and the laity. Those in the clergy class think they can do everything and that they do not need others. But those among the laity think that they are nothing and that they cannot do anything. By means of this subtlety, the Body life has been killed. This is the reason we do not see the Body function in today's Christian meetings. Instead, we see those in the class of the clergy doing everything. What a poor situation! Because we came from a background where there was the clergy and the laity and because we are still surrounded by this system today, we may not realize how ugly it is. Rather, we have been drugged to such an extent that we think such a situation is normal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EVERYONE NEEDING TO FUNCTION</H2><P>In the meetings of the church everyone must function, including the young ones, the new ones, and the weak ones. However, thinking that it is a waste of time for those who are new, young, or weak to function in the meetings, we may say, "What can the weaker ones do? What help can be rendered by the new ones or the young ones? It is better for them to be quiet. Let them save the time for those who are able to do something." Our thinking has been saturated with this concept. This indicates that we have been drugged and do not have a proper sense regarding the function of the members of the Body.</P><P>When I speak, nearly every member of my body functions. It is not true that only my mouth speaks and that the rest of the members have nothing to do. As my mouth speaks, my whole body participates in the speaking. For example, my hands make certain gestures, and my shoulders move. Every part of my body is functioning. I am not a machine with a speaking mechanism called the mouth. When a mechanical mouth speaks, the other parts of the machine do not participate in the speaking. Because my mouth is a living part of my body, my entire body functions whenever I speak.</P><P>Even in some meetings in the Lord's recovery, the situation still is not normal. Instead, due to the background and influence of Christianity, the situation is quite abnormal. Again I say, with respect to the matter of the functioning of the members of the Body, we all have been drugged. The purpose of these messages is not to give you doctrine; it is to minister a de-drugging word to you. All of us, including me, need to be de-drugged. I was born, raised, and educated in Christianity. Because of this influence, at times I have said, "These people are too young. They don't have anything to share with the saints. It is better for them to be quiet in the meeting." This concept is wrong. The Body moves with all the members. Thus, from now on we must pray, "Lord, grant that whenever we meet together we shall have the move of the whole Body." What a difference it makes when all the Body moves!</P><P>Due to our religious background, we may have the attitude that a certain meeting is not our meeting. This is the reason some saints have said to me, "Brother Lee, tonight's meeting is your meeting." This means that I am the one to run the show. How much we have been drugged! There is no meeting that is the domain of anyone in particular. All the meetings, even the ministry meetings, are the meetings of the saints. If you say that a certain meeting is my meeting, I would reply that it is not only my meeting, but also your meeting. Whenever we Christian brothers and sisters gather together, we are the Body. The Body is in our gathering. However, if we are not spiritual in a practical way in our gathering together, if we are not exercising the functioning spirit, the Body will not actually be found among us. When the saints gather together without being spiritual according to the exercise of the functioning spirits, such a gathering will be a gathering of dumb idols. But if we come together exercising our spirit and ready to function, we shall be like players on a basketball team. Everyone will participate as a member of the team. Then we shall have the Body. We need to be rescued from the fallen situation of Christianity. In the Lord's recovery we are being brought back to the beginning. In the beginning, when Christians came together, they all functioned. Today, however, we have been drugged. Thus, we all must exercise ourselves to function. Even the youngest ones and the weakest ones must also function.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A CONSTITUTION OF ALL AGES</H2><P>In his wisdom Paul touched the real problem of the practical Body life&#151;the matter of the self-despising ones considering themselves inferior to others. Many of you still hold the concept that you are inferior to others. Moreover, some of the older ones think that they are out-of-date. Although they may not say this, such a subconscious thought is nonetheless within them. As you know, throughout the years my burden has been to promote the young people and to raise them up. This has caused some of the older ones to think that they are no longer needed. Hence, they have become deeply disappointed. Some of the older ones have said, "I have been in the Lord's recovery from the beginning. Now it seems that, according to Brother Lee's concept, all the older ones are through. He will not use the older ones on his team. We cannot learn the languages to go to Europe. In particular, we could never learn Hebrew to go to Jerusalem to have the church life there in preparation for the Lord's coming back." Because of this feeling of disappointment, some of the older ones consider themselves as only good for retirement. However, so many of the older ones are still eager to be trained. On the one hand, some older ones are disappointed; on the other hand, many older ones are still eager to be trained to be useful in the recovery. The Body is the Body. The young people are not the whole Body. Rather, they are simply part of the Body.</P><P>It is difficult for the older ones to contact young people on the campuses. If I, an elderly person, were to go to the campuses, the young people would not be interested in talking to me. People gather together according to age. For example, it is difficult for a child of twelve to play with a child of five. The five-year-old would prefer to associate with those of his own age. The same is true of the twelve-year-old. For this reason, the older ones are not useful for going to the campus to contact young people. The Body, however, is not composed only of young ones. Although the older ones are not suitable for work on the campus, they are the ones to bear the burden to pray for the young people. However, it would be very difficult for the young people to stay home and pray, because they are eager to get on the campus and contact people. The matter of praying for the work on the campuses is a function of the older ones.</P><P>I use this one illustration to point out that the Body is not composed of just one class of people. On the contrary, it is a composition of many age groups. The young people should be strong and aggressive to work on the campuses. But the older ones need to be very exercised to pray for the young people. Furthermore, the older ones can invite all the young laborers to their homes for dinner. However, if the older ones gossip and complain about being useless, our situation will be pitiful, and we shall not have the Body. But I believe that many will say, "Praise the Lord for raising up so many young people! The Lord is using them for the work on the campuses. Let us pray for them and let us do certain practical things to help them." If this is the situation, the whole Body will be moving toward the goal of gaining this generation.</P><P>In all of the meetings, including the meetings of the ministry, all the saints need to exercise together. If you are indifferent or dissenting while I am speaking, it will be difficult for me to speak, and my speaking will be weakened and lack weight. However, if you exercise yourself to function as a member of the Body and use your spirit and your whole being to participate in my speaking, my speaking will be strengthened and become weighty. It will not simply be the speaking of the mouth, but the speaking of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY OF THE FUNCTIONING SPIRIT</H2><P>In these days we have a definite goal. This goal is to carry out the Lord's recovery. One of the main things to be recovered is the functioning spirit. We all, including the new ones, the young ones, the weak ones, and the old ones, need to be restored to the functioning spirit. Now is the time for us to come together to function. We all are players on the team; none of us is a spectator. If we gather together with the burden to function and with the attitude that we are players on the team, the meetings will be greatly uplifted, and the enemy will be driven away. Everyone who attends such a meeting will be subdued and convinced. The visitors will say, "How different this is from Christianity! This meeting is different from any kind of gathering I have attended before." All the church meetings must be like this. It is not a matter of a good speaker; it is a matter of the functioning of all the members.</P><P>We all need to be recovered back to the functioning spirit, back to the genuine practice of being spiritual. To be spiritual is to exercise the functioning spirit. We need to be stirred up to hate our habit of not functioning. If you function even a little in the meetings, your spirit will be stirred up, and you will be nourished, strengthened, and refreshed. When you go home, you will realize what a difference it makes to function in the meetings. But if because you are so cautious you do not function, you will sense when you return home that you are lacking in inward strength. Furthermore, you will not have the sense of inner satisfaction. Functioning in the meetings has a great effect on our daily living. Whenever you function in a meeting, no matter whether the meeting is high or low, rich or poor, that meeting is rich to you. However, if you do not function in the meeting, that meeting will be poor to you. Whether a meeting is rich or poor as far as you are concerned depends on whether or not you function in that meeting. If you function, you will be strengthened, refreshed, and stirred up. But if you do not function, the meeting will not be meaningful to you. This can be proved in our experience. If we all function in the meetings, we shall all experience a rich meeting.</P><P>How good it would be if in our meetings there were no particular speaker, but every one was a speaker! People often ask who the speaker will be in the meeting. From now on, when you are asked about the speaker, you need to answer, "I am the speaker." If the person does not believe you, tell him, "Come and see. I will stand up to speak and I will speak especially to you." We all must be prepared to say that we are the speaker in the meeting. How wonderful this would be! We need to drive away the old influence of Christianity from our meetings. We should have no clergy or laity, but the functioning of all the members of the Body.</P><P>The functioning of all the members depends on two things. First, the inferior ones should not despise themselves or be humble; rather they must learn to be aggressive. Second, the superior ones must learn to be limited. They should not think that they can do everything, but realize that they need others. If we learn these lessons, the Body will be tempered together, and there will be a proper balance. This is what we need for the genuine Body life.</P><P>Once I was invited to a certain group that supposedly had the Body ministry. But what this group meant by Body ministry was to have several speakers instead of one. I told them that this certainly was not the Body. To have several speakers does not mean that you have the Body, for the Body is not made up of several members, but of all the members. Consider how many members there are in your body. Eventually, that group began to realize that they did not truly have the Body ministry.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ADORNING THE LESS HONORABLE MEMBERS</H2><P>Let us now consider 1 Corinthians 12:22 and 23. These verses say, "Nay, much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble, are necessary. And those members of the body, which we think to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness" (Gk.). What are the members which we think to be less honorable and which we clothe with more abundant honor? As you consider your own body, do you know what members these are? Those members of the body which seem to be less honorable are the feet. In 1948 I was staying with Brother Nee in his hometown. At a certain point in our conversation, he said, "Witness, the more cultured people are, the more they adorn their feet. Whether your culture is high or low is indicated by the way you adorn your feet. You northerners have higher culture than the southerners. You never go around with bare feet. Rather, you beautify them with socks and shoes." I replied, "Brother Nee, the northerners adorn their feet because the weather there is cold. The southerners may simply wear a pair of slippers because the weather here is usually very warm." Brother Nee replied, "No, don't say this. Even among the southerners, the highly cultured people do not go around with bare feet. They always spend money to beautify their feet."</P><P>One day I was reading 1 Corinthians 12:21, where Paul says that the head cannot say to the feet, "I have no need of you." The head should not say, "Feet, because you are so low, I don't need you." Because the feet are so low, they need more adornment. Suppose I were fully dressed with a suit and tie, but had no shoes and socks on. Would you not say that it was shameful for me to be barefooted? However, you would not consider it shameful for my head or my hands to be uncovered. This indicates that the feet are the less honorable members of the body. Because they are less honorable than the other members, we need to adorn them properly.</P><P>However, we often damage the principle of the Body by adorning the head with many "hats," but not caring for the lower members, the feet. We need to bestow more honor on the feet. From now on, in all the churches and in all the meetings we must learn to clothe the lower members with more honor. Do not buy more "hats" for the head. Instead, purchase "shoes" for the adornment of the feet so that you may beautify these less honorable parts of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HONORING THOSE WHO SPEAK HALTINGLY</H2><P>Today, however, we often follow the despicable practice of crowning the eloquent speakers with honor. Sisters admire eloquence. Certain sisters may place several crowns upon the head of an eloquent one. If I were an eloquent speaker and my speech were like music, the sisters would find it entertaining and would say, "Let us go to hear Brother Lee. His speaking is so pleasant." All the sisters would purchase crowns for me. But suppose I spoke in a very halting way. Finding listening to me unbearable, everyone would want me to sit down. Instead of clothing me with honor, they would deprive me of whatever adornment I had for my uncomely feet. They would strip me in order to suppress me from speaking in the meetings. Nevertheless, we must thank God that He has brought so many halting speakers into the church. Which do you prefer&#151;the head or the feet? Throughout the years of the church life in California, we have not spent a penny to adorn the head. However, we have spent a great deal to buy socks and shoes to beautify the feet. This is precisely Paul's meaning when he says that the members that seem to be less honorable are clothed with more abundant honor.</P><P>We all need to learn to exercise ourselves as the Body. From now on, we should no longer regard eloquence so highly. Instead, we should honor those who speak haltingly. When you hear this, you may say, "Brother Lee, this is too difficult. Eloquence is so sweet and musical. But I cannot tolerate listening to halting speech." If you cannot tolerate it, it is an indication that you are natural and not spiritual. In the Body life every member is needed. In order to have the church life, the Body life, we need all the members. The services in Christianity today are a form of entertainment. Both the singers and the speakers entertain the congregation. In the seminaries men are taught to speak eloquently and are taught how to attract people and to entertain them. What a shame it is to speak eloquently to entertain people! We are not here for this. Instead, we must either crucify people or resurrect them. Instead of entertainment, we have the experience of the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPEAKING THAT EXPRESSES CHRIST</H2><P>Eloquence does not express Christ. On the contrary, an eloquent sermon is a form of entertainment. If we exercise to have the practice of the Body, so many halting ones will begin to speak. If the members exercise their spirit to be spiritual and to speak for Christ, something of Christ will be manifested, although their speaking will not be eloquent. This is the Body. For the long run, we need meetings filled with speaking that is not eloquent, yet speaking through which Christ is expressed. This kind of meeting edifies the saints and builds them up. We all need a change of taste. We are accustomed to a diet of eloquence and musical messages. What we need now are words spoken haltingly that manifest Christ. I believe that this is Paul's meaning in this portion of the Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ELOQUENCE CAUSING DIVISION</H2><P>According to our natural concept, we admire eloquent speakers. But to admire eloquence is to damage the Body. This is the reason God has had to temper the Body together. I thank God that He has been tempering the Body. He has humbled the eloquent speakers, and He has raised up the halting ones to speak for Him in order that there should be no division in the Body. In today's Christianity there is division everywhere. Most of these divisions have been caused by eloquent speakers. Every eloquent speaker will draw a group to himself. Those who admire various kinds of musical speech will gather around the eloquent ones. I do not appreciate such "music." Instead, I prefer to listen to the little ones speaking in a halting way. We in the church life must no longer exalt eloquence, because the eloquent speakers create division and draw a following. In Christianity today there is a great deal of competition in speaking. Whoever is an outstanding speaker will have a large following. But this will cause a big division. This trend still influences the churches. Thus, we must rise up to oppose it and learn how to adorn the less honorable ones, the ones who speak haltingly. We need to say, "Praise the Lord for this brother! He speaks haltingly, but he has a life-giving matter to share with us. We wish to adorn him, beautify him, and honor him." This is the Body life.</P><P>In these messages I am not teaching you mere doctrines. I am passing on to you what I have learned through the years so that we may have the proper Body life. Suppose an eloquent speaker comes into the meeting. Will you still admire him? If you do, it means that there is no Body life. Rather, by admiring the eloquent one you create a division and kill the Body. You will help to produce an atmosphere in which those who cannot speak well will be despised. We should not give so many crowns of honor to the eloquent speakers. Rather, we need to buy shoes to adorn the halting and stammering ones. We need to encourage the less honorable members to speak again and again. This will build up the Body life and establish the genuine Body ministry. In the long run, eloquent speakers damage the Body life, but the halting speakers build it up. This is utterly different from the practice in today's Christianity, and it absolutely contradicts our natural concept. Nevertheless, for the sake of the proper Body life, we must all learn this lesson.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE MUTUAL CARE OF THE MEMBERS<br>AND THE SPIRITUAL GIFTS</H1><P>In 1 Corinthians 12 Paul deals with those who have an inferiority complex and those who have a superiority complex. These two complexes are the source of today's Christianity. Because many Christians consider themselves inferior to others, they do not do anything in the meetings. But some think of themselves as superior to others and like to dominate, to maneuver, and to do everything for the whole Body. These two things, the inferiority complex and the superiority complex, kill the Body. In this portion of the Word, Paul is doing his best to lower those with a superiority complex and to uplift those with an inferiority complex. In other words, Paul is tempering the Body. This is exactly what the Lord is doing today in the church life. Because the Lord is tempering the Body, in the church life we need to adorn the uncomely parts of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THOSE WHO SEEM TO BE MORE FEEBLE</H2><P>In 1 Corinthians 12:22 Paul speaks of "those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble." Perhaps you are wondering what these weaker members are. Certainly the head cannot be considered a weaker part of the body. Neither should we consider the eyes or the ears weaker parts. The weaker members are the fingers and the toes. Our toes help us to walk. If our toes did not function, we would find walking very awkward. Although the toes help us to walk, they are nonetheless the more feeble members, the weaker members. I also appreciate all my fingers, even the little finger, which renders me very valuable service. Now we can see what the Apostle Paul meant when he said that the weaker parts are necessary.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TEMPERING OF THE BODY</H2><P>As Paul was writing 1 Corinthians 12, he was under divine inspiration. Every word he used was very economical. Thus, we should not read this chapter in a casual way or consider it merely an illustration. If we probe into this section of the Word, we shall come to realize what the practical Body life is. It is not simply a matter of the gathering together of Christians. It is possible for Christians to gather together, yet still not have the practical Body life. As we pointed out in a previous message, we must be spiritual in order for the Body to be practical. According to 1 Corinthians 12, to be spiritual is to function. If we do not function, the Body does not exist in a practical way. There may be a gathering of Christians, but the Body is not present among them. The practicality of the Body is found in the functioning of the members. To function is to be genuinely spiritual. No matter how strong or weak you may be, you are not spiritual if you sit quietly in the meetings. However, if you are so strong that you function too much in the gatherings, you are not spiritual either. The weaker ones must function more, and the stronger ones must be somewhat limited. To be genuinely spiritual means that all the weaker ones must function and that all the stronger ones must be limited to a certain extent. This is the tempering of the Body. Through this process of tempering, we have the Body in a practical way.</P><P>If we have seen this vision and compare it with the situation in today's Christianity, we shall have to admit that in Christianity there is virtually no Body. On the one hand, many do not function at all; on the other hand, a few do everything. That is not the Body. Only when every part of the Body participates in the present activities of the Body does the Body exist in a practical way. Only then is it a Body in practicality, not in theory. For example, all the members of my body share in whatever my body does. The Lord will not have His recovery in full until He recovers His church to be such a Body. Among us today, the recovery is not yet in full because we do not yet have the Body in a full way. Although our situation has improved, we do not yet have the Body in fullness. The majority still are not spiritual in our gatherings, that is, they are not functioning. Rather, they have an inferiority complex and think that they are not useful. Because they compare themselves with other members, they keep themselves down.</P><P>Often those who give eloquent testimonies may discourage others from testifying. If you are eloquent, perhaps you should limit yourself and even speak in a halting way so that others will not be frustrated. Our speaking in the meetings should pave the way for others to follow us. Most gifted speakers, however, are so elevated that others cannot reach them. Their desire to be the best is a frustration to others who compare themselves with them. This is of the flesh, and it kills the Body life. By the Lord's mercy and grace, we all must learn both how to be tempered and how to temper.</P><P>When I am with my little granddaughter, I like to lower myself down to her level. If I did not lower myself down to her to where she is, she would be afraid of me or unhappy to be with me. But when I lower myself down to play with her, she comes up, sometimes climbing on my shoulder. Because I lower myself down, she and I, a little girl and her old grandfather, can play together and even be a good team. This is a picture of the Body life. We all need to learn to come down to the level of the low ones, and the low ones need to learn to climb on the shoulder of the higher ones, to become even higher than the high ones. This is the tempering of the Body, the real practice of the Body life. In 1 Corinthians 12 the Apostle Paul was tempering the Body. This is the secret of the practical Body life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED FOR MUTUAL CARE</H2><P>At this point, I would like to say a word about mutuality. In verse 25 Paul says, "The members should have mutual care one for another" (Gk.). In the Body we must have a mutual care for one another. Paul goes on to say, "And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it" (v. 26). This is mutual care. We need to learn to have such a mutual care not only in our private life, home life, and daily life, but also in the meetings. I need to care for you, and you need to care for me. If I speak often and you do not speak at all, it is an indication that you do not care for me. To exercise mutual care means to speak in the meetings. If you speak in the meetings, it means you have mercy on me. Often the elders are cruel and merciless to me, for they sit in the meeting and expect me to do everything. Thus, I have frequently said, "Brothers, please be merciful to me and do something. Suppose we are members of a team. If I am the only one who plays in the game and you do not play, you are very cruel to me. But if you have mercy on me, you will care for me."</P><P>Those who do not function in the meetings are cruel; they have no mercy on others. Some brothers desire to be elders. Because they have never been an elder, the thought of eldership is so pleasant to them. But if they were to get into the yoke of eldership, they would see how demanding it is. For this reason, many elders desire to be released from the yoke of eldership. Most of the saints in the churches are cruel and merciless to the elders in that they do not help to bear the burden in the meetings. In the meetings, they allow the whole burden, perhaps many tons in weight, to rest upon the elders. Some saints seem to have even made a secret agreement not to alleviate the suffering of the elders. Perhaps an elder's wife is the only one who has mercy on him. Therefore, the elders suffer in the meetings. In some meetings the elders bear such a heavy burden that they are slaughtered. This indicates the lack of mutual care.</P><P>However, sometimes the elders do not exercise mutual care either, for they may dominate the meeting and maneuver it. Although some elders are suffering, others are enjoying their maneuvering of the meeting. All the saints are little "lambs," but these elders are big "donkeys." This is a very serious matter, because such maneuvering annuls the Body life. Instead of the Body life, there is the display of the activity of one "donkey." Once again we see that for the practicality of the Body life we must exercise mutual care.</P><P>Often in the meetings I have had the burden to call a hymn or to offer praise or a prayer. But because I was caring for others, I did not do so. I did not want to maneuver the meeting or be a "donkey" among "lambs." Some elders, however, are such big "donkeys" that in the meeting you can see no one but them. This is a sign of the absence of mutual care. When the Body is manifested in a church meeting in a practical way, the mutual care will be seen. Both in our private life and in our meeting life, we must practice this mutual care. We must care for others and create a situation which encourages all to function. Then we shall have the Body life in a practical way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PAUL'S LISTING OF THE SPIRITUAL GIFTS</H2><P>Verse 28 says, "And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues." This verse does not say, "God hath set some in the church, first tongues, secondarily interpretation of tongues, thirdly healings, and after this miracles and lastly prophets." In Paul's arrangement tongues is the last item on the list. This means that it is the tail. The Bible is economical, and Paul's words are very meaningful. Nevertheless, when necessary, the Bible is repetitious. Thus, after listing various items in verse 28, Paul continued in verses 29 and 30 by giving another list: "Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?" In these verses the last items are tongues and the interpretation of tongues. As we have pointed out, in verses 8 through 10 tongues and interpretation are also ranked last. In this chapter there are three lists, and in each list tongues and interpretation are the last items. However, those who advocate tongues speaking today have turned the situation upside down. They have made the tail the head, and the head the tail. In fact, today speaking in tongues has been made not only the head, but even the whole body. According to some, nothing is more important than speaking in tongues. This is certainly an extreme.</P><P>In 1 Corinthians 12 Paul is tempering the Body. As we have seen, to temper the Body is firstly to uplift the inferior ones and then to lower the superior ones. Furthermore, it is to encourage the weaker ones and to adorn the uncomely ones with more honor. Finally, to temper the Body is to practice mutual care. These five matters are basic; they are not insignificant items. In all the churches we need to uplift the inferior ones and to somewhat limit the superior ones. We need to strengthen and encourage the weaker ones and to adorn the uncomely ones. We need to make more shoes for the feet, not crowns for the head. Certain saints have had the habit of crowning others, especially those regarded as heroes. From now on, we should not have any heroes, and we should not crown anyone. In all the churches we must make more shoes to adorn the uncomely members. If, along with all this, we practice the mutual care, we shall have the Body in a practical way.</P><P>Because the Apostle Paul knew the trouble, the disease, in the church at Corinth, he dealt with the matter of the miraculous things. We all are curious concerning miracles, and we like to see miraculous things. Suppose a sister could float in the air. We all would be attracted by this and would have no heart to listen to a heavy message on the Spirit of holiness or the Spirit of life. Although we appreciate miracles very much, the Apostle Paul took the lead to tear down this fascination with miracles. I would follow him to do the same thing.</P><P>In verse 27 Paul said, "Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in part" (Gk.). The Body is not made up of giants. Rather, it is a composition of many members: strong ones and weak ones, big ones and small ones, comely ones and uncomely ones. Every member of the Body is needed. This is the Body.</P><P>Then Paul proceeded to say, "And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues" (v. 28). Notice that Paul did not say "fourthly." After speaking of teachers, he discontinues the numerical sequence. This indicates that the first three&#151;the apostles, the prophets, and the teachers&#151;are the most important. Only these three are worthy of being numbered. After that, nothing else is worth numbering. The three that are numbered are all related to speaking. Moreover, none of these functions is miraculous. Some may say that a miraculous element is involved in prophesying. If you have this concept, it is an indication that you do not know the meaning of prophecy in the New Testament. In the New Testament to prophesy means to speak forth or to speak for; it does not mainly mean to predict. Primarily, to prophesy is to speak forth something of God, to speak something for Christ. The function of apostles, prophets, and teachers is not miraculous, but is related to speaking.</P><P>We need to read verse 28 carefully, not in a superficial way, in order to get into Paul's thought. Why did Paul use the word "first" before apostles and then speak of prophets and teachers as being second and third? And why did he not mention the other items in numerical sequence? The reason is that even in Paul's time there was confusion in the Christian gathering caused by speaking in tongues. One of the reasons Paul wrote this Epistle was to correct the misuse of tongues and the confusion caused by the over-emphasis on speaking in tongues. In writing this Epistle Paul used words carefully. Every word conveyed a great deal. Therefore, it is significant that in this verse Paul numbered some of the items and not others. According to Paul's listing, speaking in tongues did not mean that much to him. Because the Corinthians were uplifting the matter of speaking in tongues, Paul minimized its importance.</P><P>We need to read 1 Corinthians 12 in a very careful way. When reading the book of Ephesians, we realize that we are dealing with profound ideas. However, we may have the concept that we can read 1 Corinthians 12 in a light way, perhaps even skipping over certain verses; we may think that Paul's talk about the eye and the foot is a mere childish illustration. In order to know the Body, I have spent a good deal of time on this chapter. The more time I spend on it, the more I discover the crucial points it contains. Have you ever seen the inferiority complex and the superiority complex revealed in this chapter? Have you ever understood the uncomely parts as being the feet? In this chapter we have the practical way to have the Body. In no other chapter do we see this secret. By listing the various gifts, Paul is tempering the Body. Today the matter of speaking in tongues has been uplifted. Christians have exaggerated speaking in tongues until it has become a monstrosity. The problem with speaking in tongues today is much worse than at the time 1 Corinthians was written. We may need a dozen epistles like 1 Corinthians today.</P><P>Paul asked the question, "Are all apostles?" Suppose everyone in a particular gathering were an apostle. Such a gathering would not be a meeting of the Body; instead, it would be a gathering of shoulders. Consider your body and all the variety it contains. Your body is beautiful in its variety. But if all the members were shoulders, there would be no beauty at all. In order for the body to be beautiful, it must have a variety of different parts. This is the body. You need to be impressed with the fact that you are very precious in the eyes of the Lord. You need to drop your inferiority complex. Furthermore, those who have a superiority complex must give it up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT ALL SPEAK IN TONGUES</H2><P>In verse 30 Paul says, "Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?" Paul's question about speaking in tongues is a problem to those in the Pentecostal movement or charismatic movement. In 1936 I first became involved with tongues speaking. I took the lead to speak in tongues and I taught about two hundred others to speak in tongues. At that time I was endeavoring to have everyone speak in tongues. Those who could not do so were encouraged to imitate tongues speaking. When Brother Nee heard the news about this, he sent me a cable containing one line: "Do all speak with tongues?"</P><P>The Pentecostal people say that there are two kinds of speaking in tongues. The first may be called the initial speaking which they say everyone must experience. According to them, the second is the function of speaking in tongues in a meeting, which only some experience. What a ridiculous interpretation! How could someone speak in tongues initially and not speak in tongues thereafter? However, the Pentecostalists must interpret the Bible this way in order to avoid being caught by Paul's question in verse 30 regarding all speaking in tongues. I am sorry that so many in today's Pentecostal movement and charismatic movement do not pay careful attention to Paul's words.</P><P>When we were in China, we attempted three times to bring the Pentecostal things into the Lord's recovery. Each time we did so we suffered a loss. The debit far outweighed the credit. In 1943 we were suffering, and the church was low. I had been imprisoned for a month, and after I came out of prison I contracted tuberculosis. Because the church was depressed, some decided to bring in the Pentecostal things in order to stir up the church. One of the sisters became bold and prevailing in the matter of speaking in tongues, and she caused the meetings to be focused on herself. At first the elders thought that this was good. However, they later sensed that things were not normal and they began to pray. One day a young sister among us died. The sister who was prevailing in speaking in tongues prophesied that the deceased sister would be resurrected the next day at twelve o'clock noon. In her prophecy she told that sister's husband to make no arrangements for the funeral. The news of that prophecy stirred the whole church, and many gathered together to witness the resurrection. Before noon the sister who had uttered the prophecy and two helpers knelt down and prayed loudly and boldly. They seemed to be quite living. Twelve o'clock came. Nothing happened. We waited until three o'clock in the afternoon. Still nothing happened. Finally, the oldest elder stood up and said, "Brothers and sisters, we should not listen to any more nonsense. Let us make the arrangements to bury our sister." That was the end of the Pentecostal movement among us. Although no conference of the workers was held regarding it and no decision was made, spontaneously everyone dropped it. After that, the entire church came back to the regular church meetings.</P><P>Let me now tell you something I experienced on the West Coast in 1963. I was invited to speak to a certain group in San Diego, and I stayed in the home of the leader for several days. At least four others were with me, all staying in the same home. In one of the meetings of this group a certain lady spoke in tongues. According to my impression, that was not a genuine tongue. After this lady spoke in tongues, a young man gave forth what purported to be the interpretation. However, I could tell that his interpretation was not genuine, for it was three times longer than the so-called message in tongues. At home after the meeting I said to our host, "Brother, do you believe that the interpretation given in the meeting was genuine?" He admitted that it was not. I said, "Brother, why do we need to practice such things? We have a wonderful Christ, and we do not have enough time to minister the riches of Christ to people. Why should we waste our time with nonsensical and false things?" Realizing what my attitude was, he became somewhat afraid of me. A few nights later, after I had gone to bed, he and his wife began to work on one of our brothers. The host laid hands on the brother, and the wife told him to open his mouth and say something, but not to speak either English or Chinese. Realizing that he had to speak something or else they would not let him go, he uttered a few sounds of Indonesian that he had learned from his wife. The host and his wife were elated, rejoicing that the brother had spoken in tongues. When I awoke in the morning, I heard what had taken place the night before. At the breakfast table I said to the host, "Brother, do you realize that you were fooled last night? Your wife told the brother to speak neither English nor Chinese. This forced him to speak nonsense. You were happy, thinking that he had spoken in tongues." They could not deny the situation.</P><P>One of the other leaders of this group told another Chinese brother and me that God had given him the grace to speak Chinese. He then proceeded to utter certain sounds. We told him that we did not understand a word of what he was saying. Then he began to make other sounds, and we told him that we still did not understand what he was saying. Although we knew Mandarin, Cantonese, and other dialects, we did not understand a word of this brother's "Chinese." What kind of tongue was that?</P><P>During the 1963 summer training, I received a copy of a magazine called Trinity. In one of the articles the writer said that he had contacted two hundred people who had spoken in tongues, and without exception they all doubted that the tongues they spoke were genuine. Nevertheless, the writer encouraged them to go on speaking in tongues whether it was genuine or not. After a brother read this article to the trainees, I said, "Do you believe that those who spoke in tongues on the day of Pentecost doubted whether their speaking was genuine? Certainly none of them had any doubts. The reason these two hundred people have doubts is that their speaking in tongues is not genuine."</P><P>If the tongues spoken today were recorded and examined by a linguist, the linguist would say that they are not genuine languages. In many cases, three or four syllables are used repeatedly. How could a language be composed of only a few syllables? Furthermore, although the words used are usually the same, the interpretation is often different. At one time the interpreter may say, "My people, the time is short. I come quickly. Watch and pray. Thus saith the Lord." At another time the interpretation may go like this: "You must love Me. If you don't love Me, you'll be cursed." But still a different interpretation may be given to the same sounds, something like this: "You rich people must give money for the building of a temple." At other times the interpreter may say, "Among you there is a wolf, one who is not a real shepherd." Any linguist could tell you that these "tongues" are not genuine. The interpretations are utterly different, but the speaking is virtually the same.</P><P>In 1936 I met a leader of the Assembly of God in China, an American missionary named Simpson. One day as I was having fellowship with him, I said, "I have a problem. Although I have been helped to speak in tongues, I doubt that many of the instances of speaking in tongues are genuine." Opening up my Greek-English interlinear New Testament to Acts 2, I showed him that the Greek words for tongue (glossa) and for dialect (dialectos) are used interchangeably, indicating that the tongues spoken on the day of Pentecost must have been dialects. Unable to answer me, he simply shook my hand and said, "Your head is too big." At that time I began to doubt the genuineness of my experience of speaking in tongues, and a year later I discontinued that practice.</P><P>Recently a brother in the church in Anaheim, one with a tongues-speaking background and a graduate of Melodyland School of Theology, said that the charismatics are investigating whether the tongues they are speaking are genuine or not. Certain linguists have said that these tongues are not a language. Thus, these charismatic leaders have begun to debate whether what they are speaking should be called a tongue or simply a vocal sound.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FALSE PROPHECIES</H2><P>In 1963 a so-called prophecy was given in Los Angeles that there would be a great earthquake and that Los Angeles would fall into the ocean. As a result of this prophecy, some people left Los Angeles and moved to other parts of the country. However, nothing happened. The next year the same prophecy was given again, and an article regarding it was printed in a San Francisco paper. Again nothing happened. Although so many prophecies given among the Pentecostal people have not been fulfilled, they still stubbornly insist upon practicing that kind of prophecy. According to the Old Testament, however, a false prophet was to be put to death. But today's Pentecostal and charismatic circles are filled with such false prophecies. Yet, no one seems to care whether the prophecies are true or false.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>KNOWING THE COUNTERFEIT</H2><P>As we all know, the charismatic movement has penetrated the Catholic Church. Fearing the loss of members, the pope allows it to go on. Eventually, the charismatic movement became mixed with the mass and even with the worship of Mary.</P><P>Because we in the Lord's recovery are concerned about the practicality of the Body, I must present the real situation to you all. There is much falsehood in the Pentecostal-charismatic movement. The real and the false are mixed together, but the false outweighs the true. The leaven is greater than the flour. This mixture is the most damaging counterfeit to the Lord's recovery today. The Lord's recovery faces both fundamental Christianity and Pentecostal-charismatic Christianity. Therefore, we need to pray, to be clear, and to be on the alert. We must know what the counterfeit is.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>LOVE AND TRANSFORMATION<br>FOR THE BODY LIFE</H1><P>In 1 Corinthians 12:31 Paul says, "But desire earnestly the greater gifts" (Gk.). Although Paul does not tell us to reject the lesser gifts, he says to earnestly desire the greater gifts because they are more profitable for the Body life. Thus, we all must learn to desire the greater gifts. By reading 1 Corinthians 12 we can easily see that the greater gifts are those related to the apostles, the prophets, and the teachers. These are the speaking gifts. Furthermore, in 1 Corinthians 14:5 Paul says that prophecy is more profitable to the church than speaking in tongues. In chapter fourteen Paul is trying to impress us that we should care more for prophecy than for speaking in tongues. Just the opposite is seen, however, in today's charismatic movement. In the charismatic movement speaking in tongues, which is the tail, becomes the head.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MOST EXCELLENT WAY</H2><P>In 1 Corinthians 12:31 Paul also says, "And yet show I unto you a most excellent way" (Gk.). We should not only desire the greater gifts, but also practice the gifts according to the most excellent way. To have the greater gifts is one thing, and to practice them according to the most excellent way is another. You may have the greater gifts, but you may not have the most excellent way of practicing them. In this message I have the burden to fellowship regarding the most excellent way to practice the gifts.</P><P>The most excellent way is, of course, revealed in 1 Corinthians 13, which is the direct continuation of chapter twelve. First Corinthians 13:1 says, "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal." Sounding brass and tinkling cymbals are sounds without life. Thus, to become sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal means to function without life. We need to pray to the Lord, "Lord, show me the difference between function and life. Show me that it is possible to make sounds, yet not have any life." Paul goes on to say that it is possible to have the gift of prophecy, to understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and to have the faith to remove mountains, and yet not have love. If we have all these without love, we are nothing of life. Furthermore, we may give material things to the poor and even offer our body to be burned and still have no profit, because we do not have love (v. 3). By this we see that we may have many gifts and functions, yet still be short of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GIFTS USED AS TOYS</H2><P>In 1 Corinthians 1:7 Paul said that the Corinthians came behind in no gifts. However, in 3:1 he said, "And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ." Paul told the Corinthians that they were not only childish, but even babyish. Babies always have more toys. Who do you think has the most toys&#151;a little baby, a middle-aged person, or an elderly person? Obviously, the babies have the most toys, for toys are made for babies and children. If you read 1 Corinthians carefully, you will see that Paul's concept was that playing with the gifts is like playing with toys. You may ask, "Where is the verse saying that the Corinthians were like children playing with toys?" Of course, no verse says this explicitly. But if you consider the whole book, you will realize that this is exactly Paul's meaning.</P><P>In 1 Corinthians 1:7 Paul told them that they did not lack any of the gifts; in 3:1 he said that they were babyish; and in 13:11 he said, "When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things." What did Paul mean by "childish things"? If you read chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen, you will have to admit that the childish things are the gifts. Some who oppose speaking in tongues claim that it is childish. However, the childish things in 13:11 refer not only to speaking in tongues, but also to prophecy, teaching, and even to the three leading gifts of apostles, prophets, and teachers. If you play with these things, to you they become childish things. Paul seemed to be saying, "You Corinthians are playing with the gifts just as children play with toys. To you, prophecy, teaching, speaking in tongues, healing, and miracles are all toys. To you these have become childish things." Where can you find a group of Christians in which no one plays with toys? Such a group does not exist because Christians everywhere play with toys. If we are honest and fair, we shall admit that this is also true with us.</P><P>Whether or not we play with toys depends upon the growth of life. No matter how much the young ones say that they do not play with toys, the fact is that they do play with them. When I checked with my eight-year-old grandson, he said that he was a good boy, that he behaved himself, and that he did his homework. He also told me he enjoys reading the Bible, and he then proceeded to read me the first eighteen verses of John chapter one. I was happy that he could read all the words so well. But immediately after talking with me, he began to show off by walking on the sofa and the coffee table. The more I asked him to stop, the more he went on. To him, everything is a toy. When he helps me water the planters in the yard, he plays with the water pot and the planter. Nevertheless, I am not angry with him, because I realize that he is a child who likes to play and to make a toy out of everything. If he did not play with things, it would indicate that he was ill, for the only time little boys do not feel like playing is when they are sick.</P><P>The young people in the church need to realize that they are still playing with toys. When they hear this, they may be disappointed and say, "Brother Lee has said that we are children playing with toys. Let us forget about the meetings and stay home." If you do this, it is an indication that you are ill. Instead of staying home you should come to the meetings and play with your toys. Do not be disappointed to learn that you are still a child. I am happy to see the young ones playing with toys. When I see my grandchildren at play, I am happy to know that they are strong, active, and normal. Likewise, I am happy to see you play with toys in the meetings. However, I would not be pleased if the elders were to play with toys, because they are past the age of playing with toys. It is healthy for children to play. If you forbid them to play, you will kill them. It is the same in the church life today. We need to encourage the young ones to go ahead and play with their toys in the meetings. We realize that when they function in the meeting it is like playing with a toy. However, for the older ones to play in such a way would be wrong.</P><P>We in the church are not an army or a school, but a large family including those of every age. Therefore, in the meetings there must be activities for all ages. Those who play with toys should not be unhappy with the older ones. The playing ones are the young ones, the fresh ones, the young people who have been saved a very short time. They need to be able to play in the meeting. In order to give them the opportunity to do so, we need to conduct the meetings in a family way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED FOR THE GROWTH IN LIFE</H2><P>However, there is still the need for the growth in life. After speaking of so many things in chapter twelve, the Apostle Paul tells us to desire the greater gifts. Then he says that he will show us the most excellent way. The most excellent way to practice the gifts is the way of love. The way of love is the way of life, for love is the expression of life.</P><P>As we have seen, speaking in tongues, miracles, and healings may become childish things. It all depends upon the measure of the growth in life found in the practice of these gifts. As my grandson was reading John chapter one, he was being very playful. But I did not condemn him. On the contrary, I was happy. But if one of the elders would read John 1 in such a playful manner, I would be exceedingly displeased. In the Body life we need the growth in life, and we need to function in the growth of life. Although I like to see the young ones functioning in a playful way in the meetings, I would be displeased to see the older ones functioning in this way. If you do not have the growth in life, it will be impossible for you not to play. Because your age is the age of playing with toys, there will be no other way for you to do things.</P><P>Some mothers exercise strict control over their children. The first year I came to Los Angeles I observed some mothers who had their little ones with them in the meetings. Whenever the little ones acted up, the mothers disciplined them. In a sense, I agree with this type of chastening. But in another sense, I do not agree with it, because you cannot change the age of a little "monkey" by discipline. No matter what you do to him, he will still be a "monkey." The little "monkey" needs time to grow. If you do not allow the little children to play, you will kill them. But those who are my age, over seventy, are not naughty. Rather, we like to have more time to rest.</P><P>Function is related to age. If we are not at the proper age, we cannot have the best practice, even if we have the best gifts. Without being at the right age, it is difficult to have the proper practice. Thus, we all need to grow. I thank the Lord that in His recovery He has gained many, especially many young people. But I am burdened to tell you that you need to grow. You cannot have an adequate practice unless you grow. If you are still childish, your practice will be abnormal. The most excellent way to function is the way of the growth in life. This is the way of love.</P><P>Do not think that love is a simple matter. No, in order to love, we must have a mature, normal, properly balanced life. You cannot expect a child five years old to love properly. Children fight with each other one minute and love each other the next. Their love fluctuates. This is not the love required in the Bible. The Bible requires a permanent love, a remaining love, a balanced, adjusted, proper love. If we would have such a balanced love, we need the proper growth in life. We need to be impressed with the need for the growth in life for the Body life.</P><P>Suppose you visit my home and find there only my wife and several children under the age of five. What kind of family would that be? However, if you visit my family, you will find at least three generations there: the grandparents, who are the older ones; the parents, who are middle-aged; and the children. This is what we want to see in the Lord's recovery. Whenever we come together, we should see some elderly ones, some middle-aged ones, some young people, and some children.</P><P>By using this illustration I want to emphasize the need for us to seek the proper growth in life, the life that is expressed in love. Proper love is maintained through the growth in life. This means that real love is expressed and maintained in maturity. If, among the saints in the Body, there are a good number who are mature, there will be a balanced love among us. If we do not love properly, this means that we are not balanced or that we have not reached the standard of the growth in life. But if we are of the proper age, there will definitely be a balanced love among us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EPISTLES OF CHRIST</H2><P>In the New Testament we have not only 1 Corinthians, but also 2 Corinthians. Whenever there are two books of a certain kind in the New Testament, the second is more vital than the first. For example, 2 Corinthians is more vital than 1 Corinthians, 2 Timothy is more vital than 1 Timothy, and 2 Thessalonians is more vital than 1 Thessalonians. Thus we should not stop with 1 Corinthians, but go on to 2 Corinthians. Second Corinthians does not take care of your gifts; it deals with you. In this book what matters is how much you have been anointed and sealed (2 Cor. 1:21-22).</P><P>In 2 Corinthians 3:3 the Apostle Paul likens us to an epistle: "Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart." It is not a matter of how many gifts we have, but of how much we have been written upon. What is important is that we are an epistle of Christ, an epistle that speaks for Christ and that ministers Christ to others. How much of Christ has been written on you by the Spirit of the living God? The living Spirit must be constantly writing something of Christ upon you. Throughout the past years, a great deal may have been written into your being by the Spirit. If so, then you are not an epistle of just two or three pages, but perhaps of a hundred pages. If anyone begins to read you as an epistle of Christ, it will take him several hours to finish. As he reads you, he will say, "Certainly this man has a great deal of Christ. He is a person full of Christ." However, some of you may just have three or four words written on you. This is what you are as an epistle of Christ.</P><P>In 2 Corinthians the Apostle Paul no longer had the thought of gifts. Rather, he turned the attention of the church in Corinth to the need to have Christ written into the being of all the saints. Something of Christ must be inscribed into our being, not with ink, but with the living Spirit. Everything that is written into you is written by the Spirit. If a great deal of the Spirit has been inscribed into your being, you will not always need to function. Sometimes you simply need to let others read you. In 2 Corinthians it is not a matter of functioning, but a matter of being read by others. When others come to you, will they find something of Christ in your being that they can read? We all need to have Christ written into our being by the life-giving Spirit. If in the meetings there are none who have Christ written into them, you will have the sense that the meeting is empty. But if even one with Christ written upon him is present, the meeting will be enriched. Such a one does not need to say anything or do anything. Simply by being present he enriches the meeting, because a great deal of Christ has been written upon him by the living Spirit. We need to go on from 1 Corinthians, the first stage, to 2 Corinthians, the second stage. In 1 Corinthians it is a matter of function; in 2 Corinthians it is a matter of Christ written upon us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MIRRORS REFLECTING CHRIST</H2><P>In 2 Corinthians 3 Paul firstly likens us to an epistle in which people can read Christ and then to a mirror with an unveiled face that beholds and reflects Christ. As an epistle, we need to be written upon. But as a mirror, we need to reflect. How much of Christ has been written into you, and how much do you reflect Christ? If you reflect Christ, there is not always the need for you to stand up and function in the meetings. (This does not mean, however, that I am saying you should not function.) If Christ has been written into you and if you with an unveiled face have been looking to Christ day by day, in the meeting you will be a mirror reflecting Him. When people look at you, they will see Christ. This is not a matter of functioning, but of reflecting. Reflection is much more than function. However, in today's religion people know only a little of the matter of function; they do not care for reflection.</P><P>When we come to the meetings, we need to reflect Christ. This is not a matter of gifts, but a matter of growth. As we grow in Christ, more of Him will be written into our being by the living Spirit. Whatever has been written upon us will be reflected from us. Thus, we are not only an epistle, but also a mirror reflecting Christ. Today Christ needs epistles and mirrors. He needs many epistles with Christ written on them by the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit so that people may read Christ on them. We are the living epistles. At the same time, we need to be bright, unveiled mirrors reflecting the very Christ who has been written into our being. This will strengthen, uplift, and enrich the Body life. We need such a Body life, a Body life not only according to 1 Corinthians, but also according to 2 Corinthians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BODY LIFE AFTER TRANSFORMATION</H2><P>Many Christians cannot differentiate Romans 12 from 1 Corinthians 12. To them, Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12 are the same, for both speak of the Body life. Romans 12, however, is much more advanced than 1 Corinthians 12 because the Body life there in Romans 12 comes after transformation. After 1 Corinthians 12, we have 2 Corinthians 3, where we find the matter of transformation. This indicates that in the two Epistles to the Corinthians transformation is mentioned after the Body life. In other words, in the Corinthian Epistles the Body life is practiced before transformation. However, Romans 12 is different, because there transformation comes first and then the practice of the Body life follows.</P><P>Seemingly, 1 Corinthians 12 and Romans 12 are talking about the same thing. But both the condition and the stage are different. First Corinthians 12 is before transformation, and Romans 12 is after transformation. Before transformation, in 1 Corinthians 12, Paul mentioned the miraculous things and gifts such as speaking in tongues and interpretation. But after transformation, in Romans 12, he said not a word regarding miracles, healings, tongues, or the interpretation of tongues. This indicates that to drop these things is a great advance. In 1 Corinthians 12 there are many toys, but in Romans 12 there are no toys. The more we grow, the fewer toys we have. The dear ones in 1 Corinthians were very young, still at the age of playing with toys. But those described in Romans 12 are more mature, more advanced, and have no toys.</P><P>The crucial matter here is transformation. To repeat, the church life in 1 Corinthians is before transformation, but the church life in Romans 12 is with transformation. This reveals the fact that we need to advance by being transformed so that we may have a solid church life with fewer toys. In the childish Body life there are many toys, things such as healings, miracles, and tongues. But in the solid church life, in which there has been a good deal of transformation, there will not be many toys. We expect that the churches in the Lord's recovery will grow through transformation. We all should grow by having Christ written upon us by the life-giving Spirit. Then we shall be epistles full of Christ for others to read. Furthermore, because Christ has been impressed upon us, we shall reflect Him, and people will see Christ by looking at us. Thus, we shall be Christ's epistles for people to read and His mirror reflecting Him that others may see Him. This is a church life that has advanced in the expression of Christ. This is a more solid church life, with many who have been transformed for the Body life. If we cannot see this today, I expect to see it in the future. Nevertheless, I hope that even today in all the churches there will be more epistles and mirrors, not only children playing with toys. Many are in 1 Corinthians playing with toys, but others are in 2 Corinthians. They are epistles in which others can read Christ and mirrors reflecting Christ to others. This is the Body life.</P><P>We all need to be ambitious to be made long epistles for Christ. We need to pray, "Lord, make me a long epistle, even more than two hundred pages long. Lord, let others read You in me. Lord, I am ambitious that whenever I come to the meeting, people will see Your reflection in me." If you are such a reflection of Christ, you will not need to stand up or say a word. Even if you just sit there in the meeting, you will reflect Christ and radiate something of Christ into the whole meeting. I have known brothers and sisters whose simple coming and sitting in the meeting uplifts that meeting. How the meetings are enriched by their presence! But when they are not present, the meetings are empty. We need some saints who enrich the meetings in this way. If all the rich ones were taken away from the church, nothing would remain. But when the rich ones are in the church life, the church is solid, weighty, and full of life. We need the epistles and the mirrors. We need a great deal of transformation so that we can be transferred from 1 Corinthians 12 to Romans 12. The Body life must advance from 1 Corinthians 12 to Romans 12 through the process of transformation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A PRESENTED BODY, A RENEWED MIND,<br>AND A LIVING SPIRIT</H2><P>This transformation requires that our body be presented and that our spirit be burning (Rom. 12:1, 11). Romans 12 refers to the body, the soul, and the spirit. For the Body life, our body must be presented, our soul must be transformed, and our spirit must be set on fire. You may love the church and present your body to the church, but you may not have much transformation in your soul. Your mind may be natural, and your concepts may be old. You need to be transformed and renewed in your soul. It is also possible to have transformation, but yet be cold in your spirit. In order to advance in the Body life, we need our body presented both to the Lord and to the Body. We should present our body to the Lord for the Body. We also need our mind to be renewed so that our soul may be transformed. Finally, our spirit must be set on fire. If we have all these things, we shall have a proper and solid Body life.</P><P>Such a Body life is not simply a matter of uplifting the inferior ones, of lowering the superior ones, of tempering the members, adorning the uncomely parts, and of strengthening the more feeble members. This is too superficial. If we care only about the head, the tail, and the proper sequence, we are being too outward. We need a solid church life with much transformation. For this, we need to have our body presented, our soul transformed, and our spirit burning. This means that we need to be transferred from 1 Corinthians 12 to Romans 12. Then we shall not have as many toys, and we shall not care for the miraculous things. This is what the Lord desires in His recovery. I realize that this will not take place overnight and that it cannot be accomplished by a mushrooming development. Nevertheless, I have been burdened to share with you a view of what is to come in the future. We all need to have such a view.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ONENESS OF THE BODY</H1><P>In this message we need to see something further concerning the Body. Ephesians 4:4 says, "There is one body, and one Spirit." Although this word is short and simple, it includes the whole Body life. The Body is one, and the Spirit also is one. The Body and Spirit cannot be separated. The Body can be likened to our physical body, and the Spirit is like the life in our physical body. If there were no life in our body, it would not be a body, but a corpse. The Body, which is the church, cannot be separated from the Spirit. Where the Body is, there the Spirit must be also; and the Spirit must be one with the Body. If you have the Body, then you also have the Spirit. But if you do not have the Spirit, the Body is dead. The Body, the church, is not a matter of religion, teaching, theology, practice, serving God, or working for Christ. On the contrary, the Body is a matter of the Spirit. Because the Spirit is one, the Body cannot be more than one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SEVEN ONES</H2><P>In Ephesians 4:4-6 Paul lists seven ones: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father. The Apostle Paul listed the Body as the first item of the seven. If I were to compose such a list, however, I would put these items in a good theological order. I would begin with the one God and then mention one Lord, one Spirit, one faith, one baptism, one Body, and one hope. When I read this chapter of Ephesians many years ago, I was troubled by the fact that Paul put the Body first and God last. I wondered why Paul mentioned one hope before one Lord. To me, Paul's order was backwards. However, I have become accustomed to Paul's order. As related to the Body, Paul spoke separately concerning the three of the Godhead. After the one Spirit, he does not mention the one Lord, but the one hope. Then after the one Lord he does not speak of the one God, but of the one faith and the one baptism. In this message we can cover only the matter of the one Body and the one Spirit. Paul put the Body first because Paul's word here is altogether concerned with the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>The subject of this section is the keeping of the oneness of the Spirit. Ephesians 4:3 says, "Endeavoring to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the bond of peace" (Gk.). The word endeavor indicates that we should be desperate to keep the oneness. This oneness is not the oneness of doctrine or the oneness of theology; it is the oneness of the Spirit. The oneness of the Spirit is just the Spirit Himself. Thus, to keep the oneness of the Spirit is to keep the Spirit. If you are not in the Spirit, you are not in the oneness. If you are in anything other than the Spirit, you are in a division. The Spirit is the oneness. For this reason, the oneness is called the oneness of the Spirit. If you are in the Spirit, you are in the oneness. But if you are outside the Spirit, you are not in oneness, but in division. You may not realize how serious this is. To be in a division, all that is necessary is to get out of the Spirit. When you are out of the Spirit, you are no longer in oneness. And as long as you are not in oneness, you are in division, for whatever is not oneness is division. Although there are many divisions, there is the unique oneness, and the unique oneness is the Spirit.</P><P>As long as you are not in the Body with the Spirit, you are in a division; and as long as you are outside the Spirit, you are outside the oneness. Whatever we think, say, and do in the Lord's recovery must be in the Spirit. If you are not in the Spirit, you cannot say that you are in the Body. The Body is one with the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reality of the Body. If you are not in the Spirit, you are not in the oneness, but in division. Everyone in the Lord's recovery needs a clear vision that the recovery is basically and fundamentally the recovery of the oneness of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DIVISION AND CONFUSION</H2><P>The history of Christianity is a history of divisions. What a shame the divisions in Christianity are to the Lord! In Christianity there is division upon division. Christians are known for the fact that they are easily divided. Consider how many Christian divisions there are in the city of Cleveland. On just one street there may be a number of divisions. On one corner there may be the Church of Christ, and on another, the Assembly of God. How easy it is for Christians to be divided! It seems that anyone can start something and call it a church. What lawlessness!</P><P>This is Babel, the source of Babylon. Today the whole of Christianity is a great Babel, which means confusion. Some Christians are arguing that we should not say that they are in Babylon. But they need to see that as long as they are a division, they are Babylonian. Division denotes confusion, and confusion is the basic characteristic of Babel. As long as you are in division, you are in confusion. As long as you are in confusion, you are Babel. Every denomination is Babylonian, and every division is part of Babel. The Catholic Church, the Protestant denominations, and all the independent groups are in a condition of confusion. All are Babylonian.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST, THE UNIQUE HUSBAND</H2><P>In a spiritual sense, division is fornication. Fornication is a lawless act. It is according to God's ordination for a woman to have a husband, but she must take a husband within the bounds of God's ordination. Anything other than God's ordination is fornication, lawlessness. Fornication produces confusion. The church, the wife, must have one husband, and that husband is Christ. But for the church to be divided indicates that the church has more than one husband. You may ask who is the husband other than Christ. If you look at today's Christianity, you will see that every group has a different husband with a different name. When those in the Lutheran denomination call themselves Lutherans, they indicate that they are married to Luther. Luther was a servant of God, but no church should be of Luther. When the Corinthians were saying, "I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ," Paul said, "Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?" (1 Cor. 1:12-13). Paul seemed to be saying, "You are not of me. Christ is the unique husband. All of you are of Christ." In 2 Corinthians 11:2 Paul even used the word husband: "I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ." Any person, thing, or matter other than Christ that becomes the basis of a Christian group is another husband. To have such a husband is to commit fornication. How many husbands there are today in Christianity!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DENOMINATIONAL NAMES</H2><P>Sometimes people have argued with me and said, "Brother Lee, denominational names are not important. They are simply a matter of convenience and do not mean anything." I replied, "If the names do not mean anything, why don't you get rid of them? You say the name means nothing, yet you still bear the name Luther. You are Mrs. Smith, but you wear a name tag that says Mrs. Jones. If you are Mrs. Smith, why do you go by another name? If, as you say, this means nothing and is just a convenience, then drop it. If you keep the title Mrs. Jones, it must mean that Mr. Jones is your illegal husband. How ridiculous for you to say that you have never met Mr. Jones and that you simply use his name as a convenience!"</P><P>Throughout the years I have done a great deal of traveling. I do not care to talk to those sitting next to me on the airplane because they often ask me questions that are difficult to answer. In talking to people they usually find out that I am a Christian. Then the question is asked about what kind of Christian I am. I find this an insult. Many times I have said, "I am simply a Christian. Please don't ask me what kind of Christian I am, for there is only one kind of Christian. If I were to say that I am the moon, would you ask what kind of moon I am? This would be foolish. There is just one moon. Please don't ask me what kind of moon I am." Sometimes people do not believe that I am simply a Christian. They insist that I must be a certain kind of Christian. Sometimes I am very strong with them and say, "If you can't believe me, it means that you are absolutely wrong. I cannot lie to you. I simply am what I am. I am just a Christian."</P><P>More than twenty years ago I met an American missionary at a retreat center in the Philippines. He proudly told me that he was a member of the Church of the Nazarene. Until then, I knew nothing of this denomination. The name, the Church of the Nazarene, sounds abnormal. It is confusion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE UNIQUE ONENESS</H2><P>The Babylonian spirit may still be in our blood. The Lord's recovery is mainly to bring us back to the genuine oneness, to the unique husband, to the one Body, and to the one Spirit. If we lose this oneness, we are no longer in the Lord's recovery. Rather, we are repeating the history of Christianity, which is a history of divisions.</P><P>Many Christians do not care about this matter of division. They say, "The Lord is not narrow. God is omnipresent. Why are you so narrow?" If we know the Bible, we shall see that with respect to division God is more than narrow. He will not permit any husband other than Christ. Read Deuteronomy 12, 14, 15, and 16 and see how narrow our God is. He told His people that they had no right to worship Him in the place of their choosing. Rather, they had to go to the unique place which He had designated for the worship of God. In this matter, God was narrow.</P><P>Those in the charismatic movement talk about the Body, but they do not care about divisions. As long as we are not in the oneness, we are not in the Body. Instead, we are in a division. This is a serious matter.</P><P>Most of those who came into the Lord's recovery before 1970 are clear regarding the unique oneness. However, those who have come into the recovery after 1970 may not be clear about this. During the first seven years of the Lord's recovery in this country, we spoke again and again about the unique oneness and about the unique ground of the church. But even those who are clear about the oneness of the church may find that the vision is fading. At times, the vision may even vanish. Thus, the vision of the unique ground of oneness needs to be restored.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERED BODY</H2><P>The Body is one. Some Christians may argue with us and say, "You say that the Body is one. But the Body is divided. How can you be the unique Body?" We do not say that we are the unique Body. But we are the recovered Body. At least, we are the recovered part of the Body.</P><P>Consider the illustration of the children of Israel in the Old Testament. In Deuteronomy 12, 14, 15, and 16 the Lord charged them again and again to worship Him at the unique center, which preserved the oneness of God's people. Eventually, many were captured, and some were taken to Syria, others to Egypt, and the rest to Babylon. Thus, they were captured and divided. To be divided means to be captured. Today nearly all Christians have been captured, some to the Presbyterian denomination, some to the Baptist denomination, and a great many to the Catholic Church. When the children of Israel were dispersed and scattered, their oneness was lost. After seventy years, God commanded them to return to Jerusalem. But according to history, only a small remnant returned under the leadership of Ezra, Zerubbabel, and Nehemiah. They were a group of recovered Israelites. After the return from Babylon, there were four groups: one in Syria, one in Egypt, one in Babylon, and one in the holy land. Apparently, each group was a division. But although the groups in Egypt, Syria, and Babylon were divisions, the group of the recovered ones in Jerusalem was not a division. Yes, they were a group, but they were not a division. Rather, they were the recovered Israel. Likewise, we in the Lord's recovery are the recovered Body.</P><P>Let us also consider the situation of the nation of Israel today. The nation of Israel is recognized as a nation by the United Nations. But there are more Jews in New York City than in the nation of Israel. But are they the nation of Israel? Certainly not. Those who returned to the land of their fathers are the nation of Israel. The Jews in New York City may say, "You in the nation of Israel are Jews, and we are Jews also. Furthermore, we in New York outnumber you in Israel. Why then do you call yourself the nation of Israel? Are we not the nation of Israel too?" No, they are not. The Jews in Israel should say to the Jews in New York, "Brothers, you are certainly part of the nation of Israel. Please come back to the land of our fathers. Don't stay in New York." We see by this illustration that it is absolutely correct for those who have returned to Palestine to call themselves the nation of Israel, for they are the nation of Israel. But the Jews in New York City are not in the position to be the nation of Israel. Although they are Jews by blood, by position they are Americans, not Israelis.</P><P>When those in the denominations have inquired of me regarding the church, I have said, "If we are not the church of Christ, then what are we? Give us a name." When they claimed that they also were the church, I replied, "Since you are also the church, you need to drop your denominational labels, such as Presbyterian and Baptist." They said that they were not able to do this. To this I answered, "As long as you cannot drop your labels, you are not the church, but a division, a denomination. This is confusion."</P><P>If the Jews living in New York would claim to be part of the nation of Israel, I would tell them to go back to Jerusalem. But they may say, "I love Israel, but I still want to live in New York City so I can make more money. I may live in New York, but I give money to support the nation of Israel." No matter how much money they give, still they are not the nation of Israel. The nation of Israel is the nation of Israel. As long as they are in the land with the proper government, they are the nation of Israel. The number of people is not the determining factor.</P><P>Let us also use the illustration of the Smith family. Suppose there are twenty-eight members in the Smith family, but most are scattered all over the country and just three remain at home. Are these three not the Smith family? Certainly they are. Those members of the Smith family living in Hawaii may say, "Does not the Smith family also include us? You three are not the only members of the Smith family." Yes, the Smith family does include those in Hawaii, but they need to return home to be with the other members of the family. As long as they are in Hawaii, they are away from the family. If those members of the Smith family living at home are not the Smith family, then what are they? In like manner, we are the church. If we are not the church, then what are we? Yes, the church in Cleveland should include all the real Christians in Cleveland. But the majority of genuine Christians will not come back home. Rather, they prefer to stay in their divisions, and only a small number have returned. Those who have returned are the church in Cleveland. For them to take a name would be a mark of division. They should not call themselves anything other than the church in Cleveland.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ONE LOCALLY AND UNIVERSALLY</H2><P>We have seen that the Body is one. Does this mean that the church in Cleveland is one Body, that the church in New York is another, and that the church in Anaheim is still another? If this were so, then there would be many local bodies. All the local churches are one Body. The church is not only locally one, but also universally one. All the local churches are one Body. We have seen that as long as we are in a division or outside the oneness, we are not in the Body. Now we must see that the Body is one both locally and universally. In the city of Cleveland there is just one Body, and in the entire universe there is still just one Body. If we truly intend to practice the Body life, we need to see that locally we are the Body and that universally we also are the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ALL LOCAL CHURCHES BEING THE SAME</H2><P>Today there is an erroneous teaching that every local church is independent. When I was young, I was greatly influenced by this concept, and I even taught it myself. I told others that every local church was independent. But if we go back to the Bible, we shall not find such a thing in the New Testament. Ephesians 4:4 speaks of one Body. Does this one Body refer simply to the local church at Ephesus? According to the best manuscripts, the Epistle to the Ephesians was not expressly addressed to the Ephesians. Rather, it was a universal Epistle addressed to all believers. No matter how many local churches there are, there cannot be more than one Body on earth. How could Christ, the Head, have more than one Body? A head with two bodies is a monstrosity. Universally, there is just one Body. Since the Body is one, how can one shoulder say to the other that it is independent? None of the members of the Body can claim to be independent. It would be foolish to ask whether the ears are dependent or independent. Nevertheless, today Christians are talking about this kind of thing. As Paul told the Corinthians, Christ is not divided. Since Christ is not divided, the Body must be one.</P><P>In the New Testament the apostles considered all the local churches the same. In 1 Corinthians 4:17 Paul spoke of the way he taught "every where in every church." There is not a verse that indicates that the Apostle Paul taught differently in the various churches. In 1 Corinthians 7:17 he said, "And so ordain I in all churches," and in 11:16 he said, "We have no such custom, neither the churches of God." In Colossians 4:16 Paul said, "And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea." In these verses we see that the teaching of the apostles was the same in all the churches. Thus, Paul encouraged the churches to follow each other (1 Thes. 2:14).</P><P>As we all know, in Revelation 2 and 3 there are the seven epistles to the seven churches. Although various differences are seen in these seven churches, these differences are all on the negative side. On the positive side, the churches are all the same. This is the reason that the seven epistles were not sent to each church separately and respectively; rather, all seven were sent to each of the seven churches. Moreover, at the end of each of the seven epistles there is the following word: "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches" (Rev. 2:7). Whatever was written to the church in Ephesus, for example, was a word that the Spirit was speaking to all the churches. This is a strong proof that all the local churches must be the same.</P><P>In Revelation 1:20 we see that the seven churches are seven golden lampstands. If all seven lampstands were standing in front of you, you could not discern one from another. All of the seven would lose their separate identity. Therefore, at the end of Revelation we have the New Jerusalem with the wall on the four sides (Rev. 21:18). Each side of the wall is built with the same material&#151;jasper. Thus, the four sides have the same appearance. If we consider all these things, we shall be convinced that all the local churches must be the same. But this does not mean that we should be organized. On the contrary, we must oppose organization. Nevertheless, all the churches, as part of the unique Body on earth, must be one in spirit, in life, and in testimony.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO CONTROL OF OTHER CHURCHES</H2><P>According to the New Testament there are no high churches or low churches. Instead, all the churches are on the same level. Some who argue that the church in Jerusalem was higher than the others use as proof the fact that a conference was held there. The conference was held in Jerusalem because the apostles who had the ministry to build the churches were there. But this does not mean that the church in Jerusalem was higher than the other churches. There was a difference, but the difference was not with respect to the church, but with respect to the ministry of the apostles. Because the church in Jerusalem was not higher than the other churches, it would have been absolutely wrong for any brother who went out of Jerusalem representing Jerusalem to control other churches. No church should control another church, and no brother should exercise control over the churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FELLOWSHIP AMONG THE CHURCHES</H2><P>All the churches need to have fellowship with one another. They should open to one another and receive help from one another. Any church that is not open to all the other churches is not healthy. Suppose the church in Cleveland is not open to the other churches, but is afraid that the other churches might interfere with its affairs. Cleveland then would be on the alert and would be careful not to be touched by the other churches. This attitude is wrong. In a recent meeting with the elders I encouraged them to visit other churches. I strongly told them that when they visit the churches they should not remain on the porch, but get into the inner circle of the church. If the churches do not bring the visiting elders into the inner circle, the elders should go back home.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO SECRETS</H2><P>This means that nothing should be kept secret. In the local churches there should be no secrecy. The shoulder keeps nothing secret from the other members of the body. If the shoulder keeps a secret, there must be a cancer there. Every part of the body must be completely open to all the other parts. Then it will be possible for the blood to circulate freely, and the body will be healthy.</P><P>When some hear this, they may say, "If we are so open to the other elders, they will invade us." Whoever holds this concept is himself an invader. This concept must be dropped. No human hand is needed to protect the glory in the temple. It is the Lord who causes the glory to come and to depart.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MUTUAL TRUST</H2><P>In the Lord's recovery today we need to have a mutual trust. We all must believe one another. You must believe me, and I must believe you. If one of the churches is cautious about the other churches, that church is abnormal and unhealthy.</P><P>In the past, I was greatly influenced by the Brethren. Every one among them was an expert at being cautious. The Brethren were afraid that someone would desire to be a pope. Some of the brothers who feared that others might become a pope might have been the ones most ambitious to become a pope. We all need to receive mercy to drop this concept of a pope, a concept that may cause us to be sectarian, even in the Lord's recovery. There is no need to be concerned about someone becoming a pope. Instead, let us take care of our spirit and be concerned with how much we release our spirit.</P><P>There is just one Body in the entire universe. All the churches must be one Body. But I do not mean that they should be organized to be one Body. If the church in Cleveland is afraid of being touched by the church in New York, I would wonder what kind of church there is in Cleveland. It would certainly be abnormal. If I am afraid that the person sitting next to me will steal my watch, I must have some kind of problem. I encourage you all to be at peace and to open your church to the other churches. Do not keep the church in your pocket as a pocket version of the church. The church is of Christ, of God, and of the saints (Rom. 16:16; 1 Cor. 11:16; 14:33). It is not a church of you or me. Nevertheless, some desire to turn the church into a pocket church. In the past I saw this a number of times. In every instance those who tried this failed, for the saints would not agree with such a thing. Every saint desires to be in a church that is an open church, a church that is of God, of Christ, and of the saints. Every local church must be open.</P><P>Do not keep the church in secret. Rather, keep it open and welcome all the saints who visit you. When they visit you, bring them into the inner chamber. It is not sufficient even to bring them into the living room; you must also bring them into the secret chamber. I can boast for the brothers in Anaheim that nothing there is kept secret. If you come to Anaheim, you will find that everything from the skin to the innermost being of the church is open to you. Nothing is in our pocket.</P><P>I am familiar with the diseases in the Body. I know the damage caused by the hidden germs. For this reason, I have been burdened to pass on this healing word to the Body. Not only the elders, but also all the young ones, should be clear that the Lord's recovery is to bring us back to one Body and one Spirit. We do not have organization or division; and we do not have confusion, control, or a pocket version of the church. All the churches must be open, and all must be one Body. But there is no organization, no confusion, and no control. Rather, there is one Body. Moreover, no one should keep the church in his pocket. On the contrary, everything must be public, everything must be for the saints, everything must be in the Spirit, and everything must be for the one Body. Remember, the Lord's recovery is to bring us back to the one Body with the one Spirit.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINETEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SITE OF GOD'S BUILDING</H1><P>In this message we come to the matter of the site of God's building. Everyone in the Lord's recovery needs to be very clear about this. The first thing the builder of a house must take care of is the site on which he will build. If he builds the house on the wrong site, that house will belong to the one who owns the lot. Hence, the site, or the ground, is crucial. If the ground is wrong, there will be a problem, even though the house may be built perfectly. Therefore, we all must know what is the site of God's building in His recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SURROUNDED BY DIVISIONS</H2><P>Today we are surrounded by divisions. In the past, many of us have traveled from site to site, from division to division. In the early years of my Christian life, I traveled to three sites or grounds. I know some who have visited a number of sites during the period of a year. First they were with the Episcopalians, then with the Lutherans, and after that with the Methodists. After staying with the Methodists a short time, they visited the Assembly of God and remained there for a while. Following this, they contacted a number of independent groups. Perhaps this is the history of your Christian life. Are you still traveling in this way? Traveling is the positive word; wandering is the negative one. The reason you were traveling, or wandering, so much in the past was that you did not know what the proper ground was. You were trying to live the Christian life, but you did not know where to live it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE GROUND</H2><P>In 1960 I gave a series of messages in New York on the ground of the church. After one of the meetings, the leading ones expressed their appreciation and told me that I had rendered them a great help. Seizing the opportunity to strengthen them and to further impress them, I said, "Brothers, you have visited a certain spiritual place where people constantly talk about the Body and about the principle of the Body. You were told that we Christians should not be individualistic, but should be built up. However, those in that place did not tell you where to be built up. They talked about the building, yet said not a word concerning the site, the ground, of the building. Tonight we in New York are all happy with one another. But perhaps after a few months some of you will no longer be happy with the rest of us. Because you are unhappy, you may look for some place where you can be happy. You may go there, stay for a while, and then look for still another place. If you do this, you will repeat your history."</P><P>No matter how spiritual we are, we cannot be built up with others if we are not on the proper ground. Before we can be built up, we need to be certain concerning the site on which we intend to build. For example, before building a meeting hall, you need to have the proper site. It is impossible to build a hall without a site, for a hall cannot be suspended in the air. Many Christians today talk about the church and the Body, yet they have not seen the proper ground of the church. Because they lack the proper ground, the result is that they build up something one day and tear it down the next. Actually, they have not built up anything, because they do not have the proper ground. The only thing that can keep us steady is the unique ground.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PICTURES OF SPIRITUAL THINGS</H2><P>The spiritual things of the New Testament are mysterious. Because they are mysterious, it is difficult to describe them or define them. Thus, the Bible follows the principle of illustrating spiritual things by shadows, figures, and types. It is similar to the way children are taught to read in school. Along with the word "dog," the teacher will show the children a picture of a dog. Praise the Lord that the Bible firstly affords a picture and then the plain words. In the Old Testament we have the types and pictures, and in the New Testament we have the definition, the fulfillment, of the types and pictures of the Old Testament. God's way in His wisdom is to use pictures.</P><P>The most comprehensive picture in the Old Testament is that of the children of Israel. The entire nation of Israel is a great picture of the church. God has had two peoples, one in the Old Testament, the children of Israel, and the other in the New Testament, the church. God's people in the Old Testament are a type of His people in the New Testament. Because the church is a mysterious entity, it cannot be easily described. Therefore, God employs the picture of the children of Israel to enable us to have a clear understanding of the church. We need to look at the picture first and then read the definition. Before the church came into being, there was already a picture of the church in the Old Testament. Although the church has now come into existence, it is nevertheless difficult to understand the church because it is a spiritual entity. Thus, we still need the picture of the church in the Old Testament.</P><P>The children of Israel observed a feast called the Passover. The first Passover feast was celebrated in Egypt. The record of this is in Exodus 12. After the children of Israel fled from Egypt, they crossed the Red Sea. According to 1 Corinthians 5 and 10, both the Passover and the crossing of the Red Sea were types. The Passover is a type of Christ enjoyed in the church, and the crossing of the Red Sea is a type of baptism, which is practiced in the church today. Although many teachers and theologians have seen that the early history of the children of Israel is a type, most have neglected the fact that their later history is also a type. The entire history of the children of Israel is a type of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PLACE GOD HAS CHOSEN</H2><P>Let us turn now to Deuteronomy 12. This word was given at the time the children of Israel were about to enter into the good land to possess it and enjoy it. Moses was charged by the Lord to command the children of Israel concerning the place where they were to worship God. In this chapter Moses seemed to be saying, "In the wilderness you did what was right in your own eyes, not what was right in the eyes of God. But now as you are about to enter the good land, I must warn you to be careful about the place where you worship the Lord. The place of worship is not a matter of your choice, but of the Lord's choice. You cannot worship God in the place of your choosing. No, you must go to the place the Lord has chosen." Sixteen times in Deuteronomy 12, 14, 15, and 16 Moses refers to the place which the Lord would choose. Because Moses was so concerned for the children of Israel, he charged them about this again and again.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FEASTING BEFORE THE LORD</H2><P>In Deuteronomy 14:23 Moses said, "And thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there." Moses seemed to be saying, "After you enter into the land, you must be careful where you eat the best part of your harvest. You need to set aside the top tenth of the harvest and bring it to the place which the Lord shall choose. You are not allowed to enjoy the top tenth in the place of your choice, not even in your homes. Rather, you must set it aside until the appointed times and bring it to the place which the Lord your God shall choose. At that place you may eat it and enjoy it. You must do the same with the firstlings of your flocks. Offer them to the Lord in the place He shall choose and then eat them in the presence of the Lord." This feasting in the presence of the Lord in the place of His choice is the kind of worship God has ordained. Most Christians do not understand that the worship ordained by God is a matter of eating. God has ordained that feasts be held in the place of His choice. Three things are important here: the place of God's choice, the times appointed by God, and the portions of firstfruits or firstlings desired by God. Have you ever realized that the worship God desires is a feast? This is what God wants today.</P><P>In Deuteronomy Moses seemed to be saying, "After you enter the land, you have no right to eat the firstfruit or the firstborn of the flocks in the place of your choice. This is forbidden. Rather, you must keep them aside until the appointed time. Then you must bring them to the place chosen by God, offer them to God, and then eat them in the presence of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PRESERVING THE ONENESS<br>OF GOD'S PEOPLE</H2><P>Now we must see the reason God ordained that the children of Israel worship Him at the place of His choice. God chose a unique place in order to preserve the oneness of the children of Israel. The oneness of the Israelites was maintained by coming to worship at the unique place chosen by God. It did not matter in what part of the holy land the Israelites lived, whether it was far to the north or far to the south. They had to come to the place God had chosen.</P><P>Suppose an Israelite from one of the northern tribes said, "God is omnipresent. Why must we travel so far to worship Him? Let us set up a worship center here in the north." Certainly worshipping God is a good thing. How could anyone say that it was not good to establish a worship center and to encourage people to come there to worship God? This is vastly different from opening a gambling casino. Nevertheless, something may sound good, but still not be right. The setting up of a worship center as a convenience to people in their worship of God may be good, but this does not make it right. If the Israelites living in the north had done this, those in the south might have followed their example and said, "God is not only with them in the north, but also with us here in the south. Let us worship Him here." If the northerners and the southerners had done this, there would have been two divisions among the Israelites. Without the regulations given in Deuteronomy 12, 14, 15, and 16, there would have been many divisions among the children of Israel. Probably each tribe would have set up its own center of worship, with every tribe claiming that their center was a place for the worship of God. In this way the children of Israel would have been divided again and again. The divisions would have been endless, perhaps with a center of worship set up in every home. If that had taken place, the divisions among the children of Israel would have numbered in the thousands. Such division is confusion; it is spiritual fornication. In other words, it is Babylonian. Now we can appreciate God's wisdom in choosing one place as a center of worship.</P><P>When I read these chapters in Deuteronomy as a young man, I could not understand this matter. However, when I was enlightened, I simply had to worship God. For years I had tried to describe the oneness that we should endeavor to keep. But I did not have the utterance until I saw the light regarding God's choice of the place of worship in the Old Testament. In the eyes of the Lord it was not right for the children of Israel to worship at any place other than the unique place God had chosen. In this matter God did not allow them to make their own choice. Second Chronicles 6:6 reveals that God's chosen place was Jerusalem. During all the years of their history, the children of Israel have not been divided as far as the worship of God is concerned. Even when their nation was divided, their place of worship was still uniquely one. Their oneness was maintained by the unique worship center chosen by God. It was there, in Jerusalem, that they built the temple. The children of Israel brought the firstfruit of their harvest and the firstlings of their flocks to Jerusalem, where they offered them to God and enjoyed them with God and with one another. This type of worship in the place chosen by God was very pleasing to Him. This was worship that maintained the oneness of the children of Israel.</P><P>Suppose two of the Israelites were at enmity with each other. When they went to Mount Zion to worship God, they were forced to be reconciled. As they ascended Mount Zion, they repeated the words of Psalm 133: "How good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!" I believe that such reconciliation took place again and again. Eventually, the Israelites who hated one another had to forgive one another so that they could sing the words of Psalm 133. This not only happened between individuals, but also between tribes. Because they had to go up to Jerusalem three times a year, they could not remain at enmity with each other for a period longer than several months. God's ordination did not allow this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SITUATION TODAY</H2><P>Now we need to apply this matter of the unique oneness to the situation today. Today, there is no unique oneness among Christians. If Christians do not like one another, they simply feel free to start another meeting, claiming that they are worshipping God and that God is with them. Nothing binds them together. Rather, everyone does what is right in his own eyes and makes his own choice. How many choices there are in today's Christianity! It seems that nearly everyone has the liberty to establish a church according to his taste. Some Christians, for example, appreciate foot washing. If you do not agree with this practice, you will not be accepted by them. Thus, the ones who advocate foot washing have a foot-washing church. The same may be true regarding head covering or regarding the type of wine or juice used at the Lord's table. Some insist upon grape juice, and others argue in favor of wine. Still others have different opinions about the bread or about the size of the cup. For this reason, there is a multitude of so-called churches according to various tastes.</P><P>Today in Christendom there is too much freedom. If a person does not agree with others, he takes the liberty to establish a church according to his taste. It seems that any kind of preaching or teaching can gain at least a small following, even if a man's following includes only the members of his family. What a pitiful situation! In the words of Moses, this is doing what is right in our own eyes. As the children of Israel were about to enter into the good land, Moses commanded them to do this no longer. Rather, they had to do what was right in the eyes of the Lord. For the Israelites, the place of worship was uniquely one. It did not depend upon man's choice or taste; it was altogether a matter of God's choice. Because God had made His choice, the children of Israel were one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RETURNING TO THE PROPER GROUND</H2><P>As we all know, the time came when the children of Israel were scattered, some to Syria, some to Egypt, and the majority to Babylon. The time of glorious oneness was over. We should not think that while they were in Syria, Egypt, and Babylon they did not worship God. Certainly they worshipped Him. However, they did not build the temple in any of those places, because they knew that the temple could be built only on the unique site, on Mount Zion in Jerusalem. If a temple had been built in Babylon exactly the same as the temple in Jerusalem, it still would have been wrong, for it would have been built on the wrong site. The Jews did not dare to do such a thing. Even today, they are waiting for the recovery of the proper site, which is presently occupied by a Moslem mosque.</P><P>After the Israelites had been in captivity seventy years, the Lord commanded them to return to the good land. While they were in Babylon, they were, of course, still the children of Israel and they could worship God; however, they had no temple. Because they did not have the temple, they did not have the full enjoyment. A number took heed to God's word and returned to Jerusalem. Suppose a group of Israelites who began the journey from Babylon to Jerusalem stopped halfway. Being neither in Babylon nor in Jerusalem, they would have been yet another division. Suppose another group left Babylon and came very close to Jerusalem, settling down just outside the city. Although they would have been very close to Jerusalem, they would still have been a division. Because they were not actually in Jerusalem, they would still have been a division, no matter how close they were to Jerusalem.</P><P>Applying this to today's situation, I would like to ask you where you are. Are you in Egypt or Syria or Babylon? Have you stopped halfway back to Jerusalem or just outside Jerusalem? We can boldly declare that we are in Jerusalem. Those who are in Jerusalem, those in the Lord's recovery, are not in a division. Those who have not come all the way back to Jerusalem are a division. God's people need to come back to Jerusalem. Today, we are no longer in division; we are the recovery. The Lord's recovery is not a division. Thus, we have the right, the position, the boldness, and the confidence to say that we are in the recovery. Regarding the church, a fight is raging today. Those in the denominations say, "Why do you claim that you are the church and that you are the recovery?" We reply, "Yes, we are the church, and we are the recovery. What are you?" They would have to say that they are Presbyterians or Methodists, but not the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S NAME AND HABITATION<br>BEING IN THE SPIRIT</H2><P>You may be wondering where Jerusalem is today. In order to answer this question, we must notice two things that Moses says repeatedly in Deuteronomy: that both God's name and God's habitation would be in the place which the Lord would choose. According to history, God has not had His name or His habitation in any place other than Jerusalem. Today God's habitation is in our spirit (Eph. 2:22), and we Christians are to meet in the name of the Lord (Matt. 18:20). Both the Lord's name and God's habitation are in our spirit. Thus, our spirit is today's Jerusalem where we should worship God. Do not despise your spirit, for it is today's Mount Zion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ONENESS ONLY IN THE SPIRIT</H2><P>If the children of Israel in ancient times had not cared for Mount Zion, they would have been divided. Only Mount Zion could keep the oneness of the children of Israel. Likewise, the real oneness of Christians today can be kept only in our spirit. If we would forget everything and turn to our spirit, we would be one. Christians are divided because they do not care for their spirit. Instead of caring for the spirit, they care for such things as foot washing, head covering, the ways of baptizing, and the type of bread or wine used at the Lord's table. They may debate and even fight with one another, but they do not care for their spirit. Many Christians do not even know that they have a spirit. Thus, they stay in their mind. If you stay in your mentality, you will never be one with other believers. Rather, you will fight with others. Because I realize that the mentality is so strong and so ugly, I often pray, "Lord, keep me in my spirit."</P><P>Because Christians stay in the mind, they are divided. If a thousand Christians were gathered together and each stayed in his mentality, there would be a thousand divisions. The reason many husbands and wives are not one is that they are in their independent mentality. For a wife to have a mind independent from that of her husband is divisive. Oneness is only in the spirit. As we have pointed out, oneness is the Holy Spirit who is in our spirit. Therefore, when we turn to our spirit, we are one. Today our spirit is the New Testament Jerusalem, the place where we have oneness.</P><P>In the spirit there is also the name of Jesus Christ. The reality of the name is the person, and the person is the Holy Spirit. If we turn to our spirit, our opinions and judgments will vanish. The only way to be attuned to the same mind and to the same opinion (1 Cor. 1:10, Gk.) is to turn to our spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IN SPIRIT AND IN REALITY</H2><P>When the Lord Jesus was talking to the Samaritan woman in John 4, she subtly changed the subject from the matter of her husband to the matter of the worship of God. She said, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship" (John 4:20). Her word indicated that she still held to the old concept found in Deuteronomy. The Lord Jesus answered, "An hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and reality" (John 4:23). The Lord's word about an hour coming indicates that the age has changed. The former age was the age of type, but now is the age of fulfillment. In type, Jerusalem was a figure of our human spirit, and the sacrifices used in the worship of God were figures of Christ. Christ is the reality of all these figures. For this reason, the Lord Jesus told the Samaritan woman that today we must worship God in our spirit and in reality. In the ancient times the people of God worshipped God in Jerusalem with the sacrifices, which typified Christ. But now we must worship God in spirit with Christ as the reality. Now we can understand that the worship of God must be in spirit and in reality.</P><P>If our worship is proper, we shall be in spirit and we shall offer Christ to God as the firstlings and firstfruits for God's satisfaction and for our satisfaction in the presence of God. This is real worship, the worship by feasting on Christ in the presence of God. Here in the spirit we maintain our oneness, and here we have no opinion, because we are not in the mind, but in the spirit. When we turn to our spirit, we have the presence of God, and we enjoy the riches of Christ. This is the proper worship in the unique place of worship, which is our spirit.</P><P>Our spirit is the only place where we can be one. Do you realize that in the spirit you have no opinion or dissension? In the spirit there is oneness. In our spirit there is the all-inclusive Spirit who is the oneness of the Body. If we would touch this oneness, we must turn to our spirit and remain in our spirit.</P><P>Today's Jerusalem is our spirit, and today's offerings are Christ as the reality. Thus, we need to worship God in our spirit and in the reality, which is Christ as all the offerings we present to God for His satisfaction. These offerings also satisfy us. In the spirit we have genuine worship and we maintain the unique oneness. This is the ground of the Lord's recovery, the site on which we can build the Body life, the ground on which the Body life can be practiced.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH</H1><P>In this message I have the burden to share concerning the ground of the church. It is difficult for the saints to be clear about this matter. Christians may talk about spirituality, the Body, and the building, but hardly anyone knows where to build. Not even the outstanding Christian teachers know where to build.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED FOR THE PROPER GROUND</H2><P>Let me relate a true story that illustrates this fact. Many of you are familiar with the books of Jessie Penn-Lewis on the subjective work of the cross. Anyone who knows the Lord's recovery will admit that her messages on the subjective work of the cross were part of the recovery. Before Mrs. Penn-Lewis was raised up by the Lord, not many Christians knew the subjective aspect of the Lord's cross clearly and adequately. A young Baptist pastor who had been somewhat influenced by modernistic teachings was made clear regarding the Lord's salvation through Mrs. Penn-Lewis's ministry. Later he became a co-worker with her. Eventually, this young pastor saw something beyond what Mrs. Penn-Lewis had seen. She had seen the subjective aspect of the cross, but he saw the principles of resurrection for the Body of Christ. What he saw was very deep. It was something about which others had had no concept. This young man worked together with Mrs. Penn-Lewis for some years, always considering her as his senior. But the day came when he could no longer work with her, and he left. Thus, the one work became two, the way of Mrs. Penn-Lewis and the way of this brother. He himself told me the story in detail. This story indicates that two spiritual persons who had seen something of so-called spirituality did not see the ground of the church. Neither of them had any ground for the work. Mrs. Penn-Lewis was suspended in the air and so was this brother.</P><P>Some time later I spent more than a month having fellowship with this brother day and night. Every contact between us lasted two or three hours. I eventually learned that he had no intention of knowing this matter of the ground. He simply would not give any heart, mind, or spirit to this matter. On the contrary, he was utterly closed to it. For more than thirty days I tried to convince him regarding the ground of the church, and he tried to convince me to abandon it. When he found that I would not leave it and when I learned that he had no intention of accepting it, we inwardly said good-bye to each other. That was the end of our fellowship. This took place approximately twenty years ago.</P><P>This illustration shows that if we do not have a definite site for building, yet we begin the work of building, we are doing something ridiculous. How ridiculous it is to prepare the materials for building and to begin the work of building, yet not to know the site of the building! Nothing is more foolish than this. Nevertheless, many Christians today are just this foolish.</P><P>We, however, need to be sober and to consider whose Christian work has the proper ground. You may ask whether or not the Baptist denomination has a ground. Yes, it has a definite ground, but the ground is wrong, because the Baptist Church takes as its ground baptism by immersion. This is the ground upon which the Baptist denomination is built. The Presbyterian denomination takes as its ground the presbytery. This ground, which is also divisive, is also wrong. I know of some cases of Presbyterian pastors who were immersed by Baptists in order to become the pastors of Baptist churches. Every denomination has a ground, but the ground is divisive. Today nearly all Christian workers are building on the wrong ground. For this reason, there is no genuine building whatever. Instead of unity, there are many divisions.</P><P>In the Bible it is clearly revealed that we Christians should be corporate and built up. But can you show me where the genuine building is today? It can hardly be found anywhere. Today's Christians have truckloads of building materials, but they are driving around looking for a place to unload them. Sometimes they unload the materials on the wrong site, and after a period of time they shift the materials to still another ground. This is the actual situation today.</P><P>I would ask you to check with the missionaries, the Christian workers, and those in the Navigators, Campus Crusade, and Inter-Varsity. In 1963 and 1964 I met a leader of a certain Christian work in Phoenix. On the campuses they were bringing a good number of young people to the Lord, but the young people then went to the denominations and became dead. Thus, some in this work recognized the need for the proper church life. At that time the book The Normal Christian Church Life had just been published in the United States. To a certain extent, these brothers agreed with it and were considering the practice of the church life. But they did not dare to take this step, for they realized that the denominations would withdraw their financial support if they were to do so. Deep within them, these leaders realized that their work had no ground. But because they feared the loss of financial support, they would not dare to practice the church life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ONE CITY, ONE CHURCH</H2><P>In this message I want to give you all, especially the young people, a clear map for your driving in the church life. I have been driving on this road for more than forty-five years. I can even tell you the way in my sleep. For our map, we shall use certain cities mentioned in the New Testament: Jerusalem, Antioch, Ephesus, and Corinth. As we all know, the church began in Jerusalem, and it was wonderful. There were not twelve churches in Jerusalem, one named after each of the twelve Apostles. No, there was just one church that included everyone. Acts 8:1 proves that the church in Jerusalem was uniquely one, for this verse speaks of "the church which was at Jerusalem." There were not many churches at Jerusalem, but one church, the church, at Jerusalem. The testimony of the church eventually spread north to Antioch through some saints who moved there from Jerusalem. Later Barnabas went there to edify them and brought Paul with him. As in Jerusalem, there was just one church in Antioch. Acts 13:1 says, "Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers." From Antioch the church spread to Asia Minor, where there were several churches in various cities. In Ephesus, for example, there was just one church. We know that in Ephesus there was not more than one church because Revelation 2:1 speaks of the church, not churches, in Ephesus. Through the ministry of Paul, the church spread from Asia Minor to Europe, and a church was established at Corinth. First Corinthians 1:2 says, "Unto the church of God which is at Corinth." Again we see the matter of one church in one city. According to the Bible, there was one church in Jerusalem, one in Antioch, one in Ephesus, and one in Corinth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DIVISIONS, SECTS, AND DENOMINATIONS</H2><P>However, the time came when the saints in the city of Corinth were divided into four groups. One group said that they were of Cephas; another, of Paul; another, of Apollos; and another, of Christ. These four groups were four divisions. If you read 1 Corinthians carefully, you will see that the Apostle Paul even called them sects. First Corinthians 11:19 says that there were sects among them (Gk.). We need to understand what a sect is. Suppose fifty Christians were meeting together. Due to the various choices, tastes, and preferences, they were divided, like the Corinthians, into four groups. One group was especially fond of Peter because he was the leading one of the twelve Apostles. Another group preferred Apollos because he was a scholar in the Scriptures. This group acknowledged that Peter was the leading apostle. But, they said, he was an uneducated fisherman, whereas Apollos was a scholar. Those in this group enjoyed Apollos's expounding of the Scriptures. The third group liked Paul better than Apollos because he had a direct contact with the Lord on the way to Damascus. The fourth group said that they were of Christ. Although these fifty Christians were divided into four groups, they continued to meet together. At first, their choices, tastes, and preferences simply made them four groups. But later these groups became divisions and after that, sects. However, they were not yet denominated. They were sects, but not denominations. Notice the development here. It goes from preferences to divisions to sects. Sects are like political parties. When the sects give themselves a name, they denominate themselves. In this way, the sects become denominations. Suppose the sect of Peter chose the name the church of Peter or the Petrine church. If they did this, they would immediately become a denomination. The same would be true of the sects of Paul, Apollos, and Christ. Thus, they would no longer be sects without a name, but denominations with a name. Hence, the development is firstly divisions, then sects, and finally denominations. If the four groups at Corinth had become denominations, they would have been exactly the same as the denominations which abound in today's Christianity. Christianity is filled not only with divisions and sects, but also with denominations.</P><P>We all need a clear understanding of divisions, sects, and denominations. In 1 Corinthians 11:18 and 19 Paul says, "For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. For there must be also sects among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you" (Gk.). The King James Version has the word "heresies" instead of "sects." "Heresy" is an anglicized form of a Greek word which means schools of opinion. Thus, in Greek, heresies means schools of opinion which form parties. A party, of course, is a sect. Therefore, we first have divisions and then sects. At the time of 1 Corinthians, however, there were no denominations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHURCH ON THE PROPER GROUND</H2><P>Originally, there was one church in Corinth, and all the saints in Corinth were part of the church in Corinth. But suppose the saints were divided into four churches: the church of Peter, the church of Apollos, the church of Paul, and the church of Christ. Suppose also that certain saints remained on the ground of the church at Corinth. Now suppose a brother came from Jerusalem to visit Corinth. As far as the church was concerned, he had no problem in Jerusalem, Antioch, and Ephesus, for in these cities the sphere of the church was the same as the jurisdiction of the locality. However, when he arrived at Corinth, he faced a difficulty. He would have to determine to which church he would go. Surely he would not go to the church of Cephas, the church of Apollos, the church of Paul, or even the church of Christ. He would meet with those standing as the church in Corinth because they had the proper ground. Suppose a leading brother of the church of Christ said to him, "I am a leader in the church of Christ and I would like to have fellowship with you. Are you not of Christ? And do you not think that I am of Christ also? Why would you not come to be with us? You say that we don't have the proper ground. But our ground is Christ, for we are the church of Christ. Christ is not divided. How then can you say that our ground is divisive? You claim that we divide ourselves from the other saints. But if you don't join us, then you divide yourself from us." However, the brother visiting from the church in Jerusalem would point out that the church on the proper ground, the church in Corinth, includes them both, for the sphere of the church in Corinth is greater than that of the church of Christ.</P><P>Those who say that they are of Christ would not agree with those who say they are of Peter, of Apollos, or of Paul. They would say, "The names Peter, Apollos, and Paul are the wrong names. We should not keep those names. Christ is the proper name. Hence, we are of Christ." However, Christ is the foundation, not the ground (1 Cor. 3:11). We need to see the difference between the foundation and the ground. The ground is the site upon which the building is constructed, whereas the foundation is the bottom part of the building itself. All the groups claim that their foundation is Christ. Even those who say that they are of Peter, of Apollos, and of Paul would claim that Christ is their foundation. However, they are all on different grounds. This means that they place their foundation on different sites. The proper ground is the ground of unity. It is correct to say that Christ is the foundation, but it is incorrect to say that He is the ground. For this reason, those who claim to be the church of Christ are building on the wrong ground.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THOSE ON THE PROPER GROUND<br>BEING THE CHURCH</H2><P>Today the situation regarding the church is cloudy. But for us the sky is clear. We are members of the Body, and the Body is universal. This universal Body has just one expression in a city. Thus, there should be just one church in a city. It was this way in Jerusalem, in Antioch, and also in Ephesus. But it is not this way in our locality today. Therefore, we must exercise our discernment to discover who is meeting on the proper ground of unity.</P><P>Let us go further and suppose that the church of Peter had two thousand members, that the church of Apollos had four thousand, that the church of Paul had three thousand, that the church of Christ had five hundred, and that those meeting as the church in Corinth had only fifteen. Those in the church in Corinth might say, "We are so small in number. The other groups have anywhere from five hundred to four thousand, but we have only fifteen. What shall we do? Can we say that we are the church? The church in Corinth should include all the saints. But the vast majority of them are not with us. How can we say that we are the church?" In such a situation many would be weakened and reluctant to claim that they are the church in Corinth. If those standing on the ground of unity numbered five thousand, they would all be bold to say that they are the church in Corinth. But if the number were small, perhaps only fifteen, they would be weakened in this matter and afraid to say that they are the church. Nevertheless, the fifteen saints standing on the church ground are the church. If they are not the church, then what would you call them?</P><P>We need to be clear that the standing of the church does not depend upon any terms or conditions, but only upon the ground of unity. The ground of unity is the ground of locality. Wherever we Christians are, we should be the church in that place. If we are in London, Paris, New York, or Los Angeles, we should simply be the church in that city. Today the situation is confused and divided. Thus, we need to be recovered back to the genuine unity. The genuine unity is the unique oneness, the oneness of the ground. We need to be clear about this so that wherever we are, we shall be nothing other than part of the church in that locality. Being the church is not a matter of how many saints there are. Even if there are just a small number coming together in a particular city, they are the church in that locality. For more than forty-five years I have been standing on this ground. The more I preach and teach it, the more bold I am to say that those standing on the proper ground are the church in that locality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO SPECIAL NAME</H2><P>Now we need to see how a group of Christians becomes a denomination. The most striking feature of all denominations is their special names. Every denomination has a particular name, such as the Church of Christ, the Baptist Church, the Presbyterian Church, or the Lutheran Church. Once a group assumes a special name, it has become a denomination, for taking such a designation separates that group from all other groups.</P><P>At this point I need to say strongly that the term local church is not a name. We do not have a name. When people ask you what kind of church we are, you should simply say, "We are just the church. To ask me what kind of church we are is like asking what kind of moon we are. The moon is uniquely one. When the moon is in London, it is called the moon in London. When the moon appears over Cleveland, it is called the moon in Cleveland. In the same way, we say that we are the church in Cleveland or the church in Los Angeles." But such terms are not a name. Rather, they are a description of a fact. Thus, we should never use the term the local church in a way that others might regard it as a name. The local church denotes the nature of the church. We do not have a sectarian church or a so-called universal church. The churches in the Lord's recovery are churches in localities. For this reason they are referred to as local churches. But the words "the local church" are not a name, and we are not a denomination. Do not use these terms as if they were a name. At most we should say, "We are the church in Cleveland. The church in Cleveland, of course, includes all the believers in Cleveland. However, because most Christians in Cleveland will not be recovered back to the proper ground of the church, we are the only ones still remaining as the church in Cleveland. But we do not have a special name."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO SPECIAL TEACHING OR PRACTICE</H2><P>Every denomination also has a special teaching or practice. For example, the Southern Baptists practice baptism by immersion and insist that you be baptized by them. If you are not willing to be immersed by them, they will not accept you as a member. For them, the receiving of the believers is not based upon the faith, but based upon the baptism they practice. Likewise, certain Pentecostal groups will not receive those believers who do not speak in tongues. Hence, their kind of so-called church is built upon the ground of speaking in tongues. Speaking in tongues is their special practice and teaching. This special practice constitutes them a sect. Regarding baptism, the Church of Christ is even stronger than the Southern Baptists. They claim that if you are not immersed by them, you are not even saved and thus cannot be accepted by them. In like manner, if you would join the Seventh-day Adventists, you must agree to keep the Sabbath day and to tithe. Otherwise, you will not be accepted as a member. This particular practice constitutes them a sect.</P><P>Today there are a great many independent groups. Nearly every group has particular terms as a requirement for being accepted into that group. Although some would not say this, they hold such a particular term in secret. Eventually, when you desire to become a member, they will reveal the terms for being received by them. They may say, "It is very good that you want to join us. But in order to be a member of this group, you must agree to this teaching or practice." Any group like this is a sect.</P><P>There are no such terms for being accepted into the churches. The only condition is that we believe in the Lord Jesus and are saved by faith. As long as you have been saved through faith, you have already been received. The church receives the saints whom God has received without imposing on them any particular terms. If you believe in the Lord Jesus and are saved, you are a saint. A saint is a saved one. As long as you have been saved, justified, redeemed, and regenerated, you are a saint, a holy one. Because you are a saint already, the church receives you without requiring any special conditions or terms. You were accepted by the church when you believed in the Lord Jesus.</P><P>We need to be careful of the independent groups that are imitating the churches. These groups claim that they have no special terms for receiving the believers. However, if you examine these groups carefully, you will find some hidden conditions for being accepted by them. But we in the churches can testify that we have no particular terms whatever for acceptance. Some may ask whether calling on the name of the Lord is a term. No, it is not a condition of being accepted. If you enjoy calling on the name of the Lord, then call on His name. But if you do not like it, then do not call. As long as you believe in the Lord Jesus, you are a saint, and we receive you. Others may claim that pray-reading is a term for being accepted into the church. No, pray-reading is not necessary for salvation, and thus it is not a condition of acceptance. I repeat, the churches have no special terms. Any group that has a special condition, either a special teaching or practice, for the receiving of the saints, is a sect.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO SPECIAL FELLOWSHIP</H2><P>Every sect or denomination has a special fellowship. But we Christians should have just one unique and common fellowship, the fellowship of the Lord Jesus Christ (1 Cor. 1:9). When we were saved, we were brought into the fellowship of the Lord. Therefore, as Christians we can have fellowship with one another. The denominations, however, have a special fellowship. For example, when certain Southern Baptists learn that others are Presbyterians, they would stop having fellowship with them. They may talk with them about business or politics, but they will not have fellowship in common concerning spiritual things. Those who insist upon the practice of foot washing also have a special fellowship, for they limit their fellowship to those within their own circle. Others limit their fellowship to those who have the same practice regarding the wine or juice used at the Lord's table. All this is sectarian, and we must abandon it. We must abandon all special names, special teachings, special practices, and special fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO SEPARATE ADMINISTRATION</H2><P>In a particular locality there may be a group of Christians who have no special name, special practice, special teaching, or special fellowship. However, they may still have an administration separate from the church in that city. If so, that group is a sect. In addition to the local church in a city, an independent group may come into being that in nearly every respect is the same as the church. But that group may still insist upon having a separate administration. This is like having two city halls in the same city. But there should be just one city hall in a city. If there is more than one, it is a sign of division. If a group of Christians has truly seen the ground of unity, they will say, "We cannot have a separate administration. We must have one administration with the church that is already in this city." As long as there is a city hall, it is impossible to have another one. If you insist upon a separate city hall, you are a division.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WILLING TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP<br>WITH ALL THE LOCAL CHURCHES</H2><P>Perhaps there is a group that has no special name, teaching, or fellowship and that does not insist upon its own administration. We still need to examine whether or not they are willing to open themselves to have fellowship with all the other local churches on earth. Suppose those in this group say, "We have nothing special and we do not have a separate administration, but we don't like to have fellowship with the other churches." If they say this, then they have become a local sect. They are no longer a local church, for a local church is part of the Body, one among many other local churches. Thus, a genuine local church must be open to the other churches. If they isolate themselves from the other churches, they are a local sect.</P><P>We need to study any group according to these five items. Today is a day of division and confusion, and we should not accept any group blindly. Rather, we must check whether or not they have a special name, a special teaching, or a special practice. We need to see whether or not they insist upon their own administration, and we must inquire if they are open to all the local churches throughout the world. If they pass all these tests, then they are a genuine local church. But if they cannot pass them, we must hesitate as far as recognizing them as a church is concerned.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO DIVISIONS AMONG US</H2><P>Since we are in the Lord's recovery and are practicing the Body life, we must be clear concerning what we are. We are definitely not a division. Furthermore, we have no divisions among us. The church in Corinth was not a division, and they were not a sect. However, sorry to say, there were divisions among them. We need to be careful about this. We in the Lord's recovery are not a division. But it is possible that in a local church there may be divisions. Some may speak one thing, and others may speak something different; yet they are all in the same locality. This is division. For example, the brothers in a certain place are standing on the ground of unity. Thus, they are not a division. But it is possible that there could be division among them. They may not be in harmony, and there may be different factions among them. Some may hold to one opinion, and others may cling to a different opinion. Perhaps you do not consider this a division. Although it may not yet be an actual division, it is something very close to division. At least such things are the seeds of division. Therefore, we all must be honest before the Lord. We should not be a division, and we should not have any divisions among us. We must chase away every shadow of division and dig out any seeds of division. The Lord's recovery is mainly a recovery of the oneness. If we are still a division or have divisions among us, we are no longer in the Lord's recovery. As long as we are involved in division, we cannot be in the Lord's recovery. Rather, we are part of the repetition of the history of Christianity. This is a serious matter. If we lose our harmony, our genuine oneness, we lose the recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DISCERNING THE BODY</H2><P>In 1 Corinthians 11 Paul says that if there are divisions among us, then in our coming together for the Lord's table, we come together not for the better, but for the worse (1 Cor. 11:17). First Corinthians 11:20 says, "When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper." We may attend the Lord's table without discerning the Body (1 Cor. 11:29). Anyone who eats and drinks at the Lord's table without discerning the Body eats and drinks judgment to himself (1 Cor. 11:29, Gk.). This, of course, is not a profit, but a loss. Whenever we come to the Lord's table, we must discern the Body. In 1 Corinthians 11:29 the Body does not denote the Lord's physical body that was crucified on the cross, but His mystical Body. At the Lord's table the body has two aspects. One aspect denotes the Lord's physical body, and the other denotes the mystical Body of Christ. We all need to discern Christ's mystical Body. Whenever we touch the loaf at the Lord's table, we must realize that the loaf denotes this unique Body. Because the loaf denotes the mystical Body, there should be no divisions among us. If we are still involved in division, yet we partake of the loaf, it will not be a profit to us, but a loss. Every time we come to the Lord's table we must examine ourselves and ask, "Am I divisive? If I am, I should refrain from partaking of the Lord's table. If I partake of the Lord's table when I am involved in something divisive, it will not be a profit to me. I will not come to the table for the better [profit], but for the worse [loss]." This is an extremely serious matter.</P><P>Never consider division an insignificant thing. We must take the Lord's table in a reverent way and in fear, lest we touch the Lord's Body without discernment. We need to discern that what we are about to partake of is the unique Body of Christ. In this unique Body there must not be any division. If I am not involved in division, then I shall have the peace and a clear conscience to touch the Lord's Body. May this matter be made clear to all the churches.</P><P>The Lord's recovery is neither a movement nor a division. Those of every age must be together in harmony. We are not a division, and there are no divisions among us. Rather, we are the testimony of the one Body and the one Spirit. Whenever we come to the Lord's table, we declare to the whole universe that we are one, that we have come out of division and that there are no divisions among us. When we touch the one loaf, which signifies the unique Body of Christ in the universe, we must have the witness in our conscience that we are not involved in division. If we do not have a clear conscience regarding division when we touch the Lord's table, we shall suffer, for we shall eat and drink without discerning the Body. This will not be profitable to us. May the Lord have mercy upon us that whenever we come to the Lord's table, we shall exercise our conscience to determine whether or not we are involved in something divisive.</P><P>Because today is a day of confusion and division, we must discern what group of Christians is the genuine testimony of the one Body. Then we ourselves must be certain not to have any seed of division or source of division among us. If there is no division among us, our conscience will be clear, and we shall bear a strong testimony of the Lord's Body to the universe. Then the Lord's blessing will be upon us.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A FEW CRUCIAL MATTERS<br>CONCERNING THE CHURCH LIFE</H1><P>In this message I would like to cover a number of miscellaneous matters pertaining to the Body. The first concerns doctrine.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TWO CLASSES OF DOCTRINE</H2><P>Doctrine is not necessarily a negative thing, for the Bible is composed of doctrine. However, we need to differentiate between the two classifications of doctrine. The first class contains those doctrines that are not divisive, whereas the second class includes the doctrines that are divisive. Certain doctrines, those which constitute our faith, are basic. However, there are many other doctrines that are not basic.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE COMMON FAITH</H2><P>Our faith is constituted with certain basic doctrines. First, we all must believe that God is one yet triune&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Anyone who does not believe that God is uniquely one yet triune is in error. This doctrine of God is not divisive; rather, it is basic, and all Christians must believe it. Second, we all must believe that our God became incarnated in the Son. This means that the Son of God became incarnated as a man. Anyone who does not believe this cannot be saved. Third, we all must believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God incarnated as a man, lived on earth and died on the cross for our sins to secure our redemption. On the third day He was resurrected from the dead both physically and spiritually, and today He is our Savior, our Lord in resurrection, and our life. If we believe in Him, our sins are forgiven, He comes into us as our life, and we are regenerated. All the regenerated ones are the unique church. In whatever locality they reside, they are the local expression of the universal church. Finally, all the saints in the churches are waiting for the Lord Jesus to come back to receive them to Himself. These are the basic doctrines, the doctrines that constitute the saving faith, the doctrines we must believe in order to be saved. Because every sound, genuine believer holds these basic doctrines, they are called the common faith (Titus 1:4). There is hardly any argument among saints regarding them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>INSISTING ONLY ON THE BASIC DOCTRINES</H2><P>In addition to these basic doctrines, the Bible contains many other doctrines. Although these other doctrines are necessary and important, they are not the basic doctrines which constitute the faith. From the time of the Reformation until today, a great many divisions have come into being. Nearly all these divisions have been caused by different doctrines. Not one division was created by a basic doctrine, for none of the basic doctrines divides the saints. The divisions have been caused by the various divisive doctrines. Thus, we must be careful regarding this. We in the Lord's recovery insist upon the basic doctrines that constitute the faith. If anyone does not hold to these basic doctrines, he is not a genuine believer, and he is not saved. However, apart from the basic doctrines, we do not insist on any other doctrines. Are things such as speaking in tongues, pray-reading, foot washing, and calling on the name of the Lord basic doctrines? Certainly not. None of these doctrines constitutes the faith. Whether or not you practice speaking in tongues, pray-reading, or calling on the name of the Lord does not affect your salvation. As long as you believe that God is one yet triune, that the Son of God was incarnated as a man, that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins, that He was resurrected on the third day, and that He is coming again, you are saved and you are a member of the church. Someone may never pray-read or speak in tongues; yet if he has the common faith, he is saved. But if you do not believe the basic doctrines, you are not saved, even if your feet have been washed a thousand times.</P><P>To take another example, the doctrine of the kingdom is not a basic doctrine in the Bible. Some Brethren teachers say that the kingdom has been suspended. But the Bible reveals that the kingdom is here today. But the young people must be warned not to go out and teach this particular view of the kingdom as a local church doctrine. Furthermore, the matter of exercising the spirit is not a basic doctrine. I am concerned that some of the young ones may insist that others believe that the kingdom is here today and that all others must pray-read, call on the name of the Lord, and exercise their spirit. If the young people do this, they will be sectarian. We should not insist on any of these things.</P><P>Recently, a brother told me that a few saints are concerned that the churches using the life-study messages may become life-study message sects. We have no intention of forcing the churches to use the life-study messages. If they do not have the appetite for these messages, they should not use them. Using them, however, does not make the churches a sect any more than eating chicken or drinking milk makes us sectarian. We eat and drink when we are hungry. It should be the same with respect to the life-study messages. Any church that does not use the life-study messages is still a church.</P><P>It is the same with pray-reading or calling on the name of the Lord. If you do not feel the need to pray-read, then don't try to do it. No one will exclude you because you do not care to pray-read.</P><P>Likewise, if a church is very sleepy and sloppy, it is still the church. If those in a particular church believe that all Christians will be raptured at the same time, they are still the church. But others, including me, believe that the overcomers will be raptured first, whereas the defeated ones will pass through the great tribulation. However, those who believe that all Christians will be raptured at the same time and those who believe that the overcomers will be raptured first are both part of the church. It is not the case that those who believe in the early rapture of the overcomers are the church and that those who believe in the simultaneous rapture of all Christians are not the church. Whether a church is sober or sloppy, it is still the church.</P><P>We should not insist on any doctrines apart from the doctrines that constitute the faith. However, we still need to know the pure Word and walk according to it. We do not want to be sloppy or loose or remain under the influence prevailing among today's Christians. I hope that we all can differentiate between these two categories of doctrines. The local church is built upon the oneness according to the Spirit and according to the locality. It is absolutely not built on doctrines such as the doctrines concerning the kingdom of the heavens, pray-reading, or the exercise of the spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO SELF-ASSUMED AUTHORITY</H2><P>Now I wish to say a word concerning the leadership in the local churches. Among us there is no self-assumed authority. It is a shame for anyone among us to assume authority or to desire to be a leader. In Matthew 20:25-27, the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, "You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. It is not so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave." Anyone who desires to be great should serve the saints as a slave. The church is different from the world. In the world the kings rule over the people, but in the church the highest ones must be slaves. All the elders must be the servants of the churches. If anyone desires to assume authority or to have a certain rank or position, that is a shame. The most shameful thing is the seeking of rank, position, or title. This is a shame not only to the person seeking it, but to the whole recovery. Our spirit must reject and condemn this seeking for position. Paul may be considered the greatest Apostle, but he was one who labored as a slave to serve the churches and to take care of them. According to the New Testament, the elders are not those who assume authority for themselves; on the contrary, they are the serving ones, the laboring ones. We all must be clear that among us we do not agree with the seeking of rank, position, or title. Rather, we must forsake this shameful practice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FOLLOWING THE LEADING ONES</H2><P>We have seen one aspect of the matter of authority, and now we must consider another aspect. Hebrews 13:17 says, "Obey the ones leading you and submit to them." Three times in Hebrews 13 there are references to the leading ones (vv. 7, 17, and 24). We thank the Lord that in His recovery He has given us a number of leading ones. The elders are leading ones, those who take the lead. The elders must take the lead in everything, including the cleaning of the rest rooms in the meeting hall. An elder should not give orders and expect the saints to work as slaves in cleaning the meeting hall. If one of the elders feels that the rest room needs to be cleaned, he should take the lead to clean it. When the saints see what the elders are doing, they should follow them. To obey is to follow, to submit to the one leading. However, this definitely does not mean that the elders are rulers and that all the saints are subjects submitting to them. This concept is utterly wrong. Rather, the elders, the leading ones in the church, should take the lead. But once the lead has been established, there is no need for the elders to continue doing that particular thing. Some elders enjoy giving orders to others without doing anything themselves. Other elders like to do everything themselves. Even if they clean a rest room, they prefer to do it alone, not allowing others to share in this task. Thus, the elders may either give orders and do nothing, or they may do everything themselves. Instead of either of these extremes, the brothers should set an example, establish the lead, and then leave the matter to the saints and allow them to do it. In item after item the elders need to do this.</P><P>When the elders are taking a proper lead, the saints should not merely say, "Praise the Lord for the diligent elders who do everything for us! They sweep the yard, vacuum the carpet, and clean the rest rooms. There is nothing left for us to do but enjoy the Lord." Sometimes the saints may even criticize or condemn the elders. Certain saints do not want to do anything. They prefer to let the elders do everything. This is abnormal. The elders should take the lead humbly and set an example, and all the saints should follow them. If the elders clean the meeting hall or mow the lawn, the saints should do the same. This is what the Bible means when it says for us to obey the leading ones and to submit to them. If the elders set an example and establish the lead and the saints follow them, the Lord's testimony will spread, and all the saints will be brought into function. This is the correct understanding of leadership in the New Testament.</P><P>According to the New Testament, there are no rulers and subjects in the church. Rather, we all are brothers (Matt. 23:8). In the New Testament to rule means to take the lead, and to be under the rule means to follow the lead and submit to the lead. This is the kingdom of the heavens on earth today. It is vastly different from any earthly empire or administration. In the practice of the church life, some take the lead and set an example and then the saints follow. Among us, there is no hierarchy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEARNING NOT TO TEACH DIFFERENTLY</H2><P>Furthermore, in the church life we all need to learn not to teach differently (1 Tim. 6:3-5). Anything that causes dissension or division or creates differing opinions must be avoided. We need to go on according to healthy teaching and not be sick about "questions and strifes of words" (1 Tim. 6:4, Gk.). Because we are all for the recovery, we should not teach differently. We are not for doctrines that may stir up opinions about things such as the rapture or the kingdom. Although I teach regarding these things, I do not encourage you to argue with others about them. If anyone wants to argue, you should simply say, "Brother, you just believe according to your way. That is not a problem to me. However, I have a different belief about the rapture." There is no need to argue with anyone. Be at peace with others and do not create an atmosphere that leads to debate or controversy regarding doctrine.</P><P>As we have pointed out, we should not insist on pray-reading or calling on the name of the Lord. Some may come who love the church and have seen something concerning the church, but who may not feel positively about pray-reading or calling on the Lord's name. Therefore, you should not force them to do this. Wait until they feel the need for it. For example, I may have a gold watch and someone else, a toy watch. My grandchildren may prefer a toy watch to a gold watch. If I take their toy watch away from them, they will be very unhappy and cry. I have learned to wait until they grow. Eventually, when they have grown, they will appreciate my gold watch. Do not argue with others. Instead, wait, keep quiet, and let them grow. Let them play with their toy watch until they are ready for a different kind of watch.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO NEED FOR UNIFICATION</H2><P>There is no need for unification in the churches. Perhaps one church may practice pray-reading and another church may not. Do not endeavor to make the churches the same. The church life is not like an army or school; it is like a family. Some churches may be like the children in the family. But there is no need to argue with a childish church. Rather, we should treasure such a church, for it is so new and so fresh, yet so childish. Do not try to make other churches the same as yours. To do that is to pluck up a tender sprout and cause it to die. Leave the sprout in the earth and let it grow. Perhaps the church in your locality has been growing for a number of years and has reached a high standard. However, another church may not have come to that standard. Other churches may be rather sickly. However, whatever the case, do not uproot it. Instead, you should nourish it. Any attempt to unify the churches is wrong.</P><P>Furthermore, in any particular church we should not try to unify the saints. If you do this, you will get into difficulty. The fleshly mentality wants everyone and everything the same. It does not like to see the naughty young ones jumping and making noise. But a healthy family is a noisy family. In a normal family the children are playing and making noise. Some of the children may be crying and some of the naughty boys may even be fighting with each other. This is a normal, healthy situation. A number of times in the churches certain ones came to me and accused each other in my presence. However, I justified everyone and said, "I justify you because you are at the age for fighting. If you do not fight, then you must be sick." I have learned this lesson from my grandchildren. If they are not naughty, it must be that they are ill. Whenever they are too quiet, I wonder what is wrong with them. The elders need to learn not to take sides. Instead, they should justify all those who are fighting and leave them alone. The more they fight, the more they will eat; the more they eat, the more they will grow; and the more they grow, the more they will fight. This is a cycle. The fighting helps the eating, the eating helps the growing, and the growing in turn helps the fighting. All the young ones grow in this way. This may frighten some of the older ones, but this is the way the young people grow.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BEAUTY OF THE CHURCH LIFE</H2><P>This does not mean, however, that any should be dissenting. Although you may fight with someone, you should still love him because you are both in the same church. We love one another because we are in the same recovery, in the same testimony. Quite often I have surprised the elders in certain churches by telling them that there is no need for them to condemn certain things. Do not try to unify the church and make everyone the same. The old people are the old people, the young people are the young people, and the naughty ones are the naughty ones. No matter how hard you try, you can never make the girls into boys or the boys, girls. All boys will be naughty and all girls under the age of ten will be nice. The nicest children are girls under ten, and the naughtiest are boys under ten. But both the nice girls and the naughty boys are lovely. This is the beauty of a family. In the church life we must recognize the fact that we have the nice sisters and the naughty brothers. This is the beauty of the church life. As long as we maintain our oneness, we shall be harmonious and see the beauty, even when we are fighting. Although we are fighting, we are still harmonious. This may sound like a strange word, but it nonetheless is true. There is fighting, but no dissenting. We are for the one recovery, for the one testimony. No matter how much we fight, our fighting is for the good of the recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DEALING WITH OPPOSERS</H2><P>I would also like to say a word regarding dealing with those who oppose us. Do not consider any opposer a hopeless case. Rather, we should treat opposition as a golden opportunity. Every opposer is a good "fish." Because of this, we need to change our concept concerning the opposers.</P><P>Dealing with the opposers will expose our motive. If our intention is simply to convince people and to gain them for our work, our motive is not pure. Our motive must be solely for the living testimony of Jesus. Whether or not a particular opposer will take this way does not matter. Our responsibility is to seize the opportunity to make the Lord's testimony clear to him. When we contact an opposer, we may have deep within us the intention to capture him. We need to forget about such an intention. We should be motivated, not by the desire for the increase of the local churches, but by the testimony of Jesus. We are not here for the increase of the local churches; we are for the bright, shining, strong, and aggressive testimony of Jesus. We do not care whether or not people come this way, agree with us, or follow us. We care only for the testimony of Jesus. We would never hide or conceal this testimony, but we would take every opportunity to manifest it to others. Often I hear the saints saying that certain ones are good material and that we should seek to gain them for the church. This exposes our motive. We are not here for this. To repeat, we are here to be a bright and shining testimony of Jesus. We must be able to shine and to present what we are enjoying to others. Whether or not they accept it is up to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING PREPARED<br>TO GIVE AN ANSWER</H2><P>In dealing with opposers, we need to prepare ourselves by reading the many books we have printed. One brother read a certain book against us and was poisoned by it. But then he read our books and was helped.</P><P>The opposers are fond of twisting my words. Yes, in one of my books I said that the church is one with the Triune God. Thus, the Triune God and the church are four in one. The Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in the church. This is four in one. But the opposers twist this sentence and say that we deify the church and worship it. What a perversion! To understand the one sentence you need to read not only the entire paragraph, but also the whole book. It is not fair to isolate a sentence or a phrase. Everything printed by us has been thoroughly considered. Usually it is the result of years of study and experience. We have the full assurance that whatever we put in print is according to the Scriptures.</P><P>The Bible is the basis for whatever we say. In its attack upon us, The Mindbenders does not quote from the Bible. The accusations leveled against us in that book are based on historic Christianity, not the Bible. We follow the Bible, not history. If Martin Luther had followed the historic church, there would not have been the recovery of justification by faith.</P><P>If possible, read all our books. When you meet an opposer who isolates certain sentences and twists our words, go to the book and read it yourself. Be prepared. Then you will know how to answer others.</P><P>First Peter 3:15 says, "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear." The Greek word rendered "answer" in this verse means an answer given as a defense. In order to give such an answer, you must know what we are standing for and what we are enjoying. Then when the opposers ask certain things, you will be able to make your defense and you will know how to answer. This cannot be done without preparation. Someone may say to you, "Why do you say that you are the church and that other groups are not the church?" This question requires a long answer; it cannot be answered superficially. In order to answer a question like this, you need to be prepared.</P><P>As you face the opposers, do not argue and lose your temper. No matter how much others may accuse and oppose, do not be angry with them, but be pleasant and patient. Do not consider anyone an enemy or a hopeless case. Rather, do your best to help others understand what we are enjoying and leave the results to the Lord.</P><P>Let us now summarize the points covered in this message. We should insist upon the basic doctrines, those that constitute the faith and are necessary for salvation, but not on any other doctrines. Among us there should be no assuming of authority or desire for rank, position, or title. Also, there should be no obedience or submission according to the worldly way. Instead, we all must learn to walk in the spirit. The elders should take the lead, and the rest should follow. If we do all these things, the Lord's testimony will spread. Then others, the opposers in particular, need to be helped. We should not consider them as enemies or hopeless cases, but love them and try our best to present to them what we are enjoying of the Lord. By helping others and by presenting what we are enjoying to them, we ourselves shall learn a great deal. Perhaps today you may not know very much. But if you have the heart to present things to others, month after month you will learn more and you will grow not only in life, but also in knowledge. This will help the Lord's recovery to go on. The ones you contact may never turn this way. But through your presentation, they will be enlightened and perhaps even convinced and subdued. At least, their opposition will be calmed down, and they will not oppose you so fiercely. No matter how many books are written against us, eventually all the Christians will realize that those in the local churches are holy ones, those who believe in the holy Word, walk in the spirit, and follow the Lord in His way. The consciences even of the opposers will testify to this. Let us go on boldly. Let us love one another as brothers and go on together for the Lord's testimony. We should also love the outsiders, help them, and present the Lord's testimony to them. Then the Lord's presence will be with us, and His blessing will be upon us.</P></body></html>
