   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RELATED TO CHANGING THE SYSTEM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer: Lord Jesus, we worship You.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thank You that by Your sovereignty You have gathered us together once again.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do treasure this time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, we offer up our worship, thanksgiving, and praise for Your recovery, for Your move among us, and for Your leading.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, bless this meeting, and fill this meeting with Yourself and Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, multiply Your blessing to us moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let others see that You are in our midst, that You have a recovery on earth, and that this recovery is Your testimony, Your move, and Your spread on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, open our hearts in the same way that You have opened up Yourself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Grant us an open sky.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>May there be no veil, no shadow, and no hindrance within us, and may we be altogether shining within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, remove all barriers and veils between You and us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Speak to us, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We consecrate our hearts to You.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We consecrate our entire being to You.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We consecrate this entire move to You as a living sacrifice to satisfy Your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May You spread outward from us, and may You gain a free way through us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Lord, may none of us become a hindrance to You, and may there be no limitations or frustrations in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Manifest Your victory through us once again.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>May the victory at Calvary be realized, applied, and manifested once more through us today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May the enemy be shamed once more.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Lord, this is Your move.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You want to gain not only this land but also the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We thank You that there are hundreds of golden lampstands on the earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Bless Your work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We would like to see a brand new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Lord, gain us, beginning from Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Gain every church and every saint.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May every one of us be like David, who was according to Your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>May Your light shine brighter and brighter, and may it be like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until the full day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Lord, glorify Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Bind the power of darkness in Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Bind the evil one, Satan, Your enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Bind everything that opposes, destroys, and counters Your move.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Lord, we exercise Your prevailing name to release Your children and loose the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Lord, this is Your promise.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You have promised us that whatever we bind will be already bound in heaven, and whatever we loose will be already loosed in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Lord, release Your life, Your truth, and Your Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Your victorious name and according to Your word, we command You to act according to Your own glory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Lord, release Your riches, Your all-inclusive and unlimited Being, through Your victorious name.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Lord, we ask You to look at the situation on this earth!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Destroy the power of darkness so that You can carry out the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in all the places.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May all those who call on Your name be not only saved but also fully saturated and fully gained through the divine dispensing of the Triune God, and may this hasten Your coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Lord, we worship You and give all the glory and honor to You.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We acknowledge You as the Head, both of the church and of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We call upon heaven and earth to testify to the fact that You have a recovery on this earth and that there are some who have placed themselves on the altar to satisfy Your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Lord, move freely without any hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE CHANGE OF THE SYSTEM</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have been under the Lord s new leading since October 1984.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>During this past year and a half, we have seen the Lord s manifold blessings, both in an obvious and visible way and in a hidden and invisible way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this meeting I would like to present a summary and some concluding observations.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I believe all of us are clear that the Lord gave us this fresh leading to bring in an increase in number in all the localities and to spread the work over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Increase is a matter of number, and spreading is a matter of land.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>During the past year and a half, we have been following the Lord s leading step by step and have not paid much attention to the spreading; that must wait for a future date.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although we have not been as strong as we would like, we have done our best to take care of the increase in the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Taipei we began the practice of turning from the small group meetings to the home meetings at the beginning of this year.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Within three months the number in attendance increased from three thousand to more than five thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is a sixty to seventy percent increase.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although the rate of increase has not come up to our expectation, it is nevertheless a great encouragement to us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now under the Lord s new leading, we must pay attention to the building up of the church in all the localities by increasing our number.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then we should spread out upon this basis of building and increase.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I do not know how clear the brothers from different places have been concerning the new leading of the Lord in the vision of building and increase in the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Over the past eighteen months I believe we have seen something concerning this new leading from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What concerns me is that there may be a great difference in the degree to which we have seen the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This may be compared to taking an examination; some may obtain a score of sixty, and others a score of one hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I would, therefore, like to present once more in a concise way the vision of the Lord s new leading which He has shown us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The aim of this new leading of the Lord is to totally deliver His recovery from the element, essence, background, environment, and tradition of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is a deliverance from the inside out.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Although this was the vision we saw sixty years ago, we have not yet fully and completely purged ourselves from Christianity; we are still dragging our feet, even after sixty years of struggling and striving.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In 1984 I realized that we had actually moved backward rather than forward.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Some things, which we had previously dropped, were picked up again.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This disturbed me to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>So I considered the situation very soberly before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>At that time I was observing the situation not only in the Far East and Taiwan, but also in the United States and other areas in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I noticed that the main reason the Lord could not move much among us was that to a great extent we were still very much affected by the poison brought in by the element, essence, background, environment, and tradition of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Outwardly, we had rejected all the things of Christianity, but as far as the inward essence was concerned, to a large extent we were still entangled in these things.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I received the commission from the Lord to change the system, beginning from Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When I returned to Taiwan from the United States in October of 1984, I told the American brothers that this return to Taiwan would be different from all of my past visits.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I wanted to have a brand new beginning with the view that the Lord would have a definite model for His entire recovery, a model that would satisfy His heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I initiated a thorough change as soon as I arrived in Taiwan.</S>
