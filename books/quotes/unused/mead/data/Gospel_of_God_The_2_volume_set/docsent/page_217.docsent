   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Hence, strictly speaking, this portion is not for us at all.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If some say that after a man receives the Lord Jesus and sins willfully, he will perish, this will contradict the context of the passage; it will also contradict the entire book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The speaking here is about a doctrinal issue.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hebrews shows us that besides the name of Jesus Christ, "there is salvation in no other, for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved" Acts 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This does not mean that a Christian will go to hell if he sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hebrews 10:27 says, "But a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fervor of fire, which is to consume the adversaries."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After receiving the knowledge of the truth, and after having a clear knowledge that the Lord Jesus Christ is the God-ordained sacrifice for sins, if the Jewish believers forsake the assembling of themselves and reject Christ, and if they go back to Judaism to look for other sacrifices for sins, there will no longer remain any sacrifice for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They can only expect judgment in fear and the fervor of fire that consumes the adversaries.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before they were saved, they could depend on bulls and goats to atone for their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But after they realize that the Lord Jesus is the only Savior, they cannot depend on bulls and goats anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If they reject the Lord Jesus, they can only expect a fearful judgment and fervor of fire about to consume the adversaries.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They can only take the Lord Jesus as the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Besides Him, there is no other way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All of the bulls and goats point to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Bulls and goats are but types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the reality of the bulls and goats.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is impossible for them to reject the reality of the bulls and goats and ask for the types instead.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, Hebrews 10:26-27 never says that after a person is saved he may still perish.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is man's twisting of God's truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we read the Bible, we have to read what is there instead of reading into it what is not there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Someone asked me once how he could understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I answered that to understand the Bible, we must first be those who do not understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do not understand, then we will understand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we say that we know this and that, then we are not sober-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once we are not sober-minded, we will have problems.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hebrews 6 and 10 should be as easy and simple and clear as John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reason the human mind is unclear is that man puts his own words into the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many people find it difficult to read the Bible, not because the Bible is unclear, but because in their minds they have prejudices and preconceived ideas.</S>
