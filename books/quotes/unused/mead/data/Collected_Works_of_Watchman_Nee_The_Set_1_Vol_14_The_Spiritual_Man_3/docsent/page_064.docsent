   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Paul's word in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 also shows us that prolonged sickness is not God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The condition of the body should match the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If our spirit and soul become sanctified wholly and preserved complete without blame, but our body is still weak, sick, and full of affliction, God will definitely not be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His goal is to save man's entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His goal is not just to save certain parts of man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the earthly works of the Lord Jesus reveal God's intention toward the matter of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His only work was to carry out God's will; He had no other work throughout His whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can especially see the heart of the heavenly Father and His attitude toward sickness in the story of the healing of the leper.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The leper said, "Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It seems as if this person was knocking on the door of heaven and asking if healing is God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"And stretching out His hand, He touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed!"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Matt 8:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is always God's will to heal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a believer thinks that God is not willing to heal him and that he should remain in sickness forever, he does not know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The work of the Lord Jesus on earth was to heal "all those who were ill" v. 16 . We should not think that He has changed His attitude today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We know that God's goal today is for "Your will to be done, as in heaven, so also on earth" Matt 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The will of God is done in heaven, but is there sickness in heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Based on this, sickness is absolutely not compatible with God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today a great number of believers pray for healing for a short period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When God does not seem to answer their prayers and they have lost all hope, they say, "May the Lord's will be done," as if the Lord's will is synonymous with sickness and death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a great mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's will for His children is not sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although sometimes His permissive will allows them to become sick, it is for their profit; His ordained will is always for them to be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no sickness in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This proves that God never intends for His children to be sick.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we consider where sickness actually comes from, we will realize that it is right for us to seek healing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Acts 10:38 tells us that all sickness is due to the oppression of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord Jesus spoke of the woman who was bent double, He said that she had been "bound" by Satan Luke 13:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When He healed Peter's mother-in-law, He "rebuked the fever" 4:39 as if He were rebuking the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we read the book of Job, we will see that it was the devil who caused Job to become sick chapters one and two , and it was God who healed Job chapter forty-two .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The thorn that caused the apostle Paul to be weakened was "a messenger of Satan" 2 Cor 12:7 , but the One who made him strong was God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hebrews 2:14 tells us that the one who has the might of death is the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When sickness ripens, it brings forth death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sickness is only an indication of death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If Satan has the power of death, he also has the power of sickness; death is simply a further step of sickness, while sickness is the first step to death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After reading all these verses, we have to conclude that the source of sickness is the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because there are some defects in the believers, God allows Satan to attack His children.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If God's children 1 refuse to yield to God's demands and allow sickness to remain in their bodies, or 2 if they have forsaken what God has commanded and still allow sickness to remain in their bodies, they are voluntarily putting themselves under the oppression of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After we have obeyed God's revelation, we should refuse the sickness and reckon that it is from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, there is no reason for us to be under his bondage anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must clearly understand that sickness belongs to our enemy, and that we should not welcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Son of God has come to free us and not to bind us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many people may ask: when there is no need for believers to be sick, why does God not remove the sickness?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to realize that God accomplishes things according to our faith Matt 8:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is an unchanging principle by which God deals with us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many times, God is willing to heal His children.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But since they do not believe and do not pray, God has to allow the sickness to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a believer allows himself to be sick, or worse still, welcomes sickness, thinking that it will make him more unworldly and holy, the Lord can do nothing except give him what he wishes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God often deals with His children according to what they can take.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God may want very much to heal them, but because they do not have the faith to ask, they never receive this gift.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not think that we are wiser than God or that we can act beyond what the Bible reveals.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even though the sickroom may sometimes feel like a sanctuary, and everyone who enters may be touched by the atmosphere, this is not God's ordained will and not God's best.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we act according to our emotion and ignore God's revelation, He can only allow us to walk as we please.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many believers say, "No matter what happens, I will commit myself to God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether I get well, or whether I remain sick, I will let God make the decision for me, and I will let Him deal with me as He pleases."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But very often, we see these people resorting to medicine at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Is this what one does when he commits everything into God's hand?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In seeking after God's healing, they put the responsibility in God's hand, and in seeking after man's healing, they resort to medicine all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is too contradictory.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The fact is that many believers have lost their willpower through their prolonged period of bed rest.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They can no longer hold onto God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Their submission is actually a kind of spiritual laziness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They desire to be healthy, but this desire will not cause God to do any work on them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many believers have become passively resigned to their illness for a long time; they have grown habitually sick and have no boldness to seek freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They would rather have others believe for them or have God give them faith and make them believe apart from their own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, unless their will is motivated, and unless they resist the devil and hold onto the Lord Jesus, the God-given faith will not come.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many patients do not have to be sick; they are sick because they do not have the strength to claim God's promises.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must realize that the spiritual blessings that we receive in sickness are far less than the spiritual blessings we gain in restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If, through trusting in God and consecrating ourselves to Him, we are healed, we should continue to live a holy life after our restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only this will maintain us in a healthy state.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>By healing us in this way, the Lord gains our body.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This joy is unspeakable.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Yet this joy comes not because we are healed, but because we have a new relationship with our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have a new experience of Him and receive new contact and new life from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>At such times, God is glorified much more than when a believer is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, God's children should rise up and seek healing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>First we should go before the Lord and listen to what He wants to speak to us through our sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Next we should walk with a single heart according to what He has revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Finally we should put our body wholeheartedly into His care and consecrate our body to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If there are elders of the church who can anoint with oil James 5:14-15 , we should invite them to come and let them follow the injunction of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Otherwise, we should remain in calmness and exercise our faith to hold onto God's promise Exo 15:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God will heal us.</S>
