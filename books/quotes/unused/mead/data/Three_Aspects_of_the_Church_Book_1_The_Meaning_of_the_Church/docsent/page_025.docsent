   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Sealing of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The calling of the church includes God the Father s sending of the Holy Spirit, the object of the calling, and the arrangement of the circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Moreover, when the servant met Rebekah according to the circumstances arranged by God, she received the sealing of the Holy Spirit in type.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through the arrangement of the environment, the servant met Rebekah and put a mark on Rebekah as a sign of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In reality, when we were called by the Holy Spirit, a similar situation occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As an illustration, the sealing of the Holy Spirit can be compared to putting a mark or signing our name upon a piece of furniture that we want to purchase in a furniture store.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The mark or signature separates the piece of furniture from all the other furniture in the store, indicating that it belongs to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the Holy Spirit encounters those whom He calls, He immediately places a mark upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ephesians 1:13 says, In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There may have been many girls who came out to draw water, but the servant chose Rebekah; she alone was called.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the servant sensed that Rebekah was the object of his calling, he immediately put a nose-ring upon her nose and bracelets upon her hands Gen 24:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The nose-ring and the bracelets signify the sealing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The nose is our breathing organ, and our hands are for movement.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The breathing of our nose is related to our existence, and the movement of our hands is related to our actions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we heard the gospel and touched the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit immediately put a golden ring upon our nose and golden bracelets upon our hands; as a result, our breathing and actions became different from the past.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Holy Spirit was sealing us, we may not have realized what He was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, after we heard the gospel and received the Lord, we felt that our living, existence, and actions had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After the servant put the golden ring upon Rebekah s nose and the golden bracelets upon her hands, she went home.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even though she may not have said anything at home, when her parents and brother saw what had been added to her nose and hands, they knew that something must have happened.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to typology, she had the sealing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we heard the gospel and met the Holy Spirit, the same thing happened to us; we had something added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the past we were able to speak casually, but after the sealing we could not; in the past we were able to act loosely, but afterward we were constrained inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When our family noticed this change, they realized that we had become different.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that we received the sealing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The sealing of the Holy Spirit always adds something to us, even without our realization.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every one of us has experienced such a day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One day I went to hear the gospel out of curiosity because I thought it unusual for a young lady to preach, but on that day the Holy Spirit met me and put a golden ring and bracelets upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Bible gold typifies God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God s nature is in God s life, and God s life is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has added His element of gold into us; that is, He has added Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, the mark that the Holy Spirit places upon us is not something apart from the Holy Spirit; it is the Holy Spirit Himself, that is, God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we first met the Holy Spirit, He wrought Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From that day onward, our living and actions have been influenced by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The golden ring and bracelets are nice, but once we put them on, we feel uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is good to have God s life in us, but at the same time, His life often bothers us in regard to our living and actions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are not as free as we were in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the result of the Holy Spirit entering into us as the seal.</S>
