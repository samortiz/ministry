   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHAT A VITAL GROUP IS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now I would like to ask, "What is a vital group?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You may say that a vital group is a group that is living, burning, and bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But this may be a doctrinal answer without vision.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Actually, a vital group is a group of normal Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today most Christians are abnormal, including a number of us in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My burden in endeavoring to carry out the vital groups is to change the generation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I went to Taiwan in 1984, I told the leading elders that I could not go on in the present dormant situation of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to come out of the deadness of Sardis Rev 3:1-2 , the lukewarmness of Laodicea vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>14-16 , and the barrenness of the degenerating believers John 15:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I want to bring the recovery into another age with a new generation, a new people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After reconsidering the holy Word, we found out the way in which Christians should serve and meet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the God-ordained way, the way ordained by God in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This way ordained by God has four steps.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first step is to preach the gospel to get sinners saved so that they can become members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the begetting stage to bring forth, to beget, members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When sinners repent, believe, and are regenerated, they become like newborn babes who need to be nourished by us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This brings us to the second stage, the feeding stage, the nourishing stage.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After the feeding stage comes the teaching stage to educate them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The teaching stage takes a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Humanly speaking, an education takes six years for elementary school, six years for junior high and high school, and four years for college.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Spiritually speaking, we also need to be educated in the divine truths for the Christian life and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the teaching stage, which is called the perfecting of the saints in Ephesians 4:12.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After a certain period of time, the saints become "graduates" in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The length of time it takes to "graduate" differs with people according to their desire for the Lord, their endeavoring, and their capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the begetting stage, the nourishing stage, and the teaching stage comes the building stage.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After you graduate from a four-year college, you have to do some business.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our business in the church life is to build up the church of Christ, the Body of Christ, by prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is fully developed and presented in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is not built by one minister, one preacher, speaking all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This concept came from the source of Satan to spoil the Body of Christ, to nullify the headship of Christ, and to make the church nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The practice of one man speaking and the rest listening does not build up the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, it builds up a hierarchy, a kind of religious system with rank and position.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul said that we should all desire to prophesy, to speak for the Lord v. 1 . Paul told us that we can all prophesy v. 31 . To prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14 means to speak for the Lord and to speak forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need the variety from many saints speaking in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After a new one gets baptized he can say, "Praise the Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is so good to me."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In a family it is good to hear all the members of different ages speak, from the young children to the grandparents.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church life should be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, we have seen that God's ordained way has four stages: the stages of begetting, feeding, teaching, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nearly everybody in the recovery likes the God-ordained way, but when we actually begin to practice it step by step, we will be a changed generation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We will get out of the old generation and become a new generation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is what I expect to see in the recovery a change of generation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must get out of the deadness, lukewarmness, and barrenness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must get out of the oldness, the staleness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must get out of the routine, the formality, the silence, and the prayers of the traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We hate deadness, lukewarmness, and barrenness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are struggling to fight them down.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need a change from the old way to the new way, from the old age to the new age in God's ordained way with four steps: begetting, feeding, teaching, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need a change of generation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I would like to say again that a vital group is a group of normal Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A normal Christian always lives a holy life in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He lives in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He does not save people into a denomination but into the church, into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because many of us were not saved in this way, we were not normal.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A normal Christian lives the normal church life and preaches the gospel in a normal way to save people into the church, into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Normal Christians beget, bring forth, normal Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After hearing the preaching of the gospel, a person should be led to repent thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He should make a thorough confession before God of his mistakes, wrongdoings, shortcomings, defects, transgressions, trespasses, sins, and evils.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He should also ask forgiveness of anyone whom he has offended.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Through this kind of repentance and confession, he will begin to have a close, intimate fellowship with the Lord and with his fellow believers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then he can also be perfected concerning how to pray, how to read the Word of God, how to call on the Lord's name, and how to exercise his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Spontaneously, he will become vital living, burning, and fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A vital person is one who repents to the uttermost, confesses thoroughly, contacts the Lord God intimately, and fellowships with his fellow Christians closely.</S>
