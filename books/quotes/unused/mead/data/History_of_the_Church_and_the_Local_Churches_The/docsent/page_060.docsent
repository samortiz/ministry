   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Eventually, I was sent from mainland China to Taiwan, and we started the work there in 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After six years, in 1955, there was a great increase in our number.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some of the leading ones in Taiwan received some letters from abroad encouraging them to invite Brother Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Two of the leading ones in Taiwan thought we needed the help in spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I agreed with them, but I said that we had to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I told the brothers that in a recent issue of Brother Austin-Sparks' paper, The Witness and the Testimony, there was a small paragraph written by him in which he expressed his thanks to the people who sent him Christmas cards.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That was the January issue of 1955.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I told the brothers that we had been enlightened by the Lord to cast down and give up all the things related to Christmas.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Yet here was a spiritual person still expressing his thanks to the people who gave him Christmas cards.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I told them that we know people not always by the main points but by the small things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is because people can be very careful about the main points.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They can pretend and cover things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But they are careless with the small things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to learn to know people not by the "head" but by the "tail."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason I told the brothers that we had to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We had good fellowship with those Christians in England.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But I said, "Suppose we invite him to come and he is dissenting in something.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we will have trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It might be better to keep our good fellowship with him without any direct contact."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Two weeks later the two brothers again brought up the subject of inviting Brother Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I went along with them, agreeing to invite him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I wrote the invitation, and he came to Taiwan in 1955.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our time with him was wonderful during his first visit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He ministered on the spiritual side of Christ as life according to what we expected.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we invited him to come a second time, but during his second visit he opposed the practicality of the church, the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I had over thirty long talks with him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Each session was about two or three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But he was greatly opposed to the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The practicality of the church is a great truth, but to practice this truth requires the paying of a price.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I say again that Brother Nee's ministry in the aspect of Christ was fully accepted, but his ministry in the aspect of the church was fully rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some may feel that it is sufficient just to publish Brother Nee's books concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, it is altogether unfair to hide the books by Brother Nee concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is dishonest.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I was with Brother Nee day after day for many years, and he opened up his heart to me many times.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I can say, at the very least, that I was one of three persons who knew him to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I know where he stood.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I was sent out of mainland China by Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I asked him why he made such a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He told me that maybe the enemy would wipe us out in China.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He said that if I were to go out, we would still have something left.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this sense, I was charged by him to be responsible for what the Lord had shown to him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more that people try to hide Brother Nee's books on the church, the more burdened I am to put them out.</S>
