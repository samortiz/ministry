   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD JESUS BEING OUR HIGH PRIEST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the eighth point.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is precious to know from the Bible that the Lord Jesus is our offering, but it is more precious to know that He is our High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many times I asked the brothers and sisters in various places what we would do if the Lord Jesus were not our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many said that we would be hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the Lord Jesus were not our Savior, we would be through; there would be no way for us to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then I asked what would happen if the Lord Jesus were not our High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many said that this would not make much difference.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They think that it would not make much difference if the Lord Jesus were our High Priest or not.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to know that there is not such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can keep our salvation only because the Lord Jesus is our High Priest before God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no need to mention the former sins or yesterday's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The sins that we have committed today alone are enough to cause us to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can continue being saved only because the Lord Jesus is praying for us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The intercession of the Lord Jesus keeps us being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hebrews 7:25 says, "Hence also He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why can He do this?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Since He lives always to intercede for them."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible clearly tells us that the Lord Jesus is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some people may tell us that we may lose our salvation or that we may still perish.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If this were the case, where would you put the prayer of the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God says that the Lord Jesus lives always to intercede for us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He continues to live to intercede for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Who can comprehend all the effectiveness of the intercession of the Lord Jesus for us?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we have a friend who is not saved and we pray for him, God can save him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How much more can the Lord Jesus, who is always before God interceding for us, keep us saved forever!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose you have a friend who fell away after believing in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You prayed for him and wrote letters to him with the hope that he would be a good Christian again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God heard your prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After a few years, he was revived.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now would not the continuing, eternal, and lasting prayer of God's Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is always before Him, be much more effective?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because the Lord Jesus is the perpetually living High Priest who intercedes for us before God, surely we will be saved by Him to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am very happy about one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Others may forget to pray for me, but I am still a person being prayed for.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man can give up praying for me, but I am still a person being prayed for, because the Lord Jesus always prays for me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have One who is the High Priest before God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although man may forget, He never forgets.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He lives perpetually as the High Priest to intercede for us.</S>
