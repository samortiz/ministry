   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 The Death of Lazarus</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 11 we find another instance of men being dissatisfied with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Martha said to the Lord, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died" v. 21 . She was blaming the Lord for arriving late.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She was saying in her heart, "I sent men to ask for You a long time ago.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why did You not come sooner?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because of Your delay, my brother has died and has been buried."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The phrase if You had been here expresses Martha's extreme unhappiness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Apparently, Martha's words were absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the Lord did everything with deliberation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He purposely stayed where He was for two more days v. 6 . In man's eyes this was a delay, but the Lord Jesus purposely delayed His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our Lord never apologizes to anyone, because He is never wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We apologize, because we are often wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we refuse to apologize, it means that we are arrogant.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more humble and meek we are, the more we will apologize.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although our Lord is humble and meek, He never apologizes, because He is never wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we are unhappy with Him, our unhappiness does not make Him feel guilty, for He knows what He is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can find many cases like these in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In reading the Bible we have to learn to apply the principle of gathering together all the portions which speak of similar things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From the above three examples, we can discover one glorious fact: The Lord never takes back one word that He has said; He never turns back on a pathway that He has trodden.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What a glory this is!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Was it more glorious for Lazarus to be healed or for him to be resurrected?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord knew that it was more glorious for Lazarus to be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we believe, we will see God's glory. b.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Attempting to Teach the Lord 1 "This Ointment Could Have Been Given to the Poor"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sometimes men were not only dissatisfied with the Lord; they even tried to teach the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The disciples said, "Why has this waste of the ointment been made?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this ointment could have been sold for over three hundred denarii and given to the poor" Mark 14:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They were teaching the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The disciples could think of another way to dispose of the ointment sell it and give it to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the Lord knew what Mary was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said that she was doing a noble deed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord never does one thing or says one thing that He is not clear about.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He needs no one to correct Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only a foolish man will try to correct the Lord or teach Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>2 "God Be Merciful to You!"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the Lord indicated to the disciples that He had to go to Jerusalem, Peter said, "God be merciful to You, Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What did the Lord say?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He said, "Get behind Me, Satan!"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Matt 16:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Peter wanted to teach the Lord, but it did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the contrary, he only exposed his own foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>3 "What Sort of Woman This Is"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once the Lord Jesus ate at the house of Simon the Pharisee.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A woman stood at the Lord's feet weeping, wetting His feet with her tears, and wiping them with the hair of her head.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Simon thought in his heart, "This man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what sort of woman this is who is touching Him" Luke 7:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here we should pay attention to Simon's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He seemed to be saying, "Look what kind of woman she is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How can You allow her to come near to You at Your feet?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although Simon did not open his mouth, the Lord knew what he was thinking, and He spoke about different kinds of forgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In effect the Lord was saying, "You, Simon, did not wash My feet, because you have experienced little forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This woman experienced much forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the reason she wet My feet with her tears."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once we have such an impression, we will realize how foolish it is for man to try to be the Lord's counselor!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the same time, we will know a Jesus of Nazareth that we did not know before.</S>
