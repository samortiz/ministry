   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Meaning of One and a Half Cubits</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The boards were ten cubits in length and one and a half cubits in width.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These measurements are also very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In many instances, the basic numbers of God s building were the numbers three and five or multiples of these numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One example is the altar, which was square five cubits wide by five cubits long and three cubits high.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Another example is the ark, which was two and a half cubits in length and one and a half cubits in width and in height.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These measurements are one-half of the numbers five and three respectively.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The width of each board was one and a half cubits, which is also one-half of the number three.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This implies that only when two boards are put together to form three cubits can there be the number of building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What this means is that every brother or sister is only one and a half cubits and that each one needs another one to match him to become a whole unit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This corresponds with the principle in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Recall that when the Lord Jesus sent out the disciples, He sent them two by two.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, Peter was one and a half cubits, and John was also one and a half cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They served God together and could not be separated or divided.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is called coordination, and this is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The problem is that some brothers and sisters think that they are three cubits by themselves and do not need others to match them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such brothers and sisters think that they can be Christians alone and do not need others at all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Please remember that you will always be only one and a half cubits, half of a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You are only a member, not the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, you need others to coordinate with you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even if you are as great as the apostle Paul, you are still just a member and not the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, not one Christian can be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If it were possible to be independent Christians, then there would be no need for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let me tell you before God that if I were to be separated from my brothers and sisters, I would have no way to be a Christian, and even more, I would have no way to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Maybe some of you would say, Have you not been ministering the word to us all this time?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You must be very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, I would like to tell you that no matter how strong I am, I am only one and a half cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, I cannot be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, I need to coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I was first saved, I could read the Bible by myself, I could pray alone, and I could pursue the Lord with great vigor on my own.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today, however, I feel more and more as if I cannot pray by myself anymore and that I have to find another brother to pray with me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I was young, my strength to push ahead was very great.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I was not afraid of anything, and I went everywhere to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now wherever I go to preach the gospel, I always need a brother to go with me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is because I know that since I am only one and a half cubits, I need a brother to coordinate with me so that I can stand firmly and be a whole unit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the day of Pentecost when Peter stood up to speak, the Bible says, Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke forth Acts 2:14a .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the principle of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to learn a serious lesson that no matter how great our gift is and no matter how weighty we are spiritually, we are still only one and a half cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is a certain matter recorded in the Bible which I feel is very sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When Paul wrote his first Epistle to the Corinthians, he began by saying, Paul, a called apostle of Christ Jesus...and Sosthenes the brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul did not write to the church in Corinth by himself alone as one and a half cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, he sought another brother who was also one and a half cubits to coordinate with him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul realized the preciousness of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In those days the apostles did not act individualistically but in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How I wish that we all knew how much we need the supply and coordination of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we have this kind of feeling, then we can be built with others and can also build others.</S>
