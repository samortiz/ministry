What is in the Old Testament is a typology, a set of types. Then what is in the New Testament is a complete fulfillment of that typology concerning God&#8217;s economy. Thus, the entire Bible, both the Old Testament and the New Testament, is first a picture of God&#8217;s economy and then a full definition and fulfillment of God&#8217;s economy. On the one hand, if we want to know the Old Testament, we must come to the New Testament definition. In the Old Testament, we can see only the pictures. On the other hand, if we want to know the New Testament, we have to spend the time to look at all these pictures.<p>Saint Augustine said that the New Testament is concealed in the Old Testament, and the Old Testament is unveiled in the New Testament. So these two sections are on the same thing. In today&#8217;s schools the good lesson books have pictures and then definitions. The pictures and the definitions form a strong basic principle for us to understand the Bible. If you do not know this principle, you will create mixture and confusion from the teachings of the Bible.<p>Two groups of Christians-those in the Catholic Church and those in Pentecostalism-are the top &#8220;experts,&#8221; &#8220;specialists,&#8221; in mixing up the Old Testament with the New Testament. In the Pentecostal movement, they sing a lot of Bible verses. All the verses they sing are from the Old Testament. Ephesians is a top book and Romans is a basic book in the New Testament, but they do not sing verses from these books. They sing mostly from the Psalms or from Isaiah. This is because the Pentecostal people do not know God&#8217;s New Testament economy. They miss the New Testament definition. They like some of the Old Testament pictures without understanding them. In other words, they like to look at the pictures; they do not like to read the definitions. If you look at a picture without the proper definition, you may consider a lion as a tiger or a turtle as a mouse. The Pentecostals&#8217; expounding of the Bible is a mixture because they do not have the proper definitions. It is the same in principle with the practices of Catholicism. The clothing of the cardinals and archbishops is a mixture. Mostly their robes are made according to the style of the robes of the Aaronic priests in the Old Testament.<p>In the early years of my Christian life, I was with the Brethren. They were famous for understanding the Old Testament types and prophecies, and I received much knowledge from them. The great teachers among the Brethren said that the entire history of Israel was a type of the church. Without this understanding, we cannot explain the significance of the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. These books are a record of the return of the children of Israel from captivity. The teaching of the Brethren strongly stressed that the captivity of Israel into Babylon typifies the church which was captured into Catholicism. Even the Lord Jesus pointed this out. The Lord Jesus referred to the Roman Catholic Church as Jezebel (Rev. 2:20; Matt. 13:33) and also as the Great Babylon, a mystery (Rev. 17:5). The entire Catholic Church is a mystery in what she is, in what she practices, and in what she teaches. The Brethren saw that Israel&#8217;s captivity typified the church&#8217;s captivity and that the return of Israel typified the recovery of the church starting from Luther. There is a call in the book of Revelation to come out of Babylon, to come out of the Catholic Church (18:4).<p>Although the Brethren saw this, they did not see that the history of the kings in the Old Testament was a typology of God&#8217;s economy. Actually, not one of the great teachers of the Brethren saw the economy of God. They did not even use this term. They somewhat used another term to replace God&#8217;s economy, that is, God&#8217;s plan or God&#8217;s purpose. The English word economy is anglicized from the Greek word oikonomia. But who knows today what God&#8217;s economy is? When most think of an economy, they think of it in terms of dollars and cents. We do not mean this when we speak of God&#8217;s economy. God&#8217;s economy is God&#8217;s plan, God&#8217;s divine arrangement, for the fulfillment of His good pleasure in His will to be His purpose. Israel&#8217;s history was not only a type of the entire church, as the Brethren teachers pointed out, but also a type of God&#8217;s economy. The fulfillment of this economy is in the New Testament. The New Testament presents us the complete fulfillment of the typology of the kings in the Old Testament. Thus, there is the typology in the Old Testament and the fulfillment in the New Testament. One is the picture, and the other is the definition.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
