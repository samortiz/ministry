   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Matthew 5:18 says, "For truly I say to you, Until heaven and earth pass away, one iota or one serif shall by no means pass away from the law until all come to pass."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"One iota" refers to the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet, and "one serif" refers to the diacritical marks in the Hebrew alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One iota and one serif refer to the smallest parts of the language.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To fulfill all the iotas and serifs is to fulfill all things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Heaven and earth will pass away only when each iota and each serif of the law is fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 17 speaks about the law and the prophets, while verse 18 speaks only about the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why is this so?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is because the law only goes as far as the end of the millennial kingdom, while the prophets cover eternity Isaiah once spoke about the new heaven and new earth .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we say that heaven and earth will pass away only when all that the prophets have spoken is fulfilled, are we not reversing the order of the record in Revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our Lord's word is very precise; He did not say too much or too little.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord said that heaven and earth could pass away only when each iota and each serif of the law was fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we can see how honorable the law is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word "therefore" in verse 19 is a continuation of what has been said in the preceding text.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What do the "commandments" in verse 19 refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They refer to the law in the preceding text, not the teaching on the mount, since the word "these" in "these commandments" clearly refers to the law in the preceding text.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are two kinds of laws: one is the ceremonial law, and the other is the moral law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, the way to offer the sacrifices is a ceremonial law, while the way to treat people and things is a moral law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The moral laws are much more important than the ceremonial laws.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Lord was on the earth, He had His ways of dealing with both kinds of law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Matthew 22:37 through 40 says, "And He said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.'</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the great and first commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Matthew 9:13 says, "I desire mercy and not sacrifice."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord shows us that the moral laws are more important than any other laws.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Matthew 23:23 says, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For you give a tenth of the mint and the anise and the cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law justice and mercy and faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But these you should have done and not neglected the others."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here the Lord shows us that the laws differ in importance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some people were very thorough in observing the rituals, yet the Lord still reproached them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paying tithes of mint, anise, and cummin, not weaving wool and linen together, not using goat's milk to boil the kid, and so forth are all lesser commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Matthew 5:19 says, "Therefore whoever annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called the least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whoever practices and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This shows us the great responsibilities that are upon those who minister God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whosoever breaks the least item among these commandments in his conduct and teaches others to break them rather than to keep them , shall be called the least in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many wrong teachings are often produced by wrong conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, some people may regard baptism as being unimportant.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then they may say, "Why be bothered with baptism"?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are determined not to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Later, when others ask them about the matter of baptism, they make up a set of doctrines about not being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because they have such a wrong conduct, they come up with such a wrong teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord said that these people will be called the least in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do Christians have to keep the law also?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No, they do not because Christians are not under the law but under grace Rom 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>During the apostles' time, a few people taught the brothers saying that if they were not circumcised according to Moses' law, they could not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Peter answered them saying, "Therefore why are you now testing God by placing a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Acts 15:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Afterwards, they wrote to the brothers asking them only to abstain from the contaminations of idols, fornication, what is strangled, and blood; they did not ask the disciples to be circumcised Acts 15:1-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the other hand, while the Lord was on the earth, and before He died and resurrected, He was the expression of the law and all the ceremonies.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, the disciples had to continue keeping the law at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For example, both the Lord and Peter paid a temple tax at that time Matt 17:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It was not until the Lord died that the law ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once the Lord died, the law and all the rituals were fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is related to the matter of dispensation.</S>
