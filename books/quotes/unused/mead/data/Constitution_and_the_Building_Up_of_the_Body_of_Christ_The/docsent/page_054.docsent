   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>My burden in these days is with this fellowship concerning the constitution and the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This book is a continuation of the burden in the two books we have published entitled The Satanic Chaos in the Old Creation and the Divine Economy for the New Creation and The Overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous chapter, we saw the complete salvation of God, the vital importance of transformation in the complete salvation of God, and the significance of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I hope that through the fellowship in this book, we will see a vision concerning God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that God's economy is accomplished in us in three steps: regeneration, transformation, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this chapter we want to see something further concerning the building up of the Body of Christ by the transformation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>IN THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we want to see the consummation of the transformation in the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to pay attention to the words consummation and transformation, since they are not common but very particular.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Transformation cannot be consummated at once, so it must have a process.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the end of the process of transformation, there will be a consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A. Constituting the Believers,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Who Grow and Mature in Christ's Life,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>into Precious Materials for the Building of God</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This transformation in its consummation, constitutes the believers, who grow and mature in Christ's life, into precious materials for the building of God Matt 13:44-46; 1 Cor 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Constituting is also a particular word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A physical building is not built by constitution but by pieces of material being added and joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With a physical building nothing is organic; it does not depend upon growth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A tree, however, is something organic which grows.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not built up by the addition of materials.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A tree can only grow up, and that growing up is a kind of constituting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The tree grows by taking in some life element.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may fertilize, water, and trim the tree, but it grows by itself according to its constitution with the life element.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How can a small green sprout eventually become a tall tree?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It becomes such a tall tree by being constituted with the life element, which causes it to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The essence of the seed of the tree spontaneously mingles itself with the earth, not the whole earth, but just the essence of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The essence of the earth with the essence of the seed grow together, and these two essences are the very materials for the constituting of this tree.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This picture is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Lord Jesus sowed Himself as the life seed into our heart as the soil, as the earth, the seed began to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ as the divine life seed and the believers as the human growing earth become one to produce the organic element for the constitution of the church Eph 1:22 .</S>
