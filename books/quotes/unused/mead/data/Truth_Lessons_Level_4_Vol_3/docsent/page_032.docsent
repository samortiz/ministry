   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Six Virtues,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Which Are Also Six Governing Aspects,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>of a Life That Lives Christ</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first virtue of these six governing aspects is what things are true.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word true means truthful ethically, not merely true in matter of fact.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the expression of the life that lives Christ there can be no falsehood, no lying.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everything that we do or say must be truthful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No one who lives Christ should practice falsehood of any kind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A life that is the expression of Christ is a truthful one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The second virtue is what things are dignified.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that if we live Christ, we must be dignified, noble, grave, solid, weighty, and honorable before man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When others see us bearing such dignity, they will be inspired and have a profound respect for us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The third virtue is what things are righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This refers to what is right, not just, before God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A person who lives Christ always maintains a proper relationship with God and with man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fourth virtue is what things are pure.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word pure means single in intention and action, without pretense and without any mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fifth virtue is what things are lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word lovely means lovable, agreeable, and endearing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The last virtue is what things are well spoken of.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that as Christians we should do whatever is of good repute, renowned, attractive, winning, and gracious.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we live Christ, we will surely have a life that is an expression of all these virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the basis of Paul s word, To me, to live is Christ 1:21 , we can rightly say that the virtues in verse 8 of chapter 4 are not things apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These are not merely human virtues; the reality of these virtues is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not only so, if we carefully consider these virtues, we will realize that in ourselves it is impossible for us to have such a life and to have such an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we must experience what Paul speaks of in verse 13, I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now that Christ dwells in us Col 1:27 , He empowers us, makes us dynamic, from within.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By such inward empowering, Paul could do all things in Christ; that is, he could express Christ in all these virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Summing Up of the Six Virtues</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>of the Christian Life</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Toward the end of Philippians 4:8 Paul changes his expression and says, If there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Virtue means excellence, that is, ethical energy exhibited in vigorous action.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Praise here refers to things worthy of praise, as the companion of virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Virtue and praise, categorized as if any, are not two additional items but values of the six items already covered.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Virtue and praise sum up the six items into two categories.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is to say that every item of the six foregoing virtues is excellent and has something worthy of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul says that we should take account of these things ; that is, we should think on them, ponder them, consider them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How excellent is the expression of the life that lives Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In each of these excellent aspects there is some virtue and something worthy of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The picture portrayed by these items is much more virtuous than that portrayed in the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These virtues produce excellence and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The praise is not only to God but also to us; others will praise us for all these excellent virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In our experience of Christ we must attain to the point that whatever we do is true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These virtues will be an excellency in our behavior and will cause others to praise God and also to praise us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>X. WATCHING AND PRAYING</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In our enjoying the dispensing of the Divine Trinity we must learn to watch and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not remain in any kind of sleeping condition.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rather, we need to watch over the situation concerning ourselves, the brothers and sisters, the church in which we are, and even the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should also watch and pray concerning the Lord s interest, His present move, the world situation, and the condition regarding the unsaved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As believers, we should be concerned for these things, learning to watch over and to pray concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A. Not Entering into Temptation</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Matthew 26:41 says, Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord s word here indicates that in spiritual things our spirit is often ready, but our flesh is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is possible for us to be tempted in anything, at any place, and at any time; therefore, the Lord reminds us to watch and pray so that we do not enter into temptation.</S>
