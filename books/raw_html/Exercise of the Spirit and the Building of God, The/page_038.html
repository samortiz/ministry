        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
GOD BEING THE WORD AND<br />
GOD BEING THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6</h1>
<p>Everything of the Father is embodied in the Son, and everything of the Son is received by the Spirit (John 14:9; 16:13-14). Now the Spirit reveals and declares all that He has received to us. Hence, we can say that through the Son and in the Spirit we can know, touch, contact, and enjoy everything of God. In this chapter we will continue to consider the relationship between God being the Word and the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT&mdash;<br />
THE KEY TO MAN ENJOYING GOD</h2>
<p>The Bible clearly refers to God as the Word. The most obvious portion is John 1:1: &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,...and the Word was God.&rdquo; The last part of this verse means that God is the Word. John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit.&rdquo; The Gospel of John contains the clearest verses concerning God being the Word and God being the Spirit. This shows that the Gospel of John does not focus on doctrine. Rather, it reveals in simple and plain words that God came to the earth to be man&rsquo;s life so that man can enjoy Him as everything.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John says that the Lord is many items. For example, the Lord is the light, the resurrection, the way, the reality, the life, the bread of life, and the living water (8:12; 11:25; 14:6; 6:35; 7:38). All these items are for our enjoyment, and they are our supply. He is the bread of life for us to eat, and He is the living water for us to drink. Likewise, He is the resurrection, the life, the light, and the way for us to partake of Him and enjoy Him. The Gospel of John portrays the many ways in which God wants us to enjoy Him as everything. God&rsquo;s being the Word and the Spirit is the key to His being enjoyed by us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BEING THE EXPLANATION AND<br />
THE SPIRIT BEING THE REALITY</h2>
<p>It is easy to understand that God is bread and that He is water. It is not difficult to understand that God is life, light, the way, and truth. However, it is not easy for us to think of God as the Word and the Spirit. We often say that God is Spirit, but we do not really understand what this means. Furthermore, our understanding of God being the Word is inadequate. Why do we need to speak of God as the Word and the Spirit, in addition to His being life, light, bread, and living water? All that God is, is made known to us through the Word and is gained by us through the Spirit. If He were not the Word, we would not know that He is everything. If He were not the Spirit, we would not be able to gain Him as our everything. The Word is the explanation of God. The Spirit is the reality and causes us to gain God as our everything in a practical way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD GIVING US UNDERSTANDING</h2>
<p>All that God is, is made known to us in the Bible. Hence, the Bible is a great book, without which the whole universe would be a mystery. Without the Bible we would have no way to know God or the things in the universe. But we praise the Lord that He is the Word. He is a speaking God.</p>
<p>Hebrews 1 unveils that God is a speaking God. Verses 1 and 2 say, &ldquo;God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son.&rdquo; He is a speaking God. Moreover, God asked some men to write down His words in a book so that people could read His words, listen to His words, and speak His words. The Bible is the story of God&rsquo;s speaking. It is the utterance of God, the revelation of God, and the explanation of God. It is the means through which we can know God and understand who He is and what He is to us. Hence, the explanation of God first enters our thoughts through the Word.</p>
<p>In order for something abstract to enter into us, it must first pass through our mind. If it cannot enter our mind, it cannot enter our being. If God were not the Word, we would not be able to understand Him, and we would be unable to know Him. We can know that He is our bread, our living water, our life, our light, and our way because He is the Word. All that He is to us is made known to us through the Word. This is the way that He passes through the first gate of our being, our mind, so that we can know all that He is to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT ENTERING INTO OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>If God were only the Word, we would not be able to touch Him; we would not be able to contact Him in genuineness. If God were merely the Word, we would be able to understand certain things about Him, but He would be unable to enter into our being. The most genuine part of our being would still be unable to contact Him. The most genuine part of a person is his human spirit. The human spirit is the genuineness of a person. God has to be Spirit so that the human spirit, the deepest part of a person, may contact, touch, and obtain Him. The Word by itself can only give man understanding, but the Spirit can enter into man&rsquo;s spirit. Hence, the Word enables us to know about God, and the Spirit enables us to touch and gain God.</p>
<p>I hope that in the young people&rsquo;s meetings this matter of God being the Word would be made clear and that the matter of God being the Spirit would be emphasized. The young brothers and sisters need to see that if God were only the Word but not the Spirit, the most He could do would be to reveal Himself in our mind. However, we would be unable to touch or enjoy Him, that is, to contact Him in the depth of our being. Hence, God must be the Spirit so that we can contact and touch Him in our spirit.</p>
<p>God is the Word mainly for us to know Him, and He is the Spirit mainly for us to touch Him. Touching God can be likened to touching electricity. We need a deep realization of this word <em>touch.</em> It is possible for a person to study electricity and to be familiar with the theory of electricity without touching electricity. It is one thing to understand electricity, but it is another to touch electricity. This is the situation of many people in relation to God. They know about God and understand things concerning Him from reading the Bible, hearing gospel messages, and reading spiritual books, but they do not contact God in their spirit. Therefore, they have very little experience of God being everything to them. Such people have the Word of God, the Bible, but they lack the experience of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Here is an example. It is possible for a person to be an expert in nutrition and a skilled cook but to suffer from hunger because he does not eat or drink. Such a person only knows about food, but he does not partake of it. We must receive the Spirit into our spirit, just as we eat food and drink water. Only then can we have a genuine relationship with God in which He is received into our being to be joined to us in spirit and to be our supply. This is the way that we gain God.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
