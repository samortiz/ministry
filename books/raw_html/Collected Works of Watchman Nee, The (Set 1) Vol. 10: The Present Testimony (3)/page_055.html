<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. The Unrenewed Nous to Ourselves</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>A. Being Unable to Manage One's Own Thoughts</H2><P>A person with an unrenewed nous is absolutely unable to manage his own thoughts. The mental energy of many Christians is wasted. If our hands can only work for eight hours a day, and what we do during these eight hours is improper, it becomes a waste of energy and a hindrance to proper work. Likewise, we can only use our mind for so many hours a day. If we waste our thoughts on meaningless and improper things, we cannot think about something proper. A brother once asked me, "Why can I not concentrate? After I pray for five minutes, my mind starts wandering." I asked him, "Does your mind wander all day long or just at the time of your prayer?" I could answer for him that his thoughts were never concentrated during the day; they were always touring the world. His thoughts were entirely in disarray. If our mind is in disarray twelve hours a day, how can we concentrate while we pray? If we cannot concentrate all day, why is it strange that we cannot do the same when we read the Bible or when we pray? Therefore, if our nous is not renewed, we cannot manage our mind. Friends, I must emphasize again that if we cannot manage our own thoughts, we are not very useful in the hands of God.</P><P>It is said that if all the heat generated from the sun in one day was collected together and put into all the factories on the earth, it would be enough for all the factories to use for ten million years. But people cannot use solar energy because it cannot be collected in one place. If we use a magnifying glass to collect the light from the sun, the heat can burn a finger underneath the glass. It is very regrettable that many believers waste their thoughts in vanity. They think day and night without producing one good thing. They waste their entire day in their disorderly thoughts. It is no wonder that God cannot use them. They can only be proper believers when their nous is renewed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>B. Considering One's Past</H2><P>The biggest fault of a believer is thinking about his past. Believers think that introspection is good. Actually, introspection cannot enable us to know ourselves. There is not one believer who acquires self-knowledge by looking into himself. The knowledge of one's self comes from God's light; only after he receives God's light will he know himself. (I have spoken in detail concerning the matter of self-knowledge. Please see "Self-knowledge and God's Light" in The Present Testimony.) Self-criticism, self-analyzing, or any thought concerning the self, whether good or bad, causes one's mind to become restless. We should not secretly compare ourselves to others, no matter who it is. Every time a believer looks at himself he will have no progress. Consider a person walking along the road: if he looks at himself, he will stop going forward. He cannot look at himself and walk forward at the same time. Therefore, whoever looks at himself is either going backward or standing still. The same is true in the spiritual realm. If you always consider yourself, eventually you will be very discouraged. If no one leads you on, you will put yourself in a dangerous position, and you may even think that you are not saved, that you have committed an unforgivable sin, or that God has forsaken you. All these are the results of your introspection. This is the condition of an unrenewed nous.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>C. Unable to Minister Well<br>the Word of God to Others</H2><P>If our nous has not been renewed, we cannot minister to others what God has given us. Some believers are very capable in conversation. No matter how many matters are being discussed, they can relate them one by one in proper utterance. They truly have eloquence. But when you ask them to talk about spiritual things or about the truth, they cannot explain even one thing to others clearly. The reason is that their mind is not qualified to be used by God. Their mind is like a child's arm which cannot bear anything that weighs more than ten pounds. Their nous is too weak. Though they have many thoughts, they are all without order. They cannot understand what comes from God. They understand what they receive in their intuition, but they cannot compose what they understand into a proper teaching in order to share with others. This is because their nous has not been renewed. If God wants us to speak forth His Word, He will certainly give us the utterance. But even though this is necessary, if a person does not have a renewed nous, he cannot express what he has received within him. Suppose a believer has his nous enlightened but not completely renewed. As such, he cannot put together God's Word and minister it to others. We cannot regard such a one as our pattern, and we cannot presume that being enlightened once is enough. We should have a clearer understanding day after day and should be able to use words to express what we know inwardly, so that others may understand.</P><P>A believer needs to have a renewed nous to guide him through his days on earth. Otherwise, he will suffer loss and damage in his life. He will think wrongly of others. He will not be able to understand God's will. He will also think wrongly of himself. He will not be able to properly live his life. This is why everyone needs to seek after the renewing of the nous in a specific way. With the people in the world, there are only two categories: the saved and the perishing, the regenerated and the unregenerated, those in Christ and those in Adam. These differences are absolute; the two are completely dissimilar. In like manner, with the nous of the believers, there is also the renewed nous and the unrenewed nous. There is an absolute boundary between the two. If we are saved, our nous must also be renewed. Furthermore, the renewing of the nous should not occur just once, but daily. If we are like this, we will be very clear concerning God's will.</P><P>Once Mr. Moody was walking on the street. Suddenly, he went into the house of one of his neighbors and asked to be allowed to go upstairs to do something. The owner of the house agreed, and he went upstairs and prayed to God, "O God, Your hand should stop. It's too much; I cannot bear it." If you daily have a renewed nous, you will see that you cannot bear what God shows you of yourself through your nous. I say again, you should do this singleheartedly, just as you did when you were regenerated. If your regeneration has caused a change in your living, your nous should also be enlightened in a specific way and be renewed daily.</P><P>You should not think that your mind is too dull. Do not think that only those who are naturally intelligent will grow and quickly understand the truth of God. There is no such thing. If man's growth in the truth were governed by his natural intelligence, it would be entirely a matter of the flesh. Your personal growth has nothing to do with your intelligence. If your nous is renewed, you can understand God, and you can know everything of God. The person beside you may be the most intelligent and wise person, but he cannot understand; only you can understand. Therefore, you should specifically ask God to give you a renewed nous. Otherwise, you will have no way to go on. Once again I stress that you must go to God in a specific way to seek after this.</P><P>Before you believed in the Lord, you did not love men. After you believed in the Lord, you began to love men more. If there was no such change in you, I am afraid that you are still not saved. If you are saved, you will surely see a change of heart and an improvement in the matters of loving, forbearing, and serving. Before, you loved to be great, but now, you would rather suffer, be defrauded, and forbear. This is because you have a new heart. Others will also see your change and say that you were a certain way before, but that now you are changed. But my question is: has there been any improvement in your thoughts? Has there been any improvement in your mental power? Are your thoughts more orderly and concentrated? Or are they still the same as they were before you were saved? If this is so, your nous is still not renewed.</P><P>Regardless of whether a believer is wise or foolish, he should know that his mind as well as his heart should be proper. Furthermore, in his nous he should have the same improvement. God is without respect of persons. He destroys the wisdom of the wise and the understanding of the prudent. God puts the wise and the foolish all on the same level. The nous of the foolish needs to be renewed. The nous of the wise also needs to be renewed. As long as your nous is renewed, you can know God, understand His will, perceive, analyze, and synthesize what God has given you. This is what you did not know, understand, or see and what you could not verbalize or analyze before. Furthermore, you will be able to run the race before you.</P><P>Indeed, the difference between a renewed nous and an unrenewed nous is like the difference between a bright, clear window and a dark, dirty window. If a believer's nous has not been renewed, he cannot think or work like a person with a renewed nous. If his nous is renewed, his thinking ability will be at least several times (if not ten times) more than before. Furthermore, his mental power will be much improved. But if his thoughts are not renewed, his thinking will not be improved because his thoughts are dead. Just as there is a great difference between death and life, there is a great difference between a renewed nous and an unrenewed nous. Just as there is a difference between heaven and earth, there is a difference between a renewed nous and an unrenewed nous. If we earnestly and single-mindedly deal with our nous in the way that we dealt with our salvation in the past, our sky will always be clear.</P>
