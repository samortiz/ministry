<h1 class="title">THE SECRET TO CONTACTING THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 2:3-5; 4:15-21, 23-24; 6:26-27; 11:3, 5-6, 17, 21-28, 32-33, 35-40; 13:6-10; 21:2-6, 9-13, 15, 19</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTACTING THE LORD</h2>
<p>Bible scholars know that the Gospel of John has a special style of writing. This book is very simple yet quite detailed. John wrote in this way in order to show how God contacts man. At the end of the Gospel, John said, “There are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself could contain the books written” (21:25). John did not record everything that the Lord Jesus did; rather, he chose certain things to show to those who are far away from God how God came to contact man. In order to contact man, God became man’s life. God entered into man to be man’s life and to live in man. Furthermore, God wants man to contact Him. This contact is what we call fellowship. The Gospel of John does not contain expressions such as <em>contact</em> or <em>fellowship,</em> but it shows that God desires to contact man and fellowship with man. In the Gospel of John we see not only how God causes man to have life but also how God wants man to contact Him.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John focuses on these two points: God entering into us to be our life, and His desire for us to contact Him. The former concerns having life, and the latter concerns contacting God. Everyone who has believed into the Lord has settled the matter of life. In this chapter we will consider our contacting of God.</p>
<p>After we are saved, the most important thing is for us to contact God. Those who have learned some spiritual lessons know that the Christian life depends on the condition of our contact with God. If our contact and fellowship with God are proper, we will be proper Christians. If we do not know how to contact God and lack fellowship with Him, we cannot be proper Christians, no matter how much we try.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONTACTING THE LORD</h2>
<p>The matter of contacting the Lord involves specific principles. It is possible to have morning revival every day and to pray every day without contacting the Lord. Many of our prayers do not result in our contacting the Lord, and thus, they are not beneficial. Hence, we must learn the principles involved in contacting the Lord.</p>
<p>There are many cases in the Gospel of John that show how we should contact the Lord. We do not have the time to go over all the cases, but we will select some crucial cases and consider the main points related to them. If we truly want to contact the Lord, we need to see some principles in contacting Him in these cases.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Directing the Lord</h2>
<p>In the first case the Lord changed water into wine in chapter 2. Verse 11 says, “This beginning of signs Jesus performed.” The Greek word for <em>signs</em> is translated “miracles” in the Chinese Union Version. A sign is a symbol with spiritual significance. Hence, the miracles performed by the Lord Jesus in the Gospel of John are, on the one hand, miracles and, on the other hand, signs. The Lord used specific, visible miracles to indicate invisible, spiritual matters. Therefore, the cases that we will enumerate indicate spiritual principles. If we can identify the key points and principles in these cases, we will see the secret to contacting the Lord.</p>
<p>The major principle in the first case is that we must not direct the Lord when we contact Him. All authority must be in His hands. Hence, both the timing and the way we do things must be determined and directed by Him, not by us. We cannot say, “Lord, do this,” or “Lord, do that.” If we say this, the Lord might say, “What do I have in this that concerns you?” (v. 4). If we contact Him in this way, we may be rejected and rebuffed by Him. This does not mean that the Lord does not want any contact with us or that He is not bearing responsibility for our matters. The Lord entered into us in order to contact us and to be responsible for our affairs, just as He was at the wedding in Cana.</p>
<p>Marriage is the center of human life, and a wedding feast represents the pleasure of human life. The Lord came to the earth and entered into us in order to become the center of our human life and the pleasure of our human life. He did not come to ignore us or to be unconcerned with our affairs. He came to bear responsibility for our affairs. However, as a prerequisite, we must hand all authority over to Him and give Him full liberty.</p>
<p>When the wine ran out at the wedding feast in Cana, Mary, the mother of Jesus, said to the Lord, “They have no wine” (v. 3). She said this in order to prompt the Lord to do something. Although she charged the Lord to do something, she was rebuffed. The Lord said, “Woman, what do I have in this that concerns you? My hour has not yet come” (v. 4). Having learned some lessons before God, Mary, after she was rebuffed, said to the servants, “Whatever He says to you, do” (v. 5). She realized that it was the Lord who should decide, not she; that it was the Lord who should give counsel, not she; and that it was the Lord who had the final word, not she.</p>
<p>The fact that the wine ran out means that something central and crucial was missing at the wedding feast. Since the Lord was there, He was surely interested in the feast. He would not stand by without doing something. Nevertheless, Mary, the Lord’s mother in the flesh, a person who represents us in our way of contacting the Lord, went to the Lord to propose that He do something. She did this with good intentions. In contacting the Lord we must beware that our intentions should not go before His intentions.</p>
<p>Sometimes we feel that we have a need when we draw near to the Lord in the morning. If we have learned the lesson, we will know that we must not be too quick to bring this need to the Lord. If we know that we have a need, the Lord also must know; hence, instead of making a proposal, we should wait for Him in His presence. If we are too quick with our proposal, we may be rebuffed and feel that the Lord is not listening to our prayer. He may seem to reject us and say, “What do I have in this that concerns you?” But He is not rejecting us; He is only rejecting our proposal, our counsel. He knows our need better than we do, and He wants to take care of it more than we do. There is no need for us to make a proposal or to counsel the Lord. Those who can pray in the Lord’s presence without making a proposal know how to pray. This is not an easy matter.</p>
<p>The feast must have been out of wine for a while, but the Lord did not seem to be doing anything. This was a test to Mary, and she said, “They have no wine,” meaning that the Lord should do something. The Lord rebuffed her, saying, “Woman, what do I have in this that concerns you? My hour has not yet come” (v. 4). The Lord seemed to be saying, “You cannot direct Me, counsel Me, or make proposals concerning My affairs. My hour has not yet come. I have My timing. I am not under your direction.”</p>
<p>This is a very good lesson to learn. When we go to the Lord, we seldom give Him the chance to speak. We normally say, “Lord, do this; Lord, do that. Look at the condition of the church. Revive the brothers and sisters.” The more we pray in this way, the drier we are within, and the less we touch the Lord’s presence. The feeling of dryness and a lack of His presence are the Lord’s way of saying, “What do I have in this that concerns you? My hour has not yet come. I will take interest in, be responsible for, and solve these matters, but I will decide when and how. I have My timing; I am not under your direction.”</p>
<p>Chapter 11 provides another example of this principle. Martha in chapter 11 is similar to Mary in chapter 2. In chapter 2 the wine ran out, and in chapter 11 a person’s life came to an end. The Lord did not do anything immediately when the wine ran out; instead, He waited before He changed the water into wine. Similarly, in chapter 11 the Lord did not do anything when Lazarus was about to die; instead, He waited a few days after he had died before going to raise him. The Lord did not listen to the words of Martha or Mary, both of whom wanted to direct the Lord with their opinions.</p>
<p>We must always remember that the first principle to learn in contacting the Lord is to stop our counsel and to let the Lord speak. On the one hand, we must learn to draw near to the Lord; on the other hand, when we draw near to Him, we must learn to not speak, that is, to not make proposals. It was necessary for water to be changed into wine, but the Lord knew about this need better than Mary. The church needs to be revived and the believers need to be transformed, but the Lord knows about these needs better than we. The lesson we must learn is to worship and honor Him as the Lord. We must listen to what He says and do what He wants. We must not make many proposals in our prayers. This is the first principle that we must learn in contacting the Lord in prayer.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
