   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Family</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Fourth, one has to pay attention to the family of the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is a familiar expression in the West, which says, I am marrying So-and-so, not her family.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But please remember that there is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a person marries a girl, her whole family comes along.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once a person marries another person, the whole family of the other side comes along, because a person is more or less a part of his family.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All you need to do is to see if the other side s family has a high standard of morality or a lofty set of values.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is their view toward many things?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do they have a strict standard for everything?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How do the males treat the females in this family?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And how do the females treat the males?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Simply consider these matters a little and you will know what your family s future holds.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A young person has been under his family s influence for over ten or twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He may not be satisfied with his family, but after he is married, his family s traits and ways will unconsciously surface in his new family.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sooner or later these traits will be made manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I dare not say that this will be so ten out of ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But I dare say that it will be so seven or eight out of ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although the traits may not surface all at once, the other party s family will gradually creep into your own family.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a father is very strict with his children, the sons and daughters of that family will not be too affectionate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Children from stern families are often lacking in affection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a family is warm and the parents are full of love, the children from this family will spontaneously be gentle and easygoing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If both the father and the mother in a family are strict, the children from that family will be introspective and inward.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is all right if you want a husband from such a family, but do not expect to find a warm husband.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you find a daughter from such a family, she will be introspective and inward.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a family carries a certain trait, seven to eight out of ten times, the children will carry the same trait.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Family traits always resurface in the second generation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why some say, If you want to marry the daughter, take a good look at the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This word may not be altogether true, but there is some truth to it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By looking at the way the mother treats the father, you will know how the daughter will treat her husband in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>She has been watching her mother for over twenty years, and this is what she has learned.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Daily she has been observing the way her mother treats her father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How can she not treat her husband in the same way?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It will be hard for her not to do the same things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I would not say that, in ten out of ten cases, a daughter will be the same as her mother.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But I would say that you can expect this to happen seven or eight out of ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, some people have a very strong character.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They can be very gentle when you speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But they grew up in a family with strong character.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sooner or later these overbearing traits will surface in them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a family is close, and there is little quarreling or fighting in the family, the one who comes from this family will spontaneously be congenial and quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They will not argue or engage in physical fights easily.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Children who come from such families will at least consider quarreling to be wrong and serious.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To ask them to engage in a brawl would be like asking them to climb over a high mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a brother or a sister grows up in a family that argues or quarrels every day, he or she may be courteous with you today, but this courtesy is undependable; it is only a temporary mask.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day when he lets down his guard, all of the skills that he learned from his family will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To him, cursing will require no effort, neither quarreling, and you will not be able to do anything about it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before you decide to marry someone, you should study the other party s family, and decide whether you like it or not.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you like it, seventy to eighty percent of the problem is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you feel that something is wrong there, do not expect your future spouse to be an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Please remember that one s habit is different from one s view.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One s view may be one way, but his habit may turn out to be something else.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If there are arguments, fights, and bad habits in a family, sooner or later the children will argue and fight.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is not easy to change anyone s habit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When one marries a sister, he is marrying her whole family.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When one marries a brother, she is also marrying his whole family.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is why one must carefully consider the other person s family.</S>
