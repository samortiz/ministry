<h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL PROBLEMS IN SPREADING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>We need to consider two practical problems that we have encountered. First, as much as possible we must avoid the practice of sisters baptizing people. When we knock on doors, we should not let the sisters baptize males, but the sisters can be allowed to baptize females. Suppose after preaching the gospel in a home that both the husband and the wife are willing to be baptized. The sisters can baptize the wife, and if there is no brother present, the sisters should make an arrangement for the husband to be baptized later. They can even arrange for the husband to be baptized in the meeting hall. Under no circumstance is it appropriate for our young sisters to baptize a male. Even if the sister is older, it is still not appropriate for her to baptize a male. During baptism, a person&rsquo;s clothing might not cover his entire body. It is therefore best to avoid such a situation.</p>
<p>Second, I hope that every locality will have a gospel van and a telephone. The first wave of saints who went to the towns and villages were equipped with two ten-passenger vans per team. In every locality there should be at least one ten-passenger van. Transportation in the rural areas is not convenient; buses do not run frequently. Therefore, these vans can be used to transport saints. Most saints do not own cars, and it may take them one or two hours to walk to the meeting. This is burdensome. It would be wonderful to have a vehicle that can transport ten saints to the meeting in one trip. In a locality where forty people meet together, if half of them require a ride, we will only need to make two trips. This is needed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if each of the one hundred newly established churches has a van, there will be one hundred gospel vans. The vans will all be of the same make and the same shape with a logo, such as &ldquo;God loves the world&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jesus is Lord,&rdquo; painted on them. When these one hundred vans travel from town to town, the townspeople will know that these are the gospel vans of the local churches.</p>
<p>Every church must have a van and a telephone. Then when the sisters go to preach the gospel and a person is willing to be baptized, they can contact the brothers to come and assist them in the baptism. These are some matters that we should pay attention to and for which we should be prepared.</p>
<p>In addition, we should not be timid or frightened when we preach the gospel to people who are older, more experienced, rather accomplished, or famous. We should not feel that we are too young, inexperienced, or unqualified to speak to them. We should be bold and speak Christ to everyone. We should preach the gospel and dispense Christ. Even if the person we are speaking to is the head of a big company or a college professor with a wealth of human experiences, he does not have Christ or the experience of Christ. We can boast that we have Christ. They may have something that they can boast of, but we have even more of which to boast.</p>
<p>We should simply present Christ to people. This should be our exercise and our practice. In Philippians 3:8 Paul said, &ldquo;I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ.&rdquo; This verse should help us deal with different kinds of people. We should read Philippians 3 and pray over the verses to apply these verses to ourselves. We need to experience Christ as our riches and as everything to us. I trust that this experience will help us in speaking to people who have positions in society.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STEPS OF THE WORK OF SPREADING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>By improving our arrangement in the work and by taking care of housing, we have taken care of the full-timers in every way. However, we are still concerned about the steps of our work. The record in the Bible shows that there are four major steps in a Christian&rsquo;s work for Christ. The first step is to preach the gospel. The second step is to nourish people after they are saved. The third step is to gather the new believers whom we are nourishing into small group meetings so that they may know one another in the Lord and fellowship together. A small group can begin with seven or eight people and gradually increase in number until it can be split into two groups. The fourth step is to bring the new ones to participate in the church life. In particular, we must bring them to the big meeting on Lord&rsquo;s Day morning for them to practice prophesying together with all the saints.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we need to preach the gospel to lead people to salvation, and we need to nourish the new believers. Then we should connect a new one with eight or nine others in a small group for mutual care and perfecting. We also need to bring the new believers to the church meetings. In particular, they need to prophesy in the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting for the building up of the church. In the past we emphasized knocking on doors to visit people and baptize them, but now we must emphasize these four steps.</p>
