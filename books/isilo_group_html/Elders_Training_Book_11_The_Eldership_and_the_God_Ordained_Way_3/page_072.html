His teaching, his work, was accepted by the church in Corinth. Otherwise, some of them would not have been able to say that they were of Cephas. Since some of the Corinthian saints said this, that is a strong evidence that Peter's ministry and teaching were accepted by the Gentile world.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Co-workers in the Jewish World<br>and Those in the Gentile World Having<br>Pleasant and Sweet Fellowship with One Another</H2><P>The co-workers in the Jewish world and those in the Gentile world had pleasant and sweet fellowship with one another. Galatians 2:8 and 9 record that Paul and Barnabas had fellowship with James, Cephas, and John. They did not consider themselves to be separated from one another. They considered themselves as one in the divine fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Apollos Being Received and Accepted<br>by the Brothers in the Gentile World</H2><P>Apollos was received and accepted by the brothers in the Gentile world (Acts 18:24; 19:1a; 1 Cor. 1:12; 4:6; 16:12).</P><P>In the light of this fellowship, we need to realize that our present situation is not so scriptural. I picked up all the above points to present a portrait of the situation at the time of the early apostles. The churches were all one in the Spirit and in practice, but it is not so much like this today among us.</P><P>All the above points show that all the co-workers in all the regions should do the same one work universally for the unique Body. We should do only one work. There should not be several works in the Lord's recovery. In the past there were several works in the recovery. This is still lingering among us. There is the risk and the danger that these different works will issue in divisions. We have to consider our present situation so that we can eliminate the number of works. The work should be just one. Even Paul and Peter did not carry out two works. Even though they worked in different regions, they had only one work to build up the Body of Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_071.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_073.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 11: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (3) &nbsp; pg 72</div><br></body></html>
