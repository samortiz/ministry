   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Through the Covenant</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God Enlarges the Measure of Man s Faith</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now let us come to the matter of God s making a covenant with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In saving his nephew, Lot, and refusing the offer of the King of Sodom, Abraham manifested his love, his zeal, his bravery, and his cleanness Gen 14:14-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then, after these things, God came to speak to Abraham saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward Gen 15:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This verse shows that at this time Abraham s feeling was on one hand that of anxiety, fearing that the four kings might come again and on the other hand sorrow for Lot s departure and for his own state of childlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was at this time that God came to him to strengthen and comfort him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But from Abraham s answer we see that this promise of God did not fully satisfy him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He asked, What wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus? v. 2 . This shows that he had not yet known or seen how gracious God s promise was.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was negative.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He had his own idea and his own arrangement as well.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So what did God do?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God said, This man shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and number the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What was it that God spoke here to Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was a promise, not a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What about Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now he could believe God s promise; therefore, God reckoned it to him as righteousness v. 6 . Because Abraham believed in God s promise, he became the father of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After Abraham believed God s first promise, the second came: And he said unto him, I am Jehovah that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it v. 7 . Did Abraham believe this promise? No, because his measure was too narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He became doubtful and said, O Lord Jehovah, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? v. 8 . Because the promise was too great, Abraham could not believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, he asked God to give him evidence to which he could cling.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How did God deal with Abraham s unbelief?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What did He do?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God made a covenant with Abraham v. 18 . Therefore, the establishment of a covenant makes up that which is lacking of a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A covenant is the best way to deal with unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A covenant enlarges the measure of man s faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Abraham may not believe God s promise, but God could not change what He had promised.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because Abraham could not believe, God made a covenant with him so that he could do nothing else but believe Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God told Abraham, Take me a heifer three years old, and a she-goat three years old, and a ram three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half over against the other: but the birds divided he not...and it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>9, 10, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that God was making a covenant with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It means that the covenant which He made was something which went through the deepest inward parts and through the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The bodies of the sheep and oxen were divided, the blood was shed, and God went through the halves of the oxen and the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This shows that the covenant which He made will never change nor become void.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God knew that Abraham s faith was limited.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God knew that He had to enlarge the measure of his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore He made a covenant with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God not only promised Abraham what He would do; God even made a covenant with him to show that He would do it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus Abraham could not but believe, for if God, after making a covenant with man, did not act according to the covenant, He would be unfaithful, unrighteous, and contrary to law.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By the strengthening of such a covenant, the measure of Abraham s faith was naturally enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through the Covenant God Gives Man a Pledge</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now let us see the history of the covenant which God made with David.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Second Samuel 7:4-16 speaks of the same thing as Psalm 89:19-37.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, 2 Samuel 7 does not say clearly how God made a covenant with David.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is in Psalm 89 where we find that when the Lord sent the prophet Nathan to David, what he spoke to David was a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Psalm 89 and 2 Samuel 7 speak of the same thing, not of two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In both of these passages God gave His word to David and his descendants as a pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He likes for man to take hold of His word and ask Him to fulfill it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He loves for man to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He gave a covenant to man as a pledge, hoping that man would ask Him to fulfill it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God spoke to David in a very clear way: If his children forsake my law, and walk not in mine ordinances; if they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Once have I sworn by my holiness: I will not lie unto David: His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me Psa 89:30-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This tells how God made a covenant with David.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If David s descendants forsake God s commandments, God will chasten them with a rod and with stripes.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But God cannot forsake the covenant He made with David.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Psalm 89 was written at the time the Jews lost their country and were taken captive to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At this time it seemed that God had forgotten the covenant He had made with David.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When the psalmist saw the situation, how the country was lost, he told God, Thou hast cast off and rejected, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thou hast abhorred the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground vv.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>38-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Here he was reminding God of the covenant He had made with His servant.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then he immediately inquired of God by holding on to the covenant: Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy faithfulness? v. 49 . We need to pay attention to what the psalmist said here.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He prayed by holding on to the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Holy Spirit especially allowed such a prayer, in which a man inquired of God, to be recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In this we see how God delights that man pray by holding on to the pledge which He has given man, namely, the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This causes God to be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God delights that man demand Him to fulfill what He has promised in the covenant.</S>
