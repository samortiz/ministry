   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 The Serpent Bruising the Heel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Seed of the Woman</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While the Lord Jesus was destroying the serpent on the cross, the serpent bruised His heel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that Satan wounded the Lord Jesus by nailing His feet to the cross Psa 22:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>4 Enmity between the Serpent and the Overcomers</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Who are the overcomers?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we have seen already, the woman in Genesis 3:15 firstly is Eve and secondly is all the people of God, including the virgin Mary, as signified by Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the seed of the woman is mainly the Lord Jesus who was born of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, more regarding the seed of the woman can be seen in Revelation 12.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The woman depicted in Revelation 12 and signified in Genesis 3:15 is a universal woman, and within her is a part called the manchild Rev 12:1, 2, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In a biblical sense, woman represents weakness, for the woman is the weaker vessel 1 Pet 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The man, especially the manchild, represents strength.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The universal woman of Revelation 12 has two parts: the outer part, which is the woman herself, and the inner part, which is the manchild.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The outer part, the woman, is the weaker part; the inner part, the manchild, is the stronger part.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the people of God are the woman, who is somewhat weak, but among all the people of God is a stronger part, which is the manchild, the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the churches some of the saints may be comparatively weak, being a portion of the woman, but other saints may be quite strong, being a portion of the manchild.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This manchild may also be considered as a part of the seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The manchild is the stronger part among the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The entire people of God are the woman, and the stronger part of the people of God is the manchild.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore the manchild is also a part of the seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I like to compare Revelation 12 with Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Genesis 3:15 we have three main items: the serpent, the woman, and the seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We find the same three items in Revelation 12, where we see the old serpent, the universal woman, and the manchild.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Have you seen how these two chapters correspond to one another?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The "ancient serpent" of Revelation 12:9 is the serpent of Genesis 3, the universal woman of Revelation 12:1 is the woman of Genesis 3:15, and the manchild of Revelation 12:5 is a part of the seed of the woman that is also mentioned in Genesis 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you do not understand Revelation 12, you will not be clear in full about Genesis 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this small verse three major items were unfolded the serpent, the woman, and the seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is difficult for us to understand these three items without reading through the entire Bible until we come to the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we come to Revelation 12 we discover that the serpent of Genesis 3:15 is the Devil, for Revelation 12:9 speaks of "the ancient serpent, he who is called the Devil and Satan."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The woman is not only Eve, but all the people who put their trust in God, including the virgin Mary, for God's people occupy a feminine position before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, we see that within the woman is a stronger part called the manchild.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the manchild of Revelation 12 is a part of the seed of the woman mentioned in Genesis 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some may ask who the manchild is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are different schools of teaching in Christianity regarding this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some say that the manchild is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I agree with this in a sense because the Lord Jesus is the Head, the center, the reality, the life, and the nature of the manchild.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, this manchild is not individual; he is corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since the woman herself is not individual, but universal and corporate, her child must also be universal and corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This corporate manchild includes the Lord Jesus as the Head, center, reality, life, and nature of the manchild.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This can be proved from the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Psalm 2:8-9 prophesies that the Lord Jesus, God's Anointed One, will rule the nations with a rod of iron.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Revelation 2:26-27 says that the overcomers in the churches will rule over the nations with a rod of iron.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now in Revelation 12:5 we are told that the manchild will rule all nations with a rod of iron.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, according to the record of the Bible, both the Lord Jesus Himself and His overcomers will rule over the nations with a rod of iron.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, the manchild in Revelation 12:5 includes both the Lord Jesus and the overcomers in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, Revelation 20:4 says that Christ and the resurrected overcomers will reign as kings for a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, the manchild in Revelation 12 is neither the Lord Jesus individually nor the overcomers separate from Him, but the Lord Jesus with the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ Himself is the foremost overcomer Rev 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As the leading overcomer He is the Head, center, reality, life, and nature of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Among the people of God on earth there is a stronger part which includes the Lord Jesus and the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, the Lord Jesus and His overcomers compose the manchild.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The enmity between the serpent and the woman's seed mentioned in Genesis 3:15 is fully manifested in Revelation 12.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Revelation 12 we see that the old serpent tries his best to damage the manchild and the woman vv.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>4, 13-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The enmity of Genesis 3:15 is thus fulfilled to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although the Lord Jesus was a manchild, He was born of a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The spiritual significance of this is that the Lord Jesus was born of a source that trusted in God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The woman is the source of the seed, and the seed, part of which is the manchild that defeats the enemy, is stronger than the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The source of the manchild is a woman, not a man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His source is the one who trusts in God, not the one who declares independence from God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The manchild is the seed of a woman who trusts in God and depends on God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord Jesus was the seed from such a source.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Likewise, we all need to be the seed of the woman, the seed from a source that depends on God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we claim to be a man before God, we are finished with God and are no longer of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Anyone who is of God must be a female before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If the leaders in the churches should say, "We know how to do things," they are no longer the woman before God, but have assumed the position of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The leading brothers should say, "O Lord, You know how weak we are.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We depend upon You.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Apart from You, Lord, we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We trust in You for everything."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If the leading brothers have this attitude, they are truly the woman before God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Genesis 3:15 does not mention the seed of man, for only the seed of woman, not the seed of man, has the position before God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>On the one hand, we are the woman; on the other hand, we are the seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We are the ones who trust in God: this is our source.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We also are the seed of this source that trusts in God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, we can become strong.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Only the seed of the source trusting in God can be strong, not strong in themselves, but strong in God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord Jesus Himself took the lead to be such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He is the Head of the manchild.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Now He is also the center, reality, life, and nature of the manchild.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>How the enemy, Satan, fights against this manchild!</S>
