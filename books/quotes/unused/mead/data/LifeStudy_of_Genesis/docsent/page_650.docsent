   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. JOSEPH'S LIFE BEING A LIFE OF DREAMS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Joseph was truly a dreamer, and his life was a life of dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A victorious and overcoming Christian will always be a dreamer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You need to have dreams, and you need to interpret the dreams of others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Day by day, let us all speak according to our vision, according to our dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, we must interpret the visions of others, and we must live according to our vision.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not speak according to our feelings, but according to the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are visionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because we are visionaries, we do everything according to the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although a certain thing has not yet come to pass, we speak according to what we have seen of it, and we find that our vision is being fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we compare Joseph with the other outstanding men in Genesis, we see that he is unique in dreams and in suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>None of the seven other great men had as many dreams as Joseph had; Joseph was always involved with dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His life was also unique with respect to suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Dreams require interpretation, and interpretation is a matter of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, Joseph was constantly speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through his speaking, all the dreams were fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Firstly, Joseph spoke himself into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If he had not spoken about his dreams, he would not have gotten into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His brothers hated him and sold him into slavery simply because he spoke about his dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If after having these dreams Joseph had been silent, there would have been no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His sufferings came from his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After the Boxer Rebellion, many saints in England prayed desperately for the vast country of China.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord answered their prayers by coming in and doing a marvelous work in the colleges throughout the country.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thousands of students, including a good number of brilliant ones, were captured by the Lord, and many of them saw a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I was one of these students, and I was very familiar with the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brother Nee was not the only one to see something concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many others did also.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, they were afraid to speak of their dream concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These students were afraid of the missionaries, whose goal was to advance their mission work, their mission church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They were fearful that if they spoke something different from what the missionaries were doing, they would get into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because of his bold speaking, Brother Nee was betrayed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the middle 1920s he published twenty issues of a paper called The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the articles in this paper Brother Nee spoke according to his dream.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a result, people laughed at him, and he got into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The missionaries, teachers, and theologians, all of whom were older than he, disregarded him and opposed him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brother Nee had seen a vision of local churches in every city throughout China.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A quarter century later, his dream was fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By 1948 there were about five hundred local churches in the provinces of China.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before Brother Nee's dream was fulfilled, however, he suffered a great deal, not only from outsiders, but even from turmoil stirred up by insiders.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Due to this turmoil, his ministry was set aside for a number of years.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brother Nee once told a certain brother that there was no possibility to ever resume his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is an indication of the severity of Brother Nee's sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He suffered so intensely that he felt that it was impossible for him ever to resume his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But, much to his surprise, the Lord did something in 1948 to restore his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the forthcoming biography of Brother Nee now in preparation all this will be made clear.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a result of the restoration of Brother Nee's ministry, hundreds of churches were raised up in the cities of China.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This was due to Brother Nee's speaking, to his sounding of the trumpet, and to that of a few co-workers who were faithful to him.</S>
