ON THE PROPER GROUND</h2>
<p>In order for the Lord to advance in these last days, we cannot merely speak about the ground of the church. If we desire to have the building, we must be sure to have the proper ground. As long as our ground is uncertain, nothing can be worked out. We must also recognize the enemy&rsquo;s scheme. Without the proper ground, we can be spiritual, but we are in Babylon. We may be as spiritual as Daniel, but we will be unable to build up the holy temple. If we desire to be built together to become the holy temple, the holy city, we must return to Jerusalem. Therefore, we must be sure of the ground; otherwise, we will not know where to build. We can be spiritual in Babylon, Aram, Syria, and Samaria; we can be spiritual in a scattered way. However, the temple of God is not built in Babylon, Aram, Syria, or Samaria. It is built in Jerusalem. We cannot build according to individual opinions. We need to return to the foundation on which the forefathers built the temple&mdash;Jerusalem.</p>
<p>This matter is not according to our opinion. It is according to the light seen by the apostles. We should return to the same ground on which the apostles built the churches. All the things related to the church ground should be according to the Bible. This is similar to baptism. It is not a matter of baptism by sprinkling or by immersion but of returning to the practice in the beginning. In the beginning the saints were baptized in water. They were buried with Christ. Similarly, the practice of the Lord&rsquo;s table is not a matter of a big cup or a small cup but of returning to the practice in the beginning. The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread&rdquo; (1 Cor. 10:17). Though we are many, we are one bread. We must go back to the practice in the beginning.</p>
<p>In the beginning there was one ground of the church, the ground of locality. We must return to the Bible. The Bible speaks of the church in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1; 11:22), the church in Antioch (13:1), the church in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2; 2 Cor. 1:1), and the church in Ephesus (Rev. 2:1). This shows the ground of the church. We cannot follow other proposals. We must have a definite ground, and then we can labor unreservedly to build up God&rsquo;s house. We can concentrate on the building work. We cannot speak of the building work if the ground is uncertain. We may speak about saving sinners and spiritual matters, but we cannot speak about the building.</p>
<p>We need to see both sides. We cannot have only the ground of the church. We must also have the building. However, if we lack the Lord&rsquo;s presence and His authority and if we are short of prayer and the dealing of the flesh, we will only have the local ground and nothing else. We need spiritual reality, and we also need the ground and the building. This is a twofold principle that we must grasp firmly.</p>
<p>The Lord raised us up with a great purpose. The ground of the church that we have taken has great impact on the children of God. We cannot lose our aim, neither should we forget our ministry and the work we are doing. If we are faithful on the ground to receive more dealings and to learn more lessons, relying on the Lord&rsquo;s grace to labor on the building, we will have great impact. Not only will we have the ground, but we also will have something solid and spiritual built on the ground. The impact of such a testimony to the church of God is beyond estimation, and the impact is even greater on the children of God. We believe that the Lord raised us up for this. Therefore, with our eyes bright and our goal clear, we must see what the Lord desires us to do. We need to see that in this age and in this universe, God intends to do a work of building, and this building work must be on a ground. We should stay on this ground, and keep up with God&rsquo;s leading today.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_061.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_063.html">Next</a> </body></html>
