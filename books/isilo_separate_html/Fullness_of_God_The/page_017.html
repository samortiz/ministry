<p>I would like to encourage the young brothers and sisters to pay attention to the crucial matter of taking Christ as life after our salvation. We have not believed in a religion or accepted a philosophy. We have received the life-giving Spirit who is real and living. The One who bore our sins and was crucified on the cross two thousand years ago wants to be our Savior. He has ascended to the throne in the heavens, and He is the Lord. This Jesus is our Savior and Lord. He is also the Spirit who is real and living. He lives in our spirit in order to be our life. Therefore, the most important matter after we are saved is to daily live by Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Contacting the Lord, Breathing Him In,<br />
and Reading the Word of God</h2>
<p>The first thing that we should do every morning when we wake up is to contact the Lord and call on His name. We should do this not only in the morning, but we should do this throughout the day, just as we breathe continually. We must take God as our life all day long. We should also read the Bible, the word of God, which is the truth, daily. The words in the Bible are different from philosophy and from the teachings of Confucius. Philosophy and the teachings of Confucius are beneficial to society, but they are merely doctrine. In contrast, the Bible as God&rsquo;s word gives a thorough explanation of God who is also hidden in the word as the reality. When we read the Bible every day, we contact God through His word. Eventually, we receive not only doctrine but the truth, the reality.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Contacting God to Receive Reality</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:22-25 says that wives should be subject to their husbands and that husbands should love their wives. It is a pity that most Christians, including many pastors, misunderstand submission and love in this chapter. When my wife and I were married, the pastor who married us asked me, &ldquo;Will you love her?&rdquo; Then he asked my wife-to-be, &ldquo;Will you be subject to him?&rdquo; In this situation everyone must respond, &ldquo;I will.&rdquo; Everyone must follow the ritual because it is a ceremony. Although we nod our head in agreement, it does not work.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5 is based on chapter 3, which says, &ldquo;That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God&rdquo; (v. 19). Chapter 5 repeats this in verse 18: &ldquo;Be filled in spirit.&rdquo; To be filled in spirit is to be filled unto all the fullness of God. When we are filled unto the fullness of God, we can overflow with obedience, submission, and love. Husbands often resolve to control their temper, maintain a proper attitude, and love their wife as the weaker vessel. Wives also make resolutions to submit to their husband. Our resolutions often last for only three hours, and then they become ineffective. Every wife wants to be a submissive, dutiful wife and a loving mother who is gentle, obedient, and sweet. Eventually, the wife is often not soft; rather, she is hard, like a piece of marble. In such a situation we need to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; After calling on the Lord, we will be filled within, and we will have submission and love. This is our experience.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Earnest in Our Education<br />
and Studying the Truth</h2>
<p>Although the students in Taiwan are very busy with their school work, I encourage them to work hard, because once they are over twenty-five years old, it will be difficult for them to further their education. They should do their best to spend all their time to study before they turn twenty-two. Around 1976 I discovered that most of the young brothers in the United States had an erroneous concept. They thought that as long as they loved the Lord and were spiritual, it was sufficient to mow lawns and clean swimming pools for a living. I was strong to correct that kind of erroneous concept. I thank the Lord that after my speaking many young people had a change in attitude, and by 1980 many of them had obtained higher degrees as a result of that message. A sister testified to me that she became a certified nurse because of that encouraging word. There are numerous testimonies of this kind.</p>
<p>Therefore, I encourage you to be earnest in your studies and get the best grades. However, you should not study diligently and neglect the Lord and the truth. You must cultivate the habit of daily praying for at least five minutes in the morning and reading the Word for ten minutes. This is not difficult; everyone can do it. Young people should not love their bed. It is more profitable to rise ten minutes earlier than it is to rise ten minutes later. Sleeping an extra ten minutes does not necessarily make you stronger. Seven hours of sleep is sufficient.</p>
<p>In the matter of studying the truth, I would like to recommend the Recovery Version of the New Testament. The young people, especially the newly saved ones, should study the book of Romans. If you want to refer to the English edition, I encourage you to purchase the Recovery Version in English for reference and comparison.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
