<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FORTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">THE MINISTRY OF THE MAN-SAVIOR<br />IN HIS HUMAN VIRTUES<br />WITH HIS DIVINE ATTRIBUTES<br />FROM GALILEE TO JERUSALEM</h1><h1 class="title">(20)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 18:31&mdash;19:10</h1><p>In this message we shall cover 18:31&mdash;19:10. These verses cover three matters: the Lord&rsquo;s unveiling of His death and resurrection the third time (vv. 31-34); His healing a blind man near Jericho (vv. 35-43); and His saving Zaccheus in Jericho (19:1-10).</p><h2 class="head1">UNVEILING HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION<br />THE THIRD TIME</h2><p>While the Man-Savior was making the long journey from Galilee to Jerusalem, He spoke to His disciples about many things. In 18:31 He took the twelve aside in order to speak a private word to them. This word spoken privately to the disciples concerned His going to Jerusalem to die.</p><p>In verses 31 through 33 this word is recorded in some detail: &ldquo;Behold we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things will be accomplished which have been written through the prophets regarding the Son of Man. For He will be delivered up to the Gentiles, and will be mocked and outrageously treated and spit upon; and when they have scourged Him, they will kill Him; and on the third day He will rise.&rdquo; It is significant that in verse 31 the Lord does not say, &ldquo;Behold I am going up to Jerusalem&rdquo;; instead, He says, &ldquo;Behold we are going up to Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p><p>This was the third time the Lord Jesus revealed His death to the disciples. The first was in Caesarea Philippi, before His transfiguration (9:22). The second was in Galilee, after His transfiguration (9:44-45). This time, the third time, was on the way to Jerusalem. This revelation was a prophecy, altogether strange to the natural concept of the disciples, yet fulfilled literally in every detail.</p><p>We have seen that the Man-Savior had predicted His death and resurrection twice already. Since the time for His death had come, He was going to Jerusalem. This was His obedience to God unto death (Phil. 2:8), according to the counsel of God (Acts 2:23), for the fulfillment of His redemptive plan (Isa. 53:10). He knew that through His death He would be glorified in resurrection (Luke 24:25-26) and that His divine life would be released to produce many brothers for His expression (John 12:23-24; Rom. 8:29). For the joy set before Him, He despised the shame (Heb. 12:2) and volunteered to be delivered to the Satan-usurped leaders of the Jews and condemned by them to death. For this God exalted Him to the heavens, seated Him at His right hand (Mark 16:19; Acts 2:33-35), gave Him the name which is above every name (Phil. 2:9-10), made Him both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36), and crowned Him with glory and honor (Heb. 2:9).</p><p>Luke 18:34 says, &ldquo;And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know what was being said.&rdquo; We may compare the Man-Savior&rsquo;s word to His disciples concerning His death to beautiful music played to those who do not appreciate such music. The disciples were not able to appreciate the &ldquo;music&rdquo; &ldquo;played&rdquo; to them by the Lord. They did not understand anything the Lord said. Although He used simple words, they could not comprehend what He was saying.</p><p>Why were the disciples not able to grasp the Lord&rsquo;s word concerning His death and resurrection? The reason for their inability to understand was that they were altogether in another kingdom, in their own kingdom. Because they were in their own kingdom, they did not have a heart for the things of the kingdom of God.</p>
