   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN PRACTICING ONE-ON-ONE,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MAKING HOME DELIVERIES, AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GIVING INJECTIONS AT HOME Scripture Reading: Acts 6:7; 12:24; 19:20</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This meeting was called because of an urgent need.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This urgent need is still related to the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You can tell by now that I cannot forget the home meetings even in my dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even though I may be giving other messages, in the end I always come back to the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I cannot help it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whatever fills the heart will come out from the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>My heart is in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>My concern is for the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My joy is in the home meetings, and my complaints are concerning the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I do not care for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I just care for the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we have the home meetings, we can say Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do not have the home meetings, even if we say Hallelujah, it will not be for long.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only when we have the home meetings will our Hallelujahs be strong and long-lasting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE LAW FOR THE INCREASE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>OF THE CHURCH THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am not joking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Based on my observation from every angle, I am convinced that the increase and spread of the church depend fully on the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is based on my sixty years of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have discovered the law for the increase and spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everything has its own laws.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Science is the discovery of these laws.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The law for the increase of the church is the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have been meeting on the island of Taiwan since 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It has now been thirty-six years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, I have been constantly working.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the other hand, I have been constantly researching in the laboratory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I never stop studying.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today the university education continues to improve every day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The improvement does not come from the classrooms.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It comes from the laboratory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all need an awakening.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The less we study, the less we progress.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While we work, we must find out the principles and the laws.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For the past five years I have been studying the reason for the lack of growth of the work in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why has there not been any increase in the number of saints in the churches in Taiwan?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have been looking for a reason.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Recently the Lord has shown me something.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since I came back last year, I have been speaking about the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The home meetings are the foundation for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we give up this foundation, surely our number will not increase.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today on the five continents, there are over six hundred churches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The work here in Taiwan is the largest among them all.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Of all the six hundred churches, the biggest church is the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For this reason I had to come back here.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Taipei is like a source.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we do not take care of the source, if the source is not strong, the other churches will have a difficult time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At present, there are about eighty churches in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are over twenty churches in Japan, and in Korea there are also over twenty churches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Malaysia there are also over twenty churches, and in Indonesia the number is between twenty and thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Thailand there are fifteen to twenty churches, and Hong Kong and Singapore have one each.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the Philippines there are over a hundred and thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Australia there are six, and in New Zealand we also have over twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In North America, with the United States and Canada together, there are over a hundred and ten churches.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Central and South America there are another hundred churches.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Altogether, in the Americas there are over two hundred churches.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Another thirty or more are in Europe, and in Africa there are over ten.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All these five continents are open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Most of these places were raised up through the English publications.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All of them are waiting like babies for their parents feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our workers are too few.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But I feel that the source of the Lord s recovery is in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If Taiwan stands still, it will be difficult to move all the other places.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When I compared Taiwan with the other places, I had no choice but to sacrifice the other places.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I did not do this lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I made this decision after much deliberation.</S>
