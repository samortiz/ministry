<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO ADVANCE AND<br />
ABOUND IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">First Having the Knowledge<br />
of the Truth Themselves</h2>
<p>The elders need to advance and abound in the knowledge of the truth (1 Tim. 5:17b). If we want to pursue the truth today, the simple way is to properly study the Life-studies. Many have dropped their jobs, forsaken the world, and joined the full-time training. In the training, during a twenty-four hour day, apart from eating, resting, and sleeping, the trainees spend all their time pursuing the truth. Although there are teachers in the training center who teach courses, they cannot read the Life-studies for the trainees; the trainees must study and enter into the Life-studies for themselves.</p>
<p>Let me use myself as an example. I did not graduate from a university or receive any kind of diploma, but, may the Lord&rsquo;s blood cover me, I have been able to take charge of the translation work of the Recovery Version of the New Testament. At times I found that a word was not according to the original language, and my helpers would then verify whether it was so. In such cases they would find that it was truly so. I came to know all these things because I have many dictionaries from which I have learned many things. It can be said that I have acquired much knowledge without being taught. Today all the full-time trainees have the best opportunity in the training. In a twenty-four hour day, other than doing some community work in the evening, they can take advantage of the rest of their time. If they can read six hours a day, they can read through the Life-studies in a little more than a year. This is real pursuing.</p>
<p>Through the literature work in the Western world, not including the Far East, over six hundred churches have been raised up in the past twenty years. These approximately six hundred churches were first established in North America, then in Mexico, Central America, South America, Africa, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. I have never been to some of these places, and others I have visited only once; nevertheless, these churches have been raised up mainly through the literature. The literature work began in Taipei. At that time my family lived in a Japanese-style flat that was less than 300 square feet: the front section was about 150 square feet and the rear section was about 100 square feet, and the corridor was another 40 square feet. I asked someone to build a small kitchen and bathroom in the backyard using wooden boards. It was in this kind of environment that I began the literature work. I began by working on the sixty topics of <em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures.</em></p>
<p>Today the scale of the literature work is quite large. There are two stations in the United States: one in Anaheim, California, and the other in Irving, Texas. Books are currently published in over ten languages, including French, German, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Portuguese. These books are distributed to the six continents, supplying over one thousand churches. In 1973, because of the increasing number of attendants at the conferences held in Los Angeles, at times exceeding three thousand, we decided to begin to have trainings in 1974. Everyone who registers for the training is required to give a donation. This serves the purpose of providing a better estimation of our budget for the arrangement of various aspects of the work.</p>
<p>Concerning this point, I learned the lesson from Brother Nee&rsquo;s practice. At the beginning, when he published <em>The Present Testimony,</em> he did it by faith; that is, the number of issues he published depended on the offerings he received. If there were not many offerings, he would wait. Hence, sometimes nothing was put out for two years, and at other times two issues were put out in a single year. When the offerings came, he would put out an issue, and when the offerings did not come, he waited. This made it difficult to work and to spread. For instance, if persons are hired for the publication work, but later no offering comes, do those who are hired stay or leave? This is a problem in the service. Hence, when he published <em>The Christian,</em> Brother Nee had the subscribers pay a dollar per year, which was to be used by the work. Our trainings are carried out according to this same principle. This is a little fellowship related to the spread of the literature work.</p>
