   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Being Individualistic</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The body is the most beautiful thing there is on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet the body can also become the most ugly thing on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A man looks very fine if he stands here with all his members attached.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But if all I saw were isolated members detached one from the other, this would be the most ugly sight.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If I came into this house and saw two feet at the door, a pair of ears in the room, and a pair of arms at the stairs, how horrible this sight would be!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I would surely run away at once.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the same way, if a person acts independently and is not joined to the Body, he will become a very ugly member.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is one thing for a person to acknowledge that he is a member.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is another thing for this person to be coordinated as a member.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Independent actions in the Body are the ugliest things there are.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Submission to the Authority of the Ministry Ministry Being the Authority</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Authority is related to the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Authority is also related to ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Please remember that all the members have their special gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The ears, the eyes, the mouth, the hands, and the feet all have their gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These gifts are the ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As long as there is the ministry, there is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why does the ministry have authority?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is because each member receives different ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The difference in ministries produces authority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the same time, with the authority in the ministry there are the limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God may grant grace to me to be an ear and to enable me to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, He intends that I serve the Body with my hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the other hand, He intends that I accept my own limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If I want to see, I have to ask the eyes to help me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The problem today is that those who cannot hear insist that they want to hear, those who cannot speak insist that they have to speak, and those who cannot run insist that they have to run.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to realize that for others to do something is equal to our doing the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their gift is our gift.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the same time, we have to learn to be limited and to realize that the church is a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Need to See One's Limitations</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some people simply do not know how to study the Bible or teach the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet they insist that they have to do it, and the result is many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the Lord is gracious to you and He makes you a hand, you can raise up this hand as high as you want.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if you say that in addition to being a hand, you want to see also, you will not succeed even if you try it as long as you live.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You should pray, "Lord, cause me to see my limitations.''</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you were all-inclusive, then you would become the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The acceptance of our own limitations is a principle of coordination, and it is also the greatest test.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who realize their own limitations will fellowship in everything and will seek help and counsel in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must realize that authority is in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The ear has a ministry of hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, the ear has the authority of hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do not see our own limitations, we will not be able to submit to authority even if we want to.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only those who have seen their own limitations can coordinate with other members.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some brothers think that they can expound the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They think that they are Bible expositors.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Actually, they do not know how to expound the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet they insist that they have to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The result is many strange teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>With a Christian there is not much difference between the self and the individual life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some people never understand what Paul meant when he said that "all are yours'' 1 Cor 3:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to realize that we were born into a rich family.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can rejoice because we are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Within us there is always the feeling that we should accept authority.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our inner man always wants to submit and accept the authority of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the one hand, we have to see our limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the other hand, we have to see that whatever the Lord has established is an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is the Lord who gives some the ability to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That ability is that person's authority.</S>
