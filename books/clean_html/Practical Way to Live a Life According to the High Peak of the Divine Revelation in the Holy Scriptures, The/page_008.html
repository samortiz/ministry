ALL THESE EXCELLENT, DIVINE, AND HUMAN ACCOMPLISHMENTS BEING FOR THE PRODUCING AND BUILDING UP OF THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>All these excellent, divine, and human accomplishments are for the producing and building up of the organic Body of Christ as the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth as the expansion and expression of the processed and consummated Triune God in humanity for eternity (Eph. 1:23; 4:12, 16; Rev. 21:1&#151;22:5).</P><P>The outline and the fellowship in this chapter are worthy of our study. We need to get into the accomplishments of the Triune God from His incarnation through His human living, His death, and His resurrection to His ascension. The accomplishments of the processed and consummated Triune God are the real content of the Bible. They are for the purpose of making God man so that the many men chosen by God can be made God in His life and in His nature but not in His Godhead, so that God and man can be constituted together as one entity. This one entity is the organic Body of Christ consummating in the New Jerusalem.</P>
