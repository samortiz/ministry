<h2 class="head1">THE POWER OF THE GOSPEL HINGING<br />ON CONSECRATION</h2><p>I hope that in handing ourselves over and in our consecration, we will not fail in any area this time. Consecration cannot fail. Once it fails, the gospel stops. In order to maintain the impact and power of the gospel, our consecration cannot stop. Today all Christians admire the power of the early church and the early apostles, but they have forgotten the consecration of these people. The power of the gospel comes from consecration. I hope that we will all remember this. May the gospel never lose its power in us.</p><p>The assembly in Hankow has had problems for a long time because the brothers and sisters were not thorough in their consecration. During the past two months there has been a revival, and ninety people have been baptized. The underlying reason for this change is that some saints have begun to hand themselves over. If a man does not hand himself over, he cannot love the Lord or the brothers and sisters, much less sinners. Under such circumstances, the gospel surely will not go out. Many people cannot love the Lord and cannot love sinners because their love is for their treasure. Where our treasure is, there is our love as well. The greatest secret to loving the Lord is storing up one's treasure in heaven. Spontaneously, we will love the Lord. I hope that we will wrap our heart around our treasure and send both to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLE OF DEALING WITH ITEMS<br />THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED OVER</h2><p>During the past three years, we practiced a particular principle in Chefoo, Shanghai, Nanking, Foochow, Hangchow, and Tsingtao in regards to the things handed over to the church. The brothers who bear special responsibility before the Lord should first let the brothers and sisters know that they should not hand themselves over foolishly. We should let them know where the consecrated items are being sent. From the first day we practiced handing over in China until this very moment, none of the co-workers has had the right to touch any of the consecrated goods of the brothers and sisters. We cannot use one penny of this money. The co-workers must, as Paul said, exercise foresight for what is honorable (2 Cor. 8:21). The money from the brothers' and sisters' consecration should be given to poor saints, local or otherwise, or it can be used for the propagation of the gospel.</p><p>Let us make this solemn declaration again: No co-worker has permission to touch a penny of this money. This word should be unnecessary in the first place. If a person is truly consecrated, he has no problem in this area. But I want to clarify this matter for the sake of helping some brothers and sisters understand our practice.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Absolute in Our Practice</h2><p>In handing themselves over, the brothers and sisters have to learn to do it in an absolute way. If we keep back anything or if we are not absolute in any way, we will not have the joy. Handing oneself over releases the burden that is upon us. If we only hand over half of what we have, we will still have half the burden on us. Even if we hand over ninety percent, we will still have ten percent of the burden on us. We will only be happy when we hand over everything.</p>
