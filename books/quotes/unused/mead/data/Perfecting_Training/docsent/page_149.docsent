   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD AS THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 14 may be considered as a conclusion of the preceding thirteen verses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>So verse 14 begins with the little word for to indicate that something has preceded it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Of the foregoing verses, the most crucial and the most basic is verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These three elements the law, the Spirit, and the life are the very constituents that constitute the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In those thirteen verses, the first few verses talk about the law and the function of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In previous messages concerning the law, we have pointed out that the law is a Person, that is, the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The law is the Triune God, who after being processed, has become the indwelling Spirit as the law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The law of the Spirit of life is just the processed Triune God as the indwelling Spirit working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The law indicates the function, the working principle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the first item of the constitution or the composition of the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>LIFE DEFINED</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From verse 6 through verse 11 life is defined.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 6 says that to set your mind on the spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 10 says that when Christ is in you the spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then verse 11 says that the Spirit will give life to your mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that life gets into your spirit, into your mind or soul, and into your body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So the second section of the foregoing verses defines the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE SPIRIT DEFINED</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the third section the definition is mainly concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>So there is the definition of the law, the definition of the life, the definition of the Spirit, and then verse 14 as a conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that these three, the law, the Spirit, and the life, are the constituents or the composition of the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE REALIZATION OF THE LEADING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the past few messages I said that if you add the residing, the life giving, and the putting to death together you have the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These three things added together equal the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is right, but that does not mean the leading of the Spirit is composed of these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It means that the leading is realized in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, the residing, the life giving, and the putting to death are the realization of the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How do you realize the leading of the Spirit within you?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By the residing of the indwelling God, by the life giving of such a God, and by your putting to death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In other words the leading is carried out by God s residing, God s life giving, and our putting to death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But that doesn t touch the nature, the composition, of the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is the very essence, the very element, of the leading?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Substantially speaking, essentially speaking, the leading is composed with these three elements: the law, the Spirit, and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE NATURE AND SUBSTANCE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let us illustrate once again with a dog and a cat.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A dog lives a dog s life, and a cat lives a cat s life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Both of them have a kind of leading within them composed of the dog life and the cat life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Life refers to some substance with a nature.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The dog life has the dog substance with its nature, and the cat life has the cat substance with its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The human life has the human substance with a human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even with a human life there is a difference; there is the male life, and there is the female life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The male life has its characteristics, and the female life has its characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These characteristics are mainly the nature and the substance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE AUTOMATIC FUNCTION OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What then is the law?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The law is the automatic function of the life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is the working principle of the life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A dog life just works that way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is a law, an automatic regulation and direction.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is an automatic control working in a dog or in a cat or even in a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every dog is led by its life and its law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every cat is led by its life and its law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And every human being is led by the law of the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>More particularly every human female is led by the female human life with its law.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Every human male is led by the human male life with its law.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is hard for a man to live like a lady.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He has to perform.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When I speak, I speak according to my leading, composed with my male life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When my wife sings or talks, she has her leading composed of her female life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These are natural leadings of natural living creatures including dogs, cats, and human beings.</S>
