   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEW COVENANT 3 Issue No. 25 Scripture Reading: Matt 26:28</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 26:28 shows us that although the blood of Christ was shed for the forgiveness of sins, the blood is also the "blood of the covenant."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The blood is first related to the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The nature of the blood is of the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The function of the blood is for the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>While it is true that the shedding of the blood is for the redemption and forgiveness of sins, it is the blood of the covenant that forgives sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the blood were not the blood of the covenant, even though it was shed, it could not bring in forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The reason that the shedding of blood forgives sins is that God had made a covenant with man in which the shedding of the blood would bring about the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is why the shedding of blood can forgive sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, this verse tells us the nature of the shedding of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The shedding of the blood is related to the new covenant, while the effect of the shed blood is the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's Word reveals that grace involves three aspects: promises, facts, and covenants.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have mentioned promises and facts and will not repeat it today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we will consider a covenant made with an oath.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the central message of our conference this time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We want to see what the covenant that God has made the new covenant is for.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some have said that there are a total of eight covenants in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I do not know if this is right.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However many there may be, the new covenant is the most important of them all.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Within a covenant, there are also promises and facts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible tells us clearly that God's covenant is a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's promise is what He has said with His own mouth, while God's covenant is what He has made with an oath.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A promise binds a person, but a covenant binds a person even more.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, a covenant cannot be annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, when God made a covenant with Abraham, He swore by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God not only promised Abraham but swore to him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thank and praise God that He has not only promised us but also made a covenant with us so that we can draw near to God and lay hold of Him with boldness, according to His righteousness and faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE REASON A COVENANT CONTAINS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A PROMISE AND A FACT</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hebrews 9:15-18 explains to us the reason that the covenant contains a promise and fact.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 16 says, "For where there is a testament, the death of him who made the testament must of necessity be established."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The word testament is the same as the word covenant in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The New Testament means "the new covenant" in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Bible there are two meanings to the word covenant: 1 a covenant, and 2 a will, or a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, the new covenant can be considered both a covenant as well as a testament or a will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without a promise, a covenant cannot be established.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Any covenant contains a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, a certificate of loan is a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Within this certificate, there is a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>An ordinary promise does not usually have a document with it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, a promise made in a covenant is supported by a legal procedure and bound by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, God's covenant includes God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But it is higher than His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is not much difference between God's promise and His covenant for those who have been deeply taught by God's grace and who know God in an intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They know that God is faithful, just as He is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, whatever God has promised, He will not leave unfulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They do not have to see legal evidence for all the promises before they believe in them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They consider God's promises to be God's covenants.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But for those who are weak in faith, God's promise and covenant still need to be distinguished from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, we cannot say that all promises are covenants.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But we can say that all covenants have promises.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A covenant contains not only a promise but a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, with a covenant there is not only a promise but also a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What is willed is the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For example, a father may will something to his son.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His testament tells of the way to dispose of his possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The inheritance is the result of the father's labor which the son can obtain without any work of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As long as he is the son, he can enjoy the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, there must be facts within a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Within the covenant there is a testament and inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, within a covenant there is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The three aspects of grace that God has given to us in the Bible are promises, facts, and covenants.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A covenant is higher than a promise or a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But a covenant includes a promise and a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Without these two things, a covenant is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thank God that there are many promises that are related to the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There are also many facts that are related to the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now we want to consider the nature of a covenant, the basis of a covenant, the relationship a covenant has with us, and the security of a covenant, etc. Suppose you receive a check or a bank draft.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The first thing you want to see is the amount; when you see it you are happy.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But if the check is void, it is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Today I can tell you that this check is very reliable and trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It can be cashed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You can be sure that you can safely draw money from it.</S>
