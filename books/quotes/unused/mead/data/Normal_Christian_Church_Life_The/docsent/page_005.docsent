   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Shepherding and teaching may be regarded as one ministry, because those who teach must also shepherd, and those who shepherd must also teach.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The two kinds of work are interrelated.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Furthermore, the word "shepherd" as applied to any person is found nowhere else in the New Testament, but the word "teacher" is used on four other occasions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the New Testament we find reference elsewhere to an apostle for example, Paul , and a prophet for example, Agabus , and an evangelist for example, Philip , and a teacher for example, Manaen , but nowhere in God's Word do we find anyone referred to as a shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This confirms the fact that shepherds and teachers are one class of men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Teachers are men who have received the gift of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not a miraculous gift, but a gift of grace, which accounts for the fact of its being omitted from the list of miraculous gifts in 1 Corinthians 12:8-10, and included in the list of the gifts of grace in Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is a gift of grace which enables its possessors to understand the teachings of God's Word, and to discern His purposes, and thus equips them to instruct His people in doctrinal matters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the church in Antioch there were several persons thus equipped, Paul among the number.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is by the operation of God that such men are "placed in the church," and their position is next to that of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A teacher is an individual who has received the gift of teaching from God, and has been given by the Lord to His Church for its upbuilding.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The work of a teacher is to interpret to others the truths which have been revealed to him, to lead God's people to an understanding of the Word, and to encourage them to seek and receive for themselves divine revelation through the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their sphere of work is mainly among the children of God, though at times they also teach the unsaved 1 Tim 4:11; 6:2; 2 Tim 2:2; Acts 4:2-18; 5:21, 25, 28, 42 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Their work is more one of interpretation than of revelation, whereas the work of the prophets is more one of revelation than of interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They seek to lead believers to an understanding of divine truth, and they seek to lead unbelievers to an understanding of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Evangelists are also our Lord's gift to His Church, but exactly what their personal gifts are we do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Word of God does not speak of any evangelistic gift, but it does refer to Philip as being an evangelist Acts 21:8 , and Paul on one occasion encouraged Timothy to do the work of an evangelist and fill up the measure of his ministry 2 Tim 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Apart from these three occasions, the noun "evangelist" is not found in Scripture, though we frequently meet the verb which is derived from the same root.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Word of God the place of prophets is more clearly defined than that of teachers and evangelists.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Prophecy is mentioned among the gifts of grace Rom 12:6 , and among the miraculous gifts we find it again 1 Cor 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God has set prophets in the Church universal 1 Cor 12:28 , but He has also given prophets for the ministry Eph 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is both the gift of prophecy and the office of a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Prophecy is both a gift of miracle and a gift of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The prophet is both a man set by God in His Church to occupy the prophetic office, and a man given by the Lord to His Church for the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of the four classes of gifted men bestowed by the Lord upon His Church for its upbuilding, the apostles were quite different from the other three.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The special position occupied by apostles is obvious to any reader of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They were specially commissioned of God to found churches through the preaching of the gospel, to bring revelation from God to His people, to give decisions in matters pertaining to doctrine and government, and to edify the saints and distribute the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Both spiritually and geographically their sphere is vast.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That their position was superior to that of prophets and teachers is clear from the Word: "God has placed some in the church: first apostles" 1 Cor 12:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Apostles belong to the ministry, but they are quite different from the prophets, evangelists, and teachers, because, unlike these three, it is not their gifts that determine their office; that is, they are not constituted apostles by receiving an apostolic gift.</S>
