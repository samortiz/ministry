   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear Sisters Ruth and Phoebe in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hallelujah, praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He has heard my supplication and provided a brother to travel with me.</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the seventh we boarded the boat; Sister Cheng Feng-yi and Brother Shen sent us on our way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was raining hard, and it hurt me to see them laboring so much.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I could only thank the Lord on the one hand and accept their love on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After I arrived in Tsingtao, I stayed at my sister's house.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the morning of the thirteenth, I took the train, got off at a little after 10:00 a.m., and took the bus at 11:30 a.m. At 1:00 p.m. I got off the bus, and I arrived home by 3:30 p.m. Thank and praise the Lord, we have seen His guidance and provision in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord has graced me and my whole family.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord stopped my father through someone's hand from doing something improper.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It has to do with some family affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Humanly speaking, my father was fully justified in bringing the matter to court.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the gracious Lord stopped this action through a visiting friend.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After I returned home and saw my father, I told him what kind of stand a Christian should take.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all felt that it was the Lord who had stopped this course of action.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am so happy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thank and praise Him!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although men sometimes believe in Him foolishly, He nevertheless grants grace to those who love Him, and He stops them from doing things that they should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His love is truly wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Praise Him!</S>
