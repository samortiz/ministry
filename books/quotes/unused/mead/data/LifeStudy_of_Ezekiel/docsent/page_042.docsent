   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING STRAIGHT IN OUR COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we are under a clear and expanding sky, we can have the adequate and proper coordination, a coordination that is altogether straight.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the first chapter of Ezekiel, the word straight is used a few times.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 7 it is used for the calf s hoofs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 23 it is used for the eagle s wings: Under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that in our coordination we must be straight.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes the coordination in the local churches is not straight but is somewhat crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, brother A might fellowship a matter with brother B and then ask him not to tell brother C about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But brother B goes to brother C, passes on the information to him, and then asks him not to say anything about this to brother D. This kind of coordination is political.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should never play politics in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we say something to one brother, we should be able to say it to others as well.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that our wings must be straight.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our coordination must be frank, sincere, earnest, and straight.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A VOICE COMING OUT OF THE WINGS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>OF THE LIVING CREATURES</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 24a says, When they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of a host.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here we are told that as the living creatures moved, Ezekiel heard the voice of their wings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that as they moved in a straight coordination, a voice came out.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This voice was their testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From this we see that the voice of the testimony of any local church must come out of the proper coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It should not be the voice of an individual believer; it should be the voice of the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The voice comes out of the wings that have been joined to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Consider the situation with Peter in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before the day of Pentecost, Peter often voiced something by himself, and what he spoke was usually rejected by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was because he voiced it by himself Matt 16:22-23; 17:4-5, 24-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But after the Lord s ascension, on the day of Pentecost, Peter stood up with the eleven Acts 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I believe that when the twelve stood there, they were like the four living creatures in Ezekiel 1.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The voice which came out on the day of Pentecost was not the voice of an individual Peter but the voice of a corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE LIVING CREATURES</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>USING TWO WINGS TO COVER THEMSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, the four living creatures stretched two of their wings for coordination, for moving, and for giving the voice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the other hand, they used the other two wings to cover themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates that in the church life, in the coordination, we all need to learn to hide ourselves under the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not display yourself but instead hide yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hide under the eagle s wings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There should be no manifestation of the self or of any individual.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No matter how great our portion may be, we need to hide ourselves under the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should never boast in ourselves but always boast in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If our sky is clear, if we have a straight coordination, and if we hide ourselves in the Lord and under His grace, there will be a beautiful situation among us in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>AS THE SOUND OF GREAT WATERS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the situation of a local church is like that of the four living creatures described above, that church will be qualified and adequate to sound out the voice and to give a strong testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The voice will not be that of an individual person but will be like the sound of great waters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A particular believer may be spiritual and love the Lord very much, but if he is not coordinated with others, the voice of his testimony will be weak; it will not be like the voice of great waters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to look to the Lord that the testimonies of all the local churches would be like the great waters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One individual brother should not always speak something for the local church, but a coordinated body should sound the voice and give the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Others will be astonished at this kind of voice, and they will say that the voice of this local church is like the sound of great waters.</S>
