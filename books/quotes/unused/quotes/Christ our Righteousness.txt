The Bible does not say that we are saved by the righteousness of Christ or that the righteousness of Christ has become our righteousness
The phrase the righteousness of Christ is only used in 2 Peter 1:1, in reference to Christ's own righteousness
They would say that they are saved by the righteousness of Christ and that they come to God through Christ's righteousness
Only when we come to Romans 6 do we see that we are joined to Him in the likeness of His death and resurrection
A Christian does not become righteous in the eyes of God through the righteousness of Christ, but through Christ Himself
She realized that her temper was a sin, and she acknowledged that she did not have any righteousness of her own
It is not something about Christ that has become our righteousness; rather, Christ Himself in His entirety has become our righteousness
If we behave well today and think that we are more qualified to come to God, we are coming to Him by our own righteousness
A Christian does not become more unrighteous through sinning, nor does he become more righteous through doing good
Rebekah gave to Jacob the coat of Esau and covered his hands and neck with the skin of goats in an effort to steal his father's blessing
Our advancement cannot make us more qualified to come to God, and our evil cannot make us less qualified to come to God
We have to see that man's condition before God can be good or bad, but his position before God can never change
It will not afford us more boldness, nor will it take away any of our boldness, because our righteousness is simply Christ Himself
