<H1 CLASS=SERIES>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation</H1><H1 CLASS=SERIES>THE DIVINE ECONOMY<br>AND THE DIVINE DISPENSING</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWENTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>IN THE PROMISES AND TYPES<br>OF<br>GOD'S ANTICIPATED REDEMPTION AND SALVATION</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Lev. 2:1-3; 6:14-18; 7:9-10; 6:26, 29-30; 7:5-7, 15-21, 28-36; 23:4-21, 23-43; 1 Cor. 5:7, 8; 15:12-20; Acts 2:1-4, 32-33; Matt. 24:31; Zech. 12:10 --13:1; 14:16-21; John 20:16-17; Rom. 4:25b; Phil. 3:10a, 11b</H1><P>Prayer: O Lord Jesus, we worship You for what You are and for Your moving. Lord, we look to You for Your speaking. Thank You, Lord, that You are so eatable. You are dispensing Yourself through all the Scriptures, from Genesis to Revelation. Lord, open Yourself to us, and open our eyes to see what is on Your heart. We want to see Your good pleasure, Your desire, concerning us. Lord, do cover us once again, and anoint us with Yourself with the living utterance. Amen.</P><P>In this series of messages we are emphasizing the all-inclusive Christ whom we are eating, rather than the way to eat Him. Some expositors have emphasized the details of the way to eat the Passover lamb in Exodus 12:1-10, but they have missed the central issue of eating. The way in which we eat is not as important as what we eat. The Lord Jesus whom we are eating is rich in many items. We need to see the riches of Christ whom we have eaten and will be eating for eternity in the New Jerusalem. However, when we come to the Scriptures, we are often distracted by our preoccupations and prior knowledge. Today there are few who stress the enjoyment of Christ. We ourselves did not speak of the enjoyment of Christ and eating Christ before 1958. John 6:57 says, "He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me." We all need to see that God is good for food; He is eatable.</P><P>In the preceding messages we have seen the promises and types concerning God's redemption and salvation in the Old Testament, especially related to the eating of Christ as the threefold seed in humanity. We should stress this, rather than the way to eat Him. In John 14 one of the Lord's disciples asked Him to show him the way, and in verse 6 the Lord said, "I am the way and the reality and the life." Thus, the way to eat the Lord is the Lord Himself. The way is a person, the very One whom we eat.</P>
