<h1 class="title">LEARNING THE TRUTH FOR PROPHESYING</h1>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:20; Acts 2:42; 5:42; 2 Tim. 3:7; 1 Tim. 2:4; Col. 3:16; Heb. 5:13-14; 2 Tim. 2:2</h1>
<p>At present, the most important thing for the church is what Paul spoke of in 1 Corinthians 14:4: &ldquo;He who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but he who prophesies builds up the church.&rdquo; For the building up of the church, the most necessary thing is prophesying. To prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord. Although our testimonies in all the districts of the churches may be good, the content of the meetings is not rich enough. The content of the meetings is not rich because the speaking is not rich. If the speaking is rich in the church meetings, especially in the district meetings, the content of the meetings will also be rich.</p>
<p>Our problem today is related to our speaking; the proper speaking is not an ordinary speaking. In every district everyone is now exercising to speak, either to give a testimony or to prophesy. They are trying their best to exercise to speak a short word. This is good. Some speak with the help of a &ldquo;cane,&rdquo; using <em>Truth Lessons, Life Lessons,</em> or the Life-studies, all of which are helpful. However, the speaking is not rich enough. Hence, although all the brothers and sisters speak in the meetings, some speak on one topic, and others speak on another topic; at the end there is the need for a responsible brother to &ldquo;tie a knot,&rdquo; that is, to release a rich word to conclude the meeting. This is very necessary.</p>
<p>There are different ways to tie a knot; just as it is not simple to tie a knot, it is also not simple to conclude a meeting. Fifty years ago in mainland China, the suitcases and handbags that we carried on long trips were not as convenient and stylish as they now are. Today everything is so convenient. The luggage and suitcases that we carry on the plane from the United States to Taiwan vary in size and style and are all well equipped and elegant looking. However, when we traveled for a long distance fifty years ago, we had to tie a knot around each piece of the old-fashioned suitcase or bag in order to secure them. Sometimes the knot was not tight enough and became loose in the middle of the journey; sometimes, because of hastiness, the knot became tangled and was difficult to untie. Hence, a great deal of consideration is needed in regard to properly tying a knot.</p>
<p>With regard to our meetings, there is the need to tie a knot at the end, that is, to conclude in a proper way; however, this requires much consideration as to who should tie the knot and how to tie it. Not everyone can conclude a meeting, and not every conclusion is satisfying, supplying, and edifying. Hence, through careful study we have realized that in order to meet the long-term need related to the district meetings and group meetings, the concluding word of each meeting must have content. The content depends upon the speaking, not the testimonies. The Lord&rsquo;s word is what edifies and nurtures people the most. While testimonies may be helpful to the saints, they do not adequately nurture the saints, because they do not contain much of the Lord&rsquo;s word. The concluding word must have the truth as its basis; such a word imparts truth into the saints so that they feel solid within. Without the Lord&rsquo;s word the meeting is not solid; with the Lord&rsquo;s word it becomes solid and secure.</p>
<p>It is not easy to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word in a meeting. Fifty years ago Brother Nee saw the light and realized that the big meeting on Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, in which one person speaks and everyone else listens, is not proper and that having such a meeting is to follow the customs of the nations. However, at that time he clearly said we should not stop this kind of meeting, because we were not able to find an adequate substitute for it. If the meeting in which one person speaks and the rest listen had been stopped, we would not have known how to meet. At that time he pointed out that in order for us to have the kind of meeting described in 1 Corinthians 14:26, we would need to experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit was poured out, psalms, teachings, revelations, and even tongues would come. Our change in system in these past few years is based upon our repeated study and exercise to practice 1 Corinthians 14:26. Eventually we have been able to change the format of the meetings from having one person speak and everyone else listen to having a meeting in which everyone speaks and listens, that is, to a meeting full of mutuality.</p>
<p>When we delved into 1 Corinthians 14, the Lord revealed several crucial points. First, in verse 1 Paul says, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.&rdquo; If a saint can prophesy only when the Holy Spirit is poured out upon him, there is no need for him to desire earnestly to prophesy. To desire earnestly implies learning. Second, to prophesy is not to speak in tongues. Speaking in tongues does not require much learning. Speaking in tongues usually occurs while someone is praying, and the Holy Spirit suddenly descends upon him, causing him to speak in tongues. Hence, it is a miraculous speaking. Prophesying is different. It is to speak forth God with ordinary words. This cannot be acquired merely by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit; rather, it depends upon the daily learning of the speaking one.</p>
<p>Luke 1 contains the prophecies of Elizabeth, Mary, and Zachariah. As we ponder over their prophecies, we can see that without a foundation of God&rsquo;s word in their daily lives, it would have been difficult for them to prophesy with words matching the standard they displayed. Mary must have been especially familiar with the Old Testament because her prophecy quotes from the Old Testament extensively. In 1 Corinthians 14:26 Paul also points out the way in which all can prophecy. He says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation.&rdquo; This does not mean that whenever we come together, we will spontaneously have something. That would be impossible. Even if someone has a hymn, he still needs to be familiar with the numbering and the content of the hymnal; he also needs to have a deeper learning and knowledge regarding the hymns in order to be able to call a proper hymn in the meeting.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 14:12 Paul says, &ldquo;Seek that you may excel for the building up of the church.&rdquo; If we desire and seek to excel, we must learn. The Corinthians liked to speak in tongues, which does not require learning. However, if someone wants to prophesy, he needs to study and know the Bible. In this verse Paul indicates that speaking in tongues does not excel but is relatively inferior. In other words, although a person may have the gift of tongues, it is not an excelling gift, whereas to have the gift of prophesying is excelling. This truly indicates that prophesying includes learning. At the end of chapter 14, Paul says again, &ldquo;So then, my brothers, desire earnestly the prophesying&rdquo; (v. 39). I hope that we would all earnestly desire to prophesy.</p>
<p>In regard to learning the truth for prophesying, we need to pay attention to several matters.</p>
