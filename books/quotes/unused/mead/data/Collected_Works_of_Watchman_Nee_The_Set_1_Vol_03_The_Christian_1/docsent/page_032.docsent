   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The ascension of Christ concludes His work on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>His ascension is based on His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The meaning of His resurrection is the victory over everything that belongs to Satan's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 1:20-21 says, "Which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We know that these things refer to Satan and his subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus' ascension means that God has given Him a position that is higher than all the powers of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His position in heaven is a Satan-overcoming position.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Satan is under His feet; he has no chance to defeat Him because Jesus is now the Lord over all and has become the Head of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Philippians 2:8-11 says that Christ passed through "the death of a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In His ascension the Lord Jesus received the highest place, a place that Satan and his evil spirits cannot touch.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They also have to acknowledge the Lord Jesus as Lord and King.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This kind of position is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the Lord Jesus had not ascended, the effect of His death and resurrection on earth would have been affected.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is right for the Lord Himself to lead His people to this heavenly position.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the one hand, His people can shine for Him, and on the other hand, overcome the power of darkness that confronts them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is what Ephesians 2:6 tells us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the light of the sun overcomes darkness, the heavenly position of the Lord Jesus overcomes the devil's power of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the moon and the stars accompany the sun in the sky, Christians remain with the Lord Jesus in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>V.The work on the fifth day signifies the Lord Jesus as the Lord of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In His work on the fifth day, God created many kinds of aquatic lives and birds.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the previous four days, God prepared the heaven and the earth as the habitation for the living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Until this day there were no living creatures in the water and in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although plants were included in the work of the third day, there was no trace of animals.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The aquatic creatures were able to live in the water because God prepared the water on the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The birds were able to fly in the air because God prepared the air on the second day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Both birds and aquatic creatures have life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The only difference lies in their outward shape.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The God-created birds and aquatic creatures are distinct from each other in man's eyes; they are clearly different.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, they possess the same life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They are only different in the outward shell of their life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the work of the fifth day is for life to take form.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some take their form in the water, while others take their form in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The work on this day is a type of the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Life cannot create itself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All lives are created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is the Creator of all life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No matter what outward form this life takes, it comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the Lord Jesus resurrected and ascended, His work has been to dispense life to people, so that those with His life may have it more abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His ascension, typified by the work of the previous day, is for the purpose of becoming life to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can see this from Colossians 3:1-4: "If therefore you were raised together with Christ, seek the things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This speaks of resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Following ascension, the Scripture continues, "Your life is hidden with Christ in God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When Christ our life..."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From this we see that the work of Christ after ascension is to be our life, a life hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The birds and the aquatic creatures are a type of the people in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now we want to see how the birds and aquatic creatures correspond in significance to the life of the Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Life is given by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord has now ascended to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His goal is for His saints to express His life in a practical way before He comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If a life does not have an outward form, that life cannot exist on this earth or have any experience on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although outward form does not mean much, without such a form, there will be no way for life to be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For this reason it is indispensable for life to "take form."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord Jesus wants His saints to work out a practical expression of the life which is derived from His death and resurrection on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They have received life through the Lord's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Positionally, they have received a heavenly place.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What they lack is a form on earth that expresses the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the meaning of the work on this day.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord Jesus is now training His disciples to take form on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As the birds express their life through their outward forms and as aquatic creatures express their life through their outward forms, the Lord Jesus desires that His saints express Him with a definite form on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord desires His saints, wherever they are, to express His life through their forms.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This life is the same life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But in their outward forms, there is a difference between birds and aquatic creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Birds and aquatic creatures receive the same life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But their forms are different.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hence, there are different expressions of the same inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All the life that the saints receive comes from the Lord Jesus; there was no difference in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, because of differences in the saints' character, they express the Lord's life in different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We see this clearly in the parable of the sower.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Although the same kind of seed is sown, although the life within the seed is the same, and although the fields are all good, eventually, some bear thirtyfold, some sixtyfold, and some a hundredfold.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Everyone receives the same life from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There are different expressions to this life because the "outlets" of this life are different.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hence, in the work of this day the Lord Jesus charges His saints to prove His life on earth and express His life through their character.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Unless we express the heavenly life practically on earth, the life, which we obtained through regeneration and is derived from the Lord's death, resurrection, and ascension, will not be firmly joined to us.</S>
