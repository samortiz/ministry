<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Satisfy God by the Burnt Offerings,<br>Sin Offerings, and Peace Offerings</H2><P>When we have the proper worship of God, God is satisfied by the burnt offerings, sin offerings, and peace offerings. All these offerings signify Christ as the redemption of God's people in different aspects.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Offered by the Twelve Tribes<br>in Twelve Days, the Number of the Sacrifices<br>Being Twelve Multiplied One Time,<br>Two Times, or Five Times</H2><P>These sacrifices were offered by the twelve tribes in twelve days. The number of the sacrifices was twelve multiplied either one time (twelve), two times (twenty-four), or five times (sixty), signifying that the offering time, the offering people, and the offerings are eternally complete in God's administration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Affording a Time for Moses to Speak with God</H2><P>The offering in Numbers 7 afforded Moses a time to speak with God. "When Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with Him, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the propitiatory cover that was upon the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim; and he spoke to Him" (v. 89). At the propitiatory cover upon the ark of the testimony, there was a conversation between man and God. In this conversation Moses could hear God's voice. How wonderful that God and man could be one to the extent that they could have such a conversation!</P>
