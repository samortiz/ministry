   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The first stanza of Hymns, #501 says, "O glorious Christ, Savior mine,/Thou art truly radiance divine;/God infinite, in eternity,/Yet man in time, finite to be."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This God infinite in eternity came to be a man finite in time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Where is He being a finite man?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is in us as a finite man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Have we experienced these two lines?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord, who is the embodiment of the great God, was the infinite God in eternity, yet today He came into us, human beings who are so small, to be a finite man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Praise the Lord that for us to live is He who is the infinite God, the God in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although we are finite men in time, He is living within us today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should learn to apply the truth in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Otherwise, even though we have a very good Bible and hymnal, we cannot apply them to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The chorus of this hymn says, "Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ, expression of God, the Great,/Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!/God mingled with humanity/Lives in me my all to be."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to learn to apply these words to our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Stanza 2 says, "The fulness of God dwells in Thee;/Thou dost manifest God's glory;/In flesh Thou hast redemption wrought;/As Spirit, oneness with me sought."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These lines are really good, but we should not simply remain in the appreciation of them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to ask ourselves whether this is the life we live.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's glory was manifested in Him, but is He manifested in us today?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, is the Spirit one with me today?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Husbands, when you talk to your wife, is Christ one with you?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Perhaps in experience you can only say, "In flesh Thou hast redemption wrought," but you cannot say, "As Spirit, oneness with me sought."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, although we sing this hymn, we do not have its reality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Stanza 3 says, "All things of the Father are Thine;/All Thou art in Spirit is mine;/The Spirit makes Thee real to me,/That Thou experienced might be."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is an excellent stanza.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All that the Father has, was received by the Son, and all that the Son is, was given to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This Spirit comes into our spirit to become our reality so that the all-inclusive Christ may be our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Have these words become our experience?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do we have this reality in our living?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we check our condition, we have to say that we are short of such experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In a previous chapter we saw that the degradation of the church is due to our not enjoying the Christ who is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Grace be with you."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To overcome today's degraded Christianity, we need to enjoy Christ in our spirit as our portion to be the abounding grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brothers, we need to bow our heads and confess that we are short of this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Among us, we have the light in the books and the hymns, but we have neglected the practical experience in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although we may sing a hymn of high quality, the husbands and wives still quarrel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not allow the Spirit to make the Lord real to us that the Lord may be experienced by us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our experience is not "the Spirit makes Thee real to me."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, we make our temper and our disposition real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we sing such a hymn, we should sing it with tears, saying to the Lord, "Lord, all things of the Father are Thine; all Thou art in Spirit is mine; the Spirit makes Thee real to me, that Thou experienced might be.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Forgive me, Lord, I am not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I need Your Spirit to make You real to me that You may become my experience."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to weep while singing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is what we should have, even daily.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christianity is poor; the light we have is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, we rarely apply these riches to our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a result, very little of the riches of Christ are manifested in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is why the burden upon me today is very heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am very happy to have such a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A great number of elders and co-workers in the Lord's recovery around the globe are here.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I like to grasp this opportunity to speak a word of love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Brothers, awake!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have the messages and the hymns, but we are short of the practical living.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Stanza 4 of this hymn says, "The Spirit of life causes Thee/By Thy Word to transfer to me./Thy Spirit touched, Thy word received,/Thy life in me is thus conceived."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In our daily life, do we allow the Spirit to cause the Lord to be realized in us through His living word?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do we, moment by moment, touch the Spirit and receive the Lord's word that we may receive the Lord as our supply?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we compare the poetic words in this hymn with our living, we will find that there is quite a discrepancy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have such a hymn, but we have very little of the reality of what it speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How poor our living is when we compare it with the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Paul said that he announced to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we desire to announce to people the unsearchable riches of Christ, we need to experience Him richly in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The riches of Christ are unsearchable, but how much reality do we have in us?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, this is a warning; this is something we need to beware of.</S>
