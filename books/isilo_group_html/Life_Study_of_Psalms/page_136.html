Psalm 37 reveals the psalmist's sentiment in his logic concerning God's dealing with the righteous and with the wicked based upon the principle of law-keeping. David could not stay away from the principle of keeping the law. Psalm 37 is essentially a lengthened repetition of Psalm 1. We may say that it is the enlarged, lengthened, and expounded Psalm 1. Psalm 38 reveals the psalmist's sentiment in his suffering of God's dealing, and Psalm 39 shows us that the psalmist realized the vanity of his life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIII. IN HIS LOGIC CONCERNING<br>GOD'S DEALING WITH THE RIGHTEOUS<br>AND WITH THE WICKED BASED UPON<br>THE PRINCIPLE OF LAW-KEEPING</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Not Being Incensed because of Evildoers,<br>for They Soon Wither like Grass and<br>Fade Away like Green Herbage</H2><P>In Psalm 37:1-2 David said, "Do not be incensed because of evildoers....For they soon wither like grass/And fade away like green herbage." Verses 7 and 8 say, "Be still before Jehovah, and wait on Him;/Do not be incensed because of him who enjoys prosperity on his way,/Because of the man who performs his evil schemes./Cease from anger and forsake wrath;/Do not be incensed; it only leads to evil."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Trusting in Jehovah, Doing Good, Feeding on<br>His Faithfulness, Delighting Yourself in Jehovah,<br>and Committing Your Way to Jehovah</H2><P>David also said that you should trust in Jehovah, do good, feed on His faithfulness, delight yourself in Jehovah, and commit your way to Jehovah. Then He will give you the requests of your heart and cause your righteousness to go forth like light and your justness like noonday (vv. 3-6).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_135.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_137.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 136</div><br></body></html>
