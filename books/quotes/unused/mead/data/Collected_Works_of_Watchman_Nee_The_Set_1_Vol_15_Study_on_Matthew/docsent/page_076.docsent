   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verses 15-16:"But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that He did and the children who were crying out in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David, they were indignant.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>And they said to Him, Do you hear what these are saying?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And Jesus said to them, Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Have you never read, Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings You have perfected praise'?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The previous praises were heartless praises; the praising ones were only following the crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why only a few little children remained here.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the chief priests and others saw the wonderful things that He did, they were very displeased.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Apparently, they were jealous.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reason they could not praise Him was that they were not little children.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 17:"And leaving them, He went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"To Bethany."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During the last seven days, the Lord always went to Bethany and stayed in the house of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There was no need for the Lord to notify the hostess concerning when He would go there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today the demand on us should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If He cannot find a dwelling place in Jerusalem, He could dwell in Bethany.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Bethany there was a household with life, love, and service.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Bethany denotes a house of grace, love, and singing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 18:"Now in the morning as He returned to the city, He became hungry."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Returned to the city."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord returned from Bethany to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Hungry."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that there was one thing He had not gained and that He was not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The fig tree signifies the Jews just as plum blossoms are the national flower of China .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Grapes, figs, and olives all refer to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 19:"And seeing a fig tree on the way, He came to it and found nothing on it except leaves only.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And He said to it, May there no longer be fruit from you forever!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And the fig tree was instantly dried up."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Gospel of Mark mentions that "it was not the season for figs" Mark 11:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This seems to imply that the Lord should not have cursed the fig tree.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ said that the Jews had two harvests of figs: while the leaves were flourishing, the first-ripe figs were on the tree, after which there would be the harvest of ripe figs.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was why the Lord came to the fig tree to look for figs; otherwise, He would not have come to look for them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The time spoken of in the Gospel of Mark in relation to this event was during the big harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord cursed the fig tree because its leaves were flourishing, and the outward appearance was quite good, yet in reality it was empty and deceiving.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Leaves here refer to man's righteousness; leaves were used to cover the nakedness of Adam Gen 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The fruit refers to that which truly satisfies God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"On the way."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The meaning here is the same as that in chapter thirteen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It signifies being near to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, the tree will still revive and blossom in the future, but it will not be that particular tree.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verses 20-21:"And when the disciples saw this, they marveled, saying, How did the fig tree instantly dry up?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>And Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, it will happen."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All these things are done by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once the Lord speaks, we should believe in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What we believe in are God's promises and His words.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The sea signifies the Gentiles, whereas the mountain signifies the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To remove the mountain into the sea signifies the scattering of the Jews among the Gentiles until they disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The principle here is that sometimes our prayers ought to be directed at the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The mountain, in teaching, signifies obstacles, a kind of fixed difficulty flatness signifies ease .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we have sufficient faith and urgency in our prayers, we should speak directly to the difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In healing the sick and in casting out demons, we not only should ask God, but when we have faith, we should rebuke the sickness and the demons also.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 22:"And all that you ask in prayer, if you believe, you will receive."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the greatest promise.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We only need to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 23:"And when He came into the temple, the chief priests and elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching and said, By what authority do You do these things?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>And who gave You this authority?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The chief priests and the elders saw the wonders of His works, and they presented these two questions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These two questions are actually one question.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If one is answered, the other is answered also.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verses 24-27:"And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The baptism of John, from where did it come, from heaven or from men?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, He will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But if we say, From men, we fear the crowd, for all hold John as a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>And they answered Jesus and said, We do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He too said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"I also will ask."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Believers can learn from the Lord here.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When people ask you unwarranted questions, you can ask them something back.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord did not answer because He had already given them too much light and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Too much light can only blind the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord's question was quite meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>John was the forerunner of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They had once asked John if he was the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>John had testified that he was not.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, if they would first answer the question concerning John, their other question would be solved by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They were most cunning.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They did not believe, yet they were unwilling to speak up.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They said: "We do not know."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This was a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Actually, they could not say that they knew.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If they said it, they would lose their face.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>"Neither do I tell you."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is a question of authority; the Lord did not say that He did not know or that He could not answer.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He is omnipotent and omniscient, and He could never lie.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The principle here is to either ask a question in return or not answer at all.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Verses 28-30:"But what do you think?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A man had two children.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>And he came to his first son and said, Child, go today and work in the vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>And he answered and said, I do not want to; yet later he regretted and went.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>And he came to the other and said likewise.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>And he answered and said, I will, sir; yet he did not go."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This parable points out the positions of the Pharisees, scribes, elders, chief priests, etc. The two children both refer to the Israelites, because according to the flesh, they were the chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In this age only the saved ones are brothers; in John 8 the Jews were considered the sons of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>"The first son" refers to the publicans and the harlots, the sinners who have obeyed and repented.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>"The other" refers to the Pharisees and those like them; they were sons only in name.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>They prayed on the street and decorated their garments with the Scriptures, but they did not keep the important parts of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Here the Lord asked them to draw their own conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In dealing with sinners, we should do the same; we should ask them to draw their own conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Here they could not draw the conclusion.</S>
