   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Service in the Service</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word service in verse 7 denotes the service of the deacons and the deaconesses in the local churches See Rom 16:1; 1 Tim 3:8-13; and Phil 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The deacons and deaconesses are the serving ones in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They must have a serving spirit and a serving attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They have to keep themselves always in service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The practice of the Body life needs this kind of service.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Teaching in Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is the difference between teaching and prophesying?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we have seen, prophesying is speaking for the Lord under His direct inspiration, that is, to speak according to the revelation the Lord has imparted.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Teaching is different from that.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Teaching is the speaking based upon prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some brothers may take what is given in others prophesying and teach people according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The teaching ones have to keep themselves in the exercise of their teaching gift.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Exhorting in Exhortation</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What then is exhortation?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How does it differ from prophecy and teaching?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Prophecy, teaching, and exhortation are all speaking gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, exhortation is based on both prophecy and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps during a special conference or training a brother prophesies under the direct inspiration of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some brothers receive the revelation given in that prophesying, take it back with them to their locality, and teach others according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That is teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then, based upon the direct speaking under God s inspiration and the teaching according to this inspiration, some others may exhort.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That is exhortation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These three kinds of speaking are for the building up of the Body; they minister the life supply to the saints that they may grow together by God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The exhorting ones also have to keep themselves in the exercise of their exhorting gift.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Giving in Simplicity</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The ability to give in simplicity is also a gift of grace in life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This denotes the giving which supplies and takes care of the needy ones in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the church we need such givers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need those who are able to impart material possessions to help the needy ones, to speed the Lord s work, and to care for the church s practical needs.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, we need many saints with such a measure of life that they may have the giving gift and be able to give in simplicity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Leading in Diligence</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He who leads signifies the leading brothers in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whoever desires to be a leading brother must first learn to be diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you are sloppy, you cannot share in the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I would call the attention of all the leading brothers to one thing: that the first quality of leadership is diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A leading brother, that is, an elder, needs to be diligent in everything and in every way all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The elders ability, function, and gift in taking the lead depend upon their diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Showing Mercy in Cheerfulness</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The ability in life to show mercy is also a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To show mercy in cheerfulness is not a matter of natural generosity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some people have a naturally generous character; they were born that way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, to show mercy in cheerfulness is a quality that is formed in us by transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When you grow in the life of Christ and come to love the Lord more, a certain quality will be formed in you, and you will be burdened to take care of others and show mercy to the unworthy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is not a characteristic of your natural birth, but a quality developed in you by your growth in life through the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, to show mercy is also one of the gifts in life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To show mercy means to help with sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever you truly help one by sympathizing with him, it means that you are showing mercy to him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Suppose a brother has a problem or a difficulty and you sympathize with him and render some help.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That is an act of showing mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you put together all seven gifts mentioned in Romans 12, you will discover that they are the gifts that are necessary for the practicing of the Body life for the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the local church we firstly need the speaking for God under His direct inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Based upon this inspired speaking we may have teaching, and based upon both prophesying and teaching we may have exhortation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Along with this we have the leadership of the elders and the service of the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In addition, we have those that are able to give material things to the church, care for the needy, and further the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Finally, there are those who show mercy to others.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In an age filled with difficulties and troubles, they can sympathize with others and show mercy to them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>These seven gifts are adequate for practicing the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Paul was marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He was an expert in the church life, presenting all these matters in a very simple but inclusive way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How we should worship the Lord for such an apostle!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We all need to be impressed with the fact that in Romans 12 the gifts of speaking in tongues, interpretation, healing, and miracles are not mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Such gifts are miraculous gifts, but in Romans 12 we find the gifts of grace in life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>An example of a miraculous gift is the speaking in a human language by Balaam s donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Although the donkey did not possess a human life, it spoke a human language.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Undoubtedly, that was a miraculous gift.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The gifts listed in Romans 12 are not miraculous gifts; they are the gifts of grace in life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As you enjoy God as life and grow in life, you find that, corresponding to your growth in life, you have a certain skill or ability.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is what we call a gift of grace in life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The donkey did not need to have growth in life in order to speak a human language.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It did not matter whether the donkey was small or big, young or old.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The gift was miraculous: it did not depend upon the donkey s growth.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, to be an elder in the church does not depend upon a miraculous gift.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Do not think that after being saved a short while you can pray for several hours, receive the so-called baptism, and suddenly become an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If a person could become an elder in this way, it would mean that eldership is a miraculous gift.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But to be an elder you do not need miraculous gifts; you need the gift of grace by growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You need to grow day by day and year by year.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If you do not exhibit the growth in life, you cannot be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>You cannot be an elder if you lack the adequate measure of life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I hope that everyone who reads this message is now able to differentiate between these two categories of gifts the miraculous gifts and the gifts of grace in life.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Many of the gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12 are miraculous gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>However, even there some of the gifts are not miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>For example, neither the word of wisdom nor the word of knowledge is miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>As we have seen, in Romans 12 none of the gifts are miraculous; all of the gifts found there are the gifts of grace in life which require the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Your growth in life gives you a certain measure of life, and out of that measure of life your skill or gift will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This will qualify you for a particular ministry or service in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The gifts of grace in life are necessary for the practice of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If you neglect the gifts of grace in life and concentrate on the miraculous gifts, the church will be divided in a very short time.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Be assured that we could never be one by stressing miraculous gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The miraculous gifts tend to divide, while the gifts of grace in life build up.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Paul was very experienced in the Body life and he knew that the gifts of grace in life are necessary for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Therefore, in Romans 12 he did not list the miraculous gifts among the items necessary for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>No one can deny the wisdom of the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Although he mentioned speaking tongues in 1 Corinthians, he did not include it in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>There certainly must have been a reason for this.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Paul, an expert in the church life, knew from his writing of 1 Corinthians that the miraculous gifts had been the cause of divisions there in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Even in 1 Corinthians we can see the fact that speaking in tongues and the other miraculous gifts had a divisive effect on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Therefore, Paul did not include these gifts in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Paul was both wise and careful, recognizing the fact that the miraculous gifts were helpful to individual Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In 1 Corinthians Paul said that speaking in tongues builds up the individual who exercises it, but that it does not build up the church 1 Cor 14:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>He told the Corinthians to care for the building up of the church 1 Cor 14:12, 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>In the book of Romans his concern was not the building up of a particular individual, but the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Thus, he did not include the miraculous gifts in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>I know that this word may not be pleasant to those who have had a background of tongues-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Nevertheless, I ask you to be patient and to consider what is best for the church life in the long run.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If you mean business to practice the church life, you should not appraise the miraculous gifts so highly, but rather pay your complete attention to the gifts of grace in life that will build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The book of Romans was written soon after 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Both of these books were written while Paul was on his third journey of ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>While Paul was staying at Ephesus on his third journey of ministry, information came to him about the confusion and division that were rampant in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Thus, from Ephesus he wrote his first letter to the Corinthians adjusting them for the abuse of the miraculous gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>After writing that letter he visited Corinth personally.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>While he was staying in Corinth he wrote the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>These are facts of history.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>First Corinthians was written either in A.D. 56, 57 or 59, and Romans was written approximately a year afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>In 1 Corinthians Paul adjusted the abuse of tongues-speaking and of the other miraculous gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Soon afterward, when he wrote the book of Romans, he said nothing about the miraculous gifts, probably because he was keenly aware of the confusion they had wrought in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Remember that he wrote the book of Romans from Corinth, the scene of confusion and abuse regarding miraculous gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>We should not neglect history, for it has many lessons to teach us.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>It is quite significant that the book of Romans was written from Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>At that time Corinth was the hot bed of miraculous gifts, yet Paul did not say a word about miraculous gifts in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>This is very significant and it deserves our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>I want to speak a little more about the gifts that proceed out of the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Before Paul talked about the gifts in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14, he spoke strongly about the growth in life in chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Paul said to the Corinthians, Ye are God s farm, ye are God s building 1 Cor 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>As we have pointed out many times in the past, the farm grows the materials for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>All the materials that are necessary for the building of God s house are the product of the growth on the farm.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Then Paul said that as a wise masterbuilder he laid the foundation and that we all need to be careful how we build thereupon 1 Cor 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>We should build with gold, silver, and precious stones and not with wood, hay, and stubble v. 12 . If you put together all these verses from 1 Corinthians 3, you will see that Paul was telling the Corinthians the proper way to build up the church in their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>The proper way of building the church is not by miraculous gifts, but by the genuine growth in life which will transform the saints into precious materials for God s temple.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Furthermore, Paul said that he fed and planted them and that Apollos watered them 1 Cor 3:2-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>The feeding, planting, and watering are all for the growth, the growth which will cultivate the talents and gifts that are useful in building up the house of God with the proper transformed materials.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Consider a newborn child.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>At the time of birth the child has every necessary organ.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>However, few of the organs can function at the time of birth because the child lacks the necessary measure of growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>The more the mother feeds her child, the more the child grows.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>After a certain length of time, the child will be able to walk and after another period of time, he will be able to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Eventually, he will be fully grown, and all of his talents will have been completely cultivated for practical use.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>When he has matured, he will have the required skills, and these skills are the gifts that come out of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>This is what Paul meant by gifts in Romans 12.</S>
