   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. From the Herd, Male or Female 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Male</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Leviticus 3:1 says, "If his offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings if he offers it from the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The male signifies the stronger offerer who enjoys Christ as a male of the herd.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not Christ who differs in being either strong or weak; it is we who are either strong or weak.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are strong, we enjoy a stronger Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are weak, we enjoy a weaker Christ, not a Christ who is weak in Himself but who is weaker in our experience due to our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we are weak or disappointed, we may have a weaker enjoyment of the strong Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because we are weak, He is weak in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Female</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The female signifies the weaker offerer who enjoys Christ as a female of the herd.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, all animals from the herd are strong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ Himself is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether we enjoy a strong Christ or a weak Christ depends on our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If our condition is strong, we will enjoy a strong Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If our condition is weak, we will enjoy a weak Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>C. From the Flock, a Sheep or a Goat 1.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sheep</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Leviticus 3:6 and 7 say, "If his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings to Jehovah is from the flock, male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If he is offering a sheep for his offering, then he shall offer it before Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A sheep signifies that some enjoy Christ in His perfection and beauty as a sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I believe that we all have had this kind of experience, enjoying Christ in His perfection and beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Goat</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 12 says, "If his offering is a goat, then he shall offer it before Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here a goat signifies that some enjoy Christ as a goat, not much in His perfection and beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to Matthew 25, the sheep are good and the goats are not good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How, then, can we experience Christ sometimes as a sheep and sometimes as a goat?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If our condition is pitiful, we will not enjoy Christ as a sheep in His perfection and beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, we will enjoy Him as a goat without perfection and beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose a brother tries to enjoy Christ after quarreling with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At such a time his enjoyment of Christ will be poor; he will enjoy Christ not as a sheep but as a goat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This indicates that in our feeling Christ differs according to our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Of course, it is not Christ Himself who differs.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is we who differ in our feeling according to our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>WITHOUT BLEMISH</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The peace offering was to be without blemish 3:1, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This signifies being without sins and transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As our peace offering, Christ is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is without blemish.</S>
