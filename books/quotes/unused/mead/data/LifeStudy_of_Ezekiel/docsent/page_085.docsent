   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE TWENTY THE OUTER AND INNER COURTS Scripture Reading: Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>40:17-47; 46:21-22</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing message, we covered many of the details related to the gates.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are divided into four sections: the first threshold, a passage, a further threshold, and the porch.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Each gate is six cubits high and ten cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Six is the number of the Lord s humanity, by which He fulfilled all the requirements of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that the number six fulfills the number ten; that is, the man Jesus fulfills the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we have pointed out, the dimensions of the guardrooms match the dimensions of the cross section of the wall six cubits by six cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that to us the guardrooms are Christ Himself as God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The passage, having the number eight, indicates a new beginning in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The porch, the final section of the gate, has the numbers two, six, and eight, indicating that the Lord as a man is fully in resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the numbers used in Ezekiel with respect to the building of God are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The numbers three, five, and multiples of five are used frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For instance, extensive use is made of the number thirty, which signifies the Triune God in resurrection bearing the full responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Ezekiel saw the visions in chapter one, he was thirty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are thirty supporting posts, thirty chambers in the outer court, and thirty side chambers surrounding the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Ezekiel the number thirty indicates both maturity which is able to bear something and also the enjoyment and expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The palm trees on the posts signify victory and everlasting power.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because the columns must bear the weight of the roof and support the entire building, they need to be in victory and to be everlasting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is the column which supports and bears God s building with a victorious, everlasting life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have also seen that the gate has thirty windows to let in light and air.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These windows are covered with a lattice, or screen, to keep the negative things out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All this is precisely the work of the life-giving Spirit: He brings in the light and the air, but He continually screens out the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this message we will go on to see that with the temple in Ezekiel there are two courts: the outer court and the inner court.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let us first consider what is in the outer court and then the inner court.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE OUTER COURT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we would enter into the temple which Ezekiel saw in his vision, we must first climb up the seven steps and then pass through the spacious gate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This would bring us into the outer court of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Pavement</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first thing we need to pay attention to in the outer court is the pavement.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is pavement around the wall on the three sides of the outer court, on the east, the south, and the north.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Chambers</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are six different sections, or areas, of pavement, and on each section there are five chambers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that there are thirty chambers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here the number thirty is composed of five times six.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In addition to the thirty chambers on the pavement, there are four small courts, one at each corner of the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These four courts at the four corners are places for boiling the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In modern terms, these are kitchens, places for cooking food.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These cooking places are used not by the priests but by the people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whereas the priests eat in the inner court, the people eat in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Outside of these kitchens, these cooking places, are some chambers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These chambers are for eating, just as in our homes the room connected to the kitchen is the dining room, a place for eating the food prepared in the kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Ezekiel, the chambers connected to the kitchens are dining places for the people to enjoy the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This indicates that these chambers are places to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From this we can see that the main thing in the outer court is the enjoyment of Christ as the offerings and sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After we pass through the gate, we come to the outer court and enter into the chambers to eat, to enjoy, Christ, who is the reality of all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Ezekiel tells us that these chambers for eating are built upon the pavement 40:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In ancient times the pavement of a court was made with stones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This indicates that whenever we are about to enjoy Christ, we need to be on a pavement made of stones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The stone pavement separates us from the dirt of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Otherwise, our feet would be on the dirt.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As believers in Christ, we have the pavement of the stones to separate us from the dirt.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although we are still on the earth and in the world, we are separated from any kind of dirt.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Originally, as the old creation, we were clay, being the same in nature as the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We came out of the earth, and we were one with the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But when we were saved, converted, and regenerated, we became stones, which are for the pavement.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now if we intend to enjoy Christ, we need to stand upon the stones of our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, in their daily situation, many genuine Christians do not stand upon these stones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After work, they may engage in certain worldly activities and entertainments.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They are genuine Christians, but they are standing on dirt; they do not have a pavement of stones under their feet.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As those in the church life in the Lord s recovery, our situation should be very different.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we come home after a day at work or at school, we may take a rest or have dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then, exercising our spirit to call on the Lord, we gather together in a meeting to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This indicates that we are standing on a pavement of stones.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Furthermore, in our experience the pavement on which we are standing becomes a place, a chamber, for us to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many of us can testify that day by day we are in the chambers enjoying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is especially true of the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>By contacting the Lord early in the morning, we put our feet on the stones and prepare ourselves to come into the chambers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then in the meetings of the church we enjoy Christ by eating Him.</S>
