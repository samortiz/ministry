   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>While staying in Shanghai as an unmarried person, his mother came to stay with him for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Rumors circulated that a woman was living with him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Miss Groves, a sister who had previously been a help to him, heard the rumor and came to ask, "Is it true that you have a woman living with you?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He answered, "Yes."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then she rebuked him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Years later when he related this incident to me, I asked, "Why didn't you tell her that that woman was your mother?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He replied, "Miss Groves didn't ask who that woman was."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He simply did not like to explain things to people in order to vindicate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Following his marriage, his wife's aunt threatened to take some steps to damage his reputation if he would not come to pay her the courtesy of a visit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This actually stopped him from paying her a visit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If she had not threatened him in such a way, he would have done it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Under such threatening, however, he would not meet her demand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He refused to do anything to reduce the attack of others upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He believed that everything was from God's hand and was willing to bear any kind of opposition or attack as a cross, in order to live a crucified life with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1942 in the church in Shanghai, there was a big disturbance concerning him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He did not say a word to vindicate himself; neither did he take any steps to appease the situation or reduce his suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Again, he was learning the lesson of the cross, living the crucified life by the Christ who was living in him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because of that disturbance he was frustrated from continuing his ministry for six years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During that six-year period of suffering, he did nothing to attempt to recover his ministry, nor did he attempt to start any other kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He remained fully silent, under God's sovereign hand, learning the lessons of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He kept himself fully in the confinement of Christ's death and experienced Christ as his life during that long trial.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Following that long dark night of six years, when the day dawned and the Lord came to recover his ministry in 1948 through a revival in Shanghai, he asked us to sing the following hymn on the life of the grapevine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This hymn portrays how the grapevine is continually under certain kinds of hardship and dealing, yet it still continues to bear fruit and to cheer others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Three stanzas of the hymn say:</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yet its wine throughout the winter</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Warmth and sweetness ever bears</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Unto those in coldness shiv'ring,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Pressed with sorrow, pain, and cares.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yet without, alone, the grapevine</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Midst the ice and snow doth stand,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Steadfastly its lot enduring,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Though 'tis hard to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Winter o'er, the vine prepareth</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Fruit again itself to bear;</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Budding forth and growing branches,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Beauteous green again to wear;</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Never murmuring or complaining</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For the winter's sore abuse,</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Or for all its loss desiring</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Its fresh off'ring to reduce.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Breathing air, untainted, heavenly,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As it lifts its arms on high,</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Earth's impure, defiled affections</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ne'er the vine may occupy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Facing sacrifice, yet smiling,</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And while love doth prune once more,</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Strokes it bears as if it never</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suffered loss and pain before.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>#635, Hymns</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This hymn indicates that Watchman Nee was continually under hardships and dealings in order to produce spiritual fruit for cheering others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After that long winter, he prepared himself to bear fruit, not murmuring or complaining about anyone's abuse nor desiring to reduce his fresh contribution.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yet he was still willing to face any sacrifice by being pruned once more, as if he had never suffered any strokes before.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He told those of us who were his close co-workers that when criticized in our behavior and character, we should not vindicate ourselves, although we must without hesitation contend for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Shanghai in 1948 there was a brother in the church who opposed Watchman Nee, because this brother's longstanding ambition for position in the church was not fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This brother gave financial assistance to a traveling preacher who wrote a long article criticizing and accusing Watchman Nee on a number of counts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The article was widely circulated, but Watchman did nothing to vindicate himself concerning this article.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In 1950 we were both in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One evening after the meeting, two young men standing at the front gate of the meeting hall were distributing flyers criticizing him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These two young men were standing directly in front of us, yet he did not react.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He only smiled a little at them and walked away.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>During my long association with him, I never once saw him quarrel, dispute, or fight with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>One always received the impression that he was following in the footsteps of the Lamb and living under the putting to death of Jesus in order that the life of Jesus might be manifested in him 2 Cor 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
