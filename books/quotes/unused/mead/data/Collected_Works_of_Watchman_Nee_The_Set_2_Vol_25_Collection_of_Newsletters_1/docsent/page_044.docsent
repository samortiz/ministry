   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>6 June 1, 1934 NEWS FROM HAINAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a letter Mr. Yun Feng Chan sent to three brothers in Singapore.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To my most beloved brothers in the Lord, Wang K'ai Sen, Yang Jen Chu, and Chang Chia Chi:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have already read your letter which arrived yesterday, and I was informed that Brother Wang Yung Shih has been baptized into the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thank the Lord because He has added another member to be His people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A few months ago Brother Shih K'o Jen planned to take a trip to Southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since he has not yet received an answer from the Lord about this matter, he is afraid to go according to his own will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The meeting in our locality used to be in Brother K'o Jen's house.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because it was an inconvenient location, the brothers prayed specifically to the Lord to prepare a place where His children could meet together to worship the Father and to break the bread and drink the cup in remembrance of the Lord Jesus who loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thank the Lord, He had already prepared the T'ien Mei Chapel for us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We prayed according to His will, and He gave us what we asked for.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we moved our meeting into the T'ien Mei Chapel on December 17 of last year.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Unfortunately, many milk-taking believers and worldly members of the Chapel do not understand that our meeting is in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They have risen up as a group to taunt us that we are the Baptist denomination and are established by man's will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our meeting is not a denomination according to man's will, nor is it established by man according to man's methods.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It has been more than a year since I received the Holy Spirit's leading to leave the denominations and to meet in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It really is the Lord's grace to be called out to be separated from the denominations and to meet in the Lord's name Matt 18:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man does not appoint us; our Head, the Lord Jesus, appoints us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We follow the Father's will and meet in accordance with the command of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We listen to the Lord's commandment and not man's commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At any rate, we only rely on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We only follow the Lord's commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We only meet in the Lord's name, so we do what God's unique universal church should do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Any Christian who can take solid food must take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord's Day is the day to worship God, break the bread, and drink the cup in remembrance of the Lord 1 Cor 11:23-31; Heb 5:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Please pray for us often in the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May the grace and peace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all until eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>NORTHERN KIANGSU</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To the brothers and sisters in the Lord:</S>
