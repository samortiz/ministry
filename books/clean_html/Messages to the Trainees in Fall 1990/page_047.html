<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. One God and Father, Overshadowing Us,<br>Taking Care of Us, and Being with Us</H2><P>The seventh factor of our Christian faith is the one God and Father, who is overshadowing us, taking care of us, and is always with us. With the Body of Christ, the Father is the source, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence. The one God and Father is over all to overshadow us. He is also through all to take care of us. Finally, He is in us all to be with us. The Father is our source. As those who are in Him, we are under His overshadowing, under His care, and under His presence to enjoy the Son as our element with the Spirit as our essence. When we have the Father, we have the Son and the Spirit. These Three are one. The essence is one with the element, and the element is one with the source.</P><P>Now we can see that our Christian faith is not of minor doctrines such as foot-washing or head covering. Our Christian faith is of seven factors: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father. These seven factors of our Christian faith are the first base of the oneness of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Oneness of the Spirit</H2><P>The second base of the oneness of the church is the oneness of the Spirit (Eph. 4:3b). "The oneness of the Spirit" simply means that the oneness is the Spirit. The Spirit Himself, who is the essence of the Body, is the oneness. Therefore, we Christians should not be divided. How can we divide the indwelling Spirit? This is impossible. How can we divide the inner essence of the church? This is impossible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Oneness of the Divine Trinity</H2><P>The third base of the oneness of the church is the oneness of the divine Trinity. In John 17:21 the Lord said, "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us." The oneness the Lord is speaking of here is the oneness among the divine Trinity. The Lord prayed that we would be one just as the Triune God is one.</P><P>The Three of the Triune God are one. The Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Father, and both the Father and the Son are in the Spirit. Now we are in the Triune God, in the divine "Us." Eventually, we all are in this One. We are in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. This does not make us God, but we must declare the fact that we are one with our God. Eventually, we must have the boldness and the full assurance to say that we are one with God because we are in God and God is in us.</P><P>In John 17:22 the Lord prayed, "And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one." We Christians, we believers, should be one just as the three persons of the Godhead are one. The glory which was given to the Son by the Father was given by the Son to us so that we might be one in this glory to express God. God wants all of His believers to be one in the divine glory. The oneness of the divine Trinity is the base of our oneness today.</P>
