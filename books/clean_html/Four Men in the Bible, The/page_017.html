<h2 class="head1">RETURNING TO THE PROPER SCRIPTURAL WAY&mdash;<br />
CALLING ON THE LORD<br />
AND ENJOYING THE LORD IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We should return to the pure word of the Scriptures. In God&rsquo;s redemption, the Lord Jesus is God becoming man. He was crucified for our sins and accomplished redemption. Then He resurrected from the dead and became the life-giving Spirit. On the day of Pentecost, He poured out the Holy Spirit upon the Jewish believers and later upon the Gentile believers in the house of Cornelius. In this way He baptized the whole church in the Holy Spirit. This fact was accomplished before we were born. We must remember that there is no factor of time in God&rsquo;s redemption. For example, the Lord&rsquo;s death for us on the cross took place before we were born. And our crucifixion with the Lord Jesus Christ took place before we were born. In the same principle, on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius, the Lord Jesus baptized His whole Body, both Jews and Gentiles, in the Holy Spirit. This was accomplished before we were born.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; This verse says that all who have believed, whether Jews or Greeks, have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body. We were baptized in the Spirit before we were born. Our baptism in the Spirit has been accomplished. The Lord Jesus has died for us, and we have been crucified with Him. When we believed into Him, our sins were forgiven, and when we called on Him, His Spirit entered into us, regenerating us and making us members of His Body. When we believe and call upon His name, He enters into us. If we daily call on Him, we will enjoy Him daily.</p>
<p>We should not pay attention to doctrines, teachings, or rituals but to our living Lord, who is the life-giving Spirit. He died for us, and now He lives in us. We need only to open to Him by exercising our spirit and by using our mouth to breathe Him in as our life, power, light, and holiness. Doctrines are useless, teachings are useless, rituals and ordinances are useless, and speaking in tongues and predictions are even more useless. There is only one way that is true, spiritual, and of life: We need to believe into the Lord Jesus, who was God incarnated as a man, who died for us on the cross, who was resurrected from the dead, and who became the life-giving Spirit. When we believe into Him, our sins fall away. Moreover, we need to exercise our spirit to call on His name. The more we call on Him, the more He will fill us from within to occupy and saturate our inner being and to transform us. When we call on Him and enjoy Him, letting Him fill and occupy us every day, He will become our life, power, light, and holiness.</p>
<p>The way is so simple and practical. Therefore, the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit&rdquo; (Gal. 5:25). Our every action must be by the Spirit and according to the Spirit, and our mind must be set on the spirit. The mind set on the spirit is life and peace (Rom. 8:6). However, we have been distracted by many doctrines, rituals, ordinances, and the like, as well as disturbed by the so-called Pentecostal movement and speaking in tongues. Now we are clear that the simple way to open ourselves and to exercise our spirit is to contact the Lord by calling on His name and by pray-reading His Word. At the same time, we need to follow the leading of His Spirit and confess our sins so that our inner being can be completely occupied, saturated, and transformed by Him. Then we can enjoy Him again and again to be filled with His riches.</p>
<p>Our daily life must be in spirit, and our church life must also be in spirit. We are being built up together into one Body in spirit. Likewise, being an overcomer and being prepared as the bride are matters of the spirit. We should have a daily life in spirit. May the Lord have mercy on us so that our eyes may be opened to live in the spirit and be filled with the Lord&rsquo;s all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
