   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TESTIMONY OF THE CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The above examples are merely objective proofs of the existence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us consider the question of God's existence from another angle: the psychological makeup of man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is a large organization in America called the National Geographic Society.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It investigates cultures and geographies of different parts of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It has one conclusion concerning its members' many investigations every race on earth, no matter how cultured or wild, advanced or backward, has one thing in common a belief in God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everywhere one goes, even among the uncivilized Miao natives, men believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A man may be unintelligent and not able to think logically; he may not be able to give many reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if he searches his heart, he knows that there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many people are only stubborn in their speaking; in their conscience they know that there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1925, there was a preacher who passed through a jungle in South America.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Suddenly he heard a cry for help, and he ran towards the sound.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When he approached a river, he saw a man on a canoe going downstream.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The current of the river was strong, and not far from him was a waterfall.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If no one came to his rescue, the man would die by falling over the waterfall.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time, the man cried with all his strength: "O God, O God, save me, save me!"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the preacher saw this, he tried his best and saved the man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The next day, the preacher passed through the same jungle again and saw a few hundred people gathered around someone who was speaking, and he drew near to hear what he was saying.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The man talked about God, and he gave many reasons why there was no God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the man finished, he challenged the audience: "I have given many reasons for the nonexistence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If anyone is not happy with these reasons, he can bring up his arguments now."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The preacher went up to the platform and said, "I do not know how to argue, and I cannot give many reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But I can tell you a story.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yesterday as I was walking through the jungle, I heard someone crying, 'O God, O God, save me, save me!'</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I ran towards the sound by the river and saw a man sitting in a canoe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The water was rapid, and the boat was moving close to a waterfall.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His life was in danger, and I saved him and took him home.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I would like to introduce this man to you now.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The one who was crying to God for help yesterday is the gentleman here today who is giving you many reasons why there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You can ask him yourself if I am right or not."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Indeed, many people have their conscience covered up.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before their conscience is awakened, they can give many reasons for saying that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But when they are at the end of themselves, when they are about to die, and when they think of their future, their conscience tells them that there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They can brush the matter aside now.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They can say that they are young and that such things do not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the day will come when they will step into eternity, and their sleeping conscience will speak out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have often said that the conscience can sleep, but it will never die.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the time comes, it will speak out.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, it may be too late to know God by then.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There were a father and son in England who were both strong and zealous atheists.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One day the father was about to die, and he was tossing about in his bed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He seemed to be very restless.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the son saw this, he was afraid that the old man would be shaken in his conviction, and he encouraged him, saying, "Father, hold tight."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His father turned to him in tears and asked, "Hold tight to what?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since they did not have God, what was there for them to hold tight to?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But we have to thank the Lord because there is something that we can hold onto.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is something which we can lean back on.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We know whom we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Friends, please listen to the inner voice.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our mind will often give us wrong ideas; it is affected by outside influences.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the inner voice is trustworthy; it represents our true self.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Please listen to the inner urge.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I have searched into the matter and concluded that no one is born an atheist; everyone becomes one through the influence of environment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is why our conscience is the most valuable guide, and we should follow its leading all the time.</S>
