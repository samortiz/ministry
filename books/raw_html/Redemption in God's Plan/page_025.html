        <h2 class="head1">THE CONDITION AFTER CHRIST&rsquo;S RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus died as a man with a human body, because He put on humanity. When He was resurrected, He still was clothed with humanity and a human body. When the disciples saw Him after His resurrection, they thought that they had seen a spirit, a ghost (Luke 24:37), but He showed them that He still possessed a body with flesh and bones (v. 39), the body that had been crucified on the cross. Although His body had been transfigured into a body of glory by His life through resurrection (Phil. 3:21), the marks from the nails on His hands and feet and from the wound in His side were still present on His body for the disciples to see and touch (John 20:25-27). His body of flesh and bones could also partake of food (Luke 24:39-43). A human body was nailed to the cross, and the Lord Jesus still had a human body after resurrection. In His resurrection He did not put off His human nature. The Lord Jesus put off the aspect of the old creation in His human nature, which had been put on in His incarnation, and He put on the aspect of the new creation in His resurrected human nature. Thus, He brought His redeemed humanity into the new creation of God (2 Cor. 5:14-17).</p>
<p>Just as the Lord became flesh in order to bring God into the humiliation of humanity in the old creation, He died and resurrected to bring redeemed humanity into the glory of God&rsquo;s new creation. Just as He became flesh to bring God to earth so that God could be joined to man to bear the likeness of man, He died and resurrected to bring man to the heavenlies so that man could be joined to God to bear the image of God. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was both God and man; He was man yet God. Now that He is in heaven, He is still both God and man; He is God yet man. After His resurrection He still possesses humanity. Today Christ in heaven has divinity and humanity, just as He did on the earth. His humanity in incarnation was part of the old creation, but now His humanity in resurrection is part of the new creation. He had a body of humiliation, but now He has a glorified body. His divinity was mingled with humanity in incarnation; now His humanity has entered into divinity in resurrection.</p>
<p>Although Christ&rsquo;s resurrected body has a physical form, it is no longer limited by time and space like it was before His resurrection. His body now is in resurrection and in glory. With such a body He can come and go freely at any time and in any place, appearing one moment and disappearing the next. On the day of His resurrection the disciples were in a house with all the doors closed, but He still appeared and stood in their midst (John 20:19). On the road to Emmaus He walked with two disciples, but they did not recognize Him (Luke 24:13-16). They recognized Him only after He entered into a house with them, reclined at table, and broke the bread; then He suddenly disappeared from them (vv. 29-31). These incidents show that Christ has a physical human body after His resurrection that is no longer subject to the limitations of a human body in the old creation. His body has changed in nature and has been transfigured; it has been freed from the slavery and bondage of the old creation into the freedom of the glory of the new creation. We cannot apprehend this freedom in our old-creation body, but He will bring us into the freedom of this glory when He comes again and redeems our body (Rom. 8:21-23).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF CHRIST&rsquo;S RESURRECTION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Raising Us Up Together with Christ</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s redemption was accomplished through His death, but the issue of His redemption was brought forth in His resurrection. Furthermore, His resurrection enables us to participate in His redemption. We appropriate and enjoy His redemption in His resurrection. First, His resurrection raised us up together with Him. We were included not only in His death but also in His resurrection (6:8). Just as the people and the living creatures in the ark passed through the waters of the flood (Gen. 7:1-16; 8:13-19), we also passed through death together with Christ and were raised together with Christ. In God&rsquo;s eyes we died together with Christ in His death, and we were raised together with Him in His resurrection (Gal. 2:20; Eph. 2:6). We died with Him, and we were raised with Him. By dying with Him, we were delivered from everything that is not of God; by being resurrected with Him, we entered into everything of God. Through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection we entered into God to enjoy everything of God. Everything of God is our portion in His resurrection.</p>
<p>Because we were resurrected with Christ, we also ascended together with Him. Ephesians 2:6 speaks of our being raised up together with Him and being seated together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus. Ascension is related to resurrection. We were earthly people; however, through the resurrection of Christ we not only entered into everything in God but also entered into the heavenly realm to become heavenly people. His death delivered us from a natural, earthly position; His resurrection ushered us into a new, spiritual, heavenly realm. We have attained a heavenly position and enjoy every spiritual blessing in this position. Every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies has became our portion in His resurrection.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
