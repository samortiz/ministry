In that plan God purposed to express Himself through His Son Jesus Christ and to have Jesus Christ expressed through a group of people
Although it had been planned in eternity past by God and was accomplished by Christ, yet it must be realized in us by the Holy Spirit
In his spirit, God is mingled; in his heart, God is dwelling; in his soul mind, emotion, and will God is occupying
Think how wonderful it is that human beings such as we could have God as life, dwelling within and occupying our whole being!
In the Gospel of John we are told that the Lord is the Word of God, that this Word is God Himself , and that one day He became a man
In these two centuries, there have been many Christian teachings, but something has been lacking the mingling of God with man
Oh, may we realize that in Christ God desires to be our life and our everything, even as He was everything to Christ
Even if we are just as spiritual as the Lord Jesus at thirty years of age, we must once more hand ourselves over to be buried
It was after the Lord was baptized that the Holy Spirit descended upon Him and He received the baptism of the Holy Spirit
From this example we see that there are three steps in the working of the Holy Spirit: begetting, filling, and clothing or baptizing
Inwardly, we must have the life of God in us through the Spirit of life and we must be filled with this Spirit of life
Outwardly, we need to be baptized in Him and clothed upon with Him so that we will be equipped with power for the work of God
If we would have a life mingled with God Himself and be in the way of fulfilling His purpose, we must be in the Spirit
Let us seek the real experiences of the working of the Holy Spirit, the inward filling and the outward clothing
Brothers and sisters, not only were we judged two thousand years ago on the cross in Christ, but we were likewise redeemed then by Christ
All creation subsists in Christ ; He is the Head, He is the center, He is the representative of the whole creation
Christ's death on the cross, therefore, means that the whole creation as represented in Christ was brought to an end
We have seen the reasons for Christ's death; now let us go on to another point regarding His crucifixion the all-inclusiveness of His death
If you come to believers and ask them who died on the cross, they will tell you it was their Savior, their Redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ
The problems of Satan, sin, sickness, death, the world, and the fallen human nature all problems were solved at the cross
In the universe is Satan with all his hosts: the principalities, powers, dominions, authorities, and evil hosts in the air
After God created Adam, He committed all things into his hands, making him the head and representative of all creation
The Lord said in John 3:14, 'As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up'
When the Lord Christ became a man, He put on 'the likeness of the flesh of sin' , in which is the likeness of the serpent
All things related to Satan evil forces, evil powers , the world , sin, sickness, death, and sinful people have been dealt with on the cross
When we have that living contact with the living Lord in the Spirit, there is the 'killing' of His death within us
Even as all things were created through Christ and brought to death in Christ, so now all things are resurrected in Christ
They were created, but as they have never experienced the death of Christ, they likewise have no share in His resurrection
Perhaps you ask, Why did God put all things to death in Christ and then later bring all things to resurrection in Him?
If we search the Scriptures, we must conclude that at the time of creation man did not receive the life of God
The grain is the man, Jesus; the life in this grain is the divine life of God Himself; the many grains are all those who are regenerated
Formerly we had nothing of God mingled with us but now through the death and resurrection of Christ God Himself is mingled with us in life
We are dead to everything of Adam and raised up to everything of Christ, because we are joined to God in Christ through the Holy Spirit
Luke and Mark tell us clearly that certain days after the resurrection, the Lord ascended to the heavens, but not so the Gospel of John
Surely this means that in the interval the Lord had gone to His Father in heaven, but that He did not stay there
After the Lord came to the disciples in the evening of that resurrection day, there is not a word that He left them again
Have we not often had the experience of something deep within contradicting us contradicting our mind, our emotion, or our will?
We must not know Him in knowledge, teaching, doctrine, the mind, the emotions, the desires, or the will, but in the Spirit
Today there is only one law, one rule, one regulation: Christ Himself, the all-inclusive Christ as our life in resurrection
By the resurrection the creation was brought to a new standing, and we were regenerated to be members of the Body of Christ
In the evening of the day of resurrection, Christ came and breathed on the disciples, saying, 'Receive ye the Holy Spirit'
They waited for the power from on high , the baptism in the Holy Spirit through which they would be formed into a living Body
Both of these matters the baptism and the drinking are related to us, but we cannot say that they are one and the same
We must drink of the Holy Spirit in order to be filled with Him, and be baptized in the Holy Spirit in order to be clothed by Him
As a Christian we need both the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of life inwardly, and the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of power outwardly
If, when we come together as believers meeting before the Lord, there is a lack of function in our midst, it is due to these two matters
Now what we need is not to be baptized in the Holy Spirit again but simply to experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit already accomplished
In the five cases of Acts, only two are called the baptism in the Holy Spirit; the other three cases include the laying on of hands
The Body was baptized in the Holy Spirit already and that this baptism was transmitted by a representative of the Body to new members
The Holy Spirit of God, like the oil from the head, flowed down to the new member, and he in turn was clothed with the Holy Spirit
The incarnation, the crucifixion, the resurrection, and the ascension all these have already been accomplished
If we are going to preach the gospel we should tell people about these four items His incarnation crucifixion resurrection and ascension
Inwardly they will be filled with the Spirit of life, and outwardly they will be clothed with the Spirit of power
We will be saturated and mingled with Him, and we will be living and functioning members of the Body of Christ
