   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE NINETEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS THE MYSTERY OF GOD Scripture Reading: Col 2:2-9</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to the matter of the experience of Christ as the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We shall consider a number of points which help us experience Christ in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. TO HAVE THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF HIM</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>AS THE MYSTERY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we would experience Christ as the mystery of God, we need to have the full knowledge of Him as God s mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have pointed out that Paul struggled for the Colossians that their hearts would be comforted unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to have the full knowledge of such a mystery, our whole being needs to be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we simply believe in Christ without loving Him, we cannot have this knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Likewise, if we love Him partially but not wholly, we cannot have the full knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to love the Lord Jesus with our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this reason, Mark 12:30, quoting Deuteronomy 6:5, says, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When our entire being is exercised to love the Lord Jesus, we shall gain the full knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some Christians are fond of the hymn, Oh, how I love Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, this hymn may be sung in a superficial way; it is not according to the full knowledge of Christ as the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only by exercising our entire being can we know Christ in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I recommend that all the saints in the Lord s recovery study three crucial books in the New Testament: Matthew, John, and Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A number of helpful Life-study Messages have been given on these books.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The studies on John and Hebrews are especially thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you spend adequate time on these three books, you will gain a considerable amount of knowledge concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>TO RECEIVE HIM</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 2:6 Paul says that the Colossians have received Christ Jesus the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is the portion of the saints 1:12 for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To believe in Him is to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the all-inclusive Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 , He enters into us and dwells in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 to be everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once we have received Christ Jesus, we need not receive Him again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But we must apply what we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, only a very small percentage of those who have received Christ apply Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all must practice to apply the living Christ in a practical way day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To employ a common term, we need to use Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For more than fifty years, I have been learning how to use Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I can testify that this is difficult because by birth it is not natural for us to use Christ, nor does our training condition us to use Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Recently, most of my confession to the Lord has been related to my failure to apply Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The hardest lesson for us to learn as Christians is to apply Christ and to use Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have heard a number of messages on living Christ, growing Christ, and producing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nevertheless, in our daily living we spontaneously use the self instead of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is no need for us to try to use the self; we use it automatically and spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the Gospels the Lord charges us to watch and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I have spent a number of years considering this word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At first I thought that this command was not necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But eventually I learned that I certainly need to watch and pray, especially in the matter of applying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we are waking up in the morning, we need to be watchful not to do anything without applying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Often as we wake up early in the morning, it seems that demons are swarming around the headboard of the bed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although we are protected by the Lord and covered with His prevailing blood, we still need to be watchful and resist the evil thoughts injected into us by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not think about anything without applying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We certainly need to be on the alert; that is, we need to be watchful and to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But very few Christians watch and pray in order to apply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although we have all received the Lord Jesus, we are very short in using Him, in applying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we fail to apply Him, then in a practical way in our daily living there is little significance to having received Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our experience of Christ should not be so superficial, and we should not take so many things for granted.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are thankful for God s salvation in Christ, and we are grateful that we have received Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But now we must go on to apply the very One we have received.</S>
