   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A believer's own spirit must be buoyant and without entanglement when he arrives at the meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many at the meeting are full of burdens when they come.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The leader of the meeting must first release them by means of prayers, hymns, or the truth before he gives the message of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the leader of the meeting has a burden from which he cannot be freed, how can he hope that others would be free?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must know that spiritual meetings are a fellowship between spirit and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A speaker releases a message from his spirit, and the listeners receive the words of God with their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whether a believer is a leader or a listener, when his spirit has a burden and is not free, it is not able to open toward God and respond to God's words; therefore, a believer's own spirit must be free.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, the leader must first endeavor to free the spirits of the congregation before delivering a message of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to obtain the power of the Holy Spirit before we can do a powerful work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to keep our spirit free for the power to flow out from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The expression of the power upon a believer is in different measures.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How much he experiences Golgotha will determine how much he will also experience Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the spirit of the believer is really buoyant, the Holy Spirit will be able to work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, in working, especially with regard to an individual, there is sometimes the experience of the spirit's being closed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This may be caused by the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Perhaps the person you are meeting has a particular condition which makes your spirit feel closed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He may not have an open spirit and mind or the capability to receive the truth; he may have an improper thought in his mind that blocks the flowing out of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If others have these kinds of conditions, this will cause the spirit of the worker to feel closed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In many instances, we only need to look at the attitude of the one who comes to us to know whether or not we can do a spiritual work toward him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we feel that our spirit has been closed because of him, we cannot spread the truth to him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If our spirit feels closed and we force ourselves to work, the work will probably not be from the spirit but rather just a product of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only work done from the spirit has lasting and effective fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is produced from the mind will always lack spiritual power.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do not first remove a person's hindrances by prayers and preparative labor so that our spirit will be free to spread the Word of God, our work will lose its effectiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Believers must learn to walk according to the spirit so that they can work in the spirit.</S>
