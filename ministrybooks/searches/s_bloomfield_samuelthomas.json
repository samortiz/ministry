This criticism was mainly of two categories. One was lower criticism being done by believers. This was like the textual research work done by many in the late Ching dynasty. The other was higher criticism being done by unbelievers. This was like the ancient Sadducees. The higher critics are today\u2019s modernists. They are the liberals. Lower critics include such people as Wordsworth, Bloomfield, and Henry Alford. They spent much time to evaluate every word of the Bible. They were familiar with every word and carefully studied classical Greek as well as biblical Greek. Today our study of the Bible is based on the result of their research. In order to train ourselves in paraphrasing, we have to reference their works. Of the critical works of these three, Alford\u2019s writings are the best. If there is any doubt, his interpretation should be taken as the standard. "}]}
