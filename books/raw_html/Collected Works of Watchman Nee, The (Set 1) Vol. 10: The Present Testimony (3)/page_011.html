<H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S WAY OF REDEMPTION</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(A Message on the Lord's Day Morning)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 25</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gal. 4:4-5; Rom. 10:17; Heb. 11:6; Gal. 4:6; John 14:26; 16:13</H1><P>Deep within me I feel the need to give a message on the significance of faith. Hebrews 11:6 says, "But without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to Him." The most important thing in the entire life of a Christian is to please God. If a Christian does not have faith, he cannot be well pleasing to God. Why is faith so important? I recently looked into a Bible concordance regarding the word faith and found that almost everything was through faith; this is by faith and that is by faith. All of the grace that God has prepared for man is received through man's faith. Faith is so important. God does not grant grace with respect of persons. Many people are obedient and well-behaved, yet God does not grant them much grace. Why is this? We need to see that there are four steps involved in God's way of redemption.</P><P>First, there is the work of Christ. God caused Christ to accomplish redemption for us. Through the death and resurrection of Christ, God accomplished redemption for us.</P><P>Second, God proclaims what He has done through His Word. The Word of God proclaims Christ's accomplished facts.</P><P>Third, man believes in God's Word. We first believe in the Word of God, not the work of Christ. Christ's work satisfied God's heart. Christ fulfilled God's desire. We rely on the work of Christ and believe in the Word of God. Without the Word of God, we cannot believe the work of Christ. Without the Word of God, we cannot understand the work of Christ. Therefore, believing in the Word of God is believing in the work of Christ.</P><P>Fourth, the Holy Spirit applies the accomplishments of Christ to the believers. When the Bible mentions the Holy Spirit, it pays particular attention to His fellowship. The Holy Spirit applies to us what Christ has accomplished. The Holy Spirit is leading us into God's truth. Truth is reality, the reality of all spiritual things. In the Bible, truth indicates Christ and His accomplishments. The Lord says, "I am...the reality" (John 14:6). Truth also refers to the Word of God. The Lord says, "Your word is truth" (17:17). The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth. The Holy Spirit ushers us into Christ and His accomplishments. The Holy Spirit also makes the Word of God real to us.</P><P>This is God's way of redemption. If we do not have faith, we do not have anything. Although Christ has accomplished everything and God has spoken, if we do not believe, the Holy Spirit can do nothing and we cannot obtain anything.</P><P>What does Christ's work include?  A few weeks ago I spoke on the riches in Christ and mentioned that sanctification, perfection, freedom from condemnation, deliverance from sins, holiness, pleasing God, etc. are all included in Christ's accomplishments. When Christ died, we died in Him; when Christ resurrected, we resurrected in Him; and when Christ ascended, we ascended in Him. A certain magazine once said, "When Christ was on the cross, not only was His physical body there, but the spiritual body was also there. The body He obtained from Mary was there, and even the mystical body was on the cross." We should not seek to die or look for death, because Christ has accomplished this for us. If we are weak, someone may tell us that we should die, that if we die, we will not sin. But the Word of God tells us that we died nineteen hundred years ago. We have no choice; God has accomplished this for us.</P><P>Sinners cannot be saved through works. Once we realize that salvation is through the work of Christ, we will be at peace. Today many Christians appear to be dead even though they are not dead. They fail today and again tomorrow; all of their efforts are in vain. Brothers and sisters, we are hearing a wrong gospel if it requires us to work. The Bible says that "in Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ" (Col. 2:11). Christ did this for us. This is the work of Christ. We should see what has been accomplished in Him.</P><P>Christ's accomplishments are for our perfection in Him. The Holy Spirit puts whatever is in Him into us. Christ not only died, but also resurrected. When Christ died, we died; when Christ resurrected, we also resurrected; and when Christ ascended, we also ascended. Our inheritance in Christ is beyond our imagination.</P><P>When we read the Bible, we ought to pay attention to one question: should we pursue the things that are in Christ, or have we already obtained them? Once I asked a brother, who was reading Romans 6, how much he needed to do and how much had already been done concerning death and resurrection. He answered, "I need to die and resurrect." I responded that my Bible did not say that; rather, Romans 6 says that we have died and resurrected. All we need to do is just consecrate.</P><P>Men in the world talk about death and resurrection, but their talk is not based on Christ's accomplishments. Therefore, they can never experience it. Thank God that Christ has died and resurrected. Even though Christ has accomplished this, without God telling us so in the Bible, how could we believe? Without God's Word, none of us would know that Christ died and resurrected. God's Word tells us the facts in Christ. Therefore, we believe in God's Word, not just the work of Christ. How can we believe if we did not see the death of Christ with our own eyes, and some of us do not even know where Israel is. The Word of God, however, has told us that Christ died and resurrected for us. God commanded His servants to write down the accomplishments of Christ so that we could believe.</P>
