   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SIX ITEMS OF THE SPIRIT WITHIN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we must see what the Spirit is to us when He comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have seen, He is the Spirit of life to be life to us Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second, He is the Spirit of reality John 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is within us as the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Reality is not merely doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit is the reality of all that God and Christ are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is love, but without the Spirit of reality within us we do not have the reality of love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we have the Spirit of reality within us, we have the reality of love.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is also light, but if we do not have the Spirit of reality, we do not have the reality of light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All that God and Christ are is in the Holy Spirit as the divine reality to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Third, the Holy Spirit within us is a seal Eph 1:13; 4:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we believe in the Lord Jesus as our Savior, we belong to God, and God puts a seal upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I buy a new book, I put my seal on it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that the book is mine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we believe in the Lord Jesus, we become God's. We belong to God, so God puts His seal upon us, or within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This seal is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moreover, to put a seal on something we possess makes that thing exactly the same as the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The seal of the Holy Spirit within us is an element within us that is exactly the same as God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Fourth, Ephesians 1:14 says that the Spirit is also a pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A pledge is a down payment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Holy Spirit is the pledge, the guarantee, that all that God is and all that God has is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit as the seal within us testifies that we belong to God, and the Spirit as the pledge within us is a guarantee that God belongs to us, that all that God is and all that God has are our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may say, "O Father, You must give me all that You have and all that You are, because I have the Spirit as the guarantee."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Fifth, the Spirit is the anointing 1 John 2:20, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have the Spirit within us who is always anointing us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While He is anointing us, He also is bothering us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sixth, the Spirit is the Comforter John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Greek word for Comforter is Paraclete.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1 John 2:1, this word is translated as Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Paraclete has a daily application and a legal application.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In daily life, the Paraclete is always with us to serve us and care for us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the legal sense, the paraclete is an attorney, a lawyer in a court of law who pleads for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In our daily life, the Holy Spirit always accompanies us to care for us and to meet all our daily needs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Concerning the righteous law of God, however, Jesus Christ as the Advocate is the attorney in the heavenly court always pleading for us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Holy Spirit as life, reality, the seal, the pledge, and the anointing is everything to us, and as the Comforter He takes care of us in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, if something happens to us in the heavenly court, the Advocate is our attorney to defend us and plead for us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These are the aspects of the Holy Spirit within us.</S>
