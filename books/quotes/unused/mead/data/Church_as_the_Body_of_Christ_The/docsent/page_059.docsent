   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING THE LORD S MERCY TO ALLOW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE HOLY SPIRIT TO DO THE BREAKING WORK</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Coordination in service is a matter of our need for the Lord s mercy; it is not a matter of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need the Lord s mercy so that as serving ones we would be willing to receive the inward shining and breaking before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Any kind of method, instruction, organization, and even arrangement cannot cause us to have a good coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only when we are willing to receive the breaking of the Holy Spirit can we have real coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the brothers and sisters are clear about this in theory, but I am afraid that we lack a heart of desiring mercy and receiving mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, we miss the opportunity to experience coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As long as we have a heart and are willing to receive mercy and the breaking and shining, our coordination will not be a difficult matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because the saints have all learned some lessons in the church life, they do not desire to contend and dare not contend.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, because there is not enough shining, although there is no outward contention or argument, they are unable to get through within.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is to be short of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Any kind of speaking and exhortation is useless; we need God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our responsibility is to allow the Lord to be merciful to us and to receive His shining in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We often do not have a sense of spiritual responsibility in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There may be several reasons for this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes too many practical church matters occupy us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As much as possible, we should reduce our involvement in these matters so that we have time to prepare for spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, instead of putting their time and heart into spiritual matters, some full-time serving brothers and sisters are busy mostly with practical church matters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>So when they come to a meeting, they are very low in their spirit and over time become indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They would tell themselves, I will let the Holy Spirit move others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I will let others bear the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am too tired.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is my resting time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The main reason for this is that they are busy with too many practical church matters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Besides not allowing ourselves to be entangled by practical church matters, we also must be able to receive the Lord s commission.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a matter of receiving mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must be willing to receive mercy in order to receive the Lord s burden, the Lord s commission.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Take the church in Taipei as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some brothers are indifferent in the meetings, not bearing any burden, and they merely sit and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, when they are not in the meetings, they are busy, working unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It seems as if the meeting time is their Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>During the other six days they are constantly busy, and on the seventh day they rest.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not think that I am joking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, if such a brother moves to a new place and becomes a responsible one, he will be unable to sleep at night because the burdens are too heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When he comes to the meetings, he will pray, select hymns, and exhort others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This shows that he has begun to have a sense of responsibility and to bear the burden of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Consider the example of the brother who traveled from another locality and put his luggage in the courtyard of the meeting hall, while the full-time serving ones and deacons did nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we send these full-time serving ones and deacons to a small locality as responsible ones, I believe that they would regard this visiting brother as an angel and would rejoice greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They would receive this brother warmly because they have a sense of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Another reason can be that in such a big family as the church in Taipei, because there are many capable and experienced ones, we do not think that we need to be responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we try to be responsible, we might cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do a good job, it is out of duty, but if we do a bad job, we will be rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, it seems better to be wise and indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this way, we think we are avoiding many problems and causing less trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, if we go to a small locality, everyone must bear responsibility and make decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we do a bad job, no one rebukes us, and if we do a good job, we receive all the credit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is totally different from being in a big church, where if we do a good job, all the credit seems to go to the responsible brothers, but if we do a bad job, we are rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although we may fall into this condition unconsciously, this is an abnormal situation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Please keep in mind that if a serving one can bear responsibility only when he goes to a certain place, his responsibility is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His bearing of responsibility only when he gets to a place where he can be responsible is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everyone who serves the Lord needs to learn a deep lesson before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should learn not to hold on to any work that has been committed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At any time and at any place we must be able to receive the Lord s commission.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whether there is an arrangement or authority, our fellowship with the Lord, our concern for people, and our care for souls should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Suppose a brother arrives at the meeting hall and puts his luggage in the courtyard.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we are in fellowship with the Lord and care for people, we will go and serve him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is not a matter of authority or responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should ask him kindly, Where do you come from?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>May I help you put your luggage inside the hall?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is a matter of spiritual life and not a matter of responsibility or authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is probably not life if we take care of things only because we are responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Not having the expression of life in one place but doing something out of responsibility in another place is not of life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we love the Lord and love people, we will definitely contact people before and after the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Before a gospel preaching meeting, we will go and find people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Before and after other meetings, we will fellowship with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should always receive a commission from the Lord when we contact people, either receiving help from others or rendering help to them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should conduct ourselves the same way in a large locality as in a small locality.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>No matter where we are, we should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In this way, what we do will most likely be of life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>These matters do not depend upon exhortation, arrangement, or encouragement; they depend upon our willingness to receive mercy and the Lord s shining.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There is often no outward contention among the churches in matters related to spiritual supply or practical help, but there is much inward contention.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This shows that something is still hidden within us, and we have not been broken in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Our natural being remains, and the service entrusted to us is strongly attached to us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This problem does not exist only among the churches; it exists even among different halls within the same church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>For example, a certain co-worker who is capable of supplying the saints may be available one Lord s day to go to one of the halls and minister to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When the responsible brothers of the various halls learn of this, they may begin to negotiate among themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The first hall may say that the second hall is strong and does not need any extra help; the second hall may say that the third hall has only a few saints and thus has no need for the co-worker to go there.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>After much negotiation, each one retains his own understanding, and no one has been struck down in their inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is the same in matters related to help in practical affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Everyone may appear outwardly courteous, but inwardly everyone has his own opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This proves that we have not prostrated ourselves before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We should not be happy simply because the church in our locality is strong; we can have real joy only when the church of the Lord is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Although we have been entrusted with responsibility, we should not be attached to the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We should be faithful unto death, but we should not be attached to the service.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should not feel happy and satisfied because the hall where we are responsible is strong; rather, we should feel happy and satisfied because the Lord s church is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must see that man is selfish and that even in spiritual matters man can express the selfishness of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Sometimes, this selfishness is hidden; instead of contending for ourselves, we contend for the work for which we bear responsibility, and we even openly contend, thinking it is justifiable.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We need to see that even in the responsibility that the Lord entrusted to us, we should not have any selfishness; we must prostrate ourselves before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>There is no method that can solve this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This problem is dealt with only by receiving the Lord s mercy and allowing the Holy Spirit to do a breaking work in us.</S>
