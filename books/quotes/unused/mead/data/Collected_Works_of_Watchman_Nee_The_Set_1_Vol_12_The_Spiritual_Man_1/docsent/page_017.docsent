   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The work of the enemy begins with the need of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He first told her to eat of the fruit, something that was entirely related to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Next he took one step further to tempt her soul by telling her that if her body would take the fruit, her eyes would be opened, and she would know good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He indicated to her that such a pursuit for knowledge was legitimate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a result her spirit rebelled against God, and she wondered whether God had forbidden her to eat because His intention was wicked.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The temptation of Satan comes first to the body, then to the soul, and last to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After she was tempted, Eve made a judgment in her will, which was: 1 "that the tree was good for food."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the "lust of the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Her flesh was touched first.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2 "It was pleasant to the eyes."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the "lust of the eyes."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Her body and soul were also deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>3 "A tree to be desired to make one wise."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is "the vainglory of life."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word "desired" means that the emotion and will in her soul were moved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now the function of the soul was motivated, and there was nothing to stop it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She was no longer a spectator, but was moved in her love and desired after the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The emotion is indeed a dangerous master to man!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why was there the desire?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes made the demands, but the curiosity in the soul urged her to pursue further.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was something that would make her wise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The activity of the soul can many times be detected in the pursuit for wisdom and knowledge, including spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To give no time to wait on God, to have no trust in the leading of the Holy Spirit, and to try to increase one's knowledge with the help of one's mind and books, these are the activities of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The result of this is damage to the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since man's fall came from the pursuit of knowledge, God used the foolishness of the cross to destroy the wisdom of the wise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Intellectual power is the source of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, if a man desires to be saved, he has to believe in the foolishness of the cross in order that he would not trust in intellectual power.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The tree of knowledge led to man's fall, but God used the foolish tree 1 Pet 2:24 to save man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, "if anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this age, let him become foolish that he may become wise.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God" 1 Cor 3:18-19; 1:18-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After we have carefully read the story of the temptation and the fall, we can see how the rebellion of Adam and Eve led to the development of their soul, the result of which is that the spirit lost its position and fell into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The most important parts of man's soul are his mind, will, and emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The will is the master of man; it is the organ of deliberation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The mind is the thinking organ, while the emotion is the loving organ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The apostle told us that "Adam was not deceived" 1 Tim 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This shows that Adam's mind was not confused.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The one who was weak in mind and intellect was Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"But the woman, having been quite deceived, has fallen into transgression" 1 Tim 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The record of Genesis says, "The woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat" 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Adam said, "The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave not beguiled me of the tree, and I did eat" v. 12 . Adam was not beguiled; his mind was still clear.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He knew that the fruit was the forbidden fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet he ate it because of his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Adam knew that all the words of the serpent were the deceptions of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we read the word of the apostle, we find that Adam sinned purposely and was not like Eve who sinned through being beguiled.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He loved Eve more than himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He idolized her and loved her so much that he rebelled against the commandment of the Lord for her sake.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How pitiful this was.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His head was controlled by his heart, and his reason was overcome by his love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Why have men "not believed the truth"?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is because they "have taken pleasure in unrighteousness" 2 Thes 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not because reason is lacking, but because the desire is lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, when a man truly turns to the Lord "with the heart and not with the head, there is believing unto righteousness" Rom 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Satan gained Adam's will through his emotion, and caused him to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The way Satan beguiled Eve was to confuse her mind, gain her will, and then cause her to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When man's will, mind, and emotion were poisoned by the serpent to follow Satan and to rebel against God, the spirit with which man communicates with God received a fatal blow.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here we see the principle of Satan's work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He beguiled man's soul to sin through the things of the flesh the eating of the fruit .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once the soul has sinned, the spirit falls into darkness and degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the order of all his works from the outside to the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Either he works from man's body or he works from his mind or his emotion for the purpose of gaining his will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once man's will surrenders, Satan gains the whole being, and the spirit is put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The way he worked the first time is the way he works in all subsequent times.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God's work is always from the inside to the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He first works from man's spirit, then enlightens man's mind, touches man's emotion, finally causes man to exercise his will to activate his body to carry out God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All the devil's works go from the outside to the inside, while all the works of God's Spirit go from the inside to the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this way we can differentiate what is of God and what is of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This shows us that once Satan gains man's will, he controls man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must be careful to realize that the soul is the organ of man's personality; it is the part that expresses man's free will and is man's master.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is why the Bible often says that it is the soul that has committed sin.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Micah 6:7 mentions "the sin of my soul."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Ezekiel 18:4 and 20 speak of "the soul that sinneth."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In Leviticus and Numbers, we often see the expression "if a soul sin" KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Proposing to sin is the function of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The definition of sin is the will responding to temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, to sin is a matter of the will, which is of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>For this reason, propitiation is for the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>"To make an atonement propitiation for your souls" Exo 30:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>"To make propitiation for your souls" Lev 17:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>"To make an atonement for our souls before the Lord" Num 31:50 KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Because the one who sins is the soul, the one who requires atonement is also the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>For the same reason, only a soul can atone sins.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>"But Jehovah was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>/ If You make His soul a trespass offering, / ...Because of the travail of His soul, He will see / And He will be satisfied; / ...Because He poured out His soul unto death...</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>/ Yet He alone bore the sin of many / And interceded for the transgressors" Isa 53:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If we study the nature of Adam's sin, we will find that besides rebellion, there is also the matter of independence.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should always bear in mind the matter of the free will.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The tree of life signifies dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the beginning, man had not yet received God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If he had received this life, he would have obtained eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This shows that there was the possibility for man to attain to the highest form of life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It also shows that man did not attain to it.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Man will not attain to the highest until he has acquired God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is the meaning of dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies independence.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Man wants to have knowledge that God has not given to him and tries to gain the things outside of God by exercising his own will.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>All these speak of independence.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When man rebelled against God, it was a sign of independence because rebellion against God means that there is no further need to depend on God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>For man to try to know good and evil is also a sign of independence.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>He is not satisfied with what God has given him.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The difference between being spiritual and being soulish is very clear here.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>To be spiritual is to fully trust in God and to be satisfied with what God has given.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>To be soulish is to turn away from God and to freely seek after what God has not given, in particular, to seek after knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Independence is a characteristic of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>No matter how good a matter is, even if it is the matter of worship, if there is not the total dependence on God and if there is any self-assurance or self-confidence, it is something soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Within a man, the tree of life cannot grow vigorously by the side of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This rebellion and independence is the principle of transgression for all sinners as well as for the believers.</S>
