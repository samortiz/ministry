   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE ABRAHAM AND HIS SON 2 Scripture Reading: Gen 16:16 18; 20:1-2, 10-13, 17-18; 21:1-3, 10; Col 2:11; Phil 3:3 Abraham's Circumcision</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God promised Abraham a son, but Abraham did not wait on God for his son; he married a concubine and gave birth to a son Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After he begot Ishmael, there was a thirteen-year period in which God did not speak to him Gen 16:16 17:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although he begot a son, he wasted thirteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the experience of many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever we act according to the flesh, God puts us aside and allows us to eat the fruit of our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In God's eyes that period of time is a total waste.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After Abraham begot Ishmael, during the long period of thirteen years, there was no peace in his family.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, the Bible does not show us that Abraham had any regret.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the contrary, he treasured Ishmael very much.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can see this from his word to the Lord: "O that Ishmael might live before thee!"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>17:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although chapter fifteen tells us that he believed, there does not seem to have been too much pursuing on his part.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Day after day, he still took satisfaction in Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to our thought, if a man has been walking according to the flesh for thirteen years and still has no feeling of guilt, there must not be much hope for him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But we must remember that Abraham was called by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God had a purpose in him which He had to fulfill; He could not give him up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although he backslid for thirteen years and although God did not speak to him during all that time, He was working all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God does not give up those whom He has chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If He wants to gain a person, that person cannot escape His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even though Abraham had failed, God still came and looked for him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to realize that no fleshly pursuit, struggle, fretting, or unrest will bring us forward.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should learn to commit ourselves to the hand of the Almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He will lead us as He sees fit.</S>
