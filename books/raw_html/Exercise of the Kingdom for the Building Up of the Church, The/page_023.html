 <h2 class="head1">BEING POOR IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Matthew 5:3 does not say, &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs will be the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; It says, &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; When we are poor in spirit, we are in the exercise of the kingdom. The same is true of those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; When we are poor in our spirit and when we suffer for righteousness, we are in the kingdom. To be poor in spirit and to suffer for righteousness both mean to lose the soul. On the contrary, to be proud and to consider that we are great is to save the soul. To be poor in spirit is to think that we have nothing, know nothing, and are nothing. In a human sense, this is to suffer and to lose the soul. To lose the soul in this way is the real denial of the self. Those who think that they are everything and know everything do not deny the self or lose the soul. The kingdom is not with those who hold this attitude. Whenever we are like this, we are out of the kingdom. We need the mercy and grace of God to say, &ldquo;Concerning God&rsquo;s economy, I know nothing, I have nothing, and I am nothing. I am nobody.&rdquo; This is what it means to be poor in spirit, to be without human enjoyment, boasting, or pride. As we have pointed out, whenever we are poor in spirit, we are immediately in the kingdom. This is the exercise of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUFFERING FOR THE SAKE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2>
<p>To suffer for the sake of righteousness is definitely to suffer the loss of the enjoyment of the soul. Whenever we are willing to lose the enjoyment of the soul today for the sake of righteousness, we are in the kingdom, and the kingdom is ours. This also is the exercise of the kingdom. It is not a matter of reward or enjoyment, and it is not something we can boast about. Today the entire world is rejecting Christ and the kingdom. The world is also rejecting the followers of Christ. Therefore, we suffer for following Christ and we lose the enjoyment of our souls today. Because of the kingdom, we are willing to lose our enjoyment. Because of the kingdom, we are willing to deny the self and be poor in spirit. Because of the kingdom, we are willing to be nobody, to know nothing, and to be an empty vessel available to be filled with Christ for the building of the church.</p>
<p>Matthew 5:10 speaks of suffering for the sake of righteousness because, according to the Bible, the kingdom as a whole is a matter of righteousness. Thus, to suffer for the sake of righteousness is to suffer for the sake of the kingdom. If we suffer for the sake of the kingdom, if we are willing to lose our soulish enjoyment today, we are in the kingdom. There is no need for us to enter into the kingdom, for we are in the kingdom already. But what aspect of the kingdom are we in? We are not in the reigning aspect, but in the aspect of exercise. To repeat, the reigning aspect of the kingdom is coming, but the aspect of the exercise of the kingdom is present today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BUILT UP THROUGH THE KINGDOM</h2>
<p>Now we need to see how the kingdom is the way the church is built. According to our experience in the church life, we all have realized that the church cannot be built up with those who refuse to deny themselves. Today not only the worldly people but even Christians are fighting with one another. In every society and organization people think of themselves as being somebody and as having something. This is even true of children in kindergarten. Where can you find a place where people always have the attitude that they are nothing and have nothing and that they are empty vessels? Such people can be found only in the church. If we cannot find people with such an attitude in the church, then there is a question whether that really is the church. The church can only be built up through the kingdom, which we have seen is today an exercise. The Gospel of Matthew reveals that this exercise kills every part of our being. When some hear this, they may say, &ldquo;The denial of the self is difficult enough. Now you are telling us that the exercise of the kingdom will kill every part of our being. We cannot bear this.&rdquo; Humanly speaking, I can only agree with you and sympathize with you because I am the same.</p>
