<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF POWER,<br>THE ECONOMICAL SPIRIT OF GOD</H2><P>The life-giving Spirit is also the Spirit of power, the economical Spirit of God, for the believers to put on as their uniform typified by the mantle of Elijah (Acts 1:8; Luke 24:49; 2 Kings 2:9, 13-15). We need the daily infilling of the essential Spirit of life as well as the daily experience of the economical Spirit of power. A policeman needs to eat well for his life and living essentially, and he also needs to put on his uniform to carry out his governmental duty economically. In the same way, we Christians need to receive daily the Spirit of life as the element and essence of the processed Triune God that we may have a proper life and living essentially, and we also need to put on the uniform of the Spirit of power economically for our work in carrying out God's economy.</P><P>Today we should be vital; that is, we should be living and active. Our being living with vitality comes from the Spirit of life working in us essentially, whereas our being active with authority comes from the Spirit of power being upon us as our uniform economically.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE COMPOUND SPIRIT, COMPOUNDED<br>WITH CHRIST'S DIVINITY, HUMANITY, DEATH, AND RESURRECTION TO BE THE ANOINTING OINTMENT</H2><P>The life-giving Spirit is also the compound Spirit, compounded with Christ's divinity, humanity, death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power to be the anointing ointment (Exo. 30:23-29). The word compound is used as a verb with reference to the mixing of different kinds of ingredients to make medicines and ointments. If a person has an ailment, a pharmacist may form a compound from many different ingredients in order to meet that person's need. In the same way, the Spirit has been compounded to give us just what we need.</P><P>The ingredients of this compound Spirit are clearly shown in the type of the holy anointing oil in Exodus 30:23-31. The holy anointing oil was used for the particular purpose of anointing both the priests and the tabernacle. The base of the holy anointing oil was one hin of olive oil. The olive oil signifies the Spirit of God. In addition, the oil signifies the divinity in the Godhead.</P><P>Four spices were added to this olive oil in three units of five hundred shekels each. These three measures of five hundred shekels signify the Triune God as an element in the compound Spirit. The second of these three measures is divided into two equal portions of two hundred fifty shekels each. This signifies that Christ, the Second of the Divine Trinity, was crucified, "split" on the cross. In the Bible the number four signifies God's creation. Ezekiel 1:5 and Revelation 4:6 speak of the four living creatures. The four spices signify the humanity of the Lord Jesus in God's creation. The four spices blended with the one hin of olive oil signifies that in the compound Spirit humanity is blended, mingled, with divinity.</P><P>The four spices were myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. Myrrh in the Bible was used for burial (John 19:39) and is related to death; hence, it signifies the precious death of Christ. Cinnamon, which can be used to stimulate the heart, signifies the effectiveness of Christ's death. Calamus, a reed that grows in a marsh or a muddy place, signifies the precious resurrection of Christ. Cassia, which was used as a repellent to drive away insects and snakes, signifies the power of Christ's resurrection.</P>
