   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Holding Hands over the Fences Not Being Unity</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since people already have the denominations today, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have already testified that it is not good for God's children to have denominations and divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's children must not form divisions; rather, God's children must love one another and be together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have been saying this for thirty years since 1921.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is this word effective?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although we have met much opposition from the beginning and are still meeting some today, the opposition is getting weaker and weaker.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the beginning they tried to defend the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today they have become much weaker.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now they have come up with another way, saying, "We want to have a spiritual fellowship."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we have seen, this spiritual fellowship is the result of two factors.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first factor is state churches, in which a small church was found within a large church, a true church within a false church, a church of reality within a church of externality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second factor is divisions caused by the differences in doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now some seek a middle road, that is, having "spiritual" fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us see if this "spiritual" fellowship is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Spiritual" fellowship is certainly an improvement upon no fellowship among the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The situation in China through these many years has certainly changed, but can "spiritual" fellowship replace the fellowship of the church as ordained in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What they call "spiritual" fellowship is not real fellowship; they only borrow the term.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, here we have several cups.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's purpose is that all should be united as one cup, but they have made the mistake of dividing themselves into many cups.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Spiritual" fellowship is for the purpose of strengthening the fellowship in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In denominationalism I have my cup, you have your cup, and he has his cup.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Spiritual" fellowship is a stretching out of our hands over our cups to hold each others' hand "across the fence."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Separation by fences is denominationalism.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Holding hands over the fences is "spiritual" fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is still sectarianism despite a desire for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not hold hands over the fences, however, we are sectarian and denominational.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the teaching of the Bible, however, there should be no sects, no denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet today there are brothers who want to keep the denominations, even though their consciences bother them that there is no fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Consequently, they stretch out their hands over the fence to hold hands on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the doctrine of the so-called "spiritual" fellowship today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Concerning this matter, I feel quite heavy within.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brothers, let me say one word: If denominations are scriptural, we must pay any price to maintain the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If it is God's command, who can nullify it?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must learn to follow God, not man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, if the denominations are wrong, we must abolish them to the root.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot confess that the denominations are wrong on the one hand and encourage them on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot say that denominations have no standing on the one hand and maintain them on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since the denominations have no standing, we have to break them down and abolish them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We cannot covet fellowship on the one hand and have fellowship over fences on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we really desire fellowship, we must break down the fences and have fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we want to serve God and feel that all God's children should have fellowship, we must tear down all the fences to have fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the fences are right, then we must build fences, not only ten feet high, but ten thousand feet high.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must be thorough and absolute before God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the denominations are right, we must exert one thousand times the effort.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the denominations are wrong, then it is proper for us to tear them down.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we feel that the denominations are wrong, yet want to keep the fences and shake hands over the fences, this is not the principle for serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The basic principle for us to serve God is that if we feel the denominations are right, we must support them; if we feel they are wrong, we must break them down.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we want to support the denominations on the one hand and try to break them down on the other, what could we hope to accomplish?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You must come to the place of showing others that their actions are not according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Speak for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you feel the denominations are right, you should help them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you feel the denominations are wrong, then please tear them down.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not merely pull the fences lower; tear them down completely.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the denominations are right, you must build the fences higher, so that no one can cross over, and so that everyone is clearly divided.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This matter must be thorough and absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Keeping the denominations on the one hand, and feeling that they are wrong while trying to repair them on the other hand is absolutely not God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You know God; you have read the Bible have you ever seen God wanting men to repair something?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is what is done by those who lack the courage to answer God's demand and listen to God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They are paying half or less than half the price; they are seeking some bargain.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They hold out their hand of fellowship while keeping the fences of division.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I would like you brothers to see this matter clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A basic principle of Christian behavior is that we must pursue every matter thoroughly and absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then we can solve the problem.</S>
