   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING THE HOOFS OF A CALF Being Straight</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The third aspect, the calf's hoofs, concerns our Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all must walk like a calf, having straight hoofs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To walk with a lion's paws is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No Christian should walk on lion's paws.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>While we can apply the boldness of a lion to our Christian character, we should not apply the lion's paws to the Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Neither should we walk with the claws of an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If one is walking with the claws of an eagle, we always must be careful because sooner or later he may hurt us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Neither should we walk with the feet of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Man's feet are good, but they are a little crooked; they are not so straight.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul said that in the world he had his conversation, his conduct with simplicity, not with man's cleverness 2 Cor 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our Christian walk must be straight; it must be frank and never crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why Paul told us not to lie one to another Col 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Never lie to a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To lie is to be crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you are able to speak something, speak it honestly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you are unable to speak honestly, simply do not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During the last six days before the Lord Jesus was crucified, He went to Jerusalem and was surrounded by the leaders of religion and politics.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some of the leaders came to Him and asked Him who gave Him the authority to do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus in turn asked them whether the baptism of John the Baptist was from men or from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They knew that if they said the baptism of John came from the heavens, He would ask them why they did not believe him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If on the other hand, they said that it was not from the heavens, the people would stone them because they considered John to be a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this kind of dilemma they considered that the best answer was a crooked one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They turned to the Lord Jesus and said, "We do not know."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Really they did know.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They knew, but they would not tell.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that they were crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the Lord Jesus knew their crookedness, He said that He would not tell them either Matt 21:23-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He meant that since they would not tell Him, neither would He tell them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus was really straight and strict, but the Pharisees were crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus' feet were the calf's hoofs; with Him there was no crookedness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By reading the four Gospels, we can see that while the Lord Jesus was on earth, He walked very straight.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Step by step His walk was straight.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was walking on this earth with calf's hoofs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We also should be walking in this way today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we are walking in a crooked way, we should not expect the church to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all must learn to be frank, honest, faithful, and sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Be simple and be single.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we mean yes, we should say yes; if we mean no, we should say no. Anything more than that is from the Devil Matt 5:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Devil is the father of all lies John 8:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even if you lie with a good intention that is still of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not walk according to our crooked man's feet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our feet are not straight; they have a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the calf's hoofs have no turn; they are straight.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Not only was the Lord Jesus so straight, but also the Apostle Paul was very straight, frank, faithful, and honest.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By reading the two Epistles to the Corinthians, we realize that Paul was such a strict and frank person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He asked, "Shall I come unto you with a rod?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>1 Cor 4:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What if one of the Lord's servants should write a letter asking such a question to a church today?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The whole congregation would be shocked.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we would be a faithful servant of the Lord we must be straight in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Being Cloven</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The calf's hoofs are not only straight, but also cloven or divided.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Each hoof of the calf is divided.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to Leviticus 11:4-6, an animal that does not have the cloven hoofs is not clean.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All the clean animals have their hoofs divided.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The clean cattle such as the cow and the sheep have two characteristics: the chewing of the cud and the dividing of the hoof.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The divided hoof signifies that in our walk with the Lord we need a proper discernment to divide the right things from the wrong and the clean things from the unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The calf's hoofs are not like those of a camel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A camel's hoof is not cloven, not divided.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This means it has a walk without discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But we must have such a walk that we can discern what is right and what is wrong in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In our daily Christian walk we need such discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even concerning the church, we need such discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In this country the term "local church" has become popular merchandise.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many groups loosely call themselves the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must be able to discern whether a group is in fact a normal, proper, genuine local church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must discern.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need the cloven hoofs.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do not be loose, thinking that because they say they are a local church, they must indeed be a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some are genuine and some are not.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some are right and some are wrong; some are real and some are not real.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need the discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In our daily walk as well as in the church life, we need to have the cloven hoofs of the calf.</S>
