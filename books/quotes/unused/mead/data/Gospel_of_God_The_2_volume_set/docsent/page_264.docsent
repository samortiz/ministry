   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When the conscience was troubled in the Old Testament, one could always bring another bull or goat to offer a sin offering through the priest.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is what Hebrews 9 shows us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It tells us that the blood of bulls and goats did not do a complete job.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Chapter ten says that if a complete job had been done, there would have no longer been consciousness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God reckoned that the work of bulls and goats was incomplete according to the conscience, because every time a person's conscience lost its peace, he felt that his sins had not yet been fully taken care of, and there was the need for further offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the apostle shows us that a Christian does not have to do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The propitiatory sacrifice that God has set up in the New Testament is not a bull or goat but His very own Son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When His Son came to the earth, He said plainly that God did not desire nor delight in bulls and goats.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead, God prepared a body for Him that He might die to accomplish the work of eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord has accomplished on the cross the sacrifice for eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now we are able to obtain this eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He has offered up a sacrifice of eternal redemption, thus accomplishing an eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because of this eternal redemption, we are eternally perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because His eternal work has been accomplished once, we do not need to offer up sin offerings anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot offer up a sin offering for the same sin any longer, for the Lord Jesus has accomplished all the work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Son of God cannot be crucified for our sins again.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One cannot trample underfoot the blood of God's Son and make it something common.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If something is one of a kind, it is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if there are two of a kind, they are common.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To treat the blood of the Son as common means to consider it the same as the blood of bulls and goats.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if you honor His blood and consider it as something unique, it will be precious to you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here is the sin offering which He has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After the Lord has accomplished this work, God said that there cannot be any other work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Son of God cannot die again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His work is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you want it, you have to trust Him for it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You cannot add anything to it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Either you depend on Him or you have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After a man has been enlightened by the truth, there is no more sacrifice for sins for him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is only one sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is what we preach to others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who come to worship through this one sacrifice will have their consciences cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They will no longer have the consciousness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All their sins are washed away, and there is no more consciousness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, there is no need for another cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible never teaches the doctrine of a second cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The blood of the Lord Jesus cannot cleanse us again.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once we have been cleansed, we are cleansed forever.</S>
