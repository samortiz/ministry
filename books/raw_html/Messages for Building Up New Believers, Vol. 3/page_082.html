 <h2 class="head4">b. Mary in Place of the Goddess of Greece</h2>
<p>Every religion of the world has its goddess. Buddhism has Kuan Yin, and the Greeks worship Venus. The Romans took this practice from the Greeks and worshipped goddesses. They could not find a goddess in Christianity, so they took the virgin Mary to be their goddess. In name they called her Mary, but in actuality she was treated like the Greek goddess. This is fornication and mixture.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Sun Festival Becoming Christmas</h2>
<p>Many Romans worshipped the sun and celebrated the birthday of the sun on December 25 every year. December 22 is the shortest day of the year. After December 22, days begin to grow longer and nights become shorter. The sun worshippers regarded December 25 as the birthday of the sun, and they had a great festival. After many of them were converted, they came up with an idea when they saw their unbelieving friends celebrating the festival with great alacrity, while they had no celebration. They claimed that the Lord Jesus was the true sun and that December 25 should be the birthday of the Lord. Consequently, they made this day Christmas Day. The only thing that is Christian about Christmas is the use of Christ&rsquo;s name in its name. In fact, it belongs to the sun religion. Please bear in mind that this is fornication before God; it is a mixture. The worship of the sun is mixed up with Christianity.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. The Heathen Temple Becoming the Temple of God</h2>
<p>The church is the temple of God. In the Old Testament the temple of God was built partly with wood and mostly with stone. In the New Testament age God allowed the temple to be destroyed, not leaving one stone upon another. Where is the temple today? All those who believe in the Lord today are the temple of God. Our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. Yet today the Roman Catholic Church has built tall and imposing buildings. The Greeks were skillful at fine architecture. The Romans continued the Greek tradition and devoted much time to the study of architecture. They were also very good at artistic edifices. They felt that all the gods had their own temple, and Christianity had nothing for the eyes to admire. They forsook the teaching of the apostles and built big and handsome buildings. No other edifices in the world can be compared to the cathedrals of Christianity. Men call these cathedrals the temples of God. The cathedrals in Milan, St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral in Rome, and Notre Dame in Paris are all high buildings that men call temples of God. Please bear in mind that this thought is pagan in its source. Men turned the pagan temples into temples of Christianity. They consider these buildings as Christian buildings, but in fact they are pagan edifices. Christianity has committed fornication and has followed after pagan people.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. The Priesthood in Judaism Converted<br />
to the Priesthood in Catholicism</h2>
<p>Every child of God in the New Testament is a priest. As long as he is a child, he is a priest. In the eyes of God all those who believe in the Lord Jesus are priests and all of them serve Him. But the Roman Catholic Church, realizing that the priests in Judaism effectively served as an intermediate class of people, divided the Roman Catholic believers into two classes and introduced the Old Testament Judaistic concept of the priesthood into the New Testament church. One class of people puts on priestly gowns and priestly caps. Everything that the Bible describes about the priesthood was applied by the Roman Catholic Church to their priests. Catholic priests dress themselves in the same way that Old Testament priests did. They also add much paraphernalia. They have not only borrowed from Judaism but also have brought many things from the Greek religion and Roman temples into Christianity. They have changed God&rsquo;s ordained way. This is fornication. In the Bible fornication means confusion.</p>
