   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE BEING RENEWED DAY BY DAY Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:16, 10-11; Titus 3:5b; Eph 4:23; 5:26; Matt 26:29; 1 Cor 11:27-31; Matt 18:21-22, 35; Eph 4:32; 5:2; Matt 5:23-24</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we want to see the renewing process that we need to pass through in our Christian life for God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Second Corinthians 4:16 says that our inward man is being renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Nee once told us that the book of 2 Corinthians may be considered as an autobiography of the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The life described in this Epistle is a life full of sufferings, but when we spend more time to get into the depths of this Epistle, we can see that it is actually talking about renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the sufferings God has assigned to us have one unique purpose to renew us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Regardless of whether we are good or bad, we are the old creation, but God in His economy desires to work out something new from His old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God spent a brief time to create the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He spoke the things of the old creation into being in five days, He created man on the sixth day, and rested on the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This old creation is not God s goal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, the old creation is the material and sphere by which God gains something new.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>RENEWED THROUGH FOUR DISPENSATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the entire Bible, God uses four dispensations in His old creation to work out something new.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first dispensation is the dispensation before law, or the dispensation of the fathers from Adam to Moses giving of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The second dispensation is the dispensation of law from Moses giving of the law to the first coming of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The third dispensation is the dispensation of grace from the first coming of the Lord Jesus to His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fourth dispensation is the dispensation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After the Lord s second coming, He will set up God s government on this earth to practice God s kingdom in its manifestation for one thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In these four dispensations, which are all in the old creation, God works to produce the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the fourth dispensation, the new heaven and the new earth are brought in with the New Jerusalem as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The New Jerusalem is the composition of all God s redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All of God s redeemed people in God s glorification will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The New Jerusalem composed of God s living, glorified people is absolutely new.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nothing old will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today we are in the process of being renewed to become the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thank God that today we are in the third dispensation, the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this dispensation, some wonderful things have happened.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first wonder that happened in this dispensation is that the Triune God Himself became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He did not only come to man but also came to man in His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He came to man by becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The incarnation of the Triune God is many, many times greater than the creation of the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One of the greatest wonders in this universe was God s incarnation, His becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The very God, the complete God, entered into the womb of a human virgin and stayed there for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then He was born as a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The little babe in the manger at Bethlehem whose name was Jesus was not only a man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was both man and God, so He was a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The second wonder in the dispensation of grace is that the very God who created the heavens and the earth lived on this earth as a man, not just for a short period of time but for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead of living in a famous place, He lived in a despised city of a despised region, Nazareth of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was not born into a rich family, but into a poor family, and He did the work of a carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may say that this carpenter was Jesus, but we need to realize that Jesus was God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What a wonder that God lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The third wonder was His going to the cross to die an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through His death, He solved all the problems in the universe, terminating the entire old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In that all-inclusive death, He released His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The fourth wonder in the dispensation of grace was Christ s resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He rose up not only by Himself but also with all God s chosen ones, including you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As a man, He ascended to the third heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From the earth to the moon is a short distance, but from the earth to the third heavens is a distance beyond the imagination of the human mind.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In His ascension, He poured Himself out as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That Spirit was the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He poured out Himself as such a Spirit upon God s chosen people to make them all His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today we believers are parts of the Body of the wonderful Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All of these items have transpired as wonders, but our apprehension of these items is not so thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because of our lack of vision, we suffer without seeing or apprehending God s purpose in our suffering.</S>
