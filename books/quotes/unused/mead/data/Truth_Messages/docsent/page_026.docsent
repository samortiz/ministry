   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LOSING THE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is a matter of great significance to be one where the Son is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>None of the fallen people are in the Father; they are in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because they are not in the Father, they are not in the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the contrary, they are in worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and concepts and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the previous message we pointed out that the world is constituted of ambition, self-exaltation, and concepts, not merely of such superficial things as fashion and entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The fallen people are altogether in themselves and in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In a sense, not even all those who have truly been saved are actually in the Father, for many still live in themselves, expressing worldliness, self-exaltation, ambition, and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These four things are in the very fiber of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even among the Christians who seek the Lord, not many are truly living in the Father and in the Father s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As a result, the genuine oneness is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all need to have a proper understanding of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is possible for us to meet together and still not be in the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have true oneness only by living in the Father and in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many Christians speak about the oneness in John 17 with no real understanding of what they are talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To a certain extent, this may be our situation also.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The oneness in John 17 is not a matter of gathering, union, or organization.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The oneness here is the living in the Father and in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such a living rescues us from worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Often we break the oneness unconsciously, perhaps even by our way of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our talk may be worldly, filled with ambition, self-exaltation, and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, in our speaking we may not be in the expression of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who live in the Father s glory can sense this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because the unbelievers live in themselves and in the world, they do not have oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead, they have Babel, that is, confusion with division.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, even seeking Christians, including us, may also be in Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may have the correct terminology and we may know that the Lord s recovery is the recovery of the genuine oneness, but we may not actually have this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we are still in ourselves, not in the expression of the Father, the oneness is damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the indwelling Christ lives and moves within us with the Father living and moving in Him, we are rescued from our ambition, self-exaltation, and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes when I am with the leading ones, I have the impression that they are too quick to express their opinion or to make decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that they have not been perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we have been perfected, we shall not be bold in expressing our opinions or in making decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We would be restrained by the indwelling Christ, and we would spontaneously check whether what we are about to say is of Christ or of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If all the leading ones are perfected in this way, there will be no dissension among them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>BROUGHT INTO THE FATHER S GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord s prayer in John 17 reveals that we need to be brought onward from being just in the Father to being in the Father s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the book of Acts, it is possible to be brought into the glory of the Father within a very short period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Gospels, the two sons of Zebedee, James and John, asked the Lord to give them a high position in the kingdom Mark 10:35-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The fact that the other ten disciples became indignant with them over this indicates that all twelve were competing for position.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, among the disciples there was worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the book of Acts, however, the situation is altogether different.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Acts 1 the one hundred and twenty prayed in one accord v. 14 . Thus, on the day of Pentecost, they were not only in the Father, but also in the Father s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At that time there was no worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, or concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead, there was only the expression of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The genuine oneness had been perfected among them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>ONENESS PREVAILING WHERE THE SON IS</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Oneness is possible and prevailing only where the Son is.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Son is in the Father and in the Father s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Without doubt, Peter, John, and the other early disciples could boldly testify that they were in the Father and in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, in the early chapters of Acts, the Lord s word in John 14 through 16 and His prayer in John 17 were fulfilled among them, for they had all been perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord Jesus could boast, Father, I am in You, You are in Me, and all these are in Us and in the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They are with Me where I am.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to be delivered from a false understanding of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Oneness does not mean that we have the same concept or that we merely gather together without dissension or division.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Genuine oneness is our living in the Father and in the Father s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whatever we think, say, and do must be in the Father and in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we live in this way, we are perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is not a matter of outward behavior, but of inward reality, and we need to devote our full attention to it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Instead of living in ourselves in our goal, purpose, ambition, feeling, or concept we should live in the Father and in His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then we shall be one where the Son is.</S>
