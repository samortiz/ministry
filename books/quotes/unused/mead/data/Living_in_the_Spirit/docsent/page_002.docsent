   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE EXPRESSING GOD AND LIVING IN THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26-27; Eph 4:24; Rev 4:3a; 21:11, 18a; Gen 2:7; Zech 12:1b; Job 32:8a; Prov 20:27a; John 3:6b; Rom 8:16; 2 Tim 4:22; Rom 1:9 THE CONSISTENT THOUGHT IN THE SCRIPTURES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all realize that the Bible is consistent, but what makes it consistent?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How does the Bible begin, develop, and end?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some may say that Christ makes the Bible consistent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This kind of reasoning, though, is too superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we will open up the "gold mine" of the Bible and excavate the gold that is buried deep inside it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible, like every object, has two sides the inside and the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, the surface of this podium is dark brown.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, on the inside its color is the color of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to see the color inside, we must get below the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the Beginning of the Scriptures</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first mention of man in the Bible links man with the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Genesis 1:26 God says, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Genesis 1 tells us that in His creation God created numerous things over a period of five days.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During those five days He created everything by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God said, "Let there be light," and there was light v. 3 . He said, "Let there be an expanse," and there was an expanse vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Psalm 33:9 says, "For He spoke, and it was; / He commanded, and it stood."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, on the sixth day God held a conference of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He said, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Prior to creating man, He created the heavens, the earth, and a myriad of items.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, these items were not His central purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His central purpose is fixed on man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God wants man to be His expression, so He created man according to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, man is like a photograph of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This photograph is God's picture, God's reprint, and God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some of us may have heard or read numerous messages on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, regardless of how many times we have heard it, we still may not understand it because this matter does not exist in our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Scriptures there is the principle of first mention.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to this principle, the first mention of a matter in the Scriptures sets the principles of that particular matter for the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first mention of man in the Bible says that man was created according to the image of God; that is, man is God's expression, God's reprint, and God's manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you were to ask me why man was created, I would answer, "Man was created for God's expression."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is why man is like a photograph of God and a reprint of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Obviously, those who do not believe in God and the Scriptures could not utter such a statement, and I believe that even many of those who have been in Christianity for years may not be able to utter it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must see that the Bible reveals that God wants man to be His reprint.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If nine hundred of us were to gather together, we would all look similar to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is because we are all reprints of one original copy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every one of us looks like God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not one among us looks like a cow.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every one of us is a reprint of God to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is what the Bible tells us at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible shows us that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth and that on the first day He created one thing, on the second day He created another, and so on.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After the heavens, the earth, the sun, the moon, the grass, the trees, and various creatures had been created, God said, "Let Us make man in Our image."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is God's central purpose, and this is the central thought that can be seen consistently throughout the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God's intention is for man to be like Him and to express Him.</S>
