   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AVOIDING AN ATTITUDE OF SUPERIORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is a problem that the brothers from the West have an attitude of superiority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, we should not oppose them because of this, nor should we react negatively or look down on them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The only serious problem is our differing view concerning the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Their superior attitude hindered further fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even though this was unintentional, it was revealed unconsciously in their behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let me illustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because I am from northern China, I unconsciously speak with a northern accent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I do not intend to speak with a northern accent, but as I speak, the accent comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I was born and raised in northern China, I also lived there for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am composed of the elements of northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Unless I am transformed, my northern accent will always be with me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as I live, I will unconsciously have a Chinese flavor and a northern Chinese accent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Similarly, the various influences of international politics over the past one hundred years and China s position in international politics has caused the brothers from the West to have an attitude of superiority that is difficult to remove.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition, our history over the past decades has caused us to have an attitude of inferiority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a problem in the East and in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have been praying concerning this matter for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>May the Lord cover me with His blood; I would now like to fight against this matter, endeavoring to get rid of these attitudes of inferiority in the East and superiority in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May these attitudes no longer exist in the future when the brothers and sisters from the East and from the West come together to fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Presently it is not a problem for the believers in the East to receive the spiritual help from those in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are already doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, the believers in the West will need to be humble in order to receive spiritual supply from the believers in the East.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When there is this open fellowship, the Lord will reveal what we have seen to the believers in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I strongly believe that soon the brothers from the West will come and live in the East for a period of time in order to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They will then understand what the Lord is doing on this earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They will understand the way the Lord is taking today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only time can prove this word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many of you brothers are in your twenties.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the Lord delays His return, you will probably live longer on this earth than I will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One day perhaps you will recall this word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the Lord s mercy to us, and we should not be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should be clear concerning what the Lord has given to the church over the past two thousand years, and we should understand the significance of the Lord s raising us up in the East in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>May we be faithful to learn our lessons and labor in the Lord s work, and may we refrain from comparing ourselves with others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as we are faithful, the result is up to the Lord, not up to us.</S>
