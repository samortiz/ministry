Every time we speak, our spirit rises up a little. When our spirit rises up during our speaking, we have to consciously release this spirit. As our speaking becomes more and more weighty, we will learn that a frivolous spirit cannot carry the weight of our word. We have to release the word with a sober spirit. We have to exercise our will to stir up our spirit to release the word. Therefore, our spirit as well as our feelings must be in line with God's word. We need to accept God's breaking under the discipline of the Holy Spirit so that our outer man can be dealt with and we can be purified daily. Then our spirit will be free and available. There is the need of a fundamental breaking work. Only then will our spirit be free to be released. Otherwise, our soul will come out instead.</p><p>Those who are free from self-consciousness can be considered "naturally spiritual." Self-consciousness is a function of the soul. Those who are strong in self- consciousness are strong in their soul. Those who do not have self-consciousness can use their spirit more freely. For this reason, it is easier for God to use those who are free from self-consciousness. The absence of such consciousness is a basic qualification for preaching the gospel.</p><p>Whether or not our meeting will be strong depends on whether a minister of the word pours out his all on his audience. He must stake all his feelings and thoughts on his spirit and push such a spirit out. The more a minister of the word sacrifices, the more focused and powerful his word becomes. If he sacrifices little, his words will be diluted, and there will be little power to them.</p><h2 class="head1">A BASIC REVELATION</h2><p>Question: What is a basic revelation?</p><p>Answer: Peter received a knowledge of the Lord when he was in the region of Caesarea Philippi, but he received a knowledge of himself in the courtyard of Pontius Pilate. In his case, knowledge of the Lord and knowledge of the self were two separate matters. Paul saw a great light on the way to Damascus; it flashed all around him, and he fell to the ground. When he fell, he knew the Lord and himself at the same time. This is the proper and standard way to be saved. We should receive our basic revelation in the same way that Paul received his; we should know the Lord in an instant and know ourselves thoroughly at the same time. This is the standard experience of salvation. Unfortunately, gospel preachers today do not render people enough light, and men do not have enough knowledge about themselves or about the Lord. We are speaking many things which can only be considered as make-up lessons for the gospel. In one sense we can even say that we are still preaching the gospel now.</p><p>Many spiritual things should have come to us at the time salvation came to us, but because of a shortage of light, we have wasted much time. The only thing that requires time is the growth in life. Other things such as consecration can be experienced at the same time that a person is saved. However, due to the shortage of light, some have not consecrated themselves even ten years after being saved. Nothing can bring in more confusion to one's salvation than the shortage of strong light and adequate revelation. Some experience grace ten times, even a hundred times, but the total effect of these experiences is less than the one time Paul experienced the grace of knowing the Lord and himself at the time of his conversion. What we are doing here today can only be considered a kind of make-up lesson. In his Epistles Paul tells us of the riches the Lord has given us. He tells us about everything that the Lord has given us. What we have received today comes far short of what Paul speaks about. The Lord has given us everything. From the time of the apostles, the church has been busy with make-up lessons. It has dropped many things that the Lord has given it. The Lord has done everything for us. Today when we speak of revelation, we are merely speaking of seeing what the Lord has accomplished for us already. We need a basic revelation because we were short in the past; we received less than a quarter of the total revelation. Today under God's light, we want to receive all four quarters. This is what we mean by receiving basic revelation. Some are saved one hundred percent. Others are saved ten percent. What we are doing today is recovering fully and completely what the Lord has given us already.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 60: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (2) &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
