<h1 class="title">THE FACT AND THE EXPERIENCE<br />
OF THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 6:6, 11; 8:13; Col. 3:5; Gal. 5:24</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE FACT OF THE CROSS</h2>
<p>The Scriptures reveal that the cross of Christ is an accomplished fact (Rom. 6:6). On the negative side, the cross of Christ terminated everything opposing God and resolved all the problems between God and man (John 12:31; Col. 2:15; Heb. 2:14); on the positive side, the cross of Christ released God&rsquo;s life and fulfilled God&rsquo;s plan (John 12:24, 32). Everything that offends God, opposes God, and frustrates God, including Satan, the demons, sin, the world, the flesh with its passions and its lusts, the old man, the self, and all things, has been dealt with and terminated by the cross. Furthermore, God&rsquo;s life and all its riches have been released through the cross. We do not need to be crucified again, because the flesh of sin, the old man, and the self have been crucified, and Christ also does not need to be crucified again, because God&rsquo;s life has been released. These are accomplished facts.</p>
<p>The cross of Christ is an accomplished fact. For example, we can see this accomplishment of these facts not only in relation to sin but also in relation to the old man. Romans 6:6 says, &ldquo;Our old man has been crucified with Him.&rdquo; Christ dealt with our sins on the cross by dying on our behalf, and He also dealt with our sinful nature, the old man, by including us in His death on the cross. His vicarious death on our behalf dealt with our sins, and our co-crucifixion with Him dealt with our old man; both are accomplished facts. Just as our sins were removed through His vicarious death on the cross, our old man was terminated in our co-crucifixion with Him. His vicarious death dealt with our sins, and our co-crucifixion with Him dealt with our sinning person. His vicarious death and our co-crucifixion with Him are both accomplished facts related to His one death on the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seeing the Cross</h2>
<p>Since the cross is an accomplished fact, we do not need to do anything other than to see and know this fact. Although we do not need to be crucified again, we need to see and know the cross. Only Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion, not ours, can save us. A cross of our own cannot save us; only the cross of Christ can save us. Christ brought us to and included us in His death on the cross. In Christ we were crucified on the cross. Hence, we do not need to be &ldquo;nailed&rdquo; to the cross, because we have already been terminated there.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we need to see the cross. We need revelation to see and know the accomplished fact of the cross. We were put to death in Christ on the cross. In God&rsquo;s eyes this is a certain fact. However, without the revelation of the Scriptures and the shining of the Holy Spirit, we cannot truly know this matter. We can know and see the fact of the cross only through the enlightenment and revelation of the Holy Spirit through the Scriptures.</p>
<p>We do not have to crucify ourselves, and we cannot nail ourselves to the cross. Our crucifixion is a fact that has been accomplished for us by Christ. Nothing further is required of us other than seeing and knowing the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Accepting the Cross</h2>
<p>Once we see the fact of the cross, we will accept it. Once the Spirit shows us the fact of our co-crucifixion with Christ, He will lead us to accept it. If, under the enlightening of the Spirit, we see that our old man has been crucified with Christ, we will spontaneously acknowledge this matter and accept it as a reality. To accept is not merely to believe the truth of our co-crucifixion with Christ but to accept the fact of our co-crucifixion with Christ as a certainty and to acknowledge that we have already died. Romans 6:11 refers to this, saying, &ldquo;So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin...in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We reckon ourselves to be dead not merely based on a doctrine of our co-crucifixion with Christ. Rather, we spontaneously acknowledge that we are dead when we see the fact of our co-crucifixion with Christ. Acknowledging the fact that we are dead is a spontaneous reckoning that is the result of seeing our co-crucifixion on the cross. There is no need to make an effort to remember to reckon. Anyone who needs to make an effort to remember to reckon himself dead lacks a genuine seeing of the cross. If, by the enlightenment and revelation of the Spirit, we see the fact of the cross, we will spontaneously acknowledge that we are dead. When the Spirit shines the fact of the cross into us and reveals it in us, the death of the cross immediately becomes a reality in us, and we spontaneously acknowledge that we are dead.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> </body></html>
