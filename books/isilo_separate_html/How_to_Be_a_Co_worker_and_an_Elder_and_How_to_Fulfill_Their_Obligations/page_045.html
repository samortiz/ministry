You are the God who is forever new; You never grow old and never fade away. May we receive from You the constant and daily renewing. Lord, save us from oldness, from the old creation, from our old "I," from our old man, and from everything old. Lord, may we be like Your apostle Paul, forgetting the things that are behind, leaving everything that is old behind us, and endeavoring to go forward for the prize to which You have called us upward, which is Your dear Self. Thank You for leading us through the past five meetings. In this last meeting we pray that You would give us a simple and clear conclusion, even the best conclusion. Give us the words, the utterance. Amen.</P><P>Thank the Lord, in this conference I sense that we have touched the main points and have covered what the Lord wants us to cover. For this we worship Him. In the preceding two chapters we saw that when we are fulfilling our obligations as co-workers and elders, we need to beware of certain things that can frustrate and damage us. In this concluding chapter I have only one clear and simple burden to fellowship with you. This is concerning how to work with God in fulfilling our obligations as co-workers and elders to carry out the divine building.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> </body></html>
