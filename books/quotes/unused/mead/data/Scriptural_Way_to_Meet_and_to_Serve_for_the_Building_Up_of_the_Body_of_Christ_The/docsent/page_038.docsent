   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must learn to enjoy the unsearchable riches of Christ Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The riches of Christ are not for theological study; the riches of Christ are for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must learn to enjoy the unsearchable riches of Christ as the all-inclusive, bountiful, life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; Phil 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we study the Bible with our mind alone, the unsearchable riches of Christ are just words printed in black and white.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when we exercise our spirit to enjoy what is mentioned in the Bible, the riches of Christ get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the word of the Bible gets into us, it becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the beginning, it is simply the printed word, but when we exercise our spirit to pray-read this word, taking and receiving it by means of all prayer in our spirit Eph 6:17-18 , it immediately becomes the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This Spirit is all-inclusive and bountiful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the word is outside of us, it is simply the word; when it enters into us, it becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we speak the word to others, it becomes the word again and when others receive the word that we speak, it becomes the Spirit within them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Outside of us it is the word; inside of us, it is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you dwell on Ephesians 3:8 by pray-reading it for only three minutes, this word will become the life-giving Spirit within you, making you so refreshed, happy, and full of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The best way to stir people up and gain them for the Lord s move is not to teach or preach too much to them, but to ask them to pray-read with you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not argue or debate with them; pick up some golden verses and simply practice pray-reading with them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At first the practice of pray-reading may seem strange to them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If they do not pray-read, do not be bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let them sit, listen, and watch as you and the others with you pray-read in a living, refreshing, strengthening, and energizing way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Perhaps, after the first or second time, they may be stirred up and say that they would like to enjoy Christ by pray-reading with their family in their own home.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the best way to help people to pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We receive Christ as the life supply by eating John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The way to eat is by exercising our spirit through the word by pray-reading John 6:63; Eph 6:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To merely exercise our mind is insufficient; we need to exercise our spirit in the depths of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we lose our temper, we often exercise and release our spirit, but in a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do not know that we have a spirit, or we do not know how to exercise our spirit properly, we may simply exercise our mind to pray without touching our spirit at all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a result of not exercising their spirit, some may even fall asleep while they are praying.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to exercise our spirit, we need to know that we have a human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The New Testament reveals that we must exercise our spirit 1 Tim 4:7; Rom 1:9; 8:4; 12:11; Gal 5:16, 25; Eph 5:18; 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ephesians 6:18 emphatically states that we must pray at every time in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we pray by exercising our spirit, we are unable to fall asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, the more we pray in this way, the more stirred up we become.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When you pray exercising your spirit, you may feel after kneeling down for five minutes that you cannot remain kneeling any longer; you must stand up to shout, Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may simply become crazy with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You may stand up or jump up saying, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The way to enjoy Christ is to enjoy the unsearchable riches of Christ as the all-inclusive, bountiful, life-giving Spirit by receiving Him as the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We receive Him as the life supply by eating, and we eat by exercising our spirit through the word by pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>EATING CHRIST AS THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>IN THE PARADISE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The enjoyment of Christ for the church meetings includes eating Christ as the tree of life in the paradise of God Rev 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The paradise of God refers to the New Jerusalem which will be enjoyed as a foretaste by the overcomers in the coming millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church life today is a foretaste of the paradise in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have the Lord Jesus in the church life today as the tree of life, and in a very positive sense, the church life is a paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church life is a most pleasant place; therefore, it is today s paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this paradise of the church life, Jesus Christ Himself is living as the tree of life for our daily supply.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, we must eat Him as the tree of life.</S>
