<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Compounded with the Unique God,<br>as the Base</H2><P>The best type of the all-inclusive Spirit of Christ as the compound anointing Spirit is the compound ointment spoken of in Exodus 30 (see Life-study of Exodus, Messages 157-166, pp. 1679-1776). This type reveals that the compound anointing Spirit is compounded with the unique God, as the base, as the divinity of Christ, typified by the one hin of olive oil (v. 24b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. With God's Divine Trinity</H2><P>The compound anointing Spirit is compounded with God's Divine Trinity, typified by the three units of five hundred shekels of the spices (vv. 23-24a). The middle unit of five hundred shekels was split into two units of two hundred fifty shekels each. This signifies that the Second of the Divine Trinity was split, crucified, on the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. With Christ's Humanity</H2><P>The compound anointing Spirit is also compounded with Christ's humanity, typified by the four kinds of spices.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. With Christ's Death<br>and Its Killing Effectiveness</H2><P>The Spirit is compounded with Christ's death and its killing effectiveness, typified by myrrh and cinnamon (v. 23a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. With Christ's Resurrection<br>and Its Repelling Power</H2><P>Christ's resurrection and its repelling power, typified by calamus and cassia (vv. 23b-24a), are also elements of the compound anointing Spirit. Calamus is a reed shooting up into the air out of a marsh or a muddy place. Thus, it signifies the rising up of the Lord Jesus from the place of death. Cassia in ancient times was used as a repellent to drive away insects and snakes. Thus, it signifies the repelling power of Christ's resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. As an Ointment for Anointing</H2><P>All the above elements compounded together create an ointment for the anointing of all the things and persons related to the worship of God (vv. 25-30; 2 Cor. 1:21; 1 John 2:20, 27).</P>
