   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUBMITTING TO AUTHORITY,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND COORDINATING IN SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is only one mouth in the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is only one place where orders are issued.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the other places only need to follow the orders.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To mop the floor is a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yet, in doing such a small thing, a person must nevertheless ask the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is real coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A man is built up through serving in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you have to ask someone about something, that someone is spontaneously the authority above you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With the authority, there are the orders.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without authority, there can be no orders, and without the orders, there cannot be those who follow the orders.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the other hand, the presence of proper services always proves that authority is there, and under such circumstances, a model of the Body will emerge.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether or not local authority is built up depends on the presence of authority in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the coordination among the co-workers is not smooth, you cannot expect the coordination among the brothers and sisters to be smooth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The crux of the matter today is the coordination among the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is our biggest problem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have met with Brother Nee many times.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the time, I have the feeling that Brother Nee's ministry must be recovered among us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>During the past year and a half, we have discussed this matter many times.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once there is coordination in the work, the local churches will be able to send people out, and there will be an increase in quantity and quality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today, the preaching of the gospel should be a work in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Men remain unsaved because they have not yet seen the power of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once the Body appears, there will be the real recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today, we cannot say that we are fully recovered yet.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In short, if Brother Nee does not resume his ministry, nothing will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If real coordination is not established in the work, we cannot expect the local churches to have the real services.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As such is the case, there will still be the system of the Nicolaitans; we still will not see the whole Body rising up to serve, and we will still be left with a few serving.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>LEARNING TO LISTEN TO OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>AND TO BE SUBMISSIVE IN EVERYTHING</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brother Nee: My personal ministry is to serve as a minister of the ministers; I am here to serve the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>My own work seldom touches the brothers and sisters directly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Concerning the work, I have much to say.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Concerning the brothers and sisters, I have very little to say.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the church, a person has to learn to ask everything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once there is the asking, the services will be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a brother mops the floor in the church for two years and is still the same person, he should not come any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He has to mop the floor to the extent that he becomes a different person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the church it is not the main emphasis to get the work done, but to learn to be the proper person through doing the works.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every time we engage in any work, we have to learn coordination, and we have to ask the church about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not propose anything, but should learn to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who have the ministry are responsible for speaking up, and others are responsible for putting aside their own ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everyone has to learn to submit under the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the church does not learn this lesson, it will become the same as the denominations and other social groups.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everything in the church is under God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not only should the responsible ones learn to give orders, the brothers and sisters also should learn to follow orders.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The responsible ones have to learn to speak, and they also have to learn not to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether to speak or not to speak, they have to live under the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To live the church life demands our very life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first thing we have to do is not to think, but to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The saints should present all the problems to the elders, and the elders should present the problems before God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this way, the saints can come to God through the elders, and God's authority can be realized among the saints.</S>
