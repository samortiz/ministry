   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING THE TRAINING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE ENLIGHTENED BROTHERS AND SISTERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Perhaps you think that it is very difficult to be a believer in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all have responsibilities at home, yet we are not only required to come to the meeting, but also to practice meeting at home.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We cannot even relax at home.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But I would say that whether you practice or not depends upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It depends upon what kind of Christian you want to be.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I will never forget the time in 1953 when, while I was conducting a four-month training in Taipei, I was concerned that the brothers and sisters might not be able to follow along.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time I remembered an old story.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once there was a king who went to see how the tutor was teaching the prince his lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Looking through the window, he saw the tutor being very strict and severe with the prince.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When he could bear it no longer, he said from outside the window, If the prince studies, he will be king.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If he does not study, he will still be king.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This tutor, who was not afraid of being beheaded, replied from inside the study, If he studies, he will be an enlightened king.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If he does not study, he will be a foolish king.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This story gave me great encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You asked me to conduct the training, so I will be strict.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whether you will be enlightened or foolish is your choice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today the situation is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who practice and receive the training will be enlightened brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who would not practice and would not receive the training will be foolish brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is entirely up to you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I believe that you all care.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What we have spoken in the past few days is not any amazing, deep, or profound doctrine, but all are points that need to be practiced.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to study the sixty-six books of the Bible carefully and remember them well.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We even need to carefully read through the table of contents of the hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The table of contents of our hymnal is divided into more than 370 categories.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is much for us to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not only do we need to spend time to read the table of contents, but we also need to spend time reading carefully through the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is surely worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you do not read the hymns, you will not know them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you do not know them, how will you be able to choose the right hymns to match the meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>ALL FULLY SUPPORTING THE CONSTRUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>OF THE MEETING HALL IN LIN-KO</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since many brothers and sisters have come to this meeting from the central and southern regions of Taiwan, I want to say something about the matter of building the meeting hall in Lin-Ko.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We hope that every year we will be able to produce 200 full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to train the full-timers, there is the need of a training center.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is not only the need for classrooms for training but also for living quarters for hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In addition, we need a large meeting place for our large gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Last year we rented a place, but the acoustics were not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was a real distraction to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we had our own large meeting hall, we could design our own sound system, and it would be very convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In addition to using that meeting place for training and conferences, we could also use that site for the campus work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today the most worthwhile and productive place for the gospel work is the colleges and universities.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because everyone in today s society emphasizes education, university graduates are able to enter all levels of the society.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who are gained now in the colleges will soon enter into all levels of society.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, we want to use the property in Lin-Ko as a campground.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Every weekend we will be able to bring a group of people to the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There we will have a place for camping, a place for meals, and also a place for hearing the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you preach the gospel at home or on the campuses and people do not get saved, you can bring them to the mountains for a walk during the holidays.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When their hearts are opened, it will be easy for them to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Chung Li and Sheenchoo, which are south of Lin-Ko, and Taipei and Cheelung, which are north of Lin-Ko, can all use this property.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If out of the fifty-two weeks of the year, two groups come to camp every week, then there will be at least 104 camping trips per year.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus there will be the need to sign up beforehand to arrange the schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Young people like to come together for gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we promote this matter among the young people, then in the future Lin-Ko will be filled with groups of three or five fellowshipping and singing hymns under the trees.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a matter with great potential.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At this time we have only purchased the land.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There are still many expenses that need the full support of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This matter also requires everyone to pray much.</S>
