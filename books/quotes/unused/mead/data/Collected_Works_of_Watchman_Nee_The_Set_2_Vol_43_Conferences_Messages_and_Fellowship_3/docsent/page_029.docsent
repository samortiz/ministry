   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SIN WITHIN MAN BEING A LAW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What do we know about the sin that lies within man?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul says that this inward sin is a law in our members Rom 7:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is a law?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A law is something that acts the same way all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, a nation may establish a law saying that whoever kills another man will lose his own life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It does not matter who you are; as long as you kill someone, you will lose your life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you kill someone this year, you will lose your life; if you kill someone next year, you will still lose your life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A law, once passed, will never change.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Consider the law of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When you drop something, it falls immediately to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Regardless of whether you are in Peking, Tientsin, Shanghai, England, or America, the minute you drop something, it will fall to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every phenomenon that acts the same way all the time and never changes is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to Paul the sin that is within us is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sin is a law because we follow a pattern or a track when we sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever someone rebukes us, we feel unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are rebuked in the morning, we feel unhappy; if we are rebuked in the evening, we feel unhappy; if we are rebuked today, we feel unhappy; and if we are rebuked tomorrow or the day after, we also will feel unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every day of the year, we feel the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When others praise us, we feel happy, and the happiness that we feel is the same every day of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our reaction is the same no matter what day of the year it is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our sins behave the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All of our sins are very specific.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the world there are Ph.D.'s in many fields.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But I have never met a Ph.D. in committing sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A person can only commit one or two kinds of sin; he cannot commit every kind of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This may sound strange to you, but one must realize that it is not easy to invent new sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The same one or two sins always come back to us; they always bother and control us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have become specialized in one or two sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A stubborn person is stubborn in whatever he does.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He will not give in at all.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A proud person is always proud; a hot-tempered person always has his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sin is a law in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It controls us all the time and causes us to commit the same kind of sins over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is very rare for a person to commit one kind of sin today, another kind tomorrow, and yet another kind the day after.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brothers and sisters, you are very familiar with at least one sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you are twenty years old, perhaps this sin has followed you for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you are fifty years old, this sin may have followed you for fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you are not saved, this sin will follow you for the rest of your life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is what Paul referred to as the "sin which is in my members."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This sin cannot be taken away simply by forgiveness, because after a sinful act is forgiven, the law of sin is still present.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can be saved, but after we are saved, sins may still follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul also had a sin which followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even after he had made up his mind not to sin, he continued to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even though he rejected this sin, he could not be free from it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Later, he exclaimed, "Who will deliver me from the body of this death?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rom 7:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The words "body of this death" had a special connotation to the Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Romans had a form of punishment in which a murderer was tied to a dead corpse, face against face, feet against feet, and legs against legs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the murderer sat down, the corpse would also sit down with him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When he walked, the corpse would walk with him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The corpse would follow him wherever he went, and he would never be freed from the corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul said that his sin was like a dead corpse that tenaciously followed him, pursued him, and attached itself to his body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brothers and sisters, have you seen that there is a kind of sin that is like a dead corpse which follows you all the time?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It will not let you go.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you have not realized this, you will not be delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God wants to point out how evil the sin within you is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is as repugnant and detestable as a dead corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is no alternative other than getting it out of the way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only then will you be rescued.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some people know that they need forgiveness through the blood when they sin.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But they do not know that there is a sin within them, urging and forcing them to do many things against their will.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>THE CROSS DEALING WITH THE SIN WITHIN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the Bible there are two different ways of dealing with sin: The sins before God are taken away by the blood, but the sin in the flesh must be dealt with by the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The effect of the blood and the effect of the cross are entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The blood is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is outward and objective.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The cross is for man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is inward and subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Bible only speaks of man being crucified with Christ; it does not speak of man shedding blood with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Only Christ can deal with outward sins.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Man cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, in order to deal with inward sin, the old man has to be annulled by the power of the cross Rom 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The old man is the old "I."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Romans 6:6 speaks of three things: the old man, the body of sin, that is, the body that belongs to sin, and sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>First, there is sin, then there is the old man, and finally there is the body.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What does it mean for a person to no longer be a slave to sin?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Sin is the lord and master, the one who has the power over man.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the original Greek, as well as in English translations, the word "sin" is singular in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is the inward sin, the motivating power that urges and compels us to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Some have been serving this sin for decades, and they are still not free from it.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Sometimes they resist a little, but they are always defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Even though sin is powerful, we cannot blame it for our acts of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The one to blame is our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The old man is the one that has descended from Adam's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Brothers and sisters, what happens when we sin?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When we are about to sin, something in us tells us that it is wrong to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>However, a power within compels us and causes us to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Suppose someone says something that is not very nice about us.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Something within urges us to argue with him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The thing that is urging us to commit a sin is the inward sin.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We are Christians, and we know that it is wrong to argue with others, but if we do not argue, we feel unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>After we argue, we feel better because we have vented our anger.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It seems as if a company director is giving us all kinds of instructions, while a company executive is ratifying all his instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The result is the actual carrying out of the sinful actions.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Sin is a power that induces us to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is our old man that determines to sin because it likes to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>One brother told me that if he tried to be patient, he would get an ulcer.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Can you see how powerful the inward temptation is?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Sin gives the suggestion, and the old man gives the consent.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>One does the persuading, and the other performs the actions.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The body is merely the acting faculty.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>No sin can be carried out without the body.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The body is like a puppet.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>When you tell it to sin, it sins.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When you tell it to act, it acts.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The Bible calls it the body of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>All evil things come from the body.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The eyes behold evil things, the mind thinks evil things, the hands perform evil things, and the legs walk on evil paths.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>All the evil things are done by the body.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>According to the Bible, sin proposes, the old man consents, and the body acts.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>When these three work together, man sins.</S>
