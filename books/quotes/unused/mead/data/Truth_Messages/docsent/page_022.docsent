   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN ONENESS VERSUS EVIL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have the burden to give another message on the genuine oneness revealed in John 17.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to know what oneness is, we need to consider the situation at Babel in Genesis 11.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Originally, God created one man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He created man not in an individualistic way, but in a corporate way; for God s intention was not to have many men individualistically, but to have many men as part of a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, in the creation of mankind there was oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But this oneness was broken at Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before Babel, there was just one race; but after Babel, mankind was divided, and the many races came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the day of Pentecost the many races of divided mankind came together as one, not in creation, but in God s full redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, at Pentecost at least 3120 people were one, and there was a practical answer to the Lord s prayer in John 17.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In John 17:20 the Lord prayed not only for the disciples with Him at that time, but for all who would believe in Him through their word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Acts 2 at least three thousand people were saved through the word of the Lord s disciples and they were truly one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE TWO BABELS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Bible there are two Babels, two Babylons, one in the Old Testament and another in the New.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In a sense, both the Old Testament and the New Testament end with Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first Babel caused division among mankind; the second Babel has also caused division.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the departure of the Apostles, the second Babel emerged in the second century as a cause of division.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to church history, the result of the second Babel was the same in nature as the first.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With the first Babel the languages were confounded, and the nations came into existence; with the second Babel the denominations came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE SATANIC SYSTEM</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was with the first Babel that the God-created earth along with mankind fully became Satan s systematized world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before Genesis 11, the world as a satanic system had not yet come into existence in its fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the Lord speaks of the world in John 17, He is referring to this satanic system.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verses 14 through 18 the Lord mentions the world eight times.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the satanic system with Satan as the evil within it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 15 the Lord prayed, I do not ask that You should take them out of the world, but that You should keep them from the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word one in this verse is in italics, indicating that it is not in the Greek; hence, the literal rendering of the Greek here is the evil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Most translators agree that the evil here is a personified evil.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not a thing, but a person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Satan has become the personified evil in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now in the world there is someone called the evil.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This evil is the essence, the basic factor, of the satanic system.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This evil is Satan who is himself the personified evil in his satanic system.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the eyes of God, the whole world today is the evil.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verses 14 through 19 there is the implication that Satan is one with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Satan is the evil, and the world is also evil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They are one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE WORLD AND THE EVIL</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 15 indicates that the evil and the world are synonymous.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this verse the Lord prayed not that the Father would take us out of the world, but that He would keep us from the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First the Lord speaks of the world and then, using a synonymous term, of the evil.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This reveals that the world and the evil are virtually identical.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The world is the evil, and the evil is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although we cannot say that Satan is the world, we can say that Satan is the evil and that the world also is the evil.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE EVIL OF DIVISION</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The major symptom of the sickness in the satanic system is division.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the world today there is no oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the contrary, there is division everywhere, among the nations, in the family, in the schools, in business, and in politics.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every society is filled with division.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The whole world is ill with the disease of division.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This divisiveness is the evil in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to Genesis 11, at Babel division and confusion came in. We see the same on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every nation and every people are divided.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the evil in Satan s system.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This evil has crept into Christianity and has produced denominationalism.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Division is therefore the evil in today s Christianity, just as it is the evil in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By this we see that Christianity has become an intimate and faithful follower of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Eventually, in the book of Revelation so-called Christianity is named Babylon the Great.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By following the world with its evil of division, it has become great.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This evil is constituted mainly of worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and concepts and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The entire world is the evil, and within this evil there are ambition, self-exaltation, and concepts and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All division comes from ambition, self-exaltation, and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If these three things were removed from the world, the world would no longer be Babel, and there would no longer be divisions.</S>
