They did not plough nor did they reap in the wilderness. What they ate was the manna from heaven (Exo. 16:15). We who follow the Lord have God&#8217;s manna from heaven, which is the Lord Jesus. He is the bread of life. When we eat Him, we will not be hungry. He who eats Him will live by Him (John 6:35, 57).<h2 class=head3>Drinking the Living Water Which Flowed from the Rock</h2><p>Not only did the Israelites need food in the wilderness; they needed water as well. God solved the problem of their need for food by sending manna, but there was still the need to solve the problem of drinking. For that, God commanded Moses to smite the rock. Out of the rock came water (Exo. 17:6), and their thirst was quenched. Today the Lord Jesus is our manna. He is also our living water. We can drink of Him and be satisfied.<h2 class=head3>Defeating Amalek</h2><p>While the Israelites were journeying in the wilderness, Amalek came and fought with them (Exo. 17:8), hindering them from going on. Through the prayer of Moses, the Israelites defeated Amalek. In type, Amalek signifies our flesh. Our flesh is always hindering us from following the Lord. But through the intercession of the Lord Jesus in heaven and through the power of the Holy Spirit, we are enabled to overcome the flesh. Hence, after we have left Egypt and are in the way of following the Lord in the wilderness, there are many needs. The Lord is able to meet all of our needs. He turns the difficulties into sweetness. He satisfies our hunger and quenches our thirst. He overcomes the hindrance of the flesh for us. In this way we can go on fearlessly to the place God has appointed.<h2 class=head3>Coming to the Mountain Appointed by God, Receiving Revelation, and Erecting the Tabernacle</h2><p>The Israelites came to Mount Sinai, which was God&#8217;s appointed place (Exo. 19:1). Here they received the revelation to build the tabernacle so that God would have a dwelling place on earth (Exo. 25:8). Later the tabernacle became the center of the move among the Israelites. This typifies that we the believers are led by the Lord to receive revelation and to build the church as God&#8217;s dwelling place.<h2 class=head3>Wandering and Dying in the Wilderness</h2><p>The Israelites could very well have entered into the good land of Canaan through following the tabernacle had it not been for their evil heart of unbelief which offended God. For that, God was disgusted with that generation. In the end they all died in the wilderness. This typifies the believers wandering and failing in the soul.<h2 class=head3>Crossing the River Jordan and Entering into Canaan, the Good Land</h2><p>The Israelites wandered in the wilderness for forty years until a new generation rose up. God brought the new generation through the river Jordan to enter into Canaan. He ordered Joshua to choose twelve men from the people to bring twelve stones from the river Jordan over to the other side. In addition, they set up twelve stones in the river (Josh. 4:2, 8-9). This was done as a symbol that the old Israelites were buried under the river Jordan and that the new Israelites were brought through the river into the good land. This typifies that the believers&#8217; natural life passes through the death of Christ, and in resurrection they enjoy Christ as the good land.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
