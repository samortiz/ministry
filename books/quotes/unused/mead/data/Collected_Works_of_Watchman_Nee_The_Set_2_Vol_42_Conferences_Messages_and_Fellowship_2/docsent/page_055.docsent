   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN CO-WORKERS' MEETING Date: October 21, 1936, morning</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Amoy</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Editor's Note: This chapter is an excerpt of notes from a co-workers' meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most of the notes were reports by different co-workers concerning the work in various places.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only the portions containing Watchman Nee's words of fellowship, his answers to questions, and related portions of the meeting pertinent to his fellowship have been included.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brother Kuo asked: Presently, I am a responsible brother in my locality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the Lord delays and no mature ones move to our locality, should we try to produce responsible brothers out of our own locality?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brother Nee answered: The elders of each local assembly must bear the responsibility of edifying the brothers in their own locality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We find this in Paul's Epistles to Timothy and the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who think that they are able to work and only trust in themselves will not have the blessing of the Lord on their work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A man must be dealt with by the Lord to the extent that he no longer acts by his own strength, but acts solely by God's strength.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He must learn to continually trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When he does, God will use him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Moses first volunteered to work for God, he appeared to be very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God had to do something to force him out of Egypt, and he became a shepherd in the wilderness at Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Later, when he acknowledged that he could do nothing, God came in to call him to His work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Natural ability cannot be our capital for spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the eyes of God, a Christian is one who does not look at himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He does not become disappointed by looking at his own weaknesses, nor proud by looking at his own strengths.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A worker of God must not look at himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He must not look at his weaknesses or his strengths.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God can use a donkey to utter human words, and you are better than a donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is impossible with man is possible with God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must learn not to look at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you want to work for God, you must seriously seek for light, revelation, and gift from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One brother in Shanghai sought for the power of the Holy Spirit again and again, but was not able to obtain it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Later, he asked a few brothers and sisters to pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He said, "Some gifts are designed especially for some people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Lord, Your Spirit can work through a donkey, and I believe that You can use me also."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Soon after this he experienced the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some have asked Andrew Murray about humility.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many people think that considering oneself to be small is being humble, and considering oneself great is being proud.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But Andrew Murray answered that humility is not considering oneself at all, whereas being proud is considering oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brother Chung asked: I feel that I need to go to Fu-ching.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brother Nee answered: Are you clear that this is the Lord's will?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brother Chung answered: I have prayed and asked the Lord about it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brother Nee answered: It is not enough to say that you have made a telephone call.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You must receive an answer to your call.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many people know that they should pray when something happens.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But after they pray, they do not know whether God has answered their prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not only must we pray, we must also receive definite revelation from the Lord and be clear of His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brother Chung should also learn to join ranks with others and go on together.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One must not be strong-willed; rather, he must cooperate and work together with others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brother Jin-shiu Han fellowshipped: Brother Nee has spoken on the iniquity of the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I received much help from that message.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I want to consecrate myself to God to enable Him to deal with me more.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I hope to go to Shanghai to receive more training.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brother Nee's fellowship: If you want the Lord to enlighten you, you must have a determination to overturn all the wrong things that you have built up in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many sins need to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You have to ask the Lord to give you the light to remove all the wrong things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No one can say that he has dealt with his sins for the last time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is not enough to just confess your sins before men.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before the Lord, you must condemn yourself and hate yourself for your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You must go through a clearinghouse experience with respect to your sins once in a while.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If a brother has not experienced this for two or three months, he is probably not right with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brother Yau-yee Wang explained how the Lord had been leading him in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He related two great crises he had encountered: 1 his ulceration of blood, and 2 his encounter with bandits.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Brother Nee's fellowship: If you are clear about the Lord's leading within, you should not be influenced by outward circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whether or not the environment works against you is not a reliable sign.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The most important thing is whether or not there is the anointing within.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you are clear about the Lord's leading within, nothing should shake you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some things require the Lord's guidance only once, and the matter is settled forever.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Other things require His guidance again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For example, the matter of marriage is a once-for-all decision.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But regarding where you should eat, either in a restaurant or at home, there is no one-time rule.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Brother Teng fellowshipped: We have over ten people at the bread-breaking table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There are more at the message meetings, about seventy to eighty people.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even when the attendance is low, we still have fifty to sixty.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Brother Nee's word: Please render the brothers some training right away.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is no need to ask brothers from other localities to come to help you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Moreover, you have to teach the young brothers to submit to the elderly ones.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Brother Ke Lien-min's fellowship: I feel that I am too young and need more training.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I will go to Pu-Tien to join Brother Tsai in his work.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I feel that a young one must follow an elderly one.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Otherwise, he will suffer great loss spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Brother Nee's word: Faith is not making sure that every outward thing is safe and sound before doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Faith is related to one's inward condition.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If one is on the right path inwardly, he should go according to the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>After George M ller started his first orphanage, someone told him not to move too fast.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But God's way is higher than our way.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Later, he quickly started a second and a third orphanage.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>While he was starting the first, he encountered many difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But he did not care for any of them, because he was clear that he was following the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Man's word could not influence him, nor could the environment change him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Acts of the Apostles is a book of "acting," not a book of "sitting."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The workers of the Lord should not remain in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should follow the Lord's leading to work in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>For example, the workers in Shanghai should go to other places and leave the responsibility of the church in Shanghai to the local brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When the workers return, they may find the local condition better than before.</S>
