<h1 class="title">THE LEARNING<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S SERVING ONES&mdash;<br />
TAKING CHRIST AS LIFE AND<br />
SERVING IN THE CHURCH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A FOUNDATION WITH TWO ASPECTS&mdash;<br />
LEARNING THE LESSONS OF LIFE AND<br />
SERVING IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The co-workers need the foundation of learning the lessons of life and of serving in the church. Everyone who serves the Lord needs to learn and know these two items. A serving one who lacks in either item will have problems in the future.</p>
<p>Life and the church are two aspects, two sides, of one foundation; they are not two separate foundations. A person has only one body, but he stands on two legs. The training of the co-workers has one foundation with two aspects&mdash;life and the church. A co-worker who is short in learning either aspect can be compared to a person with only one leg. This shortage will cause problems. A co-worker who is short in learning both aspects can be compared to a person without legs, who is unable to move. It is not a normal situation for a person to have only a torso without two legs to support him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO TAKE CHRIST AS LIFE</h2>
<p>Many co-workers love the Lord but lack the foundation of life. They have been saved for many years and are pursuing the Lord, loving Him, and giving themselves wholeheartedly, but they have never been trained in the matter of life. They love the Lord and are zealous for Him, but they do not know how to take the Lord as life, how to touch the feeling of the Lord, and how to fellowship with the Lord. Without this kind of training, everything we learn after our salvation is outward, and our experience of being a Christian is also outward. This can be compared to learning the actions in Chinese boxing but not having the internal strength. Such serving ones are merely Christians outwardly, not Christians in living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Improving or Adjusting</h2>
<p>Every Christian who is learning to follow the Lord must turn from outward activities in order to touch the way of life. Being a Christian is not a matter of being zealous, improving, adjusting, or changing, nor is it a matter of being right or wrong, good or bad, proud or humble, or gentle or violent. Those who pay attention to these matters are outward Christians. These things are not reliable or stable, nor do they have much value. God in His salvation wants to enter into us to be our life. He desires to enter into our spirit, to be mingled with our spirit, to be one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17) so that we may be joined to Him and take Him as our life. Then outwardly, it is we who live, but within, we live by His life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fellowshipping with the Lord and<br />
Being Dealt With by Him</h2>
<p>A proper Christian, one who is up to the standard, does not adjust his behavior; rather, he turns from outward things to fellowship and contact God, that is, to touch God, His feeling, and His presence and to take Him as life. This is the foundation of the living of a proper Christian. The meekness of a proper Christian must be the issue of this foundation, and his humility must also be the issue of this foundation. Even his zeal and his activities in the church must issue from this foundation.</p>
<p>Every co-worker must learn the lesson of touching the presence of God, that is, of touching God. When we touch God&rsquo;s presence, we have a sense within, our inner being is made alive, and we are enlightened. As a result, we will see that there are many things in us that need to be dealt with, and we will be restricted by the Lord. The Lord wants to be the living law within us in order to lead us in every situation. When we sense that He wants us to discard certain things or to be restricted in certain matters, we should pay the price to follow Him. This kind of learning is the lesson of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Discerning according to<br />
the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil<br />
but Turning to Our Spirit to Contact<br />
the Tree of Life</h2>
<p>Although many saints love the Lord and desire to be pleasing to Him, few have learned the lesson of life; that is, few have learned to turn to their spirit to contact Him. A brother who is not learning this lesson will experience a great lack. It is possible for him to be a Christian for many years and read the Bible regularly but not to have received this basic training. We need to be Christians in life. If we live by outward reforms, outward activities, and considerations of right and wrong, we are in the realm of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>As Christians, we are persons who turn to our spirit to touch the Lord, who is in our spirit as life. He is also the tree of life that has been planted within us and is now growing in us. We do not need to contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil with our mind; rather, we need to turn to our spirit and eat of the tree of life. As soon as we touch the Lord, we are enlivened and enlightened, and He becomes our restriction, our law of life. Moreover, we become clear concerning the items that we should discard and concerning what we should deal with. He becomes the restraining strength within us, and we become clear as to what He allows and what He forbids, and concerning what things we have done in Him and what we have done in ourselves.</p>
<p>Knowing the things that the Lord forbids is a negative experience of life. On the positive side, the Lord desires to be our energizing power in order to motivate us to obey His will, to accomplish His purpose, and to live Him out. He wants to be everything we do; hence, we need to pay the price to follow Him.</p>
<p>Some may say that they cannot be this kind of Christian. However, only those Christians who contact the Lord can be led by His hand. Having spiritual gifts or leaving the sects cannot solve our problems. The only way to solve our problems is to take the way of life. Only when we turn from all the outward bondages to our spirit can we have genuine growth and progress in the divine life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
